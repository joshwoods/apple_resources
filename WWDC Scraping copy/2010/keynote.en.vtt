WEBVTT

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.750
It's great to be here.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.600
Thank you very much for the welcome.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
Thanks, I think.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.530
Okay, well listen,
we have got a great conference

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.640
for you guys this week.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.300
We've really worked super
hard to put this together.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.300
We've got over 5,200 attendees.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.100
We're packed to the gills.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.740
Folks from 57 different
countries are here this week.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.100
And we sold out in eight days.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.180
So it's taken us a little
over a month before,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.780
but this year,
eight days we were completely sold out.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.660
And we apologize to all those
folks who wanted to be here.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.930
We didn't have room.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.740
And this is the biggest place we can get.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.700
So anyway.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.690
Over 120 sessions this week
and over 120 hands-on labs.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.700
And there are over a
thousand Apple engineers

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.500
that will be here this week.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.360
So we're rolling out everything for you,
some great sessions on Mac, iPhone, iPad,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660
and just about everything
you'd want to know.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.250
There's somebody here that
can answer your questions and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.960
sessions on almost everything.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.070
So we're very excited about
this year's conference and we're

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.690
thrilled to have you here for it.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.300
Now, I'd like to give you a
few updates to start with.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.580
And I'd like to start with the iPad.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.290
The iPad's this incredible device.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.710
Really changing the way
we're experiencing the web,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.250
things like email.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.310
photos You know maps video you
name it it is a whole new way to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.870
interact with the internet with apps
with a cup with our content media

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.540
and It's going over really well,
and it is magical.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.000
I know it because I got this email I

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.400
I was sitting in a cafe with my iPad
and it got a girl interested in me.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.900
There's proof.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.910
We have sold over 2 million iPads.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.990
We sold 2 million in the first 59 days.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.320
That's one every three seconds.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.320
So we are in...

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.850
iPads now in 10 countries.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.680
We just started shipping in 9 of those
10 countries in the last 2 weeks and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.440
I put together a little video reel
with some of the press coverage we got.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.450
So could we run that now?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.600
Today the Apple iPad is
on sale here in Britain.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.040
The German iPad is on sale.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.000
It's on sale since
this morning in France.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.300
The iPad is this tactile
tablet signed Apple.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.640
It's the iPad of the
American Apple company.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.240
Oh, this man.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.760
People queuing indeed last night
to get their hands on one of these.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300
"Hundreds of fans met early this
morning in Paris" "Like here in Munich,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.890
hundreds of iPad fans were thinking
about..." This is how Apple employees

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.300
welcome their customers.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.360
from Apple virus infizier.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
Moi si j'avais ça à la maison,
je ne ferais pas souvent mon ménage.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.360
C'est fantastique.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.360
Beau jugement,
j'ai l'impression d'être en bas du sapin.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.360
Uns gats tip top.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.360
Wir sind sehr glücklich,
dass wir jetzt endlich das iPad haben.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.790
today.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.980
We're gonna be in 19 by the
end of July and we thank

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.800
everybody for their patience.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.100
We're making iPads as
fast as we possibly can.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.020
So, there are now 8,500 native
iPad apps in the app store,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.930
which is really great and of course
the iPad can run over 200,000 of the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.850
iPhone apps that are there as well.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.490
And these 8,500 native apps have been
downloaded over 35 million times.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.060
And so if you divide that by
those 2 million iPads out there,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.220
that's about 17 apps per iPad
that have already been downloaded.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.020
That's a great number.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.520
That's a great number.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.260
So we're really thrilled with that.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.870
And again,
let me just show you some of the,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.720
you know,
the latest apps that have been out.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.560
Pulse, which is a wonderful RSS reader
if you haven't seen it.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.560
Guala.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.200
WebMD for finding out all sorts of
things about procedures in your local

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.490
pharmacy Ebay's got a great application
out on the iPad some wonderful

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.980
education applications anatomy here,
isn't this cool?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.040
There's some wonderful
stuff that's coming out.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.730
A lot of great games, Iron Man, Avatar,
Field Runners, Golf,

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.270
A really cool DJ app, flight tracker,
a lot of newspapers and magazines.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.750
This is the Financial Times.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.060
We've seen tremendous interest
from publishers of all kinds.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.840
A lot of great stuff that's out.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.860
And this is an app that's really cool.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.340
It's called Elements and the Elements.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.710
And you can just peruse the
periodic table and learn about

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.840
the things that we're all made of.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.160
It's from Wolfram.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.880
And a friend of mine named
Tao Gray wrote this and he sent me an

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.680
email and said that I could use it.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.990
I earn more on the sales of the
Elements for iPad in the first day

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.780
than from the past five years of
Google ads on PeriodicTable.com.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.080
This is what we love
to hear from you guys.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.850
So we're doing our best to get iPads
out there like crazy and I know a

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.220
lot of you are doing your best to get
your apps out on the iPad and I think

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.160
it's a really fantastic combination.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.220
I'd like to tell you about one
of our apps that we're updating

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.100
today which is iBooks on the iPad.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.700
You all know iBooks.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.120
Many people think it's the
best eBook reader in the world.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.440
It's got this great bookshelf for
keeping your books and of course the

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.890
iBook store for buying books online.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.240
I've got a few stats today for you.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.920
In the first 65 days users have
downloaded over 5 million books

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.620
and that is about 2.5 books
per iPad which is terrific.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.380
The other interesting thing
is the five of the six biggest

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.090
publishers in the US who have
their books on the iBook store.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.900
The iBook store tells us that the
share of eBooks now that are going

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:21.240
through the iBook store is about 22%.
So iBooks market share now of eBooks from

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.800
these five of these six major publishers
is up to 22% in just about eight weeks.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.350
And as we ship more iPads that number is
just going to keep going up and up and

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.750
up and we're really thrilled with it.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.090
So, we've got some enhancements
to iBooks today.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.340
The first is, as you know,
you can create highlights and

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.140
highlight the things you want.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.230
You can also now make notes.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.920
So you can make notes right
there and you can post them.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.780
You can see them posted right
on the right over there.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.070
In addition to that,
we've added a control in

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.530
the upper right-hand corner.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.940
You can just tap and bookmark the page
and you can see that bookmark whether

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.570
or not the controls are up there.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.330
And when you go to the table of
contents and look under bookmarks,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.720
you'll see all the pages that are
bookmarked and all the notes that you've

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.480
created as well as the highlights.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.990
So that's pretty nice.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.780
It's an oft-requested
feature now in iBooks.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.340
We've added another big enhancement too.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.890
One of the biggest requests
we've gotten for the iPad is the

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.520
ability to view and read PDFs.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.130
So we've built that now.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.700
In addition to books,
you can now view PDFs.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.480
And what we've done is we've put a
little selector right up on the top,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.310
and so you can select
between books and PDFs.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.120
When you select PDFs, you get a whole new
bookshelf just for PDFs.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.280
And when you select one,
they just look gorgeous.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.580
And you can navigate through them,
you can flick through them,

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.010
and they're just gorgeous on the iPad.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:06.630
So PDF viewing built right into iBooks
and that's what we've done to enhance

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:11.720
it today and that enhancement will be
out just a little bit later this month.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.170
So that is my update for the iPad.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.160
Next,
I'd like to talk about the App Store,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.540
something near and dear to all of us.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.260
Now, before I get into the App Store,
I want to make something really clear.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.750
We support two platforms at Apple.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.110
Two.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.260
The first one is HTML5.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:48.700
HTML5 is a fully open,
uncontrolled platform that is

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:54.650
forged and defined by widely
respected standards bodies.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.080
Apple is a member of some of these
standards bodies along with lots of other

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.970
companies and we fully support HTML5.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.480
A lot of the technology in it
has come from Apple and Apple's

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:11.000
browsers are in the lead in terms of
supporting the full HTML5 standard.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:16.100
So we are behind this
100% and it's fully open.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.960
Anyone can write HTML5 apps
and have them on the iPad,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.610
the the iPhone, the iPod Touch,
and of course the Mac.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.400
The second platform we
support is the App Store.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:37.170
The App Store is a curated platform with
over now 225,000 apps and it is the most

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.550
vibrant app community on the planet.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.170
There's nowhere else you can
go and find 225,000 apps.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.480
And some of them are just terrific apps.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.480
So we have these two
platforms that we support.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.400
And what I'd like to do now
is talk about the App Store.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.420
Now, you've read a lot about our
process of approving apps.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.760
Let me give you some of
the facts behind this.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.340
Might be interesting to you.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.350
We get about 15,000 apps
submitted every week.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.460
That's new apps.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.170
That's updates to apps.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.060
Everything.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.140
About 15,000 a week.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.340
And they come in in up to 30
different languages that we support.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.240
15,000 apps a week up to 30 languages.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.940
Guess what?

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:31.580
95% of all the apps we get submitted
are approved within seven days.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.040
95% of them approve within seven days.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.020
Well, what about the 5% that aren't?

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.860
Why don't we approve these apps?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.540
Well,
let me give you the three top reasons.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.390
There's more,
but these are the three top ones.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.840
The number one reason:
The app doesn't function as advertised.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.380
It doesn't do what the
developer says it does.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.380
So we reject it.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.680
We say, "You said it did this,
it does this.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.940
Change your description
or change your app,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.120
but it doesn't do what you
told us it did." The second

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.560
reason is use of private APIs.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.900
We're very clear on this.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.680
Developers can't use private APIs.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.810
Why not?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.540
Because when we change the OS,
those private APIs are not

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.420
guaranteed not to change,
and if they change, the app will break.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.880
And we'll have a very unhappy customer.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.450
Right?

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.590
If they upgrade their OS and
half their apps break,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.120
they're not going to be happy campers.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.560
So you can't use private APIs.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.820
And developers that use private APIs,
of course,

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.460
know exactly what they're doing.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.830
So...

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.180
And the third reason we reject apps,
the third most frequent reason,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.550
they crash.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.700
So I think if you were in our shoes,
you would be rejecting these

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.040
apps for the same three reasons.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.360
Even with all of this,
95% of these apps are

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.820
approved within seven days.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.960
So I just wanted to give you those facts.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.680
Sometimes when you read
some of these articles,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.090
you think something
different was going on.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.060
But 95% of these apps get
approved within seven days.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.110
Now, I'd like to highlight
one of them for a moment,

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.840
eBay.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.440
eBay came out with a great
app on the iPhone last year.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.750
And eBay's CEO, John Donahoe,
made this statement last

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.040
week at the D conference.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.740
We launched the eBay application
on the iPhone last year,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.040
10 million downloads.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.760
It did $600 million of
volume its first year.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.060
It's going to do 1.5 billion
to 2 billion this year.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.500
year.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.570
Wow.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.700
Would we all be this successful?

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.690
This is fantastic.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.690
Well, it's my pleasure now

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:43.300
to show you three new apps that are
going to be on the App Store soon.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.160
They're all in the
entertainment category,

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.740
and I'm sure they're all aspiring
to this kind of success as well.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.520
The first one is Netflix.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.290
Netflix on the iPhone,
and it's my pleasure to

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.550
introduce Netflix CEO,
Reed Hastings.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:17:39.900
[Transcript missing]

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.420
That's great.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.220
Next up, Zinnia.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.860
Zinnia is a remarkable phenomenon.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.370
And, well,
let me have them explain it to you.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.320
It's amazing.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:06.290
Mark Pincus, CEO of Zinnia.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.570
Thank you Steve and Apple for
having us here today.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.520
We're really honored and excited.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.890
Today we'll be introducing
farming for the iPhone.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:32.040
FarmVille is our most popular game
and we're excited to be finally

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.310
bringing it to the most popular
mobile gaming platform in the world.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.640
Every day,
35 million people play Zynga's games.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:49.080
That's more than the combined audiences
for the season finales of Lost and 24.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.680
And my wife and I were
two of those people.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.160
And she's here today,
but I won't embarrass

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.490
her any more than I have.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.610
In the year since we launched FarmVille,
it's grown to over 70

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:06.440
million monthly active users,
and they're very active users.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:12.700
We're proud that they've raised
over $2 million to help Haiti.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.540
But anyway, I'll turn it over to my
colleague Jen Herman,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.980
who's going to show
you farming on the fly.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.520
Thanks, Mark.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.360
This is the same farm
that I've spent many,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.730
many hours creating and
perfecting on Facebook,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.490
except now it's in the palm of my hand.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.370
I've got the same decorations,
same friends, and more.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.450
Let's zoom in and have a look.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.160
I'm going to go over and
check out my pasture.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.620
I've got my San Francisco style
groovy barn.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.960
And now, let's go into the marketplace.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.070
I can use in-app purchases
to add cash and coins,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.600
which I can then use to go into the
market and buy things like animals.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.250
Is that a snow leopard?

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.240
It sure is, and it's only on the iPhone.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:05.100
Let's jump in and do some farming.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.180
I can plow.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.500
Say goodbye to harvests and
say goodbye to withering crops.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.400
We now have push notifications.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:25.400
And I want to mention for those of you
who don't regularly farm that you should.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.460
Plug.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.870
Millions of our Farmville
players set their alarm

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.400
clocks for 2am in the morning.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.710
They bring their laptops to bars
and other strange places just so

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.400
that they won't miss a key harvest.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.400
With Farmville on the iPhone
they're going to be able to

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.400
farm anytime and anywhere.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:53.180
But what I'm most excited about is
how much cooler Tractorink just got.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.680
With a simple tap and hold,
I can fire up my harvester,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:05.010
quickly select multiple plots
for fast and efficient farming.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.550
With another tap and hold,
it will automatically

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.550
select my hot rod tractor.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:13.550
Here we go.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.430
about being social.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.300
These are my same friends from Facebook.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.320
I can visit their farms,
fertilize their crops,

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.000
and send them gifts.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:35.280
And also you may not know or many of you
do know that Farming Farmville is all

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.130
about gifting and our players send each
other over 200 million gifts every day.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.920
It's a lot more than Hallmark sends out.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.920
Oh, looks like Jen has a new gift now.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.690
Let's chat.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.280
I do.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.080
I've got a few of my gift box.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.920
Looks like one of my iPhone friends
just sent me a white apple tree.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:54.780
Thanks.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.350
And that's our game.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:15.300
[Transcript missing]

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.380
All right.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.080
Number three, Activision.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.980
Really happy to welcome
the Senior Vice President,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.100
Karthik Bala,
to tell us about Guitar Hero.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.210
With over 40 million
units sold worldwide,

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.020
Guitar Hero is a pop culture phenomenon.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.210
So our team at Vicarious Visions
have spent significant effort

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.870
and time to develop a brand new
Guitar Hero experience exclusively

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.930
for the iPhone and iPod touch
that lives up to its name.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.140
Guitar Hero is about being connected.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.380
Connected to your rock star persona,
to your friends,

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.500
and of course to the music.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.180
Going backstage,
you can customize the look of

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.160
your rock star any way you want.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.570
you can hop into the photo booth to
share that look with your friends.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.700
At its core,
Guitar Hero is about connecting

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.100
with your favorite rock music.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.880
The game comes with classic rock
from Queen and the Rolling Stones,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.780
as well as new favorites from
Vampire Weekend and Rise Against.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.420
We've gotten great feedback and support
from our music industry partners,

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.810
allowing us to deliver rich downloadable
content with new music to discover,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:43.860
like this one from the Band of Skulls,
one of Jason's favorite new bands.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.730
The gameplay riffs off
classic Guitar Hero,

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.560
perfectly tuned for your iPhone.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.930
Our team of musicians have handcrafted
note tracks to deliver an authentic,

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.200
deeper connection with
your music experience.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.880
As you can see,
we have the obvious tapping mechanics

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.380
that get you into the rhythm,
but we wanted to deliver a

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.930
richer guitar experience.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.340
With the introduction of a
new strumming mechanic and use

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.700
of the multi-touch display,
our team has tweaked and polished

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.790
Guitar Hero to make the gameplay perfect.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.140
We have sustain notes that can be
whammy to juice up for star power and

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.920
slide gems that let you master these
tricky hammer on and pull off combos.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.380
Of course, if you really want to
score big and show off,

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.920
be sure to activate star power.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.840
on leaderboards over to Facebook.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.500
And he scored enough skill
points to level up his rock rank.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.980
This is just the beginning.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.580
I'm proud to say you guys can
all start rocking out today.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.040
Guitar Hero is available
in the App Store for $2.99.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.940
Go download it.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.200
You know, he was playing that guitar
lead real time right there.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.660
It's very cool.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:49.520
So, three great entertainment apps
and they're going to join the over

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.660
225,000 apps on the App Store.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.420
And I've got a few great
pieces of information to

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.660
share with you this morning.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:06.890
The first is just last week we crossed
5 billion downloads on the App Store.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.660
Isn't that incredible?

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.830
5 billion!

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:18.800
This next thing is my favorite
stat of the whole show today.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.100
So as you know,

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:26.980
When we get revenue from the app store,
70% of it goes to the developer, right?

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:32.440
70%. So how much have we paid developers?

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.470
Our 70% that we've paid you.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.800
How much have we paid you to date?

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.800
Just a few days ago,
we crossed a billion dollars.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.750
A billion dollars.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.800
And it is one of the
greatest things we get to do.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.830
So let's go do it again.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.900
All right.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:08.980
And that's what makes the App Store the
most vibrant app community on the planet.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.250
Over 5 billion downloads and
a really healthy ecosystem,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.040
not only for users but
for developers as well.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.660
And we're thrilled with it.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.500
So that's the App Store.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:29.670
Now I'd like to talk about the iPhone.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.280
There have been a lot of
statistics floating around,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.700
market research, market share studies,
and some of them are okay and

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.800
some of them are questionable.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.000
And I'd like to just give you two
pieces of data that can help you make

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.790
your own judgments about market share.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.660
The first one is a report
that just came out by Nielsen,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.800
highly respected firm.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.800
And this is for Q1 of 2010,
this just came out.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.220
And they said,
"What is the smartphone market share in

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.800
the US?" And here's what they reported.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.260
RIM number one with 35%.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:20.290
iPhone number 2 with 28% Windows mobile
number 3 with 19% Android number

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:27.750
4 with 9% and other tied at 9%
And so what Nielsen said was in

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:34.930
Q1 of 2010 The iPhone's market
share was over 3 times that of Android

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.850
Let me give you another study.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.620
This is US mobile browser usage,
net applications.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.390
Comes out with this.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.160
And this is for May.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.350
It's the most recent data
that they've published.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.480
This is mobile browser usage in
the US and you can see iPhone

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:59.210
has 58.2% of the entire mobile
browser usage in the country.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.550
That's over two and a half times as
much as number two which is Android at

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:10.460
just 22.7%. So very recent data,
this may help you put

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.520
things in perspective.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.190
So let's get back to iPhone.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:25.740
In 2007, iPhone reinvented what
we think of as a phone.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.500
It's hard to remember what
it was like before iPhone.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.340
Carriers controlled
what was on the phone.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.880
There were a few apps,
but nothing like we

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.310
think about apps today.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.140
There was no free market for apps.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.140
There was no app store.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.390
It was really different
before the iPhone.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.680
And the iPhone started to
change all of that in 2007.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.250
It was a revolution.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:57.770
In 2008,
we added 3G networking and the App Store.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.780
In 2009,
the iPhone 3GS was twice as fast,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.070
and we added some other cool features,
like video recording.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:14.180
For 2010, we're going to take the biggest
leap since the original iPhone.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.210
And so today,

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.890
Introducing iPhone 4,
the fourth generation iPhone.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.390
This is really hot.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:40.360
And there are well over 100 new
features and we don't have time

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.740
to cover all of them today,
so I get to cover eight of them with you.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.160
Eight new features of the iPhone 4.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.840
The first one, an all new design.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:59.280
Now, stop me if you've already seen this.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.880
I ain't seen it.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.900
You've got to see this thing in person.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.790
It is one of the most beautiful
designs you've ever seen.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.960
This is beyond a doubt
the most precise thing,

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.800
one of the most beautiful
things we've ever made.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:33.600
Glass on the front and the rear and
stainless steel running around and the

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:40.070
precision of which this is made is beyond
any consumer product we've ever seen.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.590
Its closest kin is like a
beautiful old Leica camera.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:48.320
It's unheard of in
consumer products today.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.470
Just gorgeous.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:32:00.110
and it's really thin
this is the new iPhone 4

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:17.900
It is just 9.3 millimeters thick,
that is 24% thinner than the iPhone GS.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.900
Again, a quarter thinner in something you
didn't think could get any thinner.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.090
As a matter of fact, it is the thinnest
smartphone on the planet.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.480
I'm going to point out a few
of the external things on it.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.930
Here are the volume controls, volume up,
volume down, and mute.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.040
On the front,
we have a front-facing camera.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.580
We have the receiver.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.430
We have the home button.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:52.330
We have the micro SIM tray.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.240
We have a camera and an
LED flash on the back.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.330
If we look at the bottom,
we've got the microphone,

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.300
the 30 pin connector in the speaker.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.660
And if we look on the top,
we've got the headset jack,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.260
we've got a second mic
for noise cancellation,

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.090
and the sweet sleep/wake button.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.040
Because there have been a
few photos of this around,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:25.060
people have asked,
"What's this?" Some have even said,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.680
"This doesn't seem like Apple."

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.400
What are these lines in this
beautiful stainless steel band?

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:41.630
Well, it turns out there's
not just one of them,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.870
there's three of them.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.240
And they are part of the
entire structure of this phone.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.500
That stainless steel band that
runs around is the primary

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.420
structural element of the phone.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.510
And there are these three slits in it.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:03.180
It turns out this is part of
some brilliant engineering,

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:08.240
which actually uses the stainless steel
band as part of the antenna system.

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:16.230
And so one piece is Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
and GPS.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.690
and the other is UMTS and GSM.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:24.220
So it's got these integrated antennas
right in the structure of the phone.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.080
It's never been done before.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.530
And it's really cool engineering.

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:39.680
It's the thinnest smartphone ever.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.130
It uses stainless steel for strength.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.280
It uses glass on the front
and the back for optical

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.790
quality and scratch resistance.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.700
It's got integrated antennas
and extraordinary build quality.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.740
Again, I don't think there's another
consumer product like this.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.190
When you hold this in your hands,
it's unbelievable.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:10.300
So this is our all new
design for the iPhone 4.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.000
That's the first one.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.880
Second one, this is a biggie.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.590
Something we call the retina display.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.490
What's that?

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.040
Well, in any display there are pixels.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.170
Here's four of them.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.800
We start off with the retina
display by dramatically

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.280
increasing the pixel density.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:48.680
Four times as many pixels
in the same amount of space.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.820
Now why is that important?

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.600
Well let's make more pixels and let's
say we want to draw the letter A.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.050
And this is the outside boundary
of one of the strokes of a letter,

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.040
the letter A.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.780
Well as you can see,
we turn on pixels inside that stroke,

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.950
we can get far more precision
the more pixels we have.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.100
and we play all sorts of tricks
by putting different levels of

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.230
gray pixels on that line as well
to try to fuzz it for our eye.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.350
But when we zoom out of this,
what you can see is that because

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:29.800
we have four times as many pixels,
we get really, really sharp text compared

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.300
to what we normally get on
displays of lesser resolution.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:41.110
Now the retina display has 326 per inch.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.360
There's never been a display
like this on a phone.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.200
People haven't even dreamed about
a display like this on a phone.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.980
But it's more than that.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:37:00.490
It turns out that there's a magic
number right around 300 pixels per

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:05.700
inch that when you hold something
around 10 or 12 inches away from

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:12.000
your eyes is the limit of the human
retina to differentiate the pixels.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.410
And so they're so close together when
you get at this 300 pixels per inch

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:23.730
threshold that all of a sudden things
start to look like continuous curves.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.800
Like text looks like you've
seen it in a fine printed book.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.140
Unlike you've ever seen on
an electronic display before.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.700
And at 326 pixels per inch,
we are comfortably over that limit.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.120
And it's extraordinary.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.030
So let me give you an example of
a normal display on the left and

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.580
the retina display on the right.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.830
Look at the difference.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.690
Can you see it?

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:57.060
Here's some more text of different
sizes and different weights.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.790
You can really, really see this stuff.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.060
Once you use a retina display,
you can't go back.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.960
When you get to
character-based languages,

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.310
kanji in this case, it's also striking.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:22.400
And it's not just text,
it's images and video as well.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.620
Look at the difference.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.140
This is the same image on a normal
display and a retina display.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.400
Here's another one.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.860
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.750
So what I'd like to do now
is show this to you live.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:45.530
I've got an iPhone 3GS,
which has got a widely

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:50.600
praised display on it,
and I've got a new iPhone 4.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.800
Let me get them both fired up here.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.500
There we go.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.100
And I can ask them to blow these up.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.200
What's that difference now?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.200
This is pixel.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.670
We had to get special projectors for this
because most projectors can't display

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:24.130
as many dots as are on a retina display.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.200
This is pixel for pixel accurate
right off these two displays.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.140
And you can really see it.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.820
Look at that folder there.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.260
And let me go inside.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.240
Look at the icon of the folder.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.180
Compare them.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.670
Look at the text.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:38.540
Look at the linen.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.420
Look at the icon of the compass.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.240
The icon of the clock.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.180
Isn't that amazing?

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.280
So now, let me go ahead.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.870
I'm going to go to some websites.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.180
I'm going to go to the
New York Times today.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.040
And let's just compare these websites.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.910
Our networks in here are
always unpredictable,

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:13.860
so I have no idea what
we're going to find.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.210
They are slow today.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.810
You know,
you could help me out if you're on Wi-Fi,

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.900
if you could just get off.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:26.740
I'd appreciate it.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.340
We're having a little problem here.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.380
I don't know what's
wrong with our networks.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.800
I'm afraid I have a problem
and I'm not going to be able

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.180
to show you much here today.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.570
I can show you some
pictures in the camera roll.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.810
Let's just go take a
look at some photos here.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.110
Take a look at that.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.160
Same photos.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.950
Pretty different.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.840
Again, same photo.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.040
See the difference?

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.800
You can really see it around the eyes,
the teeth.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.500
It kind of just comes down to what do
you want to be looking at all day long?

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:33.280
So, the retina display.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:39.610
3.5 inches,
the same size as the iPhone 3GS,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:43.140
yet with 960 by 640 pixels.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:48.780
That's four times more
pixels than the iPhone 3GS.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.210
326 pixels per inch.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.970
800:1 contrast ratio,
which is again four times

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.490
better than the 3GS.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.750
We're using IPS technology.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:07.330
This is a very advanced LCD technology,
which is quite a bit, in our opinion,

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.260
quite a bit better than
the OLED technology for

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.060
these types of products.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:17.070
And provides much more accurate
color and much higher resolution.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:21.380
You can't make an OLED display with
this type of resolution right now.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.650
And so we think the IPS technology
is really quite superior.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:31.380
And it results in incredibly sharp text,
images and video.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:38.730
Now, again, the retina display has got
78% of the pixels on an iPad

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.590
right in the palm of your hand.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:54.030
iPhone OS 4 makes it so your apps
automatically run on the retina display,

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.400
full size.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.700
but they look even better
because what we do is iPhone

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.700
OS automatically renders your text
in the higher resolution and all your

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.680
controls in the higher resolution.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.240
So you get that automatically
and your apps look even better

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.380
without you doing any work.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:18.380
But if you do a little bit of work
and open up the hood of your app and

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:24.380
put in higher resolution artwork,
then they will look stunning.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.720
So we'd suggest that you do that.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.200
So that is the retina display.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.630
Awesome text.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.100
[Transcript missing]

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.730
We think this is going to
set the standard for displays

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.560
for the next several years.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.120
We don't think anybody's
going to come close.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:52.900
And you know, the display is your
window into the internet,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:58.670
into your apps, into your media,
into your software.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:04.480
We think it's maybe the most important
single component of the hardware.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.940
And we've got something here now that's
like the best window on the planet.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.580
So that's the retina display.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.260
The iPhone 4 is powered by the A4 chip.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.590
Apple's A4 chip.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.660
This is a chip designed by our own team.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.500
They are really good and this is
wonderful to have in an iPhone.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.180
Now let me show it to you.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:43.300
This is the back of the iPhone.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.660
You take the back off.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.200
First thing you notice is the
iPhone 4 is packed to the gills.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.100
There's a tremendous amount of
functionality in not such a big space.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.240
And so you have to kind of hunt to
find the A4 chip but it's right there.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.540
and let me just point out
some of the other things.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.500
There's the micro SIM.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.500
We went to the micro
SIM because it's smaller.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.390
We need the space.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.780
The radios, the connectors.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:14.910
You can see that the biggest single
component in the phone is the battery.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.840
We've been able to make the
battery a little bit bigger.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.150
And so that's where everything is,
inside the phone.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.940
Now, because we've been able to make the
battery a little bit bigger and because

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.790
the A4 is so good with power management,
we've been able to improve

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.200
the battery life as well.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:41.270
So we have up to 40% more talk time
on 3G from 5 hours to 7 hours now.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:46.710
Six hours of 3G browsing,
10 hours of Wi-Fi browsing.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:54.200
10 hours of video, 40 hours of music,
and 300 hours of standby.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.310
So we're very pleased with this.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.640
Our environmental report card is strong.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:13.690
Arsenic free, BFR free, mercury free,
PVC free, and stainless steel and glass

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.180
are highly recyclable materials.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:17.840
So we're doing great there.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.150
So the A4 chip.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:29.940
A4 chip up to 32 gigabytes of storage
Quad-band HSDPA and HSUPA for 7.2

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.710
megabits per second down 5.8 megabits
per second up that's theoretical because

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:40.340
the carriers don't support that yet,
but as they do will welcome it and

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:47.740
dual mics for noise cancellation
802.11n Wi-Fi And of course

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:52.160
GPS plus accelerometer plus
compass so we've got some great

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.690
hardware in the iPhone 4 the A4 chip

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:03.860
Number four, we've got another really
cool piece of hardware.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.310
Remember when we added the
accelerometer and how that opened

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.520
up a whole new vista of gaming?

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.350
Well, we're taking it even further
with the iPhone 4 because

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.710
we're adding a gyroscope.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.940
A three axis gyro, which is fantastic.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.100
Pitch rolling yaw,
also rotation around gravity.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.260
And we've tied the gyro and
the accelerometer and even the

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:43.170
compass together to provide
six axis motion sensing.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:49.460
We've got some new core motion
APIs that you can call that give you

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.710
extremely precise position information.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.680
And it's perfect for gaming.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:02.950
And one of the reasons it's perfect is
because it's built into every iPhone 4,

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.940
so you know it's there.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.980
So what I'd love to do now
is give you a demo of this.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:16.470
And since this demo does
not require the network,

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.240
I should be okay.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.850
This is the little app that we
wrote and this is being run with the

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.660
accelerometer now and as you see with
the accelerometer I can tilt it from

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.740
side to side or backwards and forwards.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.120
But I can't,
it doesn't move when I rotate

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:43.840
around gravity and the positioning
is good but not super precise.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.840
So now by tapping the word accelerometer
it's going to change to the gyro and now

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.460
I get much more precise movement here
and as you see it rotates around gravity.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.790
I'll play this game here.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.600
And I think I'll take this one off.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.600
Alright.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.110
And... maybe I'll take this one out.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:57.100
[Transcript missing]

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:21.360
Some of our amazing engineers
cobbled that together for

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.820
me to show you the gyro,
but I can't wait to see what

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.230
you guys are going to do.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:27.260
I think it's going to be pretty amazing.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:33.880
So the gyro joins our four
other sensors in every phone.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.970
We now have the gyro, the accelerometer,
the compass, proximity sensor,

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.540
and the ambient light sensor.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:44.620
These phones are getting more and more
intelligent about the world around them.

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:48.420
It's very exciting,
and I can't wait to see what you guys do

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:51.580
with the gyro built into every iPhone 4.

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.940
So that's number four.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.580
Number five.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.940
This is a great one.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:09.430
A whole new camera system
built into iPhone 4.

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:13.700
Everybody loves to talk about
things that are very tangible

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.510
when it comes to photography,
like megapixels.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:23.200
But we tend to ask the question,
how do we make better pictures?

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:25.100
And they're different things.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.180
Megapixels are nice,
but what cell phone cameras are

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:33.330
really about is capturing photons.

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:37.210
Because the cameras are so small,
the sensors are so small,

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:40.470
the lenses are so small,
that it's all about capturing

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.300
photons and low light photography.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:50.150
So what we've done is we've gone from
a 3 megapixel to a 5 megapixel sensor.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:55.130
But we're using something that has been
shipping for a while in larger cameras,

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.310
but is fairly new to smartphones,
and that is what's called a

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.100
backside illuminated sensor.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:04.410
It's a way of getting a lot more
photons to the sensor by getting some

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.110
of the wiring and stuff out of the way.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.030
In addition to that,
when most people increase

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.660
their megapixels,
they make those pixels smaller.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.960
When you make pixels smaller,
they capture less photons.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.300
What we've done is as we've
gone from 3 to 5 megapixels,

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.940
we've kept the pixels the same size,
1.75 microns.

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:28.460
And so they don't capture
less photons per pixel,

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.360
and we have more pixels.

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:36.700
We've got a 5X digital zoom
built into the camera app.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:40.240
Of course, what we pioneered,
tap to focus.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.190
And we've got an LED flash built in.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.930
And the pictures that we're taking
off this are pretty remarkable.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.140
Of course,
you can do portrait and landscape.

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.920
You can see the digital zoom right there.

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.760
And these are pictures that are
taken right off the iPhone 4.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.700
They haven't been touched in any way.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.000
It shows you what kind of
quality we're able to get.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.810
Again, these are completely unretouched.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.620
These were all taken by our employees,
just called some of the

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.820
better ones that I saw.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.060
So this gives you an example.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.660
That low light photograph is
hard to take with any camera,

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:33.620
much less a phone.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.660
So we're really happy with the photos
we're taking with the iPhone 4.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:41.860
We think we've got a
great camera built in.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.200
But that's not all.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:49.450
because the camera also records HD video.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.240
HD video at full 720p
at 30 frames per second.

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.600
So it's real HD video.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:06.030
Now, we pioneered tap to
focus for still photos.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:09.380
We now have tap to focus video.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:15.300
And we have built in video editing for
trimming your clips right on the phone.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:18.230
And one click sharing
to share your photos.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:25.700
and the LED flash also will stay on to
illuminate scenes for video recording.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.340
And so you can actually record
HD video right on your phone,

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.900
edit it right on your phone,

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.490
and then with a few taps email it,
send it in an MMS, send it to MobileMe,

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.640
send it to YouTube.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.960
It's pretty remarkable.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.760
But we're going even further than that.

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:52.190
Because what we've done is we've
written an application ourselves.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.540
I want to tell you about this.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.080
I want to show it to you and
to show it to you it's my great

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.520
pleasure to invite Randy Ubelos.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.500
He's one of our incredible engineers.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.520
He's the chief architect
for all our video apps.

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:19.780
I'd like Randy to come up
and show this to you himself.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:19.780
Randy.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.400
Thanks very much.

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.890
I've been working on video editing
software for a long time on some

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.400
pretty groundbreaking products.

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:34.830
15 years ago it was Final Cut Pro.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:36.530
Three years ago it was the new iMovie.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.640
This year I had the opportunity
to work on another one,

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.130
iMovie for iPhone,
and it's one of the most exciting

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:43.400
things I've ever worked on.

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:47.430
You can now record HD video,
edit with beautiful theme

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:50.840
transitions and titles,
and share your finished movies

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.060
all on the device that you
carry in your pocket every day.

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.120
It's really amazing.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.110
Let me show it to you.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.720
Go ahead and bring this up.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.000
And you can see the icon there.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.020
I'll go ahead and tap on that.

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:07.620
So once we bring up the application,
you get a list of all the

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:08.970
projects that you have.

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.560
And I'm going to go ahead
and just tap on this project.

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:14.750
And now I get my editing environment.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.570
I can see the clips that
I have edited into this project

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:18.760
down here along the bottom.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.010
I'm going to go ahead and rotate the
phone over so we can go to landscape.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.680
You see I got the same view here.

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.040
And let's go ahead and do a
little bit of editing on this.

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.510
I can record directly into
the timeline if I want.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:34.260
Or I can choose from existing clips
and photos that are on the device.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.960
I'm going to go to my video bin here.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.600
And I'll just scroll down.

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.240
Let's pick this clip.

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:40.240
And

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:45.820
Put this in and I can pinch and change
the scale of the timeline down here.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:49.640
And we'll go ahead and select this
clip and now I can just grab the pin

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.330
and drag this to trim the beginning
portion of the clip to set the

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.930
length to be whatever I'd like.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.310
I can zoom that in a
little bit if I like.

00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.980
Now let's go ahead and add a photo.

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:02.150
So what I'm going to do
is go back to my bin,

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:04.930
go to my photos,
then I'll scroll down here a little bit

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:07.420
and we've got this weekend and SF event.

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:10.350
Got a nice picture here
that's got the whole group.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.330
So I'll go ahead and choose that.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:16.880
Now once I've got that in there I can
tap on it and photos automatically

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.110
get a Ken Burns effect on them.

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:20.540
So I can go ahead and adjust that.

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:23.000
I'll go back to the beginning
and I can pan around,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.450
I can zoom in and you'll see that as we
go from the beginning to the end I'll

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.120
get a nice Ken Burns effect on them.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.050
I can also use theme transitions.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:33.680
So I'm going to go ahead to this
title and I'm going to switch it from

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.010
across dissolve to a theme transition.

00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:40.640
And when I do that I get this nice theme
transition that'll come across on here.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.290
We can go ahead and put a
title on the first clip.

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:44.700
I'll just double tap on it.

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.920
I'll select title and I'll
choose an opening title.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:53.010
I'll just go ahead and tap and
I'll give it a nice title here.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:58.060
So I'll go ahead and just type
in our California vacation.

00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:59.750
application.

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.730
And once I put that in there,
one of the things you'll notice is

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.840
that it's put San Francisco on there.

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:10.940
The camera records geolocation
information into the video

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.390
that's been recorded,
and we pick that up automatically,

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:16.740
and it gets put into the theme
as you see there on the screen.

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.730
Now I'm going to go
ahead and add some music.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.120
So I'll go ahead and I'll
bring up the audio bin.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.850
I could bring in music
from my iTunes library,

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:27.550
or we also have some theme music
that comes with the product.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.420
So I'll go ahead and
choose this playful track.

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:33.670
Let's go ahead and just play this back.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.560
Now we have five different
themes with iMovie.

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.820
So I'll go ahead and tap the gear here
and I can switch to a different theme.

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.330
So I'll switch to the travel
theme and select that I'd

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:57.200
like to use the theme music.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.290
And what you can see here is that
for this theme the geolocation data

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:05.010
has actually been put on a pin on a
map and that map slides around and

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:08.590
the pin moves around based on the
location that you have on the map.

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:11.520
And if I scroll over here a little
bit you'll see the transition has

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.720
been replaced with this nice theme
transition with some stamps and things.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.080
So that happens automatically when
you switch from one theme to another.

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.920
So I can come back to the project
list and I can tap the export

00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:26.680
button and I have three different
sizes that I can choose to

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.520
export all the way up to HD 720p.

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.480
And what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to show you a version of this

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:36.720
project that was exported out at
720p HD and what you're going to see

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.030
was produced entirely on the phone.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:42.590
Recorded, edited,
rendered all completely on the phone.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:42.600
00:05:00:00 - 00:05:18:00
Speaker 1 So I'm going to go

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:42.600
ahead and click on export.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:42.600
And I'm going to go
ahead and click export.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:42.600
And I'm going to go
ahead and click export.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:42.600
And I'm going to go
ahead and click export.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.130
And I'll go ahead and show you that.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.040
iMovie for iPhone 4.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:41.900
Thanks very much.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.900
Thanks.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.900
Isn't that awesome?

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.900
So iMovie for iPhone.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:59.900
And you'll be able to buy this
right on your phone for $4.99,

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.600
if we approve it.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:13.120
And so this is, again,
part of this amazing new

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.720
camera system on the iPhone 4.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.770
And we're really proud of it,
and I think you're

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:18.830
going to like it a lot.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:25.380
Now, before I begin number six, I, uh,
our guys were running around like

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:28.400
crazy backstage as you might imagine.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.270
We figured out why my demo crashed.

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:39.310
Because there are 570 Wi-Fi base
stations operating in this room.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.520
Okay?

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:42.590
We can't deal with that.

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:43.740
So we have two choices.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:48.890
Either I've got some more demos that are
really great that I'd like to show you.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.730
So we either turn off all the stuff
and see the demos or we give up

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.520
and I don't show you the demos.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.000
Would you like to see the demos or not?

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:01.700
Here's the deal.

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.870
Let's turn up the lights in the hall.

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:06.960
Several hundred of these
are these MiFi things too,

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.960
by the way.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.020
So all you bloggers need to
turn off your base stations,

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.060
turn off your Wi-Fi.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.080
Every notebook, I'd like them to put
them down on the floor.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.260
And all of you look around,
I'd like you to police each other.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.380
If you want to see the demos,
shut all your laptops,

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:27.760
turn off all these MiFi base stations,
and put them on the floor, please.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.000
Come on, look around you.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.850
I mean, I'm not, you know,
I think bloggers have a right to blog,

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.840
but if we want to see the demos,
we're not going to be able to do it.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.690
Unless we turn off all these
MiFi base stations and laptops,

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:48.390
set them on the floor, and then

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.160
This is a testament
to how far we've come,

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.800
isn't it?

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.400
It's incredible.

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:14.570
570 Wi-Fi base stations in this room.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400
Are we done?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.400
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.740
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
but if we want to see the demos,

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.680
this is what we have to do.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.080
All right.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.750
So number six.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:38.370
iPhone OS 4, the most advanced mobile
operating system in the world.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:51.100
The first new feature is that
we're going to rename it.

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:55.370
We're going to take away the
phone because it's on iPads

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:58.100
and iPod touches and iPhones.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:03.100
So we're going to rename it iOS 4,
or iOS, and this is the fourth version.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:08.610
And we're going to go even further,
we're going to give it some metal.

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.440
iOS 4.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.460
Rolls off the tongue.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:20.300
Now, iOS 4 is our most
ambitious release to date.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.160
It has over 1500 new developer APIs.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.880
I'm sure most of you have
been playing with this.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.480
There's some great stuff in there.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.190
And we're aware of a lot of
great apps being developed that

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.960
use a lot of these new APIs.

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.080
And we're thrilled by that.

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:40.380
There's over 100 new
user features as well.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.790
The biggest being multitasking.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.500
Now, you know, some people have said,
well,

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.890
you weren't first with multitasking,
and they're right,

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.390
just like we weren't first with cut,
copy, and paste.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:54.820
Took us a little while to figure
out how to do it just right.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.820
And the same is true of multitasking.

01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:00.800
If you don't do it right,
you're going to burn battery life.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.480
And it's nice to see some
people agreeing with us.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.480
This is a statement that
Larry Page made just a few weeks ago.

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.010
Software running in the background,
that just sort of exhausts

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:11.500
the battery quickly.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.490
Yes, it does.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.020
unless you do it right.

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:21.000
And so we've taken a little longer,
but we think we've come up with a

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.660
good architecture for multitasking
along with an awesome user interface

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.680
that is just the best in the
industry for finding your apps and

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:35.020
instantly switching between them.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.960
We're also using it to control
all the audio that you might be

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:42.470
playing as well as the locking the
rotation into the portrait position.

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:46.170
In addition to that, we've added folders.

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:50.240
Just got a great folder implementation
and a whole bunch of other things that

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.640
I'm not going to have time to demo today,
but I would like to demo these

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:55.780
few things for you if that's okay.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.690
All right.

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:04.800
So first thing I'm going to do,
let's get it big there.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.230
There we go.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.780
I'm going

01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:13.330
Play some Jack Johnson.

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:17.960
And I'm going to go launch mail here.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.540
And again, you can see the quality of the
text here is just extraordinary

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.220
with this retina display.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.480
And summertime in Yosemite.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.800
Now I'm going to go to a web
page and find out if we really

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:31.960
did turn off our Wi-Fi devices.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:52.130
And so again, look at the quality of
this text and graphics.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.600
And I'm going to go ahead and
just go back to Mail just by

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.240
double tapping the Home button,
seeing all the apps that are running

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.530
here and just scrolling through them all.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.650
I'm going to go back to Mail here.

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:06.910
And now I'm back in Mail.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.990
And I can also, if I want to, again,
just go back here and

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:13.100
I can swipe to the right.

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:16.480
And there's the audio controls
for whatever audio app I'm using.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.600
In this case, Pandora.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.830
I'm just going to pause it right here.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.840
And I'm in mail right now.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.870
Let me show you a few
things in mail real quick.

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:30.760
I can go to my inboxes and as you
can see I have the unified inbox,

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.900
which is all inboxes.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.200
I've got so I can switch really fast
between all my inboxes if I want to.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.410
And I've also got threading.

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:45.450
So you can see the number there
next to the arrow and I can see all

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:50.200
of the email messages from a single
conversation in one place here.

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.410
makes it really easy to
follow a conversation,

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.110
delete a whole conversation at once,
et cetera.

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:05.440
Okay, now what I'd like to do is go
back to the home screen and

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:06.640
I'm going to create a folder.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.420
And we've got this great new folder
system for being able to help you

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.010
organize and manage your apps.

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.400
And all I have to do is just
hold my finger on an icon until

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.260
it starts to jiggle and drag
it on top of another icon.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.620
So I will drag this sports app
on top of another sports app.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.790
And it automatically makes a
folder and it names it based

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:29.800
on the category of apps.

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.240
Now I can rename it at
any time if I want to.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.160
And I can go back and drag
other apps in as well.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.320
I can drag my ESPN app in there.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.420
And I can drag a sports
game in there if I want to.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.420
Oops.

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:47.130
And so now when I go in there, boom,
there's my four apps.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.580
I can drag one out if I'd like.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.460
And I can also take an app
out of the dock and I can even

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.110
drag a folder in the dock if

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.640
And so now I've got my folder with
me wherever I am in the system,

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.640
and I can just tap it and
see all my sports apps.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.500
And it's really, really helpful.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.490
So that gives you --

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.920
I provided you a brief view of just
a few of the new features of iOS 4,

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:23.520
but there are just tons of
new features everywhere.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:28.910
So, iOS 4, multitasking, folders,

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.990
Retina display integration.

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:34.920
Again, we've enhanced every app we
ship on the iPhone to work

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:40.020
perfectly with the retina display,
super high resolution artwork, etc.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.020
And put in all the work so that
your apps automatically work

01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:47.680
beautifully with it as well,
even if you don't update your artwork.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.360
Mail, a lot of new things in mail,
the biggest two being the

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.090
unified inbox and threading.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.400
Lot of enhancements in the camera
and the photo apps to take advantage

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.990
of our whole new camera system.

01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:07.020
Much deeper enterprise
integration and just again tons

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.380
of new features everywhere.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.160
I wanted to hit for just a second
on the enterprise integration.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:19.270
We got a lot of requests and our
enterprise customers are thrilled because

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.070
we got all of that stuff in to iOS 4.

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.230
Much better data protection,
device management,

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:29.610
they can wirelessly distribute
apps around the enterprise,

01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:33.680
multiple exchange support,
deeper VPN support.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.080
Our enterprise customers seem really,
really excited about iOS 4.

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:42.940
Another thing we're adding on the
consumer side is today we have

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:49.710
Google search and we have Yahoo as
an option that you can select.

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:54.870
We're adding a third
option which is Bing.

01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:59.840
Google will stay the default,
but now you'll have one

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.840
more choice if you'd like.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.730
And so instead of just having
one choice or two choices,

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:06.240
you have three choices.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.760
You can search with
Google or Yahoo or Bing.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.040
Each one takes a unique approach
to how they search and how

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.560
they format their results.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:17.360
So again,
we're going to give you the choice.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.290
You decide,
but you have one more choice now.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:21.900
And Microsoft's done a
really nice job on this.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.220
It's an HTML5 presentation.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:25.880
They've done a great job.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.850
So check it out.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.160
It's kind of cool.

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:29.900
All righty.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.100
So iOS 4.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:37.300
And we're going to put a
Golden Master candidate in

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.800
developer's hands today.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.690
For those of you that have
been following the releases,

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.480
they've gotten really good lately,
and we now have our

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.560
final release candidate,
our golden master candidate.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.980
It's going to be in your hands
today if you're a developer,

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.680
and it will be out soon.

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:06.130
Now there's another major milestone
we're about to hit with iOS.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:15.020
This month, this month we will sell our
hundred millionth iOS device.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:25.350
That's iPhones, iPod touches and iPads.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.510
A hundred million.

01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:31.340
There is definitely a market
for your applications.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:40.980
So, no one even comes close to this.

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.240
So that is iOS 4.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.050
That's number 6.

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.620
Number 7.

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:55.340
iBooks we talked about iBooks with
its enhancements on the iPad we are

01:12:55.470 --> 01:13:00.790
bringing it to the iPhone with iPhone 4

01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:04.960
Just gorgeous, as you know.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.840
Same controls, the same highlighting,
the same bookmarking, the same notes,

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:12.470
as you see on the iPad.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.490
It's done really, really well.

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.620
Same bookshelf to keep your books.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:23.150
the same PDF reading right on
your iPhone so you can get a

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:27.210
PDF in a mail message tap on it,
it goes right to iBooks to the

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:31.810
PDF shelf and you can have it store it

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:35.200
Click through it whenever you like.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.600
So we're really excited about this.

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:42.390
And of course,
the iBook store right on your iPhone.

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:45.860
Now, we've got iBooks now.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.700
We'll have it on the iPad, the iPhone,
and the iPod Touch.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.800
This gets interesting.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.870
What can we do with all
these products together?

01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:59.190
Well,
I'd like to outline just a few things,

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:03.370
and please keep in mind that they
work across all three of these

01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:05.840
products and all wirelessly.

01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.870
The first is, of course,
you can purchase and download a

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.680
book with the iBook store to any one
of these products on your iPhone,

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.700
on your iPad, or on your iPod.

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:18.490
And it'll wirelessly be
downloaded right to the device.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.480
You don't have to go through a
computer or anything like that.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.820
Buy your book right on the device.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.920
It's downloaded right to the device.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:34.920
Now, you can download the same book to
all your devices at no extra charge.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:38.560
Buy a book on your iPad,
download it to your iPhone.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.040
Buy a book on your iPhone,
download it to your iPod and your iPad.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.340
You only have to buy it once.

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:54.490
And iBooks will automatically and
wirelessly and from no charge,

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.320
Sync your current place,
all your bookmarks, and all your notes

01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:02.860
across all your devices.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.700
So you can start reading
a book on your iPad,

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.240
need to run out with your
iPhone in your pocket,

01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:18.280
pick up right where you left
off with all your bookmarks,

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.060
all your notes, right on your iPhone.

01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:24.180
Just all works.

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:27.420
And so that is iBooks on the iPhone,
and I'd love to give you a

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.960
Partly because I just want you
to see how beautiful it looks

01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:38.760
on this amazing retina display.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.990
So I'm going to open one
of my favorite books,

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:44.500
Winnie the Pooh.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.700
And look at that gorgeous text.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.370
It doesn't get any better than that.

01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:53.340
And again,
you can just flip through the book.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:59.580
And you can make a selection here.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.980
And you can say I want to highlight that.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.920
You could select it again and
say I'd like to maybe change

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:08.880
the color of that highlight.

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:12.960
And I could make a note if I want.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:19.320
And so I could say, you know, I love

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.660
Who?

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.510
And I've got myself a note right now,
and I could bookmark

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.370
the page if I wanted to.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.300
Put away the control -- oops, go back,
sorry.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.710
Put away the controls.

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:38.280
And now if I go back to
the table of contents,

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:43.300
and there's my bookmarks and
my note and my highlight.

01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:45.120
So it all just kind of works.

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:49.060
And let me go back now to the library.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.940
And I'm going to switch to PDFs.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.880
And here's my PDF bookshelf
with my PDFs on it.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.670
So let me open one of

01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:01.770
And I can use the just thumb
along the bottom if I want to,

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:07.580
or I can just flip pages
like this by tapping them.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.290
Isn't this cool?

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:19.780
And again, I can just zoom into text,
pinch and zoom any way I want to.

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.240
It's just really, really nice.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.900
Look at that.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:27.400
Pretty cool, huh?

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:42.260
So that is iBooks.

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:46.100
Now, iBooks, as you know,
has the iBookstore on the iPhone,

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:51.960
and the iBookstore joins the
iTunes store and the App Store as

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.740
the third store on the iPhone.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:58.860
Now we've gotten over 150
million accounts for these

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:05.010
stores with credit cards,
ready to buy your apps.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.440
Over 150 million.

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:12.590
We believe this is the most
of any store on the web.

01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:14.160
We believe we're now number one.

01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:19.600
And these stores have had
over 16 billion downloads.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.390
Again, number one on the web.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:29.170
So, the iBook store joining the
iTunes store and the App Store,

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:31.360
now on the iPhone.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.520
And that is number seven.

01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:46.660
Why are we doing IADs?

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.800
We're doing it for one simple reason.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.640
to help our developers earn money
so they continue to create free

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.590
and low-cost apps for users.

01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:58.900
That's why we're doing this.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.000
So this is what iAds look like.

01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:07.630
Here's an app, a Wall Street Journal app,
and you'll see banners pop

01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:11.820
into the app at various places,
depending on where you, the developer,

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.520
say you want them to show up.

01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:15.600
And they'll pop up.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:18.930
And as you know,
what we're trying to do with iAds is

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:24.140
we're trying to combine the emotion of
video with the interactivity of the web.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.280
This is what advertisers have been
after in the digital advertising medium.

01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:33.370
They want to get some of the emotion
that they use television for today

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.900
onto these digital platforms,
and we think we've figured

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.950
out how to do that.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.640
Now, IADs keep you in your app.

01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:44.550
The worst thing you want as
a user is to tap on a banner,

01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:49.240
be hijacked out of your app to a browser,
taken to some random website,

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.840
and decide you're not even
interested in the product or

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.480
the service they're offering.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.560
Then you've got to find your
app again and hopefully get

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.130
back to where you left off.

01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:00.350
People don't click on the ads.

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:02.800
If people don't click on the ads,
they don't get the benefit of the

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.990
ads and you don't make any money.

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:08.840
So by making sure that our users
know what an iAd is with the

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.740
little branding in the corner,
they'll know that iAds don't

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.630
hijack them out of their apps.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.430
It's built right into iOS 4.

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:24.040
You can add IADs to your
app in an afternoon.

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:27.630
Simply tell us where you
want us to place them.

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:29.810
Everything else is done
automatically because it's built

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:31.820
right into the operating system.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.840
You don't have to, in essence,
write an app to put an ad

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.340
like this into your app.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.850
it's all done in iOS 4.

01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:45.420
Apple sells and hosts the ads
so all you have to do is tell us

01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:48.820
where to put them and make money.

01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:57.560
You get 60% of the revenues and you
get paid via iTunes Connect the same

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:01.450
way you get paid for your apps and
as you know we pay very frequently.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.740
So, that's what iAds are.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.070
Now, we've only been selling
ads for eight weeks.

01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:10.860
We started selling ads
about eight weeks ago,

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:14.980
and I'd like to just tell you about
some of the brands that are going

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.800
to be advertising with us during
the second half of this year.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.930
These folks are the ones
that have committed so far,

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:24.120
and let me just run
through them now for you.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:28.670
Starting off with Nissan.

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.200
Unilever, the second largest consumer
products company in the world.

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:35.310
AT&T

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:44.700
[Transcript missing]

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.440
State Farm and Geico,
they want you guys to

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.280
have some insurance.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.790
Campbell's Soup,

01:21:55.070 --> 01:22:05.940
Sears, some great retailers, Sears,
JCPenney, Target, Best Buy.

01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:15.320
DirecTV, the TBS network, and Disney.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.500
and those are some of the brands
that have signed us up with us

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:20.600
for the second half of this year.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.600
We couldn't be happier.

01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:25.000
I'm really excited about this.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.280
Now, I pulled, all these folks are
working on their iAds,

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.850
none of them are quite done yet,
but I pulled one in process,

01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:34.040
which was a Nissan ad.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:39.000
Nissan is going to use iAds to
advertise their new fully electric car,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.100
the LEAP.

01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:42.930
And so I pulled their ad and
I just want to show it to you now.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.680
Again,
it's a work in process and they were

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:50.730
a little hesitant to have me show you,
but I wanted to show you,

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:52.630
so I convinced them.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:56.750
So,
this is a news reader app and as you can

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.790
see their banner popped in on the bottom
and I as a user can just tap on it,

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.260
it takes over the screen and loads in.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.560
And anytime I want to go,
I didn't want to watch this ad,

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.730
I just push this button up at
the top and I'm back in the app,

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.300
right?

01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:10.800
So I can get back to the app instantly.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.300
Let me go back into the ad in this case.

01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:20.910
So they're loading up a little
bit of video and here we go.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.950
This is the Peace Bomb.

01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:31.100
Instead of destroying things,
it makes them better.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.330
It was invented in the year 2411,
thanks to the anti-matter chip.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:40.620
which was made possible by a new form of
helium discovered on the moon in 2236.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:44.820
We got there by teleportation,
which replaced the space elevator,

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:47.140
which was built by the
electric spacecraft,

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:52.420
and it all started with the
greatest invention of the year 2010.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.290
The 100% electric Nissan LEAF.

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:08.590
It's amazing how, you know,
15 seconds of video,

01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:09.710
how compelling it can be.

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.720
So now we've got this really
cool navigator on the bottom

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.740
that as I spin it around,
it spins around the car.

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.440
And so let me show you a few things here.

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.720
I can say, oh, a new driver.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.740
The only way you're going to be able to
register to get one of these initially

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.860
is with this ad right on the iPhone.

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.460
So if you're interested in the Leaf,
you have to get an iPhone.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.180
and register in this ad.

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:40.400
So let me show you a
few things they've done.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.800
This is very cool.

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:45.700
They want to show how
efficient the leaf is.

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:47.680
And they came up with
this really cool way.

01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:49.290
The new miles per gallon.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.030
And so you just tap on this,
and it shows you that a leaf

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:56.570
goes 38 miles on a dollar,
for a dollar, right?

01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:59.650
A dollar's worth of electricity
in this case takes you 38 miles.

01:24:59.770 --> 01:25:03.290
How much will a dollar's worth of fuel
take you in some of these other cars?

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.410
So you just push on the car,
and you can see.

01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:08.290
Well, a Hummer doesn't take you very far.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:13.050
Corvette takes you a little further,
a Ford Taurus a little further,

01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:19.310
a Mini Cooper, it's kind of a cool car,
that takes you about 10 miles, a Civic,

01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:21.180
they're not so good.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.810
Here's a Prius,
that's probably a little further.

01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:29.070
So this is a pretty doggone compelling
way to get their point across,

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.160
and it's fun.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.010
And so this is what IADs are all about.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:39.820
So, and then one other very cool thing
they're putting in here is the new prize.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:45.050
They are going to
actually give away a car.

01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:46.780
And so you enter through the ad.

01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:50.810
So I can just shake my
phone and change the color,

01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:52.230
you know.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:53.980
I want a red one.

01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:55.970
I enter to win a red one.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:03.190
And it pulls my name up,
my contact information,

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.680
and I can just submit it.

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:09.120
And now I have entered
this contest to win a car.

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.760
Pretty cool, huh?

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:13.410
So that is an IAD.

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:25.460
I think a lot of people are
going to try to win the car.

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:28.100
It's a great idea.

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.500
iAds.

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:35.640
iAds start, we're going to turn it on
July 1st for all iOS 4 devices.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.480
So July 1st, less than a month from now.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.270
Now how successful have
we been in selling iAds?

01:26:43.410 --> 01:26:45.330
Well we're new at this,
we've never done this before and

01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:46.620
we don't know what we're doing.

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:52.200
But we've attracted some pretty exciting
brands and they have committed over

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:57.700
$60 million for the second half of
this year in the last eight weeks.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.500
How much is that?

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:07.960
Well, you know, JP Morgan just revised
their study of U.S.

01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:10.880
mobile display advertising
in the year 2010.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.240
They just came out
with it a few days ago,

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.110
and they reiterated their number
that they think the mobile display

01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:17.410
advertising market in the U.S.

01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:21.180
for the whole year is
going to be $250 million.

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:24.740
Well,
$60 million of that is about that much.

01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:28.870
But it's actually a little more,
because we're only talking about

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:30.840
the second half of the year.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.650
And so we're looking at IADS now with
just the commitments we've gotten in

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:40.780
the last eight weeks to be 48 percent
of the second half 2010 entire U.S.

01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:44.040
mobile display advertising market.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.040
We've only been at this for eight weeks,
and we're not stopping selling.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.050
So we think we're off
to a pretty great start.

01:27:52.050 --> 01:27:55.280
And we'll report back
to you on how we do.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.020
But I would encourage you,
if you're interested,

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.720
to sign up for IADS,
get the necessary stuff into your app,

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:05.980
and let's go put some ads out
there and help you make some money,

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:10.490
because that's our goal in this,
to help you earn money so you

01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:16.080
can continue to create free and
low-cost apps to delight users.

01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:21.250
And we think this is going to work,
and we're really excited about it.

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.360
So those are the eight things I want
to share with you on iPhone 4.

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:33.360
What do you think so far?

01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:35.420
You like it?

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:43.720
It's, it's a, I think it's a lot more
than people thought it was.

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.700
I don't know, what do you think?

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:47.570
Is it more than you thought?

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:55.710
We're really pleased with it.

01:28:55.710 --> 01:29:00.100
But there is one more thing.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:05.510
And I think it's best
that I just show you.

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:15.340
I really want your wifi devices off.

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:15.360
Are they off?

01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:19.680
Please turn them off if
you've turned them back on.

01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:29.510
In 2007, when we launched the iPhone,
it was my privilege to make the

01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:33.720
first public call on stage to one of
my best friends in the whole world,

01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:37.660
Johnny Arve, the head of our design team.

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:44.220
And I'd like to do the
same on this occasion.

01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:46.960
So I'm going to go ahead
and call Johnny now.

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.200
Hey, Johnny.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:27.700
This never freezes up,
so you guys haven't

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:30.340
turned off all your Wi-Fi.

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:32.340
Come on, let's get it off, please.

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:37.040
Hey, Johnny, how you doing?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.600
[Transcript missing]

01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:53.940
You know, this is amazing.

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:56.030
I grew up here in the U.S.

01:30:56.070 --> 01:31:00.960
with the Jetsons and with
Star Trek and communicators

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.660
and just dreaming about this.

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:05.500
You know, dreaming about video calling.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.780
And it's real now.

01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:12.950
Did you have this kind
of stuff in England?

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.800
I grew up watching
exactly the same TV shows.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:25.800
I used to love that sort of wonderful,
optimistic view of the future.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.790
And it's real now, isn't it?

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:30.780
It's real.

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:34.110
Especially when people
turn their Wi-Fi stuff off.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.100
Oh, isn't it?

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:46.540
Because as you know,
the idea of communicating this way,

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.960
it's an old idea.

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.980
It's one that we're familiar with.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.280
We've just had to wait.

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:54.260
We've had to wait an awfully
long time for it to become real,

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.130
haven't we?

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.410
Yeah.

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:01.500
Well listen, let's have lunch later on.

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:03.330
All right, I'll see you soon.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.600
Thanks, Johnny.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.590
All right, see you soon.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:30.300
[Transcript missing]

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.850
It's great.

01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:36.760
It's iPhone 4 to iPhone 4.

01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:39.950
Anywhere there is Wi-Fi,

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:45.700
and there is no setup required you
don't have to find a server you don't

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:50.020
have to type in anything you don't need
a special code you don't need a buddy

01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:54.110
list nothing you just make a phone call

01:32:56.730 --> 01:32:59.690
You can use the front or the rear camera.

01:32:59.690 --> 01:33:02.040
You can switch to the rear camera
so the person on the other end

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.600
can see what you're seeing.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.600
You just switch back and forth real easy.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.730
Portrait or landscape.

01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:10.380
You turn your phone,
it automatically does the

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.600
right thing on the other side.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.560
So if you have two people
wanting to talk to somebody,

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:20.590
you can just go into landscape and
get a little bit wider aspect ratio.

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:25.040
and the video and the
audio quality is great.

01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:31.840
Now, FaceTime is going to
be Wi-Fi only in 2010.

01:33:31.890 --> 01:33:35.340
Need to work a little bit
with the cellular providers.

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:37.600
Get ready for the future.

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:39.870
So we're Wi-Fi only in 2010.

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:48.410
And Apple will ship tens of millions
of FaceTime devices this year.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.050
Tens of millions of
FaceTime devices this calendar year.

01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:54.710
So there's going to be a
lot of people to talk to.

01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:58.760
So FaceTime, video calling.

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:01.300
We're really happy with this.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:12.900
We made a little video to just
show some of the ways that we

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:17.340
hope people will use FaceTime and
I'd like to run that for you now.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:36.700
[Transcript missing]

01:34:51.700 --> 01:35:10.700
[Transcript missing]

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.950
that reminds us why we do what we do.

01:36:28.190 --> 01:36:30.120
So FaceTime.

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:37.300
iPhone 4 to iPhone 4,
anywhere there's Wi-Fi, zero setup,

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:40.650
portrait or landscape,
front or rear camera,

01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:42.890
and amazing video and audio quality.

01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:48.860
Now, FaceTime is based on a
lot of open standards.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:55.490
H264 video, AAC audio,
and a bunch of alphabet soup acronyms.

01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:58.720
We're going to take it all the way.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:03.580
We're going to the standards bodies
starting tomorrow and we're going to

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:06.510
make FaceTime an open industry standard.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:21.100
[Transcript missing]

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.000
So that is the iPhone 4.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.430
And we think it's the biggest leap
we've taken since the original iPhone.

01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:33.230
We're really proud of it.

01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:39.270
And I think you'll agree there's
more to it than met the eye.

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:42.490
So price and availability.

01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:48.160
Well, first of all,
the iPhone 4 comes in two colors, black

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:51.500
They are both gorgeous.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:57.630
And the price with the normal
qualifications and two year contract,

01:37:57.630 --> 01:38:04.910
$199 in the US for the 16 gigabyte model,
same price as the 3GS,

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:11.280
and $299 for the 32 gigabyte model.

01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:20.700
to also announce that AT&T is
going to make an incredibly

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:23.590
generous upgrade offer.

01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:31.550
The offer is going to be if your
contract expires any time during 2010,

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:37.700
you are immediately eligible for
a new iPhone 4 at the same $199,

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:43.420
$299 prices if you top up
your contract to two years.

01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:48.880
So you can get up to six months
early eligibility for an iPhone 4.

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:52.710
If your contract expires
any time this calendar year,

01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.760
you top up your contract to
two years and you can buy an

01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:59.240
iPhone 4 for the same price,
$199 or $299.

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.360
So we're thrilled about that.

01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:04.400
Now, what's our lineup look like?

01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:07.880
Well, today, or yesterday,
it was the iPhone 3G

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:12.680
at 8 gigabytes for $99,
the 3GS, 16 for $199.

01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:17.840
Well, we're going to just add iOS 4
to the 3GS and slide it on over.

01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:23.820
And an 8-gigabyte 3GS for $99,
16-gigabyte iPhone 4 for $199,

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:25.720
and of course, the 32 for $299.

01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:28.200
This is our new lineup.

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:33.590
And these go on sale June 24th.

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.940
Pre-orders start a week from tomorrow,
June 15th.

01:39:45.010 --> 01:39:47.950
Now, on June 24th,
we're going to be shipping

01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:49.820
in five countries.

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.210
The US, France, Germany, the UK,
and Japan.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:01.700
But in July, we're going to be shipping
in 18 more countries.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:08.550
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland,

01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:13.940
Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway,
New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea,

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:16.900
Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.190
In August,
we're going to add 24 more countries,

01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:24.600
and in September we're
going to add 40 more,

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:29.000
so that by the end of September we
are shipping in 88 countries.

01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:32.110
This will be our fastest rollout ever.

01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:40.900
A few accessories that I'd
like to tell you about.

01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:43.940
The first, very simple one, a dock.

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:47.580
Real nice dock for the iPhone 4, $29.

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:51.180
The other is just like
we did with the iPad.

01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.780
We took a crack at
doing a case ourselves.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:55.820
We're pretty happy with the results.

01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:58.060
We call it a bumper.

01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.370
And it goes around the iPhone 4.

01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:04.200
It's got these really nice metal controls
so they pass through the plastic.

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.000
The back is open so you have the
camera and you can see our logo.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.200
And they protect the phone very well.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.690
And they come in colors.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.980
And so they are real nice,
and they are $29 as well.

01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:24.930
And I'd like to talk for a
minute about iOS 4 upgrades.

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:31.480
We will be offering iOS 4
upgrades for the iPhone 3GS,

01:41:31.690 --> 01:41:36.440
the iPhone 3G, but again,
not all the features are supported.

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:39.780
The hardware just won't support the
kind of experience for multitasking

01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:44.230
that we would like to see,
so that will not be supported on the 3G.

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.190
But many things will be.

01:41:46.190 --> 01:41:49.040
And the iPod Touch, again,
not all the features will

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.460
be supported on every model,
and it excludes the first generation,

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:54.460
because again,
the hardware will just not support it.

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:59.810
And the great news here is that
upgrades for all these products

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.890
will be free on June 21st.

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.380
We finally found a way to get
these upgrades for free to our

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.640
iPod Touch customers and we
couldn't be happier about that.

01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:20.960
So that is iOS 4 and of
course the new iPhone 4.

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:25.400
Now we put together a video to kind of
try to summarize all the features of the

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:29.390
iPhone 4 and I'd like to run that now.

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.900
iPhone 4 is so much more than
just another new product.

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:50.580
I mean, this will have a lasting impact
on the way that we actually

01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.140
connect with each other.

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:57.000
In 2007, the iPhone reinvented the phone.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.790
In 2008, the iPhone 3G brought
faster 3G networking and

01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:03.440
the revolutionary App Store.

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:07.900
In 2009, the iPhone 3GS was twice
as fast and brought out new

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.200
features like video recording.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.770
For 2010,
the iPhone 4 is the biggest leap

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.380
forward since the original iPhone.

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:20.560
We're introducing the amazing
Retina display and we're bringing

01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:23.540
video calling to the world.

01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:25.940
And we call it FaceTime.

01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:29.850
It's going to change the
way we communicate forever.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:39.090
The very first time
I had a FaceTime call,

01:43:39.090 --> 01:43:40.760
I was blown away.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.970
Because it is amazingly engaging,
personal.

01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:46.940
It's all about connecting people.

01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:51.160
I think of my own children, like seven,
eight years, they'll be off at college.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:55.310
And I can imagine being able
to call them and see them,

01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:59.870
but also look into their eyes and
see how are they really doing.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.500
What makes it even better is
that it switches from the front

01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.400
camera to the back camera.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:10.130
So you can show someone
what you're seeing.

01:44:10.150 --> 01:44:13.330
And because it's so mobile as your phone,
you'll be able to chat

01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:14.930
anywhere there's Wi-Fi.

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:17.330
But what's amazing is every
time I've been using it,

01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:20.110
you can't help but smile and go,
"I can't believe this is real.

01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:23.290
This is actually happening."

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:27.340
Another thing we're really
excited about on the new

01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:29.820
iPhone 4 is the retina display.

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.500
It's the highest resolution
display ever built into a phone.

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:39.260
At 326 pixels per inch,
you get four times the pixels as before.

01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:42.170
So instead of the fuzziness
of individual pixels,

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.420
you get smooth,
continuous shapes and tone.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:49.340
You have something that looks
to your eye like you're holding

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:50.620
a printed page in your hand.

01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:54.380
And the level of fine detail
in images is just incredible.

01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:59.850
Another thing that adds to the sharpness
and clarity is optical lamination.

01:44:59.850 --> 01:45:04.820
That's a very precise technical process
that laminates the cover glass to the

01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.700
display and eliminates light refraction.

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:10.980
So all of the hard work that's
been put into this ultra high

01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:14.460
resolution display is presented
with the most visual clarity.

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:20.460
On top of that we use IPS technology
and LED backlight so you get the most

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.700
vivid experience in everything you do.

01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:27.730
The display on the iPhone is blow away.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.780
can show more detail than you've
ever seen on any device before.

01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.530
The text is just perfect.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.600
iPhone 4 enables
multitasking for all apps.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.870
You can now quickly switch between
applications and everything

01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:49.140
is exactly as you left it.

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:52.280
If you're like me and you have
lots of apps on your phone,

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.780
you'd love a way to easily
organize them and find them.

01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:58.020
And that's exactly what
folders does for you.

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.770
Take an app and drag it onto another
app and it automatically creates

01:46:02.770 --> 01:46:06.700
a folder intelligently named with
the type of apps you're grouping.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.200
Mail on iPhone 4 is incredibly efficient.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.940
You can see all the messages
from multiple accounts in

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.840
a single unified inbox.

01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:20.840
And it allows you to organize all of
the messages in your inbox by thread.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.540
So you can deal with a
single topic altogether.

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:28.980
Pictures taken with a five
megapixel camera look amazing.

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:32.400
And we even have an LED flash so
you can take photos in low light.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:37.600
Plus the camera captures full
720p high-resolution images.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.530
video at up to 30 frames per second.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:46.040
Not only can you record great video,
but you can also edit your video

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:48.040
right on your iPhone with iMovie.

01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:54.500
The iPhone, for a user, it is simplicity,
it is easy to use.

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.700
Behind it is intense technology.

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:02.900
What's running all this incredible
software is our A4 chip.

01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:05.700
It's custom designed silicon,
and what that gets you is

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:09.700
remarkable speed and efficiency
in a really small chip.

01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:12.350
The one thing we made
larger was the battery.

01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:17.270
In fact, iPhone 4 delivers up
to 40% more talk time.

01:47:18.130 --> 01:47:21.980
We started with
completely opposing goals.

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.780
We wanted to make this
iPhone more capable.

01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:27.100
We wanted to add more features.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.070
And yet at the same time,
we wanted to make it

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.180
smaller and even thinner.

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.860
And that led to some really
surprising innovation.

01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:39.300
We developed an entirely new grade
of stainless steel that after

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.970
machining is incredibly strong,
but also remarkably precise.

01:47:44.050 --> 01:47:50.060
The steel frame functions as the antenna,
but also the primary structure,

01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:52.420
giving us more internal volume.

01:47:53.690 --> 01:47:56.540
We also developed a custom
glass that's comparable in

01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:02.300
strength to sapphire crystal,
but about 30 times harder than plastic.

01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:05.910
This glass is not only used
on the front of the phone,

01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:08.250
but also on the back.

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:12.480
The quality of the materials,
the manufacturing precision,

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.020
the advanced technology,
ultimately all of this becomes relevant

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:20.570
when you just hold it in your hand.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:24.540
Even if FaceTime were the only
new feature we're delivering,

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.940
this would be an amazing new iPhone.

01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:30.070
But it's the fact that we've
got the Retina display,

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:34.870
5 megapixel camera,
high def video recording, A4 chip,

01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:38.380
bigger battery, all in a thinner product.

01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:41.170
This is going to change everything.

01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:43.130
All over again.

01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:02.300
I put up this slide a
little earlier this year,

01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:07.120
and to me it represents
what Apple's all about.

01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:09.880
Apple's not just a technology company.

01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:15.760
Even though we have and invent some of
the highest technology in our industry,

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:17.400
it's more than that.

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:20.690
It's the marriage of that plus,
if you will,

01:49:20.690 --> 01:49:25.430
the humanities or the liberal
arts that distinguishes Apple.

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:29.520
It's the hardware and the
software working together.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.500
Coming up with A4 chips that
work with the software to give us

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.100
these incredible battery lives.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:41.520
It's not just a great new camera
system built into the iPhone 4,

01:49:41.570 --> 01:49:45.310
but it's the video editing software
built in and iMovie for iPhone

01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:50.160
that really takes it the distance
and gives you a complete solution.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:53.240
It's not just a front-facing camera.

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.670
It's a front-facing camera and 18
months worth of work to come up with

01:49:57.790 --> 01:50:03.120
software that you'll never even notice
when you want to place a video call.

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:06.180
It's the complete solution.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.830
So that all of us don't have
to be system integrators.

01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:15.430
And I am so proud of the teams
that have made this product.

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.340
It's really extraordinary.

01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:21.460
And I urge you to get your hands
on one and see for yourself.

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:27.550
So before we end today,
I'd like to just say thanks to the teams

01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:32.480
that have worked their tails off for the
last 18 months to create the iPhone 4.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.600
Mark Papermaster and his hardware team,
Can you guys please stand up?

01:50:55.700 --> 01:51:08.900
[Transcript missing]

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:20.910
Scott Forrestal and our
remarkable iOS software team.

01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:34.800
All of this wouldn't make any difference
if we couldn't build a ton of them.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.670
Tim and our operations team, Jeff,
stand up please.

01:51:49.400 --> 01:52:06.000
[Transcript missing]

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:07.890
This is our new baby.

01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:10.000
I hope you love it as much as we do.

01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:10.960
Thank you very much.
