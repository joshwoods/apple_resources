00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Hello, everybody.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.940
I'm happy to see so many people here
interested in turn-based gaming.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.440
For those of you who were around earlier,
you would have seen some of

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.820
the other interesting things
we can do with Game Center,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.090
but this is totally new for
iOS 5 and turn-based gaming.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.400
I'm Gabriel,
and I'll be with you for the next hour,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.870
hopefully, and we have a lot to say.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.080
So this is Game Center and
the Game Kit framework.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.280
We've seen this before.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.680
There's really three pieces to this.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.100
It's a Game Center app.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.140
There's a Game Kit framework
and Game Kit services.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.330
And so what I'm going to be talking
about is just turn-based gaming,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.010
and that really falls
into the middle category.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.040
And there's a set of APIs that we
provided for you that will allow

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.120
you to create turn-based games.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.980
We think of these as social asynchronous,
a little bit leisurely.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.800
People don't have to be
there all at the same time,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.870
but we're really going to be
focusing on the middle piece for now.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.440
Just an introduction,
some of the things I'll be talking about.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.100
As I mentioned, turn-based gaming is new.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.200
I hope to see in the next few months
a whole bunch of new turn-based games.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.790
I'm going to talk about the API and
the user interface that we provide

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.200
to help you create these games.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.190
We'll talk about different types
of games that you can create.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll talk about how you
can manage the game,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.200
so the state of the game
and the flow of the game,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
how people -- how you
pass the turn around,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.070
essentially.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.730
And I'll go over a bunch of
code from the API so you can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.110
actually see how it's implemented.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.300
And that will be a little bit of a demo.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.390
Specifically what I'm going to
be talking about sort of in this

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.220
order in a few different ways.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.100
The Game Center turn-based API basics.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.650
So what are the basics that you
need to know in order to get your

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.700
turn-based game off the ground?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.950
What handlers you need to implement,
what notifications you'll get,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.010
all those kind of things.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.900
I'll show you how you
can start a new match.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.650
I'll show you how you can
make turns in a match.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.320
Notifications that you'll need to handle.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.270
And finally, how you finish the
match once you're done.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.430
So what is a turn-based game?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.880
A turn-based game really
is a game that has turns.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.660
So each individual participant
in the game will go sequentially.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.900
And not everybody has to
be there at the same time.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.000
Some examples of turn-based games.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.850
We can do chess, checkers, backgammon,
go.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.450
Some sort of standard type games.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.710
Something a little bit more
complicated would be a bridge.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.120
Card games where you
have multiple people.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.670
I mean, it's clear that the turn
goes around in the bidding.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.920
Those are familiar with bridge now,
right?

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.300
And obviously all the interesting things
that you're going to come out with.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.770
We've all seen instances of board
games which could be implemented

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.900
as turn-based or some strategy,
not necessarily real-time strategy,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.350
games.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.210
And I'm really excited about this.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.710
And I can't say how much I'm looking
forward to the games that are

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.380
going to show up on the app store.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.180
Here we actually have an example.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.650
So one way that we've been
visualizing this is people sitting

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.100
around a table playing a game.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.290
And one person has the turn.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.250
So that person is the only person in
the game who can affect the state.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.060
So they have the dice.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.790
It's their turn to roll.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.100
They're going to move.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.000
Everybody else is sort of waiting.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.590
And traditionally the turn will go around
the table in sort of an orderly manner,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.400
each person having their opportunity
to take one turn at a time.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.000
We've also introduced an interesting
concept to this which was matchmaking.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.100
And so we've seen P2P matchmaking
where essentially when a P2P match,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.300
a live game we've been calling it,
is everybody needs to be

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.700
there at the same time.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.770
And so what we've done is we've
actually developed a game that's

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.470
kind of a matchmaking type of thing.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.710
And with matchmaking,
what you find is you want to start

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.700
a match in a turn based game,
but there aren't really people there yet.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.400
Right?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.200
And it's asynchronous.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.550
So they can be filled in as necessary.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.530
So what happens in our
implementation is as you make

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.070
turns and you go around the game,
you're going to set the turn to a

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.680
participant who might not actually
have a player in the seat yet.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.800
And as it becomes their turn,
the matchmaker will find a person for

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.600
them and fit them into their slot.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600
So it will be their turn
and they will be able to go.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.600
This is really interesting because
it has the effect that every

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.600
time that I go and I create a
new match and I matchmake into it,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.550
it's my turn.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.710
As soon as I get a callback from
the matchmaker view controller,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.590
in this case it's a turn based
matchmaker view controller,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.590
it's my turn.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600
The other thing is to
talk about the control.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.040
So we've seen it go around the
table in a clockwise manner,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.600
but it doesn't have to.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.180
When you end your turn,
you say who the next participant

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.490
is and it can go in any direction.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.140
It can be the next person,
it can be the last person,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.460
it can be the person
across the table from me.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.500
We don't define that at all.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.500
And lastly, what we do support is we
support multiple matches.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.450
So you can have up to
15 matches at a time.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.420
Some of them is your turn,
some of them is somebody else's turn.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.890
Because of the asynchronous nature,
I'm going to go in one and I'm

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.500
going to send a notification to
the persons that I'm playing,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.400
to the person whose next turn it is,
and while I'm waiting for them,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.070
to return to me,
I can go and I can start another

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.310
game or I can make a move in a
game that I've been invited to,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.300
all sorts of instances like that.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.290
I'm going to show you a little bit
of what the UI that we're providing.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.910
So you would typically start your
game and here I have what we call a

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.300
turn based matchmaker view controller.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.300
And it really has two functions.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.760
And the first function is to
show you a list of the games that

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.300
you're currently involved in.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.140
Right?

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.080
The ones that are my turn,
there's three sections to this.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.130
The first section shows you the
games which require your action.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.190
So it's my turn.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.200
I have the ability to change
the state of the game.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.200
I have three games here.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.200
The first one is with Jessica.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.190
The second one with Eunice.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.200
And the third one is
an auto match player.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.120
It's a new game.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.170
I haven't started.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.200
It says when the last
turn of the game was.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.040
The second section is
the other player's turn.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.350
So if I'm in a multiplayer game and
there are other people sitting around,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.100
virtually sitting around,
playing the game,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.100
we can see when they made their turn,
whose turn it is, a little notification.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.080
And again, I've showed you an example
of an auto match player.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.100
So in this case,
I've actually made the first turn.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.460
And I'm waiting for somebody to
come and claim their spot so that

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.100
they can take the second turn.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.960
The third section in here is a game over.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.100
And you can see here we have a little
custom message which you can play.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.000
You can provide.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.000
So there were two different games there.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And we can show those.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.880
The second functionality,
if you notice right at

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.980
the top right-hand corner,
there's a plus button.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.000
And this will allow you
to create a new match.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And the view for the new match looks
very much similar to the P2P match maker.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.930
So you're all familiar with this.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.000
It allows you the ability
to invite somebody.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.840
Here I've invited my friend Eunice.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.390
It allows you to set slots as auto match.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.160
So this would be a three-person game
where Eunice would be second and an

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.770
auto match would be that empty seat.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.900
: This is really interesting.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.720
And lastly,
what we do is we provide some support in

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.720
the home page so that we badge your app
for you so you can easily -- your users

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.900
can easily see how many turns they have.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.860
In this case,
I have turns in two different matches.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:22.130
And we support the new notifications.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.980
So we can see here it's an
invite notification from Unus.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.000
Now what I'd like to do is bring
back Jordan Ceccarelli to the stage,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.220
our ace achievement hunter here,
to show us a little bit of how this

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.540
works in action with the game that
we've been showing all morning,

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.340
which is Rochambeau, Jordan,
how about it?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.390
All right.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.780
Turn-based games.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.610
Woo!

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.240
Exciting.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:46.860
Okay.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.940
So here we go.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.120
Many of you,
if you were in our other sessions,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.440
we did single player
and multiplayer games,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.660
may have wondered that we have
a badge here for Rochambeau.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.540
And this badge actually means that we
have two turns that are waiting us.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.660
So it's actually two games that are
waiting for us to make our move.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.450
So at a quick glance,
looking at the springboard, you can go,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.310
oh, okay, cool.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.540
We've got two turns.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.910
So here's our app.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.610
We're going to go into turn-based
because that's what we're

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.140
going to focus on right now.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.640
And here is the matchmaking screen
that Gabe was just talking about.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.210
And much like our other ones, you know,
it should look pretty familiar.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.130
It's got the green felt.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.850
You have the header up top, the icon.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.840
The awesome star rating so you can
actually have your game rated from this,

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.080
which is very cool.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.080
And now you've got your three sections.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.120
The top section is your turn.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.550
This is literally, you know,
they're playing checkers, chess.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.630
It's just waiting for you
to make the next move.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.580
The other player, you know,
they have their phone in their pocket.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.960
They're doing whatever they're doing,
and they're just waiting

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.940
for you to make a move.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:43.940
The second section here are
turns that you can make.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:43.940
They're just waiting
for you to make a move.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.940
The second section here are
turns that you can make a move.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:45.940
The second section here are
turns that you can make a move.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.940
And so you can see how many
outstanding games you have.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.940
And then finally we have
the game over section.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.940
And these are games
that you've completed.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.400
And this section, you know,
it's kind of up to you for what

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.940
you would like to show for this.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.850
It could be the board's last state.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.940
In this case, it's going to be just
replaying the Rochambeau game.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.380
Because, you know,
maybe you totally kicked butt and you

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.940
want to go back and watch it again.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.920
So let's go through these.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.940
Let's do one where it's my turn.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.400
So let's go through these.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:15.740
Let's do one where it's my turn.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.500
So someone has sent me a game here.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.780
I don't know what they've picked.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.490
Rock, paper, scissors, I'm not sure.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.020
So I'm feeling lucky.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.400
Let's go scissors.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.760
Looks like we both picked scissors
and I picked it a little faster.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.180
No, I picked it a little slower.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.780
Ugh, okay, I lost.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.260
I was getting excited on that one.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.260
So I've lost the crown on this one,
but it was a fun game.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.500
Losing sometimes is fun.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.300
So we go back to our turn-based
here and you can see that game

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.160
has been removed from your turn.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.380
The game is now over.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.380
It's done.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.260
So let's say for some reason I want
to show that game to my friend.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.670
Oh, you'd love to see this.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.010
I had this awesome tie.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.430
I thought I was going to win, but I lost.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.700
And your friend is like, oh, that's lame.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.300
But you're like,
you can show them at any point.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.240
So say you're done with that.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.590
You're done with that game.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.190
It's a harsh memory you don't
want to remember ever again.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.260
So you can come here and you can just
swipe the game and you can remove it.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.190
So this game is now gone.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.500
I don't have to relive this memory again.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.540
Likewise, let's say you've made a turn
and it's been on your friend,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.900
it's been a couple days,
you're trying to play a game with them,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.400
they don't want to play the
game anymore and you don't

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.100
want this on your list anymore.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.700
You can just slide and
actually resign from the game.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.900
The same goes for ones
where it's your turn,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.730
you can just slide there
and quit from the game.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.300
So let's create a game.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.710
So here we have our
regular matchmaking screen.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.690
You can invite a friend.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.060
You can auto match.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.650
You can add players
here by selecting this.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.910
You can remove players.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.660
Let's say we want to get in a scenario
where you want to invite one player

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.350
and you want to auto match one player.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.100
You can customize this how you want.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.090
In this case, for a single auto match,
this is going to place me up against

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.100
another player who is also looking
for a two-player auto match game.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.930
The neat thing about turn-based games
that a live game won't have is the

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.100
concept of always being your turn.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.090
What does that mean?

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.040
In this case, when you create a game,
guess what?

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.950
When you create the game,
you're making the very first move.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.100
It's always your turn.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.100
When you want to make a game, boom,
your turn.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.100
Your friend doesn't get notified
when you create this game.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.430
Because then your friend gets
the notification and then what?

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.100
Then they wait around and that's no fun.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.480
Your friend is actually going
to get the notification after

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.100
you've made your first turn.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.100
Your friend gets the notification, hey,
do you want to play Rochambeau?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.100
You're like, okay, cool.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.640
When you click on it, guess what?

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.980
It's your turn as that player.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.100
And so it eliminates the waiting,
trying to get your friends together,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.010
like, oh, let's wait for this person.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.530
He's finishing dinner.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.870
This guy is playing Xbox.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.100
We want everyone to get together at once.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.100
This is just you make the game,
you make the move, you send it off,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.470
and when the other player gets it,
guess what?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.050
It's their turn.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.100
They're good to go.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.040
So we're going to send, let's say,
our friend Eunice.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.100
We'll send a match.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.070
Hey, let's play.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.350
So we hit play now, but again,
they're not receiving

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.500
any notification of this.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.050
In a live game, they would have.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.490
So in this case, I'm going to pick paper
because I like paper.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.600
And now we're back here at the menu.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.710
I can move on with my life.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.900
I can go to another game.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.380
I can go to another turn-based game.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.150
And this will wait until
Unix makes their move.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.660
And in this game,
if Unix makes their move,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.360
it'll immediately cut to the
game so I can see in real

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.240
time what actually happened,
and then I can go back

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.610
and watch it again.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.280
So with that sheet, you can, once again,
play your games that are

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.830
waiting for your turn.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.700
You can see your games that
you're waiting for their turn,

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.560
and you can rewatch games you've played.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.920
You can delete them at will as well.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.580
You can resign.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.320
Turn-based games is very exciting.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.190
I'm really, really, much like Gabe,
looking forward to playing some of these.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.020
It's new for Game Center in iOS 5.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.790
Right on, guys.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.500
We're really looking forward to that.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.630
So thanks a lot.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.810
Gabe, back to you.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.020
Take it away.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.760
Thank you.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:17:28.700
[Transcript missing]

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.470
I'm trying to follow the flow
that Christy did in the Ready,

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.230
Set, Go, but it's not exactly the same.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.730
But here we go.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.440
You want to start a match,
you need to pick players in a match,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.640
and there's a few different
ways that we can do this.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.840
You can use our matchmaking UI.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.720
You can bring it up from in-game.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.720
You can hit play from Game Center.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.590
That works for turn-based gaming as well.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.630
And a user can accept an invite.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.640
So they're not really
deciding who's in the game,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.280
but somebody's invited them
to a game that already exists.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.180
Once you have the players,
there's a few different ways

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.900
that you can get the match.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.010
Did find match,
which is a delegate callback

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.900
on the view controller,
which I'll show you on the next slide.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.340
There's load match data.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.190
So if you have the match ID,
maybe you created your own UI.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.440
But if you have a match ID that you know,
you can load the match

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.520
directly using that.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.370
And you want to take your turn,
which is end turn.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.900
So you're going to be passing the
turn around to different folks.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.760
They'll see the updated match data.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.830
They'll see your message.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.900
They'll be able to make
some action on the game.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.380
And they'll end turns.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.400
And this will go on until
the end of the game,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.980
at which point you have
basically three exits.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.830
You can quit, whether it's your turn or
whether it's not your turn.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.830
There's a few different subtleties there.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.340
If it's your turn,
you hold the baton and you need

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.840
to pass it off to somebody.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.830
Otherwise, it's dead in the water.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.380
And you can end the match.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.700
So ending the match basically
ends it for everybody.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.560
I just won.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.500
Everybody else is done.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.500
So these are the different -- I'm
going to try to do them in order.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.000
All the different sort of activities,
tasks that we can do.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.140
We talked about the view controller.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:06.840
You've seen it.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.660
I just want to reiterate before
I show you how to use it.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.400
You use this in your game so
that you can allow your user

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.160
to choose a match to play.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.500
They can quit from the match.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.100
They can remove a match from the list.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.040
They can do all those kind of
management stuff of their game lists.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.100
There's the ability
to create a new match.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:26.100
Right?

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.440
And we've seen we can
do that using invites.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.440
And we can also use auto match.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.110
And I'll show you both of those.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.600
So this is how you can
use the view controller.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.600
The first thing, it's kind of a repeat.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.540
You've seen the match request.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.790
I'm not going to go
over the match request.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.870
But it's exactly the same
match request that we used for

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.160
P2P and hosted multiplayer.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.930
So the properties on there
that you're most interested in,

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.700
it would be the minimum player.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.200
The maximum number of players.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.200
Right?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.300
You want to initialize
the view controller.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.870
In this case,
it's clearly differentiated.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.500
It's called a turn-based
matchmaker view controller.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.000
So this is for turn-based only.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.690
You initialize it with the match request.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.540
The next couple of lines,
this one is interesting.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.820
Show existing matches.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.860
So we've seen that there's two screens.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.770
Or there's sort of like two screens.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.140
The first one is the list
of all the matches that

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.070
you're currently involved in.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.300
And the second one is
more of a -- you know,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.340
more of a creation.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.610
So to create a new match or to
get matched into a new match.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.020
To get auto matched.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.270
And so we allow you the ability through
some of the APIs to generate your own

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.100
lists and you can create your own UI.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.450
But if you want to use our UI,
just set that property

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.000
on the view controller.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.620
Show existing matches.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.910
And that will bring up
the list of matches.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.850
There's a delegate.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.830
It's a turn-based matchmaker.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:56.060
Should be turn-based matchmaker
view controller for you.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:57.120
Right.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.350
And I'm going to go over the delegate
callbacks on the next screen and

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.930
then present the view controller.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:07.020
So this is all very similar to what
we've seen earlier if you've been here.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:12.670
Or you've created any P2P games
using Game Center in the past.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.740
So here's the delegate callbacks.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.200
There's four of them.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.400
The first one is the one that
we're most interested in.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.740
I did find match.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.830
So you will get this whenever
the user selects a match.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.930
This is, you know, it's my turn.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.780
I want to go.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.290
It's the end of the game.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.730
I want you to replay it or I've
just created a new game or just

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.790
been matched into a new game.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.260
So the first thing I do is
I dismiss the controller.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:41.680
Right?

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.580
And then the second thing I do is I'm
checking to see whether it's my turn.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.660
Because if it's my turn, right,
I show the state of the game.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.460
I missed that, right?

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.570
So you want to update your UI.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.150
This is the match that the
player is interested in.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.360
Show the board.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.620
Show the, you know,
it's totally your game.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.190
So I can't...

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.000
You can't fathom yet
what's going to be there.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.980
And this will give you a
quick way to check to see.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.350
So what I'm doing is I'm
taking the current player ID,

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.640
right, and I'm checking to see if
there actually is one because

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.630
it might be on a matching slot,
in which case there's no player ID.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.910
And if there is one,
I'm comparing it to the

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.750
local player's player ID,
which would be the person

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.440
who's logged in on the device.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.200
And that way you can tell
whether it's my turn.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.060
If it's my turn, I want to go.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.520
So allow user actions,
allow me to submit my turn,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.410
whatever it needs to be in your
game for me to actually go.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:42.000
The second view controller delegate
callback is player quit for match.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.450
This one I'm not going to go into too
much details now other than showing it.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.030
But when I talk about quitting
later on in the session,

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.290
I'll revisit this one.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.300
So because we have this concept
of it's always one person's turn,

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.980
you can think of it as there's a
baton that you're passing around

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.300
the different participants.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:05.680
And if I'm holding the baton and I quit,
right, then the game's pretty much dead

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.580
in the water unless I have an
opportunity to pass it off as I quit.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.310
And so that's exactly what this is.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.010
Participant quit in turn.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.990
So I give myself a match outcome.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.450
Maybe it's just quit.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.520
I define who the next participant is.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.220
Who should get the turn?

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.290
And if there's any updated state,
so maybe I have to remove

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.760
my pieces from the board,
that kind of thing,

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.170
I have the ability to do it here.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.240
But I'll go into a little
bit more detail later.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.460
This is the callback that we expect.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.050
And this will actually remain in our UI.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:36.440
Right?

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.330
So you're still in our UI.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.190
They swipe.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.750
They quit.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.010
You get the callback.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.820
You quit the game.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.140
And then we go back to our UI.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.180
We stay in our UI.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.020
You shouldn't necessarily
dismiss -- in fact,

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.660
you shouldn't dismiss the
view controller at this point.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.390
So the first thing is if I cancel,
I decide that I don't want to look at a

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.390
game or I just wanted to look at my games
but I don't really want to play any,

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.620
there's a cancel button in
the top left-hand corner.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.940
And you should handle this
just by dismissing the

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.550
controller is probably best.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.660
And then the last one
is there's a failure.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.880
Maybe you're not online and I tried
to create a new game or -- I mean,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.790
there's a few different cases there.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.000
But you'd want to handle the error,
dismiss the view controller,

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.120
go back to your menu,
go back to whatever the

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.020
user was doing before.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.930
you brought up the view controller.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.440
So invites.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.500
Here you can see I've invited Eunice.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.610
I haven't pressed play yet.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.230
Invites, as Jordan mentioned before,
are also asynchronous.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.320
So unlike P2P where we've seen
it goes through this phase where

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.590
I send an invite to somebody,
they respond to it,

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.510
we go through a connecting phase,
and it's not until everybody's ready

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.030
that I can start to play the game.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.300
In this case, I'm inviting Eunice.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.660
She'll be attached to the game.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.340
She'll get the invite when it's her turn.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.440
She'll get a notification.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.520
But it means that when I press play now,
I'm going to get a match back.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.570
It's going to be my turn.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.190
I'm going to go.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:59.190
Right?

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.660
There's one sort of caveat declining.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.160
If somebody decides that they're
going to decline an invite,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.170
since they only get the
invite on their turn,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.000
they're stuck holding the baton.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.920
And there's really not much that we
can do at that point because they

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.940
might have declined because they
don't have the application installed.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.660
They might be on an iOS 4.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:18.160
device.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.160
I mean, there's a few reasons for that.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.420
And we can't guarantee at that point that
we're going to be able to give control

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.060
back to the developer so that they
can choose where the baton should go.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.320
It's unfortunate,
but it's the nature of turn-based games.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.120
Here what I've done is I've
updated this a little bit.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.790
You can see what happens
after the invite.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.760
This would be the match that
would be returned to me.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.140
Right?

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.320
So it's match 001.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.410
It's really a UUID,
but just so that I can keep

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.620
the slides differentiated.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.800
The current participant
in this case is me.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.280
I'm the local player ID.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.430
I just started the game.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.120
I have an invited player ID,
and their status is invited.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.790
So they haven't responded to this yet.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.880
It's my turn.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.540
I can go.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.790
When I go,
I'm going to decide I'm going to change

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:07.020
the current participant so the next
participant will be the invited person,

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.180
and they'll actually get the invite.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.840
The other way we can
support is matchmaking.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.090
So auto match.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.700
Right?

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.580
Well, I just leave the slot open.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:17.580
I don't invite anybody.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.940
And they'll get filled in.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.540
Since it's asynchronous and
that person doesn't actually get

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.580
filled in until it's necessary,
the same scenario happens.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.310
I'll get a match back.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.780
It will be my turn.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.370
I can go.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.320
We'll fill in the slots as necessary.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.510
One other thing that might actually
happen here is I might get matched

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.840
into a game that's already ongoing,
in which case I would be

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.580
that auto matched player.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.120
Right?

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.540
But in all cases,
it's my turn when I get this match back.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:47.540
Right?

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.540
You obviously can do this.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.540
You can have up to 16 people.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.440
You can have some invited,
some auto matched.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.540
It works really great.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.120
Whenever I set the next
participant to a match,

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.540
to an auto match player,
our services will find a player for that.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.400
For that seat.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.430
And it kind of looks like this.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:09.540
So the other one, I had the second player
was actually Eunice.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.350
I invited her.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.540
She had a player ID.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.540
In this case, there's no player ID,
and it's just status of matching.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.500
It's a second match.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.500
Distinguished a little bit.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.420
And the status on the match is
matching instead of being open.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.500
What happens is as I'm going through,
I'll make the next turn,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.500
and the server will find
somebody for that person.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:30.500
Right?

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.500
So now I have a remote player ID.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.500
He's active.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.500
It's his turn.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.290
He's just been returned.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.500
And the status on the match becomes open.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.500
So this will make more sense as I go
through some of the other code pieces.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:47.400
The next thing that I need to
talk about is event handling.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.790
three different types of events.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.900
Invites from Game Center.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.870
So we've seen that.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.030
If I'm looking at a friend's
games list and I have,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.530
you know, I decide I want to play him,
I'll play him.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.350
We'll send you a notification.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.360
We'll send you kind of notification,
but you'll get a call back on

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.460
one of the delegates that says,
I want to invite these people.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.540
Turn notifications.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:15.110
So if you've been invited and you
accept the invite or it's an ongoing

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.380
game and the turn comes back to me,
there's a notification.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.630
This one will actually have a
notification in the notification

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.440
center and a call back for you.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.830
Similarly, once the game is over.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.980
So when I end the game,
a notification goes out to

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.580
all the participants in the
game that the game is over.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.970
So they have the ability to look
at the resolution of the game.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.920
And I'll show you some.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.880
Some of the event handler delegates.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.400
The first one is handle
invite from Game Center.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.810
So this is very similar
to getting a player,

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.370
a list of players, right?

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.420
You get a list of,
you get an NSArray of players to invite.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.270
You start with a match request.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:58.440
The difference is you attach
that players to invite that

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.970
array to the match request.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.740
And you initialize a view controller
in the same manner that you did before.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.790
In this case, what I've done is I've.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.870
Show existing matches no,
because the user is clearly

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.090
in shown his intention that
he wants to invite somebody.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:20.970
So I can skip the first screen,
go right to the match creation screen.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.920
I set myself as the delegate so I can
handle the callbacks and I present it.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.950
So the user will see it.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.550
The next notification that you'll get,
the next callback you'll get is

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.440
a handle turn event for match.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.850
So this means that a turn
is now available for you.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.040
And it could be in any one
of the outstanding matches.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.100
And it won't be the greatest user
experience if I'm in the middle of one

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.960
match and I get a turn notification
for the other match and you pull

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.040
the rug out from underneath me.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.660
So what I'm doing here is I'm
checking just to see whether the

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:05.480
match that I'm looking at is the
same one as I just got a callback on.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.300
Right?

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.510
If it is,
then what I can do is I can update the

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.260
state in real time that I'm looking at.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.460
Otherwise, maybe I want to delay
presenting that to the user.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.960
Maybe I'll want him to
pick it from a list.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:21.220
Maybe I just want to notify him
that there's a turn somewhere else,

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.920
right?

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:26.580
If it is, I'm going to want to update the
match that I'm currently holding

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.330
because there's new data there.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.330
It's my turn,
so I want to update the UI and

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.950
I want to allow turn submission.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.270
So that means allowing
actions in your game,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.900
in your UI that will allow me to

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.590
Do what I need to do
to make the next turn.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.270
Handle match ended.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.440
Same thing.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.100
I'm just checking to see whether it's
the match that I'm currently looking at.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.250
If it is, then I can show the
resolution right away.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.040
Otherwise, maybe I want to delay it,
depending on where I am

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.330
in the state of your app.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:07.920
Those are the three delegates that
you're going to need to implement.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.010
Here's a little bit more
details about the actual class.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.900
So it's a GK turn-based match and
these are the properties it has.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.400
So it has a match ID I've
talked about before.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.330
It's a UUID.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.700
There's a creation date so you
know when the game has started.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.490
We show this.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:28.050
You can use this in your own
UI if you're creating your own UI.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.590
Indication of when...

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.400
helps the player maybe decide which
game it is that they want to look at.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.910
There's an array of participants.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.240
There's a status.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.320
There's a current participant.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.540
That's the one whose turn it is.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.720
Match data,
which is the state of the game.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.880
We store in our servers for you.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.840
And there's a custom message.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.430
So that custom message gets
passed with the notifications on

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.280
turns and at the end of a game.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.220
And then there's the GK turn-based
participant and the properties player ID,

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.040
which might not be there
if it's a matching.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.830
The last turn date,
if they've ever made a turn.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.600
It will timestamp it when the last
turn that that participant made.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.950
The status, which could be active or
done or matching or invited,

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.430
those kind of things.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.740
And a match outcome,
which we can use to show on our

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.400
UI and you can use to show on your UI.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.960
So submitting a turn.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.560
This is, you know, primarily the meet.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.110
So it's my turn.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.560
I've gotten the state of the data.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.500
I want to update it.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:31.740
I want to pass it to somebody.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.150
So the first thing I do is
I update the match data.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:40.760
This is a function that you're going to
create because the match data is yours.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.460
It represents the state of the game.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.310
The players are on the board.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.420
Those kind of things, right?

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.850
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to pick our next participant.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.450
I've just shown you a simple
example here of actually picking

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.950
the next one in the list.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.040
So I get the index in the
array of participants,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:57.670
right?

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.920
I add one, mod it so that it goes
around in a circle,

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.980
and that's the next person.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.920
What you'd really want to do
is in a more advanced case,

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.020
you'd want to look to see if the
status of that player is appropriate.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.310
If somebody who's quit,
you don't want to give the

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.610
turn to somebody who quit.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.140
That's going to be an error.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.130
But it's pretty simple.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:24.520
The next participant has to be an object
that comes from that participant's array.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.380
Otherwise, it's an error.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.500
And then I set a custom message.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.840
Finally, once I've set all the
parameters that I need,

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.840
I call end turn with next participant.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.200
Defining who the next participant is,
match data,

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.760
define what the new match data is.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.500
This is going to be sent up to
our servers and stored there.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.290
And a completion handler.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.840
So when it's done,
if there are any errors,

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.460
maybe my match data was too big,
we limit it to 4K.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.290
Maybe the next participant
doesn't make sense.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.740
Maybe it's not even my turn.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.460
So those are some of the
errors that you might get back.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:06.100
Now I'm going to show you what the
match looks like after I've made a turn.

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:10.870
So you can see the first match
that I was playing with Eunice.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.460
There's my custom
message that I just set.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.400
There's my match data that
gets associated to it.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.230
And now the current participant
is pointing at her because

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.600
I just set it to her.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.060
So when she downloads,
she'll get a notification.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.400
The match will get loaded.

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:28.160
This is what she'll say.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.900
It's her turn only from her perspective.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.140
She'll be the local user.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.440
So a little bit on turn flow.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.240
I showed you the diagram at the beginning
where you saw it turn around on a clock.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.760
But essentially we've been
talking about this baton.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.700
So the match data and
the next participant,

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.100
sort of the keys, can only be set by the
current participant.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:55.510
If you try to do an end turn or an
end game and it's not your turn,

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.340
you'll get an error back.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.900
That's really what turn-based gaming is.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.340
One person has control at a
time and they pass it around.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.600
The next participant can
be set to any participant.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.120
You can even set it to yourself.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.140
If you want to make a turn
and then make another turn,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.100
okay.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.040
I'm sure there's use cases for that.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.180
I can set it to the person on my right,
the person on my left, anyone.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.670
Anyone in that participant array.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.480
Of course,
if I set it to somebody who's matching,

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.300
that's an indication
that when you upload it,

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.840
we need to find somebody who's
going to match to that spot.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.210
So we're going to find the next
person who's going to come in,

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.260
who matches, to match those parameters,
and give that back to him and

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.760
it's his turn or her turn.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.740
So that's turn flow.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.630
But the focus here is that there's
really only one person that can make

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.840
changes to the match at any one time.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.990
And the flexibility of the
changes that they can make.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:55.400
Match data.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.460
It's in NSData.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.850
It's stored on our servers.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.740
It's defined by you.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.200
It's interpreted by you.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.780
We treat it sort of like an opaque blob
that we pass around with the match.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.560
It's limited to 4K.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.440
So you're going to need to
be a little bit creative on

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.800
how you can store this data.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.960
Some examples,
player positions around a board,

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.280
what their last turns were.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.940
If you don't find that
there's enough space,

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:27.360
you can use this as a pointer to your
own server if you need more than 4K.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.480
One of the things that we might suggest
is you can use it as a pointer to

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.910
some static data already in your app.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.690
And this is the cool thing about
being stored on the server is that it

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.080
can be retrieved on multiple devices.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.400
So if I'm playing a game and I start
it on my iPad and I leave my house

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.780
and I get a notification on my phone,
oh, this is cool.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.790
I'm riding the bus to work.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.930
And I can take a turn.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.940
So I do.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.460
Right?

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.100
And it loads the data and it
gives me an updated state of

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.410
what's really going on now.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.000
And it's cross-device.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.430
So that's pretty cool.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.840
Quitting a match.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.900
So we've done the turns, right?

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.340
We've updated the state.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.600
We've shown how you can
pass the baton around.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.520
And now I actually -- okay, I'm done.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.240
I'm over with, right?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.110
Quitting a match is one of the
ways that you can end your game,

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.240
sort of abandoning it.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.480
And there's three different
ways that you can affect a quit.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.870
Quitting from a match
when it's your turn.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.130
So there's API calls for the first two.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.070
And then there's a callback
for the second one.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:35.700
Quitting a match when it's not your turn,
when somebody else is in the match turn.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.800
And then finally quitting
the match from the UI.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.020
That's -- I made
reference to that before.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.300
I showed you the slide.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.700
But I'll actually talk about what
the different parameters mean.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:48.250
You might be a little bit
more familiar with it now.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.170
It's a callback from our UI.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.220
So you can quit from our UI.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.270
If you've implemented our UI.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.630
So, quitting a turn.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.430
It's my turn, I have the baton.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:00.730
I don't really want to play anymore,
but I don't want to cause

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.340
the rest of the match to die.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.660
So, I'm going to pass it off to somebody.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.190
Right?

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:08.870
And so, what I have to do now is I have
to determine what the data is.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.940
So, the new match data, update it.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.010
I have to pick the next participant.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:17.030
I have a little function called choose
next participant from the match.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.440
And I call participant
quit in turn with outcome.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.470
So, I'm giving myself an outcome of quit.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.900
GK turn-based match outcome quit.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.610
But there are a few others you can use.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.240
Lose, for example.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.150
Next participant,
who I define who gets the

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:38.240
baton next and who has the
ability to make the next move.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.120
And updated match data.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.440
It gets sent to our server.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.820
It's a completion handler.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.850
I suppose you should handle the
error if there is one because you're

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.330
offline or it's not your turn.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.550
Those kind of things.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.940
And the play can continue without you.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.310
What you'll see in what the match
looks like I'll show you in a

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:03.310
minute after I go through the
other two methods of quitting.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.500
So quitting out of your turn.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.740
Really not much you can do, right?

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.880
You don't have control of the board.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.310
You don't have control of the game.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.060
You can't change the status of the game.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.300
You can't change the data on the game.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.500
You can't change whose turn it is.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.420
All you can really do,
this is kind of like an abandon, right?

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.650
So what you can do in this case is you
can set yourself to a match outcome.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.770
You can quit the game.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:28.770
And it's really simple.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.900
And of course the last one is
probably the most complex one,

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.900
right, is the callback.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.780
So this is a delegate callback on
the matchmaker view controller,

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.740
on the turn-based
matchmaker view controller.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.300
It's called player quit for match.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.140
So this indicates that
the player actually quit.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.990
So I brought down the UI and there was
one of the sections that was my turn and

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.420
I don't want to play this game anymore,
so I swipe and I press quit.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.800
Well, you're holding the baton.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.460
You need to pass it off as you do this.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.050
So we give you that ability.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.620
We'll call you back,
player quit for match.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.620
And essentially what you have to
do is as if you were making a turn

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.520
or you were quitting from turn,
it's exactly the same thing.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.340
You have to define what the
new match date is going to be.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.150
You have to choose an ex-participant
and you call participant

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.240
quit in turn without count.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.160
If you don't implement this,
then it's going to be a poor

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.300
UI experience because somebody
is going to swipe to quit.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.190
We'll call you back, you ignore it,
and the person never actually quits.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.200
So we give you that ability.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.060
If somebody actually quits from the game,
maybe you've implemented it so that

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.650
they have to load it and quit it.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.110
We suggest you implement this.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.980
It's not all that difficult to do.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.920
And here you can see the
parameters on this were next

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.500
participant and match data.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.110
So quite simple.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.020
This is what the match will
look like after you quit.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.260
So the local player is done,
not involved in the game anymore,

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:54.110
and my status, my match outcome was quit.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.900
And I passed it off.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:01.080
So I guess this would be Eunice, right?

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.760
Would have the ability to choose,
you know,

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.450
does she want to continue the game?

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.340
If it makes sense, if there are multiple
people in the match,

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.320
it certainly does.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.160
In a two-player match,
maybe your quit is really an end match,

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.410
but that's okay.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.950
You have that kind of flexibility, right?

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.770
And so lastly,
the last kind of task that you would need

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:26.680
to accomplish for this is ending a match.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:26.680
Right?

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.160
Again, you need the baton to be
able to end the match,

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.760
right?

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.860
So only the current participant,
if your local player is

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.150
the current participant,
then they will be able to end the match.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.940
You need to set outcomes for everybody.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.200
The game is going to be over.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.980
There really is no next
participant after this.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:47.280
It will show up in the game
over section for everybody.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.620
And a notification is going to be
sent to all the other participants.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.740
I'm not going to send
a notification myself.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:56.860
Doesn't make too much sense.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.860
And this is what it looks like.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.890
So the first thing I do
is I'm setting outcomes.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.800
There's a match outcome,
which we've seen is a property

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.400
on one of the participants.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:09.000
In this case,
I'm just setting everybody to tied.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.060
It's really simple, just for an example,
but you really want to

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.170
set the appropriate one.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.920
Whether somebody won,
whether somebody lost,

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:20.000
it's a bit field and there's
even a section there for you

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:21.800
to be able to set your own.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.440
Custom outcome that you can use
if you're creating your own UI or

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.670
you want to present in your game.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.410
I need to resolve the game because
this is the last chance that

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.150
I have to set what the data state
is going to be for the game.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.020
Everybody will see this as
a result of a notification.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.560
Anybody who loads this game
who was a participant in it.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.350
So this is really the
last possible thing.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.870
And I have one more
opportunity to set a message.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.800
This is an end game message.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.160
So game is over.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.410
What you've seen in our demo
case is press here to see the

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.920
match outcome as an example.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.540
And I call end match in turn.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.220
There is no end match out of turn.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.500
You have to be your turn.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.410
With a completion handler and the
same kind of errors that you would get

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.940
from any of the other submission type.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:45:32.600
[Transcript missing]

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.720
Exactly, right?

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:35.800
Demos.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:40.340
When you're in Game Center and you're
looking at somebody's list and you see

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.590
a game and you want to play against them
and you both have the game installed,

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.850
you can press play and as you
bring up the view controller,

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.650
it will automatically
have selected that person.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.020
That's actually kind of neat.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.580
So if you guys are going
to do customizations,

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:00.760
I didn't show it to you here,
but the documentation

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.380
is quite good on this.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.440
There's a few methods that you can use
so that you can provide your own UI.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.640
You can list matches.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.970
You can load individual matches.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.760
They will just give you a summary of the
match IDs and the participants in them.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.300
You can create your own UI.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.720
I think if anybody was
watching the Game Essentials,

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.490
they did a little bit with
this app called Word for Word.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.400
They're also replaying on Friday.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.540
Suggest you go there if you're
really interested in writing games.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:30.390
They've done some custom UI for this.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.500
You can determine the
state of the matches.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.390
So you can look at the
state of the match.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:38.180
You can see whether it's matching,
whether it's open, whether it's ended.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.040
So you can use those kind of parameters.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.260
When you're creating your UI, custom UI.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.170
The only caveat that we say
is if you want to create a new

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:51.820
match that includes invites,
then you need to use

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.960
our invite controller.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.310
So the GK turn-based
matchmaker view controller.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:01.600
If you don't want us to do the list,
you can just set that property,

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.440
show existing matches to no,
and just use it for invites.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.440
There's also a function.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:12.440
A method on GK turn-based match that
will allow you to do a quick auto

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.870
match without any UI involved at all.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.470
Just give it a match
request and we're done.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:22.880
So as a sort of a summary,
just to cover what we've

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.640
talked about before,
I showed you all the UI.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.260
We showed a demo of it.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.610
Hope you're all really excited
to go out and use these things.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.790
I showed you what events
you need to handle,

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:39.100
how to create matches, how to make turns,
how to quit and end games.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.030
It's all really cool.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.350
Most of these sessions,
I didn't know about the repeats,

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.540
but most of these sessions
were early in this morning.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.440
They're here mostly so when
you review this and you're

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.240
looking for more material,
because I think that they're

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.580
going to release all the slides
and videos in a few weeks,

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.420
you'll know what to refer to.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:01.560
The introduction that was
done by Nate Tuesday is being

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.740
repeated Friday morning.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:08.280
And also repeated Friday morning
is the two game essentials that

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.530
I think Graham is providing.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.760
Those are really cool.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.660
Lastly, if you have any questions,
then we're not here.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:20.160
You can talk to our evangelist,
Alan Shaver.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.530
This is his email address.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:23.170
And dev forums.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.020
We follow the forums.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:26.140
We respond to the forums.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.400
It's a great place to do that.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.730
- Thank you.

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:35.360
Be able to talk to us other than here,
but really I encourage everybody to

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:42.580
come downstairs this afternoon and
talk to us directly because that's...

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.040
That's what we love the most.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:44.810
Thank you for coming.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.100
Hope you enjoyed it.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.700
I hope you're going to create
some awesome games for us.
