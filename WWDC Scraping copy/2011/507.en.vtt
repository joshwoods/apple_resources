WEBVTT

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.260
Hi everybody, welcome to WWDC.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.430
My name is Alan Cannistraro,
I'm the engineering manager for iBooks.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.920
And today we're going to teach you how
to make beautiful books using HTML5,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.300
CSS3 and EPUB.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.960
We're going to show you how to take your
books far beyond what you can do in print

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.500
and add features like audio and video.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.860
We'll talk about how to add animation.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.700
And at the end of the talk today,
we're going to show you a feature that

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.300
nobody has seen before with iBooks 1.3.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
Before we dive in,
let me talk about books for a moment.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.010
Books have been around
for thousands of years.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.940
They were invented by the Romans.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.170
They are

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.120
A record of our human history.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.110
They're a collection of all
of our accumulated knowledge.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
A book can tell a story.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.700
It can take you to another world.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.680
Books have changed the course of history,
politics and religion.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.080
A good book is engaging
and hard to put down.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.130
The last innovation with books
was 650 years ago when Gutenberg

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.460
invented the printing press and
brought books to the masses.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.780
Well, in the last two years,
we've seen something very new

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.240
and that's the advent of digital
books on devices like the iPad,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.380
the iPhone and the iPod Touch.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.440
Now, people can take thousands of
books with them in their pocket

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.840
or in their bags and they can read
them anywhere they want to go.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.180
We're going to show you today
how to make these books.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.170
So let's talk about
digital books for a moment.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.950
This is a graph of the digital book
market over the last nine years.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.880
As you can see,
digital books were around about

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.420
nine years ago and even before,
but it wasn't until the last

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.880
year or two that we've actually
started to see this take off.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.160
But in 2011,
the digital book market is expected

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.900
to grow to one billion dollars.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.190
Anyway, so... Thank you, thank you.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.630
So, some of you are publishers here today
and you're trying to figure out,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.030
well, how is this digital book revolution
going to change your industry

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.310
and how do you get into that?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.800
And we'll show you.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.570
And some of you are web developers that
want to learn how to take your skills,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.000
which are completely
valid in this new world,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.340
and how do you take a piece of this
gigantic monetary action that's

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.800
growing at a tremendous pace.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.650
And we'll show you how to make
your books better than the rest.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.790
You've seen books that look like this.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.980
These are text-centric books
that flow from page to page.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.460
We're going to show you how to
take text-centric books and make

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.160
them look beautiful on the iPad,
the iPhone and the iPod

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.730
Touch inside of iBooks.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.380
We're going to show you how to
add style and visual treatment,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.220
how to add audio and video and fonts
to give your text some character.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.110
We'll show you some new
features around this as well.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.520
But did you know that digital
books can also look like this?

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.500
Or like this.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.890
These are called fixed layout
books and are new to iBooks.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.210
With fixed layout books you
can bleed from edge to edge.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.200
All the things that used to
be only available in high

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.520
quality color printing presses,
you can now do inside of digital books.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.040
And we're going to show
you how again today.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.090
And we'll show you how to go beyond
just what you can do with print

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.390
and make your books come alive.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.860
So the first question I want to
answer for you is why make a book?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.500
And the answer I have for you is content.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.180
You want to focus on content
when you're creating a book,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.660
not code.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.170
And with iBooks, you have all kinds of
beautiful stylizing options.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.360
Books are based on standard technologies.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.400
So what does that mean for you?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.770
Well, one, they're easy to create.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.350
There are lots of tools available.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.160
And they're based on top of WebKit.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.180
So all of the techniques that
you've learned this week with

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.860
WebKit can be taken over to books.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.880
And because this is based on standards,
your books when authored once for iBooks

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.380
will also work in several other readers.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.360
Anyone can publish a book.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.510
There are, like I said,
many tools available, but none required.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.640
And finally,
one advantage of making a book over, say,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.600
a website, is that books can
travel with your reader.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.990
They take it with them in their pocket,
on their iPad, on their phones,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.760
and they can pick up anywhere they want.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.430
They can be on a bus, in a car,
hopefully not driving,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.800
and they don't need an internet
connection unlike a website.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.960
So let's talk about iBooks.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.000
Most of you probably know
iBooks is Apple's reader app.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.880
And it's the most fully featured
digital book reader on the market.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.240
It allows you to have visually rich
images and layout like the books

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.490
that I just showed you images of.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.200
We of course give you the ability to
add audio and video to your books.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.760
And with iBooks, the store is just on the
backside of the bookshelf.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.770
Your reader doesn't even have
to leave the app in order to

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.610
go buy your next best seller.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.900
So we'll teach you a few things today.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.520
Number one, how to build an EPUB.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.800
EPUB is the standard
building block of books.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.970
Number two, we'll talk about how
to build flowing books.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.430
And flowing books are the text-centric
books that I talked about earlier.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.550
We'll give you techniques for
taking HTML and CSS and make

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.840
them beautiful inside of iBooks.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.920
We'll show you how to enhance your
books with audio and video and also

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.160
how to include fonts so that you
can give your text some character.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.820
And we'll show you a feature
called non-linear documents.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.860
Non-linear documents allow your readers
to break out of the linearity of a

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.260
book and give them content that's
usually relegated to the appendix.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.680
We'll show you how to
embed those in the book,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.330
give your users a way to get to that
content and then quickly get back to

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.760
where they were in their reading order.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.540
Finally, we'll show you how to
make a fixed layout book.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.200
The fixed layout book are
the picture-heavy books

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.600
that I showed you earlier.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.850
We'll show you how to use
CSS to precisely place

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.540
your elements on the page.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.400
And we'll show you how to go
far beyond the print experience.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.290
To talk about EPUB,
I want to introduce you

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.670
Casey Dougherty from the iBookstore.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.540
Thanks, Al.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.240
A little water to get me going.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.800
Hey everyone, I'm Casey.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.480
I'm on the iBookstore team.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.540
And today I'm going to teach you
how you can make books for iBooks.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.540
Now, as Al said,
EPUB is the building block for iBooks.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.960
So to teach you how to make a book,
I'm going to start by teaching you EPUB.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.460
I'll show you the contents of EPUB.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.360
I'll also show you how you can
define a reading order and a

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.460
table of contents for your EPUB.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.350
And then finally,
we'll look at how you can

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.710
customize the iBooks experience.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.300
An EPUB is web technology.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:07.430
In an EPUB you'll see HTML, CSS,
XHTML and XML.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.980
In fact, you can think of an EPUB as a
website that has been bundled

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.910
together for distribution and
given the extension of .epub.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.000
In fact,
if you look at an EPUB's file structure,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.860
it looks very much like a website.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.200
Inside the EPUB is an OEBPS folder
and a meta-INF folder.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.830
The OEBPS folder is the open ebook
packaging structure and it contains

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.940
all of the content of your book.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.350
In this case, we're seeing web content,
that's XHTML and CSS,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.400
that's the content of your book
and the style for your book.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:51.800
There's also a lot of media,
including images, video, audio and fonts.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.500
And then in addition to this
standard web content is also

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.230
three EPUB specific XML files.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.430
This is the OPF file,
the NCX file and the

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.860
Apple Display Options file,
which we've abbreviated as ADO here.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:13.440
Now the OPF and the NCX file are
crucial to your EPUB structure.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.870
So I'm going to start
by teaching you those.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.960
The OPF file is the open packaging
format file for your book and in it

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.280
contains the metadata for your book,
this is all the information

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.320
about your book,
a manifest that lists all of the

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.910
files that make up your book,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.840
A spine, which defines the reading
linear order of your book.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.040
And also the guide, which identifies the
key files of your book.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.030
This is the key structure.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.320
Now,
metadata may not sound like much fun,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.840
but it's crucial in defining
how your book looks on the

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.480
iTunes and iBooks bookshelf.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.320
In this example of Harry and Horsey,
you'll see that we have

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.500
a cover for your book.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.140
There's also the title and
there's the author of the book.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.090
And EPUB actually requires
you to include three pieces of

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.670
information in your book's metadata.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.310
And that's the title,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.760
A unique identifier for your book,
which is usually the ISBN number,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.340
and also the language,
in this case it's English.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.940
In addition to this required metadata,
I have also included the subject,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.610
which is the genre of the book,
the creator, which is the author,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.770
and I've included a meta tag that
defines the cover image for your book.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.380
And all of this metadata works
together to define how your book

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.940
looks on the iBooks bookshelf.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.360
In addition to the metadata in the OPF,
there's also the manifest.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.200
The manifest lists all of the
documents that make up your book.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.040
So that's your NCX file,
your content documents,

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.140
all of your XHTML,
your images and your CSS styling,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.160
everything that makes up
your book is listed there.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.690
In addition to the manifest,
there's also the spine of your book.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:10.100
Now the spine of an EPUB works very
much like the spine of a physical

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.620
book in that it binds together your
chapters into a linear reading order.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.630
So for this example,
we actually have page one, page two,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.210
page three and page four,
and we've made each of them

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.950
a separate XHTML document.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:31.810
The spine only references XHTML documents
because those are your content documents.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.280
The metadata,
the manifest and the spine are all

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.900
required attributes of the OPF file.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.840
The guide is optional,
but it's good practice.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.120
Because the guide identifies
key files within your book.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.540
In the example here,
you'll see that we've identified both the

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.710
cover and there's also the type of text.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.200
So no matter what our
XHTML files might be named,

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.040
we can tell iBooks, hey,
cover.XHTML is the cover page of my book.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.630
And page1.XHTML is the start
of the main text of my book.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.430
So type of text communicates
this is the start of the content.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.280
It's probably equivalent to chapter one.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.940
And it means that anything
before that was front matter,

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.390
like a cover or a copyright.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.040
So that's the OPF.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.400
Remember, metadata,
manifest and spine are all required.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.740
The guide is optional but good practice.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.540
Next, I want to show you the NCX file.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.380
NCX is the Navigation
Control XML and that's just fancy

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.620
talk for a table of contents.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.140
This is a table of contents in iBooks.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.600
You can see that there's a
listing of the different entries

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.080
in the table of contents.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.750
And iBooks has actually assigned
each of them a page number.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.100
That page number is a dynamic number.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.870
iBooks is able to construct
this table of contents based

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.220
off of a NavMap XML structure.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:11.240
In that NavMap, you'll see that there's
a series of nav points.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.850
Each of those nav points has a
defined play order and that play

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:20.670
order defines the ordering of that nav
point in the books table of contents.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.060
Within each nav point is a nav label.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.600
That's the text that's forward
facing and is what the reader

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.500
sees in the table of contents.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.250
And there's also a content source.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.730
That's the URL of where the reader
will be taken when they select

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.860
that item in the table of contents.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.080
For this example, for this nav map,
iBooks will create a table of

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.790
contents that looks like this.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.500
You'll see that there's
two entries in there,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.490
our title page and chapter,
and each of them have

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.210
an assigned page number.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.330
So that's the OPF in the NCX.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.420
There's a third XML file that
I want to talk to you about today,

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.230
and that's the
Apple Display Options file.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.260
The ADO file lives in the MetaINF folder.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:17.190
It gives you, the developer,
four customization methods,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.510
including fixed layout, zoom level,
fonts and orientation lock.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.440
And each of these options can be
defined either globally for all

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.000
of the devices of iBooks or can be
defined on a device-specific level.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.120
So let me show you the code to do that.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.600
In the Apple Display Options file,
you'll see that there's a platform name.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.190
If you wanted to find this globally,
you'll want to give it

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.880
a name of an asterisk.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.520
This will apply it to the iPad,
the iPhone and the iPod Touch.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.350
However, there might be a time where you
want one of those options to apply

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.560
to just a specific type of device.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.540
So we also give you the ability
to define it just for the iPad.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.990
Or you could set the value to iPhone,
which applies it to both

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.950
the iPhone and the iPod.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.440
Next, I want to walk you through
each of the display options.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.020
First is Fixed Layout.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.520
Fixed Layout is that highly designed
book that Al was showing you,

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.060
and he's going to tell you how to make
one of those in just a few minutes.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.290
Second is Open to Spread.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.120
You can think of Open to Spread as
like a zoom level for your book.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.640
So if you have a book where
you want the reader's first

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.770
experience to be a two-page spread,
you'll want to set the

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.320
Open to Spread to True.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.820
Third, specified fonts.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.890
If the fonts in your book are
critical to the book's experience,

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.760
then you should include the
Apple Display Option file of

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.110
specified fonts and set it to true.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.100
And finally is Orientation Lock.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:01.900
iBooks displays your book great
in both portrait and in landscape,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.400
but there might be a time where
you have text that goes sideways

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.210
or topsy-turvy on your book,
and that would make the reader

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.280
want to rotate the device in
order to read that text better.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.980
So if you have a book like that,
you will want to set the

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.530
Orientation Lock to either
landscape only or portrait only.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.960
and that's Apple Display Options.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.920
It's a really great way of
augmenting the reading experience,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.940
but it's only a small part
of the total EPUB package.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.060
All good books need a great design.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.640
And so I'm going to show you a way
today to design great flowing books.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.210
And Al is going to tell you how
to design great fixed books.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.400
First,
I want to tell you about flowing books.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.490
You'll want to make a flowing book if
you have a text heavy book like a novel,

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.810
because flowing books give
the user control over both the

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.560
font face and the font size.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.200
As I told you earlier,
a book is really just a web page.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.600
So this is how a book looks in Safari.

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.560
iBooks takes this long scrolling
document and neatly divides

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.560
it into individual pages.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.970
Now this helps your content
look more like a book,

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.140
but it's still missing that
quality design of a novel.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.770
So today I'm going to give you
some code and show you how you can

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:28.640
easily turn this plain Jane book
into a great design novel.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.760
I'm going to show you how
to create stunning text,

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.720
how you can embed fonts in your book,
how you can incorporate

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.760
auxiliary content in your book
using an EPUB specific feature,

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.360
and finally how you can enhance
your books with audio and video.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.950
The two most important things
that you can do when creating

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.290
a flowing book is one,

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.200
Define your width and percentage,
not pixels.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.460
And two, define your font size in ems.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.660
These two rules will ensure
that your book flows and adapts

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.890
so that it works well on any
size device in any orientation.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.200
The example here is of a block quote.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.540
This is a very typical example
of a block quote in an eBook.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.340
You can see that the block quote
isn't taking use of its full page

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.690
real estate there and it's off center.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.030
But even worse is if you rotate
the device and look at this in a

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.140
smaller viewport or a smaller page,
this block quote now is even,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.470
it's shoved off the edge of the book.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.800
There's actually text
being clipped on the edge.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:49.680
And that's because this block quote
was defined precisely using pixels.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:56.800
It has a set width of 350 pixels and
it has a left margin of 50 pixels.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.040
Fortunately,
this is really easy to fix if

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.800
you just follow our two rules.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.490
So change the font size to 1M,
change the width to 90% and give it

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.690
a left and a right margin of auto.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.620
The result's much better.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.490
Now you have a block quote that's
taking full use of the page real

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.800
estate and it stays centered.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.710
And that's because by defining a width
of 90%, you ensure that the width of

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.800
your paragraph is 90% of the page width
no matter what the size of device.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.030
Thanks.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.610
Okay, so with those two simple rules,
we have a great structure for our book.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.740
Next,
let's have some fun and add a bit of

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.560
design and color and embellishments.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.250
Styling books is actually quite
simple because they're made up of a

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.300
bundle of nearly identical content.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.070
That's because books are made of
chapters and generally you want every

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.300
chapter to have about the same design.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:58.610
And you can easily add that design
without having to add a lot of extra

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.890
HTML markup because you can use
CSS pseudo classes and pseudo elements

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.830
to select just the text that you
want to add the style to dynamically.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.970
You may already know of the
CSS pseudo classes Active and Hover.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.150
Today, I'm going to tell you
about the pseudo class,

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.350
First of Type,
and then we'll look at pseudo elements,

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:24.400
First Line, First Letter and Before.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.270
First, I want to show you First of Type.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.870
Oh, and that's our Plain Jane book
and we're turning it in as a

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.850
reminder to this nice novel.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.430
So, first of type.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.820
For each of these examples,
we're going to reference a chapter class.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.010
And you can think of this as a
container div for your entire chapter.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.440
And for first of type,
we're going to use it to accomplish

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.430
a very common design of a novel,
where you want the text at the

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.780
start of a chapter to start
down a little bit on the page.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.140
So in the chapter class,
you want to identify the first paragraph

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:05.510
within that class and give it a margin,
a top margin of 20%.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:12.520
First of Type and top margin of 20%
is added just to that first paragraph.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.400
None of the other paragraphs
within that chapter are affected.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:22.400
Another really good way of adding
great style to your books is to

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.080
create a drop cap for your books.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.240
So a drop cap is when you bump
up the font size on just that

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.520
first letter of a chapter.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.200
So today we're going to
accomplish just that by using

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.790
the pseudo element first letter.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.110
So just as in our previous example,
you're going to go

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.140
into the chapter class,
identify the first

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.040
paragraph of that class.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.810
And then this time we're going
to drill a little deeper and

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.560
select just that first letter.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.100
We're going to bump up
the font size to 6M,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.160
add a color of red and
add a float of left.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.440
And that float is what makes it so
that your paragraph text actually

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.430
floats around the enlarged initial.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.700
And with that bit of code,
we have a great looking

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.410
drop cap in our book.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.910
Another really common design
element that I see in both physical

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:22.640
and in eBooks is to bold just the
first line of that first paragraph.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.930
Now usually when I see this in an eBook,
it's been hard coded into the

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.600
HTML and this means that there
might be 10 words that are bolded,

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.410
but however many it is,
it's always the same number

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.000
no matter what my device size,
no matter what my font size.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:43.270
And that means that it's pretty much
never just the first line that's bolded.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.640
This is really easy to fix using
the pseudo-element first line.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.970
So just as before,
you're going to go into your chapter

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.880
class and then you're going to
identify the first paragraph and

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.470
then you're going to stylize just the
first line of that first paragraph

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.640
and giving it a font weight of bold.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.040
And while it's just a minor
adjustment in this keynote,

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.700
let me tell you,
it makes a big difference in a book.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.280
So, so far I've shown you how you can use
pseudo classes and pseudo elements

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.640
to actually stylize your content.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.450
Next, I want to show you how you can
use a pseudo element to actually

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.840
insert content into your book.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.880
And this is accomplished using
the CSS content declaration.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.360
Content can be used with either the
pseudo elements before or after,

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.440
and you can use it to insert text,
images, or in this case,

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.800
we're going to use the
Unicode character for a star.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.940
And we're using it to add an
embellishment into our book.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.380
So for this example,
we're adding the Unicode

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.440
character of a star,
making it red and giving

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.540
a font size of 2M.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.240
We want the star to be
a little bit bigger.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.590
And because our chapter header up
there is still looking pretty plain,

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.300
let's go in and stylize our H1 header.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.270
We're going to make it red.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.860
We're on the iPad after all.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.570
You should use some color.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.060
And we're going to increase the
font size to 3M and set a text

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.440
transform to make it all uppercase.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.740
And with that little bit of code,
we have our final great novel design.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.280
So another really great way to do this
is to use the Unicode text transform.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.880
And it's a really great way
of adding style and adding

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.570
character to your books as fonts.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.850
And iBooks makes it super easy to
include fonts in your books because

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:31.770
there's over 60 font families available
on iOS for you to choose from.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.600
If you need to,
you can also embed fonts in your book.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.500
And then, iBooks supports both
OpenType and TrueType fonts.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.900
Also, if needed, you can use something
called font mangling.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.820
Font mangling is a method of font
encryption that's available in EPUB.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.020
And finally, I do want to remind you
that like all media types,

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.330
audio, video and images,
you should verify your font

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.070
rights before you embed them.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.150
Okay, so let's look at fonts in iBooks.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.810
Let me show you how to include it.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.940
It's super easy.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.110
A little bit of code because
it's all standard CSS.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.440
In this example,
we're calling on a system font,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.310
Heffler text.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.140
All you need to do is include
the font family with the

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.720
font name you want to use.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.720
If you want to embed a font,
you want to use this same bit of code,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.440
but you're also going to
include the font face at rule.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.800
In the font face at rule,
you're going to include the font family

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:38.300
name and the source URL for where that
font file is located in your EPUB bundle.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.630
I really encourage you to use fonts
in your books because as you can see,

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.160
you can create some really
great handwritten notes.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.160
It adds a lot of character to your books.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:53.280
But I know that I've also told you
that one of the great things about

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:58.400
flowing EPUBs is that it gives the
user control to change those fonts.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.760
And it's true.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.960
The users can change the fonts in iBooks,
but iBooks also gives you, the developer,

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.030
the ability to say, "Hey,
these fonts are critical to the

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.120
look of my book and I want you,
iBooks,

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.280
to respect them." So all you have to
do is include the Apple Display option

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.800
of specified fonts and set it to true.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.800
And not only will iBooks
respect your fonts,

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:31.400
but it provides your original fonts as a
font option in the main iBooks font menu.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:37.980
This means that the user can easily
change to Palatino or change to

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:43.240
Georgia but they can just as easily
change back to your original fonts.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.850
Okay, so we've added some great
structure and color,

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.400
embellishments and fonts.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.640
Let's now enhance our book.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.480
Let's add content to the book.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.160
And these are EPUBs.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.480
These are ebooks after all.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.160
We can break out of the physical
book metaphor and go beyond.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:08.440
One really great method to push the
book is utilizing nonlinear documents.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:15.720
Nonlinear documents are part of the
EPUB spec and it's a method for you to

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.310
embed supplementary content in your book.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:23.560
It's great for embedding PDFs, charts,
quiz answers,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:29.400
because the reader can never flip
a page to access this content.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.810
You, the developer,
need to provide a link

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.720
for them to get there.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:39.560
And when that link is included,
when that link is triggered,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.060
iBooks will open this nonlinear
document into a new web view

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.030
that overlays your book.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.920
This web view contains an
HTML content in your book.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.130
That means all of the text
in there is searchable,

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.190
selectable.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.400
This is an HTML made chart.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:56.440
And

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:03.510
And because it's not subject to the
paginated environment of iBooks,

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:08.240
that content can be panned and zoomed
in and it maintains its formatting.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.690
So let me show you how
to make one of these.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.500
Here is our code with our chart.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:21.030
So this is an image of our chart
in line between our paragraphs.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.100
You're going to add an anchor tag that
points to the new nonlinear document.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.260
So in this case we're
calling it chart.xhtml.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:33.000
So now you need to make
that new nonlinear document.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.250
Here's our new document.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.760
We've put in a table there
to represent our chart.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.560
But because you're making
a new content document,

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.660
you must also include that
content document in the spine.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.000
So this is the spine.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.920
We're adding a new item called chart.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.670
And the magic there is in gold.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.150
And that's the linear attribute.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.280
And we've set it to no.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.260
This is what tells iBooks, hey,
a reader should never be able

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.260
to flip to get to this document.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:09.500
And if this document is reached by
through a link that you have provided,

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.140
iBooks should open it in a new web view.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.900
So let's run through this one more time.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.280
There's our book, an image of our chart.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.770
That chart is linked to
a nonlinear document.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:25.900
So when that chart is selected,
it opens into a new web view where

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.450
the reader can pan and zoom in.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.200
Non-linear documents are really useful.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.260
I think once you start playing with them,
you'll actually find a lot of

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.070
uses for them and they're a really
great way of enhancing your book.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.080
One other really good way of enhancing
your book is to embed audio and

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.500
video and iBooks makes this really
easy because it's all standard HTML.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.100
You're going to use the HTML5
video and audio elements.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.510
I want to walk through
them here really quickly.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.360
You can see that they're
very similar to each other.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.770
They both contain a source
URL that points to the media

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.490
within your EPUB bundle.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.600
They both also contain
the controls attribute.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.850
This is the default controls but you
do need to provide it because this

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:16.070
is what allows your user to scrub,
play and pause your media.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:21.700
The video element is unique
because it contains a poster image.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.740
That poster image is the image that
displays in line in your paragraphs.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.780
In this case, you can see it's of a cat.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.140
Its purpose is to entice the
reader to want to play your video.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.790
This is an excellent choice
because we all know everyone

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.710
likes watching videos of cats.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.800
And optionally,
you can also include the dimensions.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.800
You don't need to include dimensions.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.800
iBooks has default.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.790
iBooks will also ensure that your video
never flows over the side of a page.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:57.080
The audio and video elements are
a really good example of how HTML,

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:04.030
when paired with EPUB and CSS,
really are the embodiment and power

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.720
of web technology in the flowing book.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:13.010
But even more impressive is the
sheer precision that's possible with

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.800
web technology in the fixed book.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.800
And here's Al to teach you how
to make a fixed layout book.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.930
Thank you.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.320
Thank you, Casey.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.800
So everybody ready to
see the new hotness?

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:34.800
Okay, so let me, let me, uh, thank you,
thank you.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:39.800
Um, when the IDPF came up with EPUB,
they had a great insight.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.800
And that's that digital books need
to work on different sized devices

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800
with different screen sizes.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.690
And so they needed to flow from page
to page differently on every device.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.800
But what they forgot is that
sometimes layout is important.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.640
Sometimes layout is crucial to your book.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.650
So we had a little
innovation back last year,

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.510
late last year,
and we added something called

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.800
fixed layout to iBooks.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.800
And fixed layout is a standard EPUB.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.920
It's the same EPUB that
Casey just taught you how to make,

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.800
but we've added a few things
to respect your layouts.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.600
So let's look at that.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.660
Once again, fixed layouts.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.260
We respect your precise
layouts as a publisher.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.310
You can place your elements
anywhere you want on the page.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.940
You can bleed them edge to edge.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.100
And you can even place them on top of
each other and have text over images.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.930
The example you see here is from
a book called "Five Good Reasons

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.090
to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth."

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:44.340
So anyway, as you can see with this book,
the positioning of the

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.260
elements is crucial.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.300
So we'll show you a few things today.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.300
One, how to set up your book.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.820
Two, how to lay out the
elements on your pages.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.620
Three, how to prepare your images
that go in your EPUB bundle.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:06.570
And four, how to enhance your books
so that they come alive.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:16.300
As I mentioned, fixed books are the same
EPUB format as flowing books.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.500
There are three additions
that you need to respect.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.300
One.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:26.500
You need one XHTML document
per page in your book.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:32.000
Two, you must specify the viewport
dimensions for each page.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.180
And three,
you need to set the Apple display

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.590
option of fixed layout to true.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.100
Now let's go through each of
these last three points in detail.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.580
Here's an example of a
book called Pete the Cat.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.400
As you can see, it's beautiful.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.950
The images spread across the middle.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.010
This is actually two different pages.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.580
Two different XHTML documents.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.600
You can point to the same image.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.700
There are reasons why you may want to
do that and reasons why you may not.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.800
We'll talk about images in a moment.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.090
The takeaway here, that's two pages.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:16.760
Second, you need to specify the viewport
dimensions for your book.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.780
Your users are able to zoom in and
out of the content on the page.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:26.930
Not only that,
but your book might be viewed on an iPad,

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.900
it might be viewed on an
iPhone or an iPod Touch,

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:31.900
so the screen size changes.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.700
The viewport allows iBooks to know
what the aspect ratio of the pages

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.490
are that you intend for your pages.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:43.300
Your viewport dimensions should
correspond to your body dimensions.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.790
And we'll talk about the CSS in a moment,
but keep that in mind.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.040
And you must specify your
viewport dimensions in every

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.240
content document in your book.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.940
Here's an example of the code.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.140
To set your viewport.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.190
This is the head of your HTML.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.420
It includes things like the title.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.490
It also includes the
last element in here,

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:10.160
which is a meta tag called
viewport with a content set with a

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.300
width of 800 and a height of 600.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.200
Remember those numbers,
we're going to come back to them.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.750
The last thing you need to do so
that your book will be recognized

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.580
as a fixed layout book is to set
the fixed layout option to true

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.500
in your Apple Display options.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.780
That's the key so that iBooks needs
to know how to open your book.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.810
And remember, as Casey mentioned,
you can specify the platform

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.590
name to iPad or iPhone,
or iPhone is both.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.460
In this case, we specified Star,
which means we want it to be fixed

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.770
layout on all three platforms,
all three devices.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.120
All right, now let's look at how
to layout your pages.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:52.220
I mentioned setting viewport dimensions,
but you also,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.950
in order to get absolute positioning,
you need to specify your

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.460
body dimensions for your CSS.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.900
We recommend that you match them
to your viewport dimensions.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.240
Once you've specified
your body dimensions,

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.900
you can then work in pixel and
position elements anywhere you want.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.900
You can use absolute or
relative positioning.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.520
Relative positioning allows you to
move your elements based on where they

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.900
would be from their default position.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:24.190
And absolute positioning allows
you to specify element position

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:29.250
with respect to the container
in which those elements live.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.360
So let's take an example.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.470
This is a page from a
beautiful fixed layout book.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:43.120
As you can see it has a full background
image and it has some text that's

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.440
slightly tilted in the top left corner.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.790
Let's break this down
and see how it's built.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.260
First, the HTML.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:51.900
Here it is.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.960
Pretty simple.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.840
Our body has one div.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:57.540
Its class is page 4.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:03.200
Inside that there's an image element
and there are four lines of text.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:07.610
All the text is wrapped in a paragraph
tag and then the second and third line

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.040
are wrapped in a span with a class of P2.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.920
The fourth line is wrapped
in a span with a class of P3.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.900
That's the HTML required
to make this page.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.080
Simple.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.220
Let's look at the CSS that's
required to position these elements.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.180
So,
our body has a width and height of 800.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.860
As I mentioned before,
this should match your

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.300
viewport dimensions.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:36.540
What we've added here is a border,
a thin solid yellow line.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.690
Now that's for you, the developer,
so that you can tell what your borders

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.940
are as you're positioning your elements.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.910
Don't forget, if you use this technique,
remove it before you ship or else all

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.260
your pages will have thin yellow borders.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.020
And we've specified a margin of zero.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.030
I told you that iBooks is
based on WebKit and it is.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.560
This is a web view.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:01.120
By setting a margin to zero,
you can go edge to edge.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.620
Next, the CSS for the image.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:09.740
We've specified a position of absolute
and we've specified a z-index of zero.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.350
The z-index will make sure that
your image appears behind the text

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:18.790
and it allows your user to a see
the text and b select the text.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.200
And there's the CSS for our
paragraph tag down at the bottom.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.910
We've set the position to relative
and we'll show you how that

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:31.190
allows us to do the indentation
and a margin of zero as well.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.790
So here's the CSS for the text.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:38.290
All the text, everything wrapped in that
paragraph tag is a font of

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.360
blackout midnight set to 30 pixels,
a color of blue.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.940
And the text is positioned
70 pixels from the top,

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.420
sorry 75, and 60 pixels from the left.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:56.300
We've also given the text a 10 degree
rotation using a CSS transform.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.090
Next, in order to get the indentation
that we see in the text,

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:05.800
our P2 class has CSS specified
with a padding left of 60 pixels.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:06.990
Pretty simple, right?

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:15.290
P3 set to a padding left of 30 pixels.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.290
So that's how we get that little
kind of stair-step-bowl pattern.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.600
All right, so that's it.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.230
That's how you lay out
your elements on your page,

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.120
HTML and CSS.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.390
Now let's talk about what you
need to do in order to... Well,

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.560
that's the page.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.780
Beautiful.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.040
Now let's talk about what you
have to do with your images.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.950
So I mentioned that your users
can zoom into your pages,

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:35.840
right?

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.200
Because we're rendering this as HTML,
your text will be crisp,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.200
but you also want your
images to be crisp.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:48.550
So we recommend that you
provide images that are one

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.950
and a half times the CSS size.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.760
In the 800 by 600
example that we give you,

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.790
that's images that are 1200 by 900.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.520
And the CSS will properly
shrink the image down to fit.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.900
Your images can be up
to 2 megapixels in size.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.100
So in the 4x3 example that
we've been going through,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.880
that means your images
can go up to 1600x1200.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.940
So if your user zooms in to
twice your viewport size,

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.790
you're still crisp.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:25.710
You can use JPEGs.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:30.060
JPEGs will be fast and small so
your book will download faster.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.090
But if you need
transparency in your images,

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:34.710
you can also use Pings.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.760
And we want you to use alt tags.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:42.270
Alt tags will allow your
images to be read to users that

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.680
are using the screen reader.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:48.340
If they have voiceover turned on,
you want your images to be read.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.900
And remember,
if your image is worth a thousand words,

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.480
your alt tag better be more than one.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:03.440
So, we've shown you how to set up,
layout and prepare your images

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.120
for a fixed layout book.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.110
Now we're going to enhance the
same techniques that Casey showed

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.840
you for embedding audio and
video in a flowing book,

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.530
Work in Fixed Layout.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.880
It's all HTML5.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.720
With fixed layout books,
you can also add SVG.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:25.360
So if you want more advanced graphics,
you want vector graphics,

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.840
that will be positioned
properly and it'll look right.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.560
When the user zooms in,
it'll still be crisp.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.160
You can also do curved text graphics.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.670
In this example of Splat the Cat,
notice the "aw" and the "hooray"

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.860
all follow a curved text path.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.350
That's done with SVG.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:47.300
And another thing you
can do is CSS animations.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:53.190
So because WebKit is driving all of this,
the same CSS animations that you can

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:56.860
use in Safari also work in books.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.480
So we're excited to see what
you can make with these things.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.310
So let's do a little summary and then I'm
going to take you through some new stuff.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.680
First, fixed layout books are EPUBs.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.460
They're the same standard
EPUBs that you use for flowing

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.540
books with three additions.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.120
One, you've got to specify
the Apple display option.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:23.820
Two, you must specify your viewport
dimension on every page.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:28.060
And three, you must have a different
XHTML document per page.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.050
If you meet those three things,
you have a fixed layout book.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.140
There are some image requirements
that we talked about.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.760
Provide images that are
1.5 times the CSS size,

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.880
up to 2 megapixels.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.150
And now that you have
a fixed layout book,

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:49.350
then we open you up to a
whole world of possibilities.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.400
So today I want to talk
to you about iBooks 1.3.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.020
iBooks 1.3 shipped yesterday,
it was announced yesterday.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.650
It added some new features,
one of which was the ability that

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.530
we can now break tables out of the
book and show them in the non-linear

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.020
UI that Casey talked to you about.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:08.800
So that's pretty cool.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.800
We've also made things a lot faster.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.400
For those of you who have given us
some challenging table of contents and

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:22.800
books with tons and tons of images,
those are way faster, exceedingly fast.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:29.580
But iBooks 1.3 also added something new,
and that's called Read Aloud.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:36.300
And I am excited to be the first
to show you this feature today.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:43.420
Read Aloud allows you to include a
narration track that goes with your book.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:48.130
The narration track can be
synced to the text in your book.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:52.900
And when the reader starts things going,
the pages can turn in

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.890
time with the narration.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:44:00.440
As each word is read by the narrator,
it'll light up on the page.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:06.520
Imagine a child picking up an iPad,
wanting to hear a story.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:11.080
And by starting things going,
the book reads to him.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.840
That's what we've announced today,
that's what we're introducing today

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.760
with iBooks One 3 and Read Aloud.

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:18.680
And I'm excited.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.220
Thank you.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.000
And I'm thrilled to be the first to
demo that feature to you right now.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.600
Alright, so here's my iPad.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.530
I have iBooks in the dock.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.990
I'm going to tap on it and open it up.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.880
And this is my bookshelf.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.980
As you can see,
I don't read very advanced books.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:47.200
I'm going to tap on "Whose
Hat Is It?" in the top left corner.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.840
And it opens up.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.500
This is a fixed layout book.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.510
I'm going to hide the UI and you
can see I can turn each page.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:03.380
And the page tracks with my
finger and turns beautifully.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.020
I'll turn another here, grab the corner,
flip the page.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.700
Now we have some words on the page.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:14.620
With iBooks 1.3 and Read Aloud,
we've added the ability

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.540
to read this text to you.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.770
I'm going to tap on the book
to bring up the controls.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.390
In the top right corner
you'll see a speaker icon.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.810
Let's tap on that and bring up the menu.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.760
All right,
so there are three options in this menu.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:33.500
The first is volume control.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.040
I don't think I need to say
too much about volume control.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:40.960
The second is an option
called turn pages.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:45.350
Now, turn pages allows you
to change how the user,

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.400
the reader interacts with the book.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.160
You can either,
let's tap on that and take a look.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:56.060
You can either have the book turn pages
automatically for you or manually.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.310
Let's set it to manually.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.860
If Turn Pages is set to manually,
the narrator will read until the end of

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.900
the spread and then iBooks will give you
a hint that it's time to turn the page.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.060
So let's start reading
and see what happens.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.750
I'm going to press the big blue
start reading button and let it go.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.240
"Wow!

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:23.980
Someone's hat was blown off
by the wind!" Turtle said.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.460
You noticed, as each word was read,
it lit up in blue.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.840
Imagine a child reading along.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.130
This will help them learn to read.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.700
The bottom corner of the page
is turned up to tell us that

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.050
it's time to turn the page.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.140
So let's turn the page now.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.140
When I let go,
the narration will continue.

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.890
Whose hat is it?

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:53.810
Let's go one more.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.840
Is it your hat, Mouse?

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.330
So let's go back into the options.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:06.530
I'm going to tap on the book,
pull down the speaker menu and

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:10.150
let's set it to automatically.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.760
Now what's going to happen,
as the narrator reads the book,

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:19.100
the pages will turn automatically
and we won't miss a beat.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.300
Let's start reading now.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.490
Is it your hat, Mouse?

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.900
"It is not mine," Mouse said.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:33.820
"Is it your hat, Rabbit?"

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:41.220
"It is not mine," Rabbit said.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:46.190
So that is iBooks 1.3 with Read Aloud.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.730
I think this should... What's that?

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.740
Whose hat is it?

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:02.910
Yeah, you have to wait till the end.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.900
I think this is going to do to bedtime
stories what the DVD player did to

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.800
babysitting for you parents out there.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:16.230
So, alright, so without further ado,
I'm going to bring Casey back up here to

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.600
show you how to make a read aloud book.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.000
Thanks Al.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:28.830
Oh man,
I am so excited to get to show you guys

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:30.240
today how to make read aloud books.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.050
I think it's really special
to be able to give to WWDC the

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.140
first teaching I've done of this.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:45.390
So, read aloud books can entirely change
the way that a kid experiences a book

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:50.660
and we make it really easy for you to
be able to give them that experience.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:55.540
All you need is a fixed layout
book and a narration file.

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.600
I'm going to show you today how,
go through the slides here,

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.240
how you can create media overlays.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.020
This is the method of syncing
your audio with your text.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:10.800
Then I'll show you how you can
actually style that actively

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.700
playing word using CSS.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.140
And finally,
I'll show you how you can even include

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.710
an ambient soundtrack in your book.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:25.300
Media overlays are the EPUB3
standard for syncing audio and text.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:28.230
And as far as I know,
we're the first ones to do it.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.730
To create a media overlay,
you're going to want to

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.370
identify the text in your HTML.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:39.460
You're also going to want to identify
the audio that correlates to that text.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.200
And then finally,
you need a method to pair those up.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:48.950
So let me first show you how
you can identify the HTML text.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:50.490
It's standard HTML.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.320
You're just going to include an ID.

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:54.730
Now the granularity
for this is up to you.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:50:01.810
So you can add an ID for every word
or you can add an ID for a sentence.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.800
Entirely up to you.

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.900
So now we have our text identified.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:11.170
Next, let's look at how you can
identify the corresponding audio.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.410
I suggest that you use an audio
editing program like Audacity.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.880
I'm suggesting Audacity
because it's free,

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:23.100
it's cross-platform and it allows you
to not only identify the start and

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:29.420
the end times but also add a label for
those and export it to a text document,

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.490
which will make it easier
for you to include that text

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:36.020
into your media overlay file.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.060
So,
we have our text and we have our audio,

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.840
now we just need a method
to pair the two up.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.360
That is called SMILE.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:48.060
SMILE is the synchronized
multimedia integration language.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:52.710
It's just an XML file that's
used to pair text and audio and

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.720
it's located in the OEBPS folder.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.210
Now I know it's been a while
since we've gone through the

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.650
file structure of an EPUB,
so I'll take you back to

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:03.560
that beautiful slide there.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.560
You can see that the OEBPS folder
is the folder that we're going

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:05.560
to use to create our text.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.560
The OEBPS folder is the folder that
contains all of our book's content.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.990
And now,
in addition to our two EPUB XML files,

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:16.550
the OPF and the NCX,
we're going to add SMILE files.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:52:18.500
[Transcript missing]

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:23.650
Because you're making a new document,
you need to include all of the

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.890
smile files in the book's manifest.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:31.350
So here's an example of
a manifest for page one.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:36.350
You'll see that there's page1.smile,
this is our new smile document.

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:40.480
There's also page1.m4a,
which is the narration file.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.840
And there's page1.xhtml.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.650
Now we've added something
new to that xhtml.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:50.790
There's the media overlay attribute
and this acts as a cross reference

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:58.400
so that reading systems know that the
page1 smile goes with the page1.xhtml.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:01.600
And that's all you need to
create a read aloud book.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.240
With the addition of the smile files,
iBooks will sync your audio and

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.380
your text and will provide a
default blue highlight color so

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:15.870
that as those words are read aloud,
the words will highlight blue.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.430
Now iBooks wants to give you guys a
way to go even above and beyond that.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:24.820
So I'm going to show you how you
can add your own style to those

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:29.840
currently playing words and how you
can include a soundtrack in your book.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.970
First, I'm going to show you
how to add the style.

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:33.730
It's easy.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.680
It's CSS.

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:41.000
You're going to include the
CSS class -epubmedia-overlay-active.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.570
The app will style the
currently playing word.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.860
It accepts all standard CSS styling,
including color and text shadow.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:52.830
But do remember that the style
for it is dependent on the

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.590
granularity of your HTML text IDs.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:01.060
So that means if you've given an
ID to each word in a sentence,

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:05.410
each ID will light up as
the word is read aloud.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:11.580
However, if you put a granularity of
an ID per sentence level,

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.280
that means the whole sentence
will light up while any word

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.520
within it is read aloud.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.800
So for the example here,
we've put the class of "EPUB

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.790
Media Overlay Active" made it red.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.620
And that just means that as
those words are read aloud,

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.910
they'll turn red.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.450
Next,
I want to show you how you can include

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:31.220
an ambient soundtrack in your book.

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:35.480
Again, we're making this as easy
as possible because we're

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.500
using the HTML audio element.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:42.360
And to still be cross-platform,
we are making this EPUB3

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:48.500
compliant by adding the EPUB type
attribute of iBooks soundtrack.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:55.500
So, if you include this audio element in
every one of your content documents,

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.550
all of your XHTML,
iBooks will know to play this audio track

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:03.500
seamlessly across each page of your book.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:08.770
It's a really great way of adding some
ambiance and some style to your book and

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:15.220
it's completely independent of the smile,
of the read aloud because it has

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.500
no timestamps associated with it.

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:18.360
So that's it.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.500
Next, iBooks Read Aloud.

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.400
It's EPUB3 compliant media overlays.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:26.250
It allows you to style the word
highlights as you want to and you

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.500
can even include a soundtrack.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.960
I'm really looking forward to seeing
the content that you guys are going

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:35.500
to make because we've really opened
the door for a lot of creativity.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.500
And here's Al to wrap it up.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:42.570
All right, thank you Casey.

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:46.560
So just to wrap things up, you know,
the three things,

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.000
a few things you learned today.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:50.160
One, anyone can publish a book.

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.920
So I expect all of you to go out
and make something and take a

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.000
piece of that billion dollars.

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.880
Two,
it's all based on standard technologies,

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.640
HTML, CSS, EPUB.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.150
Powerful and easy.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.410
You can make flowing and
fixed layout books and you

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.610
can enhance them with audio,
video, non-linear content and

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:11.200
now with iBooks 1.3,
read aloud.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.610
Thank you very much.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.360
I just want to give you a
little more information.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.040
You can contact Vicki Murley,
who's our evangelist,

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.200
at the following email address.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:25.200
You can contact the iBookstore
at ebookquery@apple.com.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.900
If you want more information about how
to sign up to sell your books online,

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.200
go to itunes.com/sellyourbooks.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.790
And for more documentation
on the EPUB spec,

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:38.200
you can go to idpf.org/epub.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:39.930
There are some related sessions.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:42.180
One occurred yesterday,
so go get the videos.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.370
That's the HTML5 media controllers.

00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:49.340
There's a great one coming up on
CSS effects and animation today at 4:30.

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.750
And a couple more tomorrow.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.570
One tomorrow, one today.

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.420
Thank you very much for coming.

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:58.070
Have a great WWDC.
