00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.800
Good morning and welcome to
Working with Game Center.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.530
My name is Alex Finlayson and I'm going
to go over everything you need to know

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.830
to include Game Center within your game.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.440
Game Center is a great tool for you
as a developer and offers you so much.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.900
We offer great opportunities
for you to get visibility

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.530
with your potential players.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.810
When I look at my friends list,
one Game Center,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.630
and I see that all my friends
are playing your new game,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.200
I think to myself,
why don't I know about this game?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.670
And now from within Game Center,
I can click on your application and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.250
buy it from within the application.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.790
We also offer features such
as game recommendations,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.640
and we have a store page
within the App Store.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.780
We have a lot of great features that
really allow you to engage your players.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.590
We do this with leaderboards
and achievements.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.970
The Game Kit framework that we include
within Game Center is really easy to use,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.100
but extremely powerful.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.920
And most importantly,
it creates a better gaming

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.220
experience for your players.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.430
Now, like I said,
today I'm going to go over

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.040
everything you need to do to include
Game Center within your game,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.390
including going over some of the
basic features that you need.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.740
And then I'm going to go over
some of the more advanced features

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.110
and some of the new features that
we're including within iOS 5.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.440
And I'm going to do this by showing
you a demo app that we've created

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.240
specifically for these sessions.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.570
Something that we're calling

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.660
Rochambeau, Return of Rock, Paper,
Scissors.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.980
And today,
I'll show you how to add Game Center.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.660
So there are four topics that
I'm going to talk about today.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.220
The first is how to get you set up,
how to get your game

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.140
ready for Game Center.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.380
This includes going over
iTunes Connect and then getting

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.660
your player authenticated.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.000
Next, I'll go over leaderboards.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.960
Everything you need to do to
get these ready for your app,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.190
including defining
them on iTunes Connect,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.540
submitting them,
and presenting them to your user.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.570
The third topic,
I'll go over achievements.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.200
Achievements are really great.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.220
They're a fantastic feature that you
get to use to reward your players for

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.420
what they've done within your game.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.180
And lastly, I'll go over customization.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.380
This is how you get to use Game Center to
work to your look and feel.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.200
So with that, let's get started.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.380
The first topic I'm going to go
over is how to get yourself set up.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.600
Like I've said, there's two things you
need to do to do this.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.670
First, you're going to want to set
yourself up with iTunes Connect.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.570
This is a little different than what
you do with most applications because

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.620
you need to get the Game Center servers
ready for your application.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.620
Second,
we'll go over player authentication.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.740
So like I said,
when you set up a Game Center game,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.340
you're going to have to register your
game with the Game Center services.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.960
That means that you have to have your
game set up within iTunes Connect at the

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.240
beginning of the development process,
not the end.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.600
So once you've done that,
and this is a well-known process

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.740
that has lots of documentation,
so I'm not going to go over all of it,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.550
you will end up at a page such as this.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.820
This is what we have for Rochambeau.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.810
What we'll want to do is we're going
to want to click on the Manage in App.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.000
It's supposed to be Managing Game Center.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.880
And what we do there is we
will come to a page like this.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.680
All we need to do is
click the Enable button.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.740
Once we do that, we are now set up.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.060
You'll notice here,
this is where we're going to want to

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.500
set up leaderboards and achievements.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.460
We'll talk about that
in just a little bit,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.180
but this is the page that we'll do it in.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.490
Now that we have the
Game Center services ready for our game,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.140
let's go into player authentication.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.330
This is necessary at the launch of
your application so that you can get

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.130
your players ready for using your
features using the Game Center features.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.000
And this identifies the
player so that you can use the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.390
features such as leaderboards,
achievements,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.570
Your friend list, multiplayer,
and voice chat.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.780
We cover everything you need to
do to authenticate your player.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.050
And so when a player
first looks at your game,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.000
as you see here with Roshan and Bo,
and they've never used Game Center,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.790
they're going to see this pop up.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.840
And they'll have three choices.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.630
If they have, for instance,
created an account in the past,

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.540
they'll have an opportunity
to re-login with this user.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.980
They'll also have an opportunity
to create a new account.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.530
Let's go over what this looks like.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.250
Right from within your game,
our sheet will come up and

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.800
allow them to create an account.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.790
They don't have to leave
the app or do anything.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.650
If they choose,
they can also opt out of Game Center,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.800
and that means they don't
have to do anything else.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.640
And by doing so, this will pop up,
and they should be able to play

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.500
your game without Game Center.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.990
But in most cases,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.260
This will pop up.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.530
And that means that they've
been logged in and everything

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.380
will continue on forward.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.050
Like I've said,
authentication is required

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.700
for you to use these features,
so you want to do this as

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.780
soon as your game starts up.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.100
There are three things that you need
to do to authenticate your user.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.940
The first,
you're going to want to check to see

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.500
if Game Center support is available.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.530
We released Game Center in version 4.1,
so you're going to want to check to

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.290
make sure that that is the release
of the OS that they're using.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.340
Second, we're going to want to
request authentication.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.460
And last, we'll check the results.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.490
Let's take a look at what
this looks like in code.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.440
As you see here,
we're first going to want to check

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.730
to see the GK Local Player class
is available to us.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.090
Next, we'll check the OS version,
make sure that we're at

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.690
least on version 4.1.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.840
After we've done this,
now we're going to have

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.780
to authenticate the user.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.680
We do this using a method called
authenticateWithCompletionHandler.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.150
This is within the
GKE Local Player class.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.360
Once we do this,
we're going to submit a block.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.460
This block is where we check to
see if we've authenticated or not.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.620
This is a little different than
you might expect because we

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.580
get this error variable back.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.470
But actually,
we just want to check to see

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.100
if the player's authenticated.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.800
The reason for this is that your
player might have already logged in.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.010
And even though that there
is a communication error or

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.870
something else has happened,
the player could be authenticated

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.370
and you want to continue on
with Game Center features.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.140
And that's where we do it right here.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.100
The last thing I want to mention
about this piece of code is that we're

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:46.740
going to call it within application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.980
And the reason for this is that
during multitasking scenarios,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.940
we really don't want
you to re-authenticate.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.210
That is because we do it for you.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.800
We retain your completion
handler throughout the

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.740
runtime of the application.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.990
So that means you're going to want
to do everything within that block.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.850
including checking for new players.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:16.300
So if I were to be playing a game,
let's say your new game,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.330
and I'm doing really well,
and my friend's like, "Hey,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.300
what is that?" I'm like, "Here,
how about you give it a try?"

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.870
He then takes a look at it,
he's like, "Actually, let me sign into my

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.790
Game Center account." He does that,
and then brings it back up.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.450
He doesn't wanna play my session,
so that means I'm gonna

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.100
have to do the right thing,
save my game state,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.240
and that should happen when
you leave the application,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.300
and then create a new session when
I notice a new player has logged in.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.920
The last thing I want to talk about
with authentication is you want to

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.500
avoid using enable Game Center buttons.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.070
And the reason for,
our whole API does not

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.000
really handle this well.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:03.060
And that's because your users probably
have already logged into a Game Center.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.020
Or if in the rare case
that they've opted out,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.180
they've already done this.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.040
So when you bring up a
confusing dialog box saying,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.140
do you want to enable it?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.480
Well, they've already made their choice.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.740
Why are you giving them another one?

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.360
So with that,
we're now Game Center enabled.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.760
And now, Roshan Boat is ready
for our other features.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.740
So let's continue on.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.240
Our next topic is leaderboards.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.840
Leaderboards are really great.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.560
They are a list of all
your players' top scores,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.890
and you get to define what they are.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.300
They can be most wins, best time,
best level, most kills, anything.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.200
You get to define it.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.100
Within Roshambo,
we have most wins and we're

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.170
doing it for all three:
rock, paper, and scissors.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.410
But we also have fastest time
because this is a variant of rock,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.400
paper, scissors.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.380
This really will engage your user and
make them want to come back for more.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.000
And it really encourages competition.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.440
When I get to look at my list of
friends on Game Center and I see that

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.280
someone has just beat the top score
that I spent all night working on and

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.540
even missed a bunch of sleep because
I was so addicted to this new game,

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.610
I'm going to be disappointed
when someone beats it that quick

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.720
and go back and try it again.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.620
So there's a few features I want
to talk about in leaderboards.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.770
The first,
we give you the ability to include

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.110
both a built-in and custom UIs.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:48.290
We have filters so that you can
filter by both time and audience.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.340
We have combined leaderboards.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.140
This means that you can have,
as we do in Roche and Beaux,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.020
three different leaderboards,
let's say your rock, your paper,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.960
and scissors,
and have a combined one so that you can

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.860
show what the best times for all of them,
which really gives you insight into

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.910
maybe you need to rebalance your game.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.340
If all the top scores are rock,
maybe I'm doing something

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.470
different with rock,
and maybe that's just the bigger

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.640
button or easier to press,
and I can rebalance based off that.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.530
And other people can make
decisions on what they want to

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.780
do based off that information.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:27.930
We offer 25 leaderboards
within your game.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.700
We have a new feature that
we're including in iOS 5,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.800
and it's the per score context.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.570
This is really great.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.000
We're going to go over this
a little bit more later.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.880
But this allows you to include
information about each score you submit.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.420
And so as you see here
with Roshan and Bo,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.500
we're including which action they
did when they made their win.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:56.100
So you see like Ghandi
Zero has won with scissors.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.340
That's fantastic information to include.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.310
So there are four development topics
I want to talk to you about leaderboards.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.130
The first is how to define it.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.210
This is going to go over
everything we need to do to

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.340
include it within iTunes Connect.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.870
The second thing we're going to
talk about is reporting a score.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.200
Third topic is how to present
leaderboards to your users.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.200
We're going to show you how to
do this with the standard UI,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.120
and then later on we'll talk about
customizing it in that section.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.380
And the fourth topic I want to talk
to you about is recommended practices.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.370
So as you see here, this is exactly what
we have for Roshambo.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.060
The first thing we have
on this list is the name.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.580
This is just an easy way so that
you can identify each of the

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.700
up to 25 leaderboards you have.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.910
And so we have Fastest Choice Rock.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.630
So we're going to talk
about this leaderboard.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.700
And so Category ID is
typically like a DNS type name,

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.700
like we have com.apple.roshenbo,
Fastest Rock.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.700
And this is probably the most important
piece of information you need to keep

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.250
because you're going to use this same
Category ID for submitting your scores

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.660
and displaying your leaderboards.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.320
We offer a couple of different types.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.660
This one we're using an integer,
but we also have

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.640
opportunities to use money,
time, integer.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.600
There's a whole bunch of them,
so you can go take a look at them.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.950
Sorter, we have this to be low to high.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.540
That allows us to see
that the faster the time,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.340
the lower the score,
it's going to be at the top of the list.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.700
But this can also be high to low,
and we'll talk about that in just a sec.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.970
The rest of this board is
things that you get to localize.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.180
And so I'm just going to
go over the English stuff,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.320
but you can go in there and localize
it for your different languages.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:05.790
So we have the name,
what the score format is, suffix,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.770
which we're doing in milliseconds.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.690
We also have the plural, and score range.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.610
Score range is really important for
defining a maximum and a minimum.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.480
So this is optional,
and we'll go over this a little

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.480
bit more when we define it.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.430
And we'll go over this a little
bit more when we submit our scores.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.280
A few tips about defining
your leaderboard.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.970
Score order is really important
and it can sound a little

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.340
obscure just by looking at it.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:37.130
High to low means top scores at the top,
so that would be like most kills,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.490
most money, stuff like that.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:46.020
And low to high is what we have
within Rochambeau with the lower time.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.580
This is really important
because once you've published

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.940
your app to the app store,
you don't have an

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.790
opportunity to change this.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.560
Once it's set, that's it.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.940
So you're going to want to make
sure that this is exactly as you

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.600
expect when you test your app.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.700
The other thing I want
to talk about is suffix.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.500
You'll notice that in the last
slide we had milliseconds spelt

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.080
out and we had a space in there.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.930
And so we could have just as easily
used MS and not include that space.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.280
But really you have to define whether or
not you want that so that we can present

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.570
it properly within our view controllers.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.340
Now let's go on how to report a score.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.370
This is really simple.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.560
All you need to do is
create a GK score object,

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.610
initialize it with what you need,
like the category, set the score,

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.530
and there's a few other options
that we'll go over in a sec,

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.980
such as context and setting the default.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.770
And then we're going to
want to check for errors.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.900
Let's go over this new context variable.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.090
This is going to be really great
for including within your scores.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.650
And we have a lot of different
options to be able to

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.690
customize what this looks like.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.740
So you'll see here that we have
a list of leaderboards that we're

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.050
including within Rochambeau.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.620
We have the, we include scissors as
what their last win was.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.240
Well, we can go even further than this
and create some really great

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.510
customization opportunities.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:26.110
We can go and include stuff
like your hand statistics.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.940
You could have,
let's say you have a different game,

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.480
poker, you include what your poker
hand was when you won,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.070
or what everyone else had.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.200
You can include a lot of information.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.620
And because this is a 64-bit integer,
there's a lot of different

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.000
opportunities to include stuff.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.930
So, for instance,
we use a bit field to define

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.360
all the information that we want
to include with a Russian boat.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.310
But you can get really creative here,
and don't limit yourself to

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.140
just what's in that integer.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160
You can include an index to
your own server so that you can

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.360
do some really creative stuff,
like having ghost laps, whatever,

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.330
replays, taunts,
other ways to really get your players

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:16.290
engaged and see who your best players are
and how they came to this accomplishment.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.770
Another new feature that we're
including in iOS 5 is the ability

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.410
to the default leaderboard.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.540
This is really an opportunity for
you to help us create a better

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.500
experience within Game Center.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:36.040
And that's because it really helps
us to define what each player's top

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.340
leaderboard is out of your list.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.310
So, for instance, myself,
I'm a big fan of Rock.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.500
You know how the saying goes,
"Good ol' Rock,

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.980
nothing beats that." Well,
you'd expect that on

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.950
my page in Game Center,
you'd expect Rock to

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.460
be the top leaderboard.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:55.190
And so now we have an
opportunity to set that.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.960
Now let's go over how to report a score.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.620
First,
we're going to want to initialize a

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.980
GK score object with the identifier,
or the category, sorry.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.580
This is the same thing I mentioned
before within iTunes Connect.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.800
Then we'll set the score value.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.640
This is also an integer,
so you're going to want to make

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.990
sure that you get it correct,
especially if you're dealing with one

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:28.080
of the more obscure instances like time
and/or money or one of the other ones.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.970
Here's the context variable.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.470
As I mentioned, we're using a bit field,
so we're using statistics

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.040
to set the context.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.040
Then we're going to want to report
the score to the Game Center servers.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.550
And lastly, we'll check for errors.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.130
So the thing I want to mention
about reporting scores and

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.370
checking the errors is that if
you've done everything correct,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.530
there really is only one
area that you'll get.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.440
And that is a communication error.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.680
But if you have, for instance,
not done the authentication properly

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.360
or set up your game within iTunes,
you might get one of these two errors.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.900
But in most cases,
you will get communication errors.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.440
And within iOS 4,
we expected you to save these for

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.460
a later time and resubmit them
once you have a connection again.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.900
But new within iOS 5,
we will resubmit these

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.340
for you automatically.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.700
Another thing that you should consider
when you are reporting a score is what

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.110
steps you can take to limit cheating.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.450
One of the things that you're
going to have is that with

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.750
these great leaderboards,
people are really going to try a lot

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.510
of different things to get to the top.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.380
Most people will try to just play a
game over and over and over again,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.320
which is great.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.520
But there's a few people who
would rather find other means.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:02.520
So what you can do is go over a
couple of different best practices.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.510
And so this could be any time that
you save any game state information,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.150
you're going to want to do so
using a checksum or a hash.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.810
If you're doing stuff like iOS 4,
saving your score to the side

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.600
before you resubmit them,
make sure those are hashed out

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.890
correctly because those will just be
binary files that are easily editable

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.040
and they could change the score.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.870
And as I mentioned before,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.500
We also offer an opportunity
to limit your scores.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.620
And so let's say with time, well,
you can't have negative time or

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.420
you can't have certain ranges.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:50.800
So we set the limit from 0 to 10 seconds
because once you're out over that,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.700
you're off your scoreboard.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.140
Next topic I want to talk about
is displaying your leaderboard.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:05.480
The first thing you notice here with the
leaderboard that we're including within

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.530
our game is that we have the ability
to rate your games within your game.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.640
And this is included within
every View Controller that

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.370
Game Center has to offer.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.500
So no longer do you have to
leave the instance of your

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.780
game or put up a dialog box.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.440
Every time you display
our View Controllers,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.780
you'll get an opportunity--
your players will get an

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.020
opportunity to rate your game.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.680
So to display one of
our standard leaderboard

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.270
View Controllers within your game,
you're first going to want to create a

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.920
GKE Leaderboard View Controller object.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.500
Then you'll set properties
such as your categories,

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.910
the time scope,
and also your delegate for dismissal.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.160
And then you're going to
want to present it modally.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.160
Let's take a look at what some
of the code will look like.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.990
You'll see here that we first create the
GKE Leaderboard View Controller object.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.170
Then we're going to want to set
those properties I talked about.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:08.880
You'll see here we're using the fastest
rock that we've displayed earlier.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:14.600
We also are going to set the time
scope and a few of the other variables.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.400
Once we have set the delegate,
we will then present it.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.740
In iOS 5, we have a new way to do this,
and it's called

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.330
Present View Controller Animated
Completion.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.840
The completion area is new,
and we hope that you guys can use

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.980
that to whatever way you want to.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.340
And lastly,
we obviously have to define how

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.480
the leaderboard will finish.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.180
And so here's

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.760
Let's go over some best practices
for displaying our view controllers.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.760
You'll notice here that I've screwed up.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.570
I did not do some of the best practices.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.720
The Russian bow is set
to the wrong orientation.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.340
And the reason for this could
be... There's a couple of different

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.840
reasons why you might run into this.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.510
But the most prominent one that we've
seen is that people have used the old

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:19.380
OpenGL template that came out with 2.0,
I think.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.810
And this was an OpenGL instance
that didn't use a view

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.240
controller as the basis.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.060
And so we saw people trying to set
the status bar to wherever they

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.980
thought was the most appropriate.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.080
And this ran into some
really weird scenarios.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.170
You'd see this pop up like this,
and that's wrong.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.840
And we'd see some audio
bezels the wrong way.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.120
And just some really random ways.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.120
The best practice for displaying
the view controller is to set the

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.160
status bar to the right orientation.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:45.220
And that's what we've seen.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.750
The best practice we could tell you
right now is that you should use a

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.860
view controller for presenting our UI.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.410
And so if you look at
the new OpenGL template

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.600
that's included with iOS 5,
this will help you out and give you the

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.590
right steps to the right directions.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.440
So that's leaderboards.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.120
We went over how to
define your leaderboards,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.350
submit scores,
how you can use context in a

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.620
really great ways to present new
information to your user and really

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.640
get them engaged in different
ways that weren't possible before.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.880
We also went over how to set
your default leaderboard.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.860
And this is a great way so that
you can really help us present the

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.560
best experience for your players.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.690
And we also went over how to
display standard view controllers.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.480
Next, let's go on to achievements.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.260
Achievements are really great.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.830
These are a great way that you get
to reward your players for doing

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.800
something fantastic within your game.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.000
For instance, we have a couple different
ones within Rochambeau,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.610
like win three times in a row with rock.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.400
This might sound easy,
but who in their right mind

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.020
is going to let you win with
rock three times in a row?

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.740
It's actually quite challenging.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.660
But there could be other things
like finding secret passageway,

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.280
finding a new weapon,
doing something on one of the edge

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:17.470
cases of whatever your game is,
defeating 50 enemies.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.110
This is a great way to
really engage your players,

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.800
get them to explore all
that your game has to offer.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.340
And it really encourages competition
amongst your players friends.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.400
Some of the features that I want to talk
about with achievements are we support up

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.010
to 100 different achievements per title.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.060
We have different UIs,
including Customize UI,

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.390
and we also have Standard UIs to show.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.590
We have progress support,
and so we allow you to show how far

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.970
they've come on this achievement
within our view controllers.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.220
We also have the ability
to hide achievements.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.230
This is a really great way so that
you can get your players guessing of

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.380
what the next thing is going to be.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.000
And this is really fantastic.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.190
When a player looks at their friend's
achievement list and they have something

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.080
that they didn't even know about,
it's like a little surprise.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:27.300
And they can really get encouraged
to really try out your game

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:27.300
in multiple different ways.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.140
We're including a new
feature within iOS 5,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.710
the Completion Banner.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.300
This is a really easy way so that you
can get your players engaged whenever

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.530
they accomplish an achievement.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.880
And we also offer Achievement Points.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.640
This is kind of like the
currency of achievements.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.520
Achievements or Achievement
Points are really a great way so

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.180
that you can differentiate the
difficulty of all your achievements.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:07.160
They can be anywhere
from 0 to 100 points.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.490
And you might think, well,
why would I want an

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.960
achievement of 0 points?

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.800
That seems kind of counterintuitive.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.810
Well, I've actually seen some really
interesting ways to use this,

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.860
including, let's say,
having an achievement for something

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.050
negative and giving 0 points for it,
like losing five times in a row.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.340
Well,
I don't want to lose five times in a row.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.640
So you give 0 points.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.350
And it's a great way to kind
of have negative achievements.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.960
But in most cases,
you're really going to want to

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.580
give more achievement points for
the difficulty or the challenge of

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.090
doing those things within your game.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.100
Each title is allowed up to 1,000 points.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.450
You're going to want to make
sure that you leave room for

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.300
improvement within your game.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:55.530
That means if you include in-app purchase
or you include some other features,

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.500
you're going to want to budget
accordingly and leave some room

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.300
so that you can add new things.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.490
It keeps people wanting to come
back after they've accomplished

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.330
all in the first version.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.320
Another new thing that we're
including within iOS 5 is

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.100
the Achievement Leaderboard.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:17.090
We think this is going to be a
great drive for people to really

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.350
do well within their achievements.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:26.770
And it's going to create a new
competition to get these points.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:33.980
So there are five topics I want to
go over today with achievements.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.610
The first is how to define
them within iTunes Connect.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.670
We'll go over an example within Roche
and Beaux and show you how to do that.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.140
The second topic I want to go over
is how to report your achievements

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.220
to the Game Center servers.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.820
The third is how to
present completion banners.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.180
Like I said, these are a new feature that
we're including within iOS 5,

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.160
and these are really easy,
so I'll go over those.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.750
The fourth topic I want to
go over is key value data.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.000
We heard in the keynote that
this is a new feature included

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.670
with the new iCloud servers.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.440
So we'll go over everything
you need to do to include this.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.500
And the last topic we'll go over is how
to present achievements to your users.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.490
So as you see here,
we have an instance of winning

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.860
three rocks in a row on Rochambeau.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.540
We have the name,
similar to your leaderboard name.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.140
It's just something so you can define it.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.140
We have the ID.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:38.580
This is how we're going to want
to submit them within your game.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.560
So hold on to that.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:44.420
It's also a DNS name,
or it's recommended at least.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.860
We have the ability to hide it.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.500
This one's going to be obvious,
and we're setting it to no.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:55.240
We set the point value and we think this
is a really tough challenge to do yet,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.000
so we're going to use the
maximum of 100 to do that.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.270
Then we have some localization and stuff.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.380
And lastly, I want to mention the image.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.380
And the image is a little different.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:12.740
I'll go over what you
need to do for this now.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:17.530
We offer a couple of different
image supported types for both

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.500
achievements and the leaderboard image.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.500
And although we do,
we really highly recommend using the PNG.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.880
And the reason for that is
PNG supports the alpha channel.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.030
And this is really great because we
do a bit of post-processing on every

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.480
achievement image when we include it.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.400
And we can incorporate it
within our view controllers.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.660
For instance, for achievements,
we add this really nice

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.650
gold coin behind your image.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:48.650
Then we apply a mask.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.930
And then we add a gold
coin to finish it off.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:58.880
And so by including an alpha,
it really goes together really nicely.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.300
Now let's go over how to include
completion banners within your game.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.410
This is a really great feature because
if you're really going to get players

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.810
interested in your achievements,
you're going to want to present to

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.660
them every time they accomplish it.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.110
And so we've seen a lot of
really great ways to do this,

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:22.930
but we wanted to include our own
that's just really easy to use.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.300
And you'll see just there,
all it takes is one line of code.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.210
Every time you submit your achievement,
set it to yes.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:33.710
When you've completed that achievement,
a little banner will

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.490
pop down really easily.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.800
But we didn't stop just there.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:44.260
We also include a way to include
custom banner to be shown.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.180
And so, for instance, I have here a hint.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.450
So you get to a point and you're
almost about to get the achievement,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.660
but you've got discouraged or
you decide to do something else.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.250
Maybe you give them a hint.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.020
Hey, you're almost there.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.480
Try a little bit harder.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.360
But not just that.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.120
There's other ways you
can use it as well.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.030
It's a great way to get a
message across to your user.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.180
Let's go over how to
report these achievements.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.360
First thing we're going to want to do
is create a GKE Achievement object,

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.130
initialize it with that achievement
ID that we talked about earlier,

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:22.400
set the percentage complete
that you want done,

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.480
then report it to the
Game Center servers,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.300
and then check for errors.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.180
Let's take a look at what
this looks like in code.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.840
You'll notice here that
we're using the 1-3 rocks,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.600
and so we're creating a
GK achievement object there.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.600
We set the percentage to 80.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.600
We set the achievement, sorry,
the shows completion banner to yes,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.780
but you'll notice since we're
only setting the percentage to 80,

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.600
it won't be shown quite yet.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.600
Then we report the achievement
to the Game Center servers,

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.630
and then we're going to
want to check for errors.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:06.480
As we did with GKScore
and submitting scores,

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.390
in most cases of the error,
you're only really going to want to

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.680
worry about the communication error.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.910
And in iOS 4,
this was an issue that we wanted

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:23.550
you to hold onto these and submit
them later at a time later on.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.400
But new in iOS 5, we'll do this for you,
which is really fantastic.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:35.680
The fourth topic I want to talk to
you today is about key value data.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.870
This is a new feature included
that allows us to use the

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.140
iCloud services within our game.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:47.780
This is really easy to use and
it has a lot of great benefits

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.560
to you as a game developer.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.890
For instance,
one of the big things that we're using

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:02.640
within Rochambeau is the ability to have
it on both your iPhone and your iPad.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.320
And the big piece of game data
that we're syncing between

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.200
them is our achievements data.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.300
Our achievements can be sometimes a
little bit more complex and just being

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.730
able to use how much the percentage
complete is done isn't enough.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.220
So whenever we have any
kind of complex game data,

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:27.340
we can now use the iCloud support to
sync these across multiple devices.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:34.040
This is really easy to use because
it's similar to NS user defaults.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:40.010
And all you need to do to
include it within your game is

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.880
to include a special entitlement.

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:47.400
Now let's take a look at what
some of this code looks like.

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:53.390
All you need to do to set an object
within the iCloud is to first grab

00:34:53.900 --> 00:35:02.600
the NS ubiquitous key value store,
the default store object, set the object,

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:03.720
and then synchronize.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.020
It's that easy.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:09.260
The one thing I will mention that's not
up here on the slide is that you're going

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:15.150
to want to make sure that you use a key
that associates with your player ID.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.370
And the reason for that is that
your Game Center ID and your

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.080
Cloud ID might be different.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.860
Let's say you have multiple
players using a similar device.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.780
So you don't want them
to clobber each other.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.660
And now here's the code to
get it from our servers.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.000
And it's the exact same way.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.340
You just do it in reverse.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.350
And so you grab the default store,
synchronize,

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.840
and then you grab the object.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.180
The fifth topic I want to talk
to you about on achievements is

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.180
displaying them to your user.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.500
Your user really will want to know
how far they've gone in all these

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.830
achievements that you're including.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:05.540
And so by presenting them to them using
the GKE Achievement View Controller,

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.060
they will really get a sense of
how they're doing within your game.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.090
So first to do this,
we will create an object,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.840
set the delegate for dismissal,
and then present it.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:17.570
It's really that simple.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.060
Let's take a look at what
this code looks like.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.430
So first, like I said,
we create the GKE Achievement

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.480
View Controller object.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.600
We set the delegate to whatever
view controller you're coming from.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.700
We'll present it using the
new method within iOS 5.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.190
And then we'll make sure that we've
defined the achievementDidPressDismiss

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.590
to whatever the rate of value is.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.940
So that's what I want to
talk to you on achievements.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:53.450
And so we went over a lot of things,
including that these are a

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.480
really great way for you to
really reward your players.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.580
And they really create
competition between your friends

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.770
and increase engagement so that
they can come back wanting more.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.370
We also showed you how to
include completion banners.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.960
This is a great way so that you
can get your players really engaged

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.980
with every time that they've
accomplished a new achievement.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:22.340
And lastly, we went over the ubiquitous
key value data store.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:27.080
And this is a really great way that
you can really extend your game.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.250
So with that,
I want to bring up Jordan Ceccarelli

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.490
to show us all about Rochambeau.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.310
Thank you, Jordan.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.440
Hello, good morning everyone.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.550
I'm Jordan Ceccarelli and I'm going
to show you some cool stuff with the

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.390
demo app that he's been talking about.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.100
It's called Rochambeau.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.040
And I'm going to show you how we've
used Game Center to make it really cool.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.890
So let's see here.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.600
So here's the game, Rochambeau.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.900
As you can see here right
on our launch screen,

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.490
in addition to being
able to play the game,

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.210
we give the user access to the
leaderboards and the achievements

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.360
right here from the main menu.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.380
As a gamer, I love that.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.140
I love being able to just immediately
go right into this stuff without

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.590
having to go into Game Center.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.420
So that's really cool.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:17.640
We're going to play the game,
and we've got three game types here.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.020
A single player versus the CPU.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.900
This is a four-player game,
so you and three computer opponents.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.880
We also have a live
player peer-to-peer game,

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.980
and we also have a turn-based game.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.900
And we'll talk about those
two in a later session today.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.210
So today we're just going to
focus on the single player game.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.700
So what's going to happen here,
we're going to get presented

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.440
with our three choices,
rock, paper, and scissors.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.950
And so we're going to pick
our instrument of choice here

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.460
and go against the computer.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.840
So let's say rock.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:46.900
Nothing beats rock, right?

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.220
So we'll pick rock.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:53.110
And as you can see here on the bottom,
we have the computer opponents,

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.610
Hard Rockin', Paperboy,
and Stabby Stabby.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.640
And on the bottom,
we get to see what they've picked,

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.820
and we get to see the time that
they've taken to pick their choice.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.110
And it looks like I totally lost a paper.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.730
So that happens sometimes.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.710
So I don't want to play again.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.380
But maybe I do.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.280
So we're going to show
you one cool thing.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.750
It's the banners that slide in,
and you're allowed to put in

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.440
notifications and messages,
or we can have those

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.870
pop up for achievements.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.440
So one of the notifications we have
in here is if you try to select one

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.640
of these options before the three,
two, one countdown,

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.870
we penalize you 500 milliseconds.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.880
And we give you a little banner
notification to tell you that.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.320
So we'll play the game again.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.560
And rock, rock, rock, come on.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.100
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.190
Slow down.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.640
Now as a player, I like that.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.540
I like that instant feedback.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.590
So that's really fun.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.950
We'll pick rock again,
and let's see how we fare this time.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:55.630
Looks like I'm coming in dead last.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:02.720
Okay, well, when I practiced this,
I was winning, I promise.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.190
So, next up, let's talk about some of
the other things here.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.480
We've got our in-game leaderboard sheet.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.880
And we've got the leaderboard between,
let's see, these are our top friends.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.410
I'm in dead last of my friends.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.070
And then under here,
you get to see the world players

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.940
that have played this game and
where you rank on this leaderboard.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.600
We can go back and see, in this case,
the five leaderboards that we have here.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.670
And one thing you'll notice,
this does look different

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.050
than we shipped today.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.110
And you'll notice that we
have this nice red felt up top

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.430
with game name and the icon.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.630
And you also see these five
kind of transparent icons.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:40.270
And as Alex mentioned,
this is actually a store rating.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.180
And this is great because I'm sure
you've all played a game before.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.860
And you've been playing it.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.830
You're kind of getting into
it five or 10 minutes in.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.260
And all of a sudden, you get the alert.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.340
And it's like, rate my game.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.940
And you're like, oh, I'm in the groove.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.440
I'm playing.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.860
I don't want to go to the store now.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.250
I'd love to rate your game,
but I don't want to leave.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.220
So this is a great place because
when someone is checking out

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.630
leaderboards or achievements,
that's a good time to say, hey,

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.520
you like this game?

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.400
You can rate it.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.600
So if I'm coming in here and
I want to check out a score,

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.120
I can go, great.

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.940
I love this game.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.640
I'm giving it five.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.840
stars.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.890
So this is probably a pretty big win.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.990
And here we have our achievements.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.010
And I like achievements.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.220
Every gamer likes achievements.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.580
So we can instantly see the
achievements that we've unlocked

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.120
while we've been playing this game.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.040
And once again,
we have the star ratings right here.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.640
This is a great place for
people to rate your game.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.360
So as you can see,
we have our green felt for the

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.740
leaderboards and achievements.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.190
And maybe -- you know,
it looks pretty cool,

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.310
but maybe this doesn't really
go with your game theme.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.720
Maybe the green kind of clashes for you.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.940
So with iOS 5,
we're going to give you the ability

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.480
to put custom UI in the game.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.460
So here we go.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.010
For leaderboards,
this is now our custom UI leaderboards.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.740
Beautiful.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.370
This looks nicer than the green felt
because it actually fits in the theme

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.020
of the game with the blue ribbon.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:59.360
So just like our regular leaderboards,
here's our leaderboards for this game.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.920
And you can see here that we
have some of the new photos,

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.820
some players that have selected photos,
and we have some players

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.690
that haven't selected photos.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.840
So they'll pop up as a silhouette there.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.820
And we give you the opportunity to put
pretty much whatever you want here.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.600
So in this case, we have, you know,
the instrument they

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.460
chose for their last win.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.840
So a lot of good information here.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.710
We have the time selector up top,
just as you'd expect for

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.030
a regular leaderboard.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.750
Now let's look at achievements.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.110
Here is what we're
calling the trophy room.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.090
This gives you the exact same
set of achievement data showing

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.100
you the ones you've unlocked
and ones that are still hidden.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:39.100
But instead of being on the green felt,
you have this nice little trophy room.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.020
So if you want to sit back and look at
all the achievements you've unlocked,

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.100
this looks beautiful.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.990
So I happen to like this custom UI.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.100
I think it fits well with this game.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.850
But you know what?

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:48.960
I think you guys can do better.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.090
I have a lot of faith in you guys.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.840
I'm looking forward
to playing your games.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.010
I want to see some custom UI.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:55.090
I want to see some achievements.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.100
I want to see some banner notifications.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.100
I know you guys can do it.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.080
So with that, thank you very much.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:02.100
Back to Alex.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.940
Thanks a lot, Jordan.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.940
That was fantastic.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:12.240
So with that, let's go on to our
final topic of the day,

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.270
and that is customization.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.050
So as we saw within Rochambeau,

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.460
We offer you, we've showed you both how
to use the original one,

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:30.990
the GKE Leaderboard View Controller and
the GKE Achievement View Controller.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.020
And then we also went into customization.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.670
But why would you want to customize?

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.860
The standard one,
as we've gone over today,

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.340
is really nice and offers
really great features.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.820
And it's extremely easy to use.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.270
It's three lines of code,
like five lines of code if you add

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.490
some of the other stuff in there.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.960
But in a lot of cases,
you do want to customize because

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.640
you really want to fit the
best experience for your game.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:06.600
And as we did with Rochambeau,
we thought that the green felt just

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:09.560
didn't match the kind of art direction
that we were trying to go with.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:14.810
So we went out and we
created a great trophy room.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.890
And we also created a great leaderboard
that used some of the new features

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.920
that we're including within iOS 5.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:28.490
The context variable really offers
some great opportunities to get more

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:33.590
information into your leaderboard
and show new ways to really make it

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.700
kind of give that extra little pop.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.430
So as we see here,
we have the ability to show who

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:44.260
won and with which instrument.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:48.140
But don't let this be the
only thing you want to use.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.780
You can go even further than that,
like including replays and new

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:57.740
opportunities to include other
data that might be really useful.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.620
The thing with Rochambeau is when
I'm playing against my friends,

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.560
I actually do want to know a little
bit of information about what kind of

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.720
things that they've done in the past.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.760
Like are they a big fan of ROK?

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.020
Like I'm a big fan of ROK.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.400
So everyone's going to want
to use paper against me.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.630
Well, maybe that's something
I want to keep consider,

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.990
reconsider when I play them.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:29.330
Okay, so there's two topics I want to
go over within customization.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:29.330
The first,

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.670
is going into how to
get that information,

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:35.400
how to get the leaderboard and
achievement data so that you can create

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.340
a great experience for your users.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.110
The second is how to use
player photos within your game.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:50.920
So we offer three different classes
that give you access to the data that

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.830
our Game Center servers have to offer.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:59.600
And so those are the GKE Leaderboard,
GKE Achievement Description,

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.460
and the GKE Achievement.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.160
So this gives you all
the information you need.

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.760
So be creative.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.170
Like, if you're going to spend the effort
to create an all-inclusive experience,

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.700
make sure that it's purposeful.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.460
Like, have something that
really makes the user go,

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.800
yes, this is exactly what I want to know.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:26.910
So first, let's talk about what custom
leaderboards can offer you.

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.940
The leaderboard data that we include
can be queried programmatically.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.330
And so you don't actually just
need to create custom leaderboards.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.950
You can actually use some of this
information for other reasons.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.210
Like, let's say I'm about to
create a multiplayer game.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:47.870
I might want to see where all my players
that I'm playing against rank against

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:50.180
me so that I can make my decisions.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.230
Maybe Jordan is the best
player out of all of us.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.840
I want to ally with him.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.490
If we're playing an allied game,
I definitely want to be on his team.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.850
So a typical query
could be anything like,

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.190
let's say, top 10 players.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.940
A couple of different ranks.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.510
You might want to get a
list of certain players,

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.670
scores, stuff like that.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.390
And your queries are returned
to you asynchronously,

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.220
as are most of the Game Center APIs.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:25.220
And so,

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:31.610
We set a limit at 100 so that you
don't query the whole database.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:36.020
But we also want you to kind of
be a good network citizen and make

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.120
sure that you do low frequencies.

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:42.580
Don't try to circumvent the
system by making multiple calls

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.610
to load the whole database.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:49.610
In most cases, you only need to show a
minimal amount of information.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:56.360
So what you'll need to do to load
this leaderboard information is

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.370
create a GKE Leaderboard object.

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:02.700
Set the properties that
you are requesting and then

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.140
submit it asynchronously.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.750
Let's take a look at what
this code looks like.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.800
First, we're going to want to create
the GKE leaderboard object.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.380
Then, we'll set the category for
which leaderboard we want.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:23.430
We also offer some method calls
so that you can get a list of

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.890
all the categories possible.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.570
But in this instance,
we're going to only talk about

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:31.000
the fastest rock that we've
been talking about all night.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.930
For instance, in this instance,
we're going to want to look for all our

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.400
players' top scores within the last week.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:43.300
And we're going to only
look for the top 25.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.650
You'll notice here that
our range is from 1 to 25,

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:51.040
and that's because our leaderboards
are done with a starting at 1.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:55.090
So make sure that you don't
submit looking for 0 because

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.500
there is no 0th player.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.400
And so finally,
we're going to want to submit this.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:05.780
And so we submit using load
scores with Completion Handler.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.120
And this will return
back an array of scores.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.260
So once we've done that--

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.040
We'll check for errors and
send a completion block.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:17.730
This completion block,
as similar with all of

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.270
our asynchronous blocks,
we're going to want to make sure

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:25.000
that we only check to see if
scores are submitted or sent back

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.500
to us in the scores variable.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.740
If we don't get something from them,
then we can check for errors.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.000
The fact of the matter is even if
we are having a communication error,

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.960
if we have this information
within Game Center stored

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:44.390
from a previous instance,
we will send these back to you.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:49.430
So just check to make sure
that we've included the scores.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:56.590
Next, let's talk about how to get the
information for GKE achievements.

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:00.600
So we can query this in two parts.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:04.320
First, we have the GKE Achievement.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.730
An instance of all the GKE achievements
that you've submitted by

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.100
the time you make this call.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:15.140
So if you have not made any
progress on your achievements,

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:16.470
you won't get anything back.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:20.750
So that means that we're going to use
the GKE achievement description to get

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.640
a list of all the achievements possible.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.070
So let's take a look at what
this will look like in code.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.190
It's actually really similar,
the two of them.

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:34.140
So to query the achievements data,
we're going to want to first,

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.220
use the nothing called load
achievements with completion handler.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:43.390
This will return back an array of
all the achievements that you've

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.080
already submitted at this point.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:51.070
And then, similarly enough,
you just want to check to make sure

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.400
those achievements have been done.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:59.800
And if there is an error,
send a UI feedback.

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.980
Similarly with
GKE Achievement Description,

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:10.100
we're going to want to load Achievement
Description with Completion Handler.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.170
Then make sure that the
descriptions are there.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.590
So the second topic I want to
talk to you today on customization

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:21.070
is how to include player photos.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.560
This is a new feature that
we're including within iOS 5.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:30.410
So you can now grab the exact
player photo that's included within

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.450
Game Center within your game.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.200
And it's really easy to use.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:40.840
All you need to do is load
whatever player you're looking for,

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:44.410
request a photo, and check for errors.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:50.150
So you'll see here within Rochambeau,
we offered photos as a way to really

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:56.520
get some more player involvement
with when a player has won or not.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.460
So for instance, right now I've won,
so I got to do a paint splat

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:05.820
on the opponent that I faced,
which gives me a lot of gratification.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.330
Because it's a way that
I can really feel like,

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:13.260
hey, I just beat this guy, splat,
you're dead.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.920
Player folders are a really
great way that you can include.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.990
So let's go over them.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.630
To do this, reload a player,
we're going to request a photo,

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.980
and then check for errors.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.700
If we don't get anything back,
we're going to want to

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.710
include a default image.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:40.240
And this can be anything that
really fits the theme of your game.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.300
So this is what this looks like in code.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.820
First, we're going to want
to call-- we'll do it,

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.980
for instance, on the local player.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:56.540
We'll load a photo with size,
and we offer a couple of different sizes,

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.960
and then we'll pass
in a completion block.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:04.580
This completion block will then hand
you a photo and an impossible error.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:09.250
And then all you need to do is
set whatever your image is to

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.870
the photo that we give you back.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:17.090
And if you do get an error,
use whatever your default image is.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:22.390
And this should really fit
whatever the theme is of your game.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.050
So that's your customization section.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:33.260
So the things that I went over today
are I gave you all the tools necessary

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:38.020
so that you can create really great
leaderboards and achievements within

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.340
your game that really fit the look
and feel that you're looking for.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.630
And this is a really great way
so that you can really stand out,

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:50.120
really have your game be
a complete experience.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:56.120
And new with our player photos in iOS 5,
you have a new way to

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.230
increase player engagement.

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:02.620
So when you're playing multiple people,
as we'll show you in our next session,

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:07.360
you have a way to really bring the
experience alive by having your

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.410
player photo part of the experience.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:11.880
So that's it for this session.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:16.040
I want to go over a few things
that I talked about today.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:20.100
The first thing we went
over was how to set up.

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.980
And I'm not going to talk too
much about that in review because

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.320
I think you guys got the point.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.420
Second is leaderboards.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.620
We went over everything you need to do to
include a leaderboard within your game.

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:38.000
We also went over how to
include context in your game.

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:43.820
And this is a great way for you to offer
some really great customization tools.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:49.620
We also went over how your players can
now rate your games from within the game.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:55.120
And they're included in all the view
controllers that Game Kit has to offer.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.400
We went over achievements.

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:03.100
Everything you need to do to include
achievements as a way to reward your

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.500
player for tasks that they have done.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.510
And we also went over how to show these
to your users when they've completed

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.580
them using the new completion banners.

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:17.180
And lastly, we went over customization.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.900
These are the tools that you're
going to need so that you can

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:24.300
really include a great experience
to really bring the whole thing

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.620
together to your look and feel.

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.960
And we did this by using photos
and showing you how to use them.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.470
And we also went over how
to grab the data from the

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:36.120
leaderboard and achievements.

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:39.620
So the related sessions that we have,
we have two of them today,

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.960
and then we have a repeat of
the introduction on Friday.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.540
So the two are multiplayer,
which happens right after

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.170
this one in this room.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.100
And then we have turn-based gaming.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:52.500
This is a great new feature
that we're including in iOS 5,

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:56.370
and that will happen at
11:30 today in this room.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.430
If you want more information,
please contact Alan Schaffer

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.200
and the great evangelism team
that we have here at Apple.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.040
And with that, thank you very much.

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:10.210
I can't wait to see what
you guys have to offer.
