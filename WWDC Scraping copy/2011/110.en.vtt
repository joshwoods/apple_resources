00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.560
Okay, so good morning.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.200
I'm Mark Kawano,
Apple's User Experience Evangelist.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.250
Today I'm going to be talking about
designing user interfaces for the iPhone,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.080
the iPad, and the Mac.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.260
And before I get started,
I just want to play a video of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.800
one of our recent commercials.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.080
So let's watch.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.790
This is what we believe.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.790
Technology alone is not enough.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.800
Faster.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.470
Thinner.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490
Lighter.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.660
Those are all good things.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.610
But when technology gets out of the way,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.560
Even magical.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.800
That's when you leap forward.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.310
That's when you end up
with something like this.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.930
All right, isn't that great?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.050
It's one of my favorite
Apple commercials.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.110
So when technology gets out of the way,
everything becomes more delightful,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.500
even magical.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.400
And while this was a
commercial for the iPad 2,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.300
this is a belief that permeates
everything that we do at Apple,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.200
right?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.360
From our retail stores, to the hardware,
to the software and cloud services.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.780
When we design products,
our goal is to enable our users to learn,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.740
work, play,
or communicate in the most intuitive

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960
and delightful way possible.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.640
And when you design your app,
this should be your goal as well.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.440
Remember that it's not about technology
that you have under the hood.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.190
It's not about how impressive
your feature list sounds.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.260
And it's also not about how
pretty your screenshots look.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.800
Those are all important,
but what your users really care about

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.490
is what your app enables them to do.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.780
How it makes them feel
when they're using it.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.180
And that's what you need to think about
when you're designing the UI of your app.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.140
So many of you know just how
challenging it can be to design

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140
a really great user experience.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.540
Some of you might have apps on one
of our app stores already and are

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.840
just wondering how to improve the UI.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.470
And others of you are working on an
app for the first time and just want

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.950
to make sure the design is just right.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.040
So today I'm going to be covering
some content that will help you

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.660
improve the design and UI of your app,
whether it's for the iPhone, the iPad,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.210
or the Mac.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.900
Now, it would be impossible for me to
cover every single UI situation you're

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.280
going to face when designing your app,
right?

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.840
We could spend all week
talking about just UI design.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.050
And covering all the different
topics is not my intention,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.840
right?

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.130
The content that I've put
together today comes from my

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.060
experience designing apps at Apple,
but also from working with hundreds

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.870
of developers from all over the
world to help them improve the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.320
design and UI of their apps.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.560
So if there's just one thing that
you take away from my talk today,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.190
it should be this,
that each device is unique.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.620
So many developers don't consider the
unique characteristics of each device

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.460
when they're designing their app.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.440
So many of the iPhone and iPad apps
that I see have interfaces that are

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.420
kind of best suited for the web,
right?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.770
And their features make
more sense on a desktop.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.780
And lots of the Mac apps that
I see are using old computing

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.940
paradigms from the 80s and the 90s.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.200
And so when you design your app,
you need to make sure you're

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.740
considering the unique
characteristics of each device.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.840
To help you do this,
what I'm first going to do is review the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.000
device characteristics of the iPhone,
the iPad, and the Mac.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.740
I'm going to talk about the different
ways that people use each device

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.990
and how you need to really let
this impact the UI of your app.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.960
And after I review the
device characteristics,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.080
I'm then going to provide some detailed
design tips that will help you get

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.320
started with the UI of your app.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.400
OK, so let's get started.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.130
So first let's talk about the iPhone.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.340
As you know,
it's got a 3 and 1/2 inch screen,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.900
weighs less than 5 ounces.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.870
And this makes the iPhone
extremely portable,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.500
right?

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.840
And so you see iPhones everywhere, right?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.320
Walking down the streets,
in line at the grocery store,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.350
or at the bank, restaurants, meetings,
everywhere.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.720
Think about all the places
you've used your iPhone,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.630
right?

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.580
When you design an app for the iPhone,
you need to always take into

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.160
account its extreme portability.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.200
iPhone apps need to be simple.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.830
You just don't have time to be
waiting and learning a complex

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.510
and confusing user interface.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.390
And iPhone apps need to be quick.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.760
Users should be able to complete
their tasks really fast and move on,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.760
right?

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.540
And users need to know that
they can rely on the data in

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.600
your app wherever they are.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.790
So your app needs to be reliable as well.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.380
And they don't want to be surprised
when they're navigating different

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.900
parts of the user interface.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.520
Now the iPad.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.100
So like the iPhone, the iPad is portable,
right?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.200
It's a very portable device.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.400
But it's not pocket sized.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.560
What's unique about the iPad is
its 10-inch multi-touch display.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.460
It's beautiful, right?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.510
The iPad is really unique
because it's so light and thin.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.440
When you hold it, it actually feels like
you're just holding a screen.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.740
You don't even think about
all the advanced technology

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.170
and computing power behind it.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.840
And so when you design
an app for the iPad,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.260
you need to always think about
how to take advantage of this

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.760
large 10-inch multi-touch display.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.980
And so your app needs
to be highly visual.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.810
The layouts, the typography,
the graphics, they need to be beautiful.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.260
It should be immersive.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.420
Users spend longer periods of
time using an iPad app and your

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.710
app should account for this.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.890
And it should be realistic, right?

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.180
The 10-inch screen is great for
representing real-world objects

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.730
that you're able to actually
interact with with both of your

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.160
hands on the multi-touch display.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.170
And it should be flexible.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.180
Remember that there's no right
or wrong way to hold your iPad.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.190
So Macs come in all different
sizes from our 11-inch

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.190
MacBook Air to the 27-inch iMac.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.190
So your app also needs to
be flexible on the Mac,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.190
right?

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.190
This is definitely going to affect
the way that you design a Mac app.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.230
People love using Macs because
they're so visually appealing,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.730
right?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:02.080
We pay so much care and consideration
into every interface element on the Mac.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.200
And when you design your app,
it needs to feel right at home.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.600
In Lion, we've got lots of new
support for full screen apps.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.920
And every app developer that's working
on a Mac app needs to think about

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.190
how to take advantage of full screen
and what this means for your users.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.810
And there's a lot of new multi-touch
gestures in Lion as well.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.440
And we really think that these new
multi-touch gestures are going to

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.800
fundamentally change the way that
people interact with their Macs.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.700
And so in your app,
you need to really think

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.470
about what this means.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.450
Okay, so when you design your app,
really consider the unique

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.340
characteristics of each device.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.560
If you're designing for the iPhone,
make sure that you're always taking

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.490
into account its extreme portability.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.990
It needs to be fast.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.020
The UI needs to be simple and it
needs to be reliable wherever you are,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.500
right?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.600
And if you're designing for the iPad,
take advantage of that

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.120
large multi-touch display.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.830
Don't just treat the iPad
as another type of screen.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.530
It's really a unique device.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.140
It's not just a place to view
websites or a smaller computer.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.870
It's an iPad.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.000
It's really special.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.150
Take advantage of it.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.550
And then on the Mac,
if you're building an app for the

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.700
Mac App Store because you want to
reach more customers and really

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.210
get in front of a lot of people,
you can't just take your existing web app

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.720
or an app that's been designed for a PC.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.570
Or other platform and just put it on the
Mac App Store and expect to have success.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.310
You really need to think about OS X,
the most advanced desktop OS,

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.950
and how Lion's going to
affect the UI of your app.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.590
Okay, so let's now go into each of
the different devices and talk

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.390
about some design tips that you
can use in the UI of your app.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.100
So let's start again with the iPhone.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.370
And when the iPhone first came out,
there were some major

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.090
paradigm shifts in UI design,
right?

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.780
And the multi-touch screen
was a large reason for this.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.610
There's no longer any abstraction
between what you're seeing on

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.700
the screen and the input device.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.600
You're able to just reach
out and touch objects,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.670
direct manipulation, right?

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.700
And so we've seen some amazing
things come out from developers,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.540
many of you in the room, right?

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.660
So many great apps.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.340
But when you design an app
for the multi-touch screen,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.420
you need to remember to always
make the controls fingertip-sized.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.970
One of the most common problems,
probably the most common problem that

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.560
I see on iPhone apps are buttons and
controls that are designed for a cursor.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.600
They're too crowded and small and
it makes them really hard to tap.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.940
So imagine you're on an elevator
and they had buttons designed

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.680
for a cursor instead of a finger,
right?

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.760
And you're in a rush and you
get on and it would be really

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.490
hard to press the right floor.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.780
It would take a lot of time
and effort to just get the

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.540
floor that you wanted to go to.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.610
If you were in a hurry,
you might end up pressing all

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.420
the buttons above and below the
floors that you wanted to go to.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.050
It would be very frustrating, right,
because you just want to get

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.500
to the place and move on.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.960
And I know this sounds ridiculous,
but so many iPhone apps have this

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.080
same problem because they weren't
designed with a fingertip in mind.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.360
And in the iOS human
interface guidelines,

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:27.400
we recommend a minimum tap
target to be 44 by 44 points.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.860
And the built-in Calculator app
is a great reference to follow,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.750
right?

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.460
The buttons are nice and easy to tap,
and there's adequate

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.870
spacing between each one.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.700
But remember that iPhone
users are always on the go.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.460
So you need to vary the control
size based on how your users

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.740
are interacting with your app.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.700
So this is the Nike Plus GPS app.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.440
And if you haven't used it,
it's a great app.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.000
It's for joggers and it
lets you track the time,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.590
distance, location.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:03.030
Connects to a pedometer in
your Nike Plus sneakers.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.480
And it even gives you audio
encouragement if you're

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.740
listening to music on your iPod.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.050
And notice how they've made
the pause button nice and big

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.200
in the center of the screen,
right?

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.340
It's way bigger than the 44 by 44 points
that we recommend because it needs to

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.380
be easy to tap when the user is jogging.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.660
In your app,
really think about the different ways

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.950
that your users are going to interact
with it and make sure that you make the

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.950
buttons and controls adequately sized.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.900
Don't just test your app on the iOS
simulator or in your office and see,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.340
oh, is it easy to use here?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.020
Really go out,
put a development build on a device,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.070
go out in the real world the way that
people are going to be using your app,

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.620
and that's how you're going
to know it's easy to use.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.240
So you also need to streamline
navigation in your app,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.760
right?

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.840
Unless you're building some
type of adventure game,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.440
don't make the path to information
feel gimmicky or challenging.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.280
Users want to be able to access
the content quickly and get

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.810
tasks just done right away.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.700
So a great way to streamline navigation
in your app is to use swiping.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.610
And you guys are all
familiar with swiping.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.240
So this is the weather app.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.040
And we use swiping because it's a very
fast way to get to different data sets.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.760
So in the weather app, you can just swipe
between different cards.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.860
And you're moving between cities.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.060
And because we're relying on
a gesture for the navigation,

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.420
we're able to fill up the
entire screen with just content.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.890
And so when the user launches an app,
They see exactly what

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.390
they want right away.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.370
So many of you are using swiping in
your apps or thinking about using it.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.190
So I want to go through
some tips about swiping.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.900
And sure, all the items are equal, right?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.440
So in the weather app,
everything that you

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.170
swipe between are cities.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.480
And sure, they may be in different order
because where you live or the

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.000
different places that you go to,
but they're all cities.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.590
If you add different types of objects to
the things that you're swiping between,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.900
it can get very confusing for users,
right?

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.480
So say you were going
between a bunch of documents,

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.190
then all of a sudden you got
to a folder of documents or

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.390
something else altogether,
right?

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.110
So make sure all the
different items are equal.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.690
Make sure the content doesn't scroll.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.880
So when you're swiping on the iPhone,
it actually feels a lot like

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.510
you're physically kind of
shuffling a deck of cards.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.020
You're moving cards, you know,
just kind of -- and that

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.430
metaphor gets lost if the content
scrolls beyond the screen.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.760
Another reason you don't want to
have content scroll is because you

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.040
should provide visual indicators.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.170
And the most common,
easiest way to do this is to

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.100
provide those paging controls
underneath the swipeable object.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.130
And this lets users know
that they can swipe,

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:47.600
right?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.720
Those little dots underneath.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.520
And if you really don't want to
provide those paging controls,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.000
those dots underneath,
you need to think about another way

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.900
to let users know that they can swipe.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.900
You need some other type
of visual indicator.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.520
So maybe consider using,
showing whatever's to the left or to the

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.900
right of the currently selected item.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.890
And that's what we do in iMovie
and some of our iWork apps.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.660
And so look how nice this looks.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.460
It's a beautiful screen,
so it lets you choose the different

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.040
movies that you're editing.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.760
And not only does it look good,
it's a really fast UI, right?

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.860
Because you're able to see that large
movie poster and then the name of the

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.160
movie above and that great billboard.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.820
You're a lot less likely
to select the wrong movie,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.920
then have to go back out to an
unhelpful list of file names,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.610
you know, tap on something, go in,
load the movie, right?

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.860
So this is a great way to
really show the content.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.190
And we couldn't provide the
paging controls here because

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.530
there's commands underneath.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.980
So we show a little bit of
whatever's to the left or to

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.280
the right of the selected item.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.830
So now I want to talk about tab bars
because they're another great way to

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.750
streamline the navigation in your app.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.020
And Tab Bars are great for managing
complexity when you have a little bit

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.990
more of a lot different types of data,
right?

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.060
It's not all equal.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.960
So you're able to manage
different data sets.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.340
And you're all familiar with Tab Bars.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.980
So they're in lots of our built-in
apps and they're also in a lot

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.820
of your apps on the App Store.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.490
But so many developers that I meet with
just get confused about some of the small

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.490
nuances about how Tab Bars should work,
right?

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.490
They're almost used in
too many different ways.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.490
They're overused.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.490
And so I want to go through some
different rules about Tab Bars.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.540
So there should only be one tab bar
at the highest level of your app.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:41.030
If your app has so much different data
that you're thinking about using multiple

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.870
tab bars in different parts of your app,
the first thing you need to

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.900
do is just think about how
to simplify that data set.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.050
Get it down to the most important items.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.560
If you're really not able to simplify
the data set and you still think,

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.730
I need a tab bar in this part of
the app and a different one there,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.010
you should really think about--
or you should use a different

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.130
navigation system altogether,
probably lists.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.680
If you put multiple tab bars in your app,
users are going to get very

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.770
confused because they're not going
to know where the top level is.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.040
They're not going to know how to
get from one section to the other.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:20.400
Some tab bars have some items
and other tab bars have others.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:20.400
So just one tab bar.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.740
And tab bars should be mostly permanent,
right?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.400
Almost every screen of your app should
have a tab bar if you're going to use it.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.190
Users are going to look for this control
to get around the different sections.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.260
Now it's okay to remove the tab bar if
you need to maximize screen real estate,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.790
say for viewing content, viewing a photo,
or watching a movie,

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.340
reading a news article,
something like that.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.900
But if you remove the tab bar,
it should always be the last

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.650
leaf of your data hierarchy,
right?

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.100
It's important to provide good
icons and labels in your tab bar.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.900
So the labels need to
be concise and clear.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.450
There shouldn't be any
redundancy in them.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.760
Users should be able to read
them and right away know what's

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.320
going to be in that item.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.130
And the icons should be
really distinguishable,

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.460
right?

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.840
Each of them should have different shapes
so the user can really know what's in the

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.980
difference by quickly looking down there.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.340
And if you have tabs such as
featured or favorites or most viewed,

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.690
any of the ones that we
provide icons for in UIKit,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.560
you should use the
standard icons from UIKit.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.700
Users are accustomed
to seeing those icons.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.900
This is a lot less work for you.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:40.190
And there's not going to be any
confusion about what's in those tabs.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.400
And one of the great features in
iOS 5 is that you're able to now

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.090
customize the look of tab bars,
right?

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.980
You're able to customize the look
of lots of other controls as well.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.930
But tab bars are one of the
great ones to customize.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.970
So many developers that I've met with
just have customized their tab bars.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.920
They've rebuilt the entire
tab bar control for their app.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.920
But when they rebuilt it,
when they customized it,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.440
they weren't able to get all the nuances
of exactly what users are expecting,

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:09.930
right?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.000
So sometimes the selection
state isn't completely visible

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.060
or some of the other behaviors,
such as tapping on the selected items to

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.980
go back to the parent item of that tab,
just doesn't work.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.620
It gets really confusing.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.240
But now in iOS 5,
you can customize that look.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.030
So it doesn't necessarily
need to be black,

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.440
right?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.180
And if you don't like
the selection color,

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.950
you're able to change it.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.970
You want to be cautious here,
but it's a great feature if you want to

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.580
really match the aesthetic in the rest of
your app and still use standard controls.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200
There should only be five
visible items in a tab bar.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.790
So another reason that I've seen
a lot of developers customize

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.090
tab bars is to make them scroll,
right?

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.780
They have more than five items
and for whatever reason they

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.320
don't want to use the more tab.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.670
And so they create a tab bar that scrolls
and you can see more and more items.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.430
And a scrolling tab bar is really
problematic on the iPhone because

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.690
users on the go have a really hard time
swiping versus just tapping in that same

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.070
small area at the bottom of the screen.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.120
And so they often make mistakes.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.020
So there should only be five visible
items and use the more tab when you

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.710
have more items that you want to fit in.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.970
Prioritize which items make sense.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.530
Make those the first four tabs and then
implement the standard more button.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.880
And if you really want to avoid
using the more button just because

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.240
you can't figure out which are the
right four items to go in front,

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.900
again,
consider a different navigation model.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.170
Tab bars might not make
sense for your app.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.600
Don't force them in there.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.000
Lists are probably what you want to use.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.180
So let's talk a little bit about lists.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.180
And lists are great.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.980
They're another simple way to streamline
that navigation in your app when

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.130
you've got lots of different items
or just a few that fit on the screen.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.180
You can make them very visual lists.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.990
And we use them in apps like Settings,
right?

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.920
And when you have items that are similar,
you're able to group them

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.170
together and group lists.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.180
So they're great.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:03.180
It's very easy to read.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.350
Unfortunately,
a common trend that I've seen lately

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.490
are apps that have a springboard
of icons as their main navigation.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.140
And so you launch the app
and you just see this icon.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.500
And it's very jarring for users.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.150
They just came from the
iPhone's home screen where they

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.500
have a whole bunch of icons.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.840
Now they're in this other app that's got
another whole bunch of springboard of

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.480
icons that the user has to deal with.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.450
And it's confusing.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.500
And it's also really slow.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.590
Because on the iPhone home screen,
it's really fast to tap on it

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.500
to find apps because you've
customized the look of that.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.560
You've installed most of those
apps or there are apps that

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.500
came with the phone as well.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.500
And you're just used to
staring at them all day.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.380
You set them up.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.480
And you don't even read
the labels underneath.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.300
You just look at the icon.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.490
You tap that app and you're in.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.390
But no matter how good
your icons are in your app,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.700
users aren't going to be as
accustomed to seeing them.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.700
And so what they're going to have to do
is read the labels underneath each icon.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.700
And then their eye is going to
have to zigzag across the screen.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.580
It's just much slower.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.990
So avoid using a springboard of icons
in your app for the main navigation.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.960
Look how much easier this is to read,
right?

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.200
The user can just kind of look down,
they can see the icons and the labels,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.890
and just literally look and find
the item that they're looking for.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.640
Remember that the point of your
navigation is to allow your

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.140
users to get to content quickly.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.700
So this is Mint's app.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.100
And Mint is a great app for
managing financial information.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.780
You can set it up with
different bank accounts,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.270
credit card accounts,
different investments

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.240
that you might have.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.510
You can even track a
monthly budget for yourself.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.760
And what they've done is they've provided
a custom list view because for them,

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.570
an overview of all the different
information in your app was way more

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.230
important than just a single item,
right?

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.000
So a tab bar wouldn't
have made as much sense.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.220
And when you go into one of those items,
they wanted to use the full

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:09.010
screen for that specific item,
whether it's an account or investments,

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.800
right?

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.370
And so they didn't want that tab bar
to be permanent like it should be.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.900
They've also gone the extra step
of putting important content

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.000
right into the list view itself.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.320
So again, the content is right there.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.060
If you see maybe a low balance
or something is wrong with one

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.040
of your credit card charges,
you can just tap on that item right away.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.190
It's really fast.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.710
The text is nice and legible as well.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.080
On the iPhone,
you need to make sure that the

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.230
text is really easy to read
for your users wherever they're

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.800
going to be using your app.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.620
This is the Stocks app.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.750
Look at how big and easy to read
the numbers and ticker symbols are.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.820
User might be checking their
portfolio under a table in a

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.070
meeting or in a restaurant.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.400
So when you design your app,
if you need to increase the

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.580
font size and then it forces
content to move beyond the fold,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.700
right, it's not in the viewable area
and the user has to scroll,

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:07.790
that's fine.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.480
Don't worry about trying
to fit everything up there.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.530
On the iPhone, users won't mind scrolling
to see additional data,

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.100
right?

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.990
It's one of the most intuitive
gestures on the iPhone.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.900
It's one of the first things
you learn after tapping,

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.000
right?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.510
You know how to scroll with your thumb.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.100
Users will get really frustrated,
however,

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.500
if they have to constantly squint to
read the data in your app or bring

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.840
the device closer to their face.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.840
What they'll often do then is
just close your app down and say,

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.560
"Okay, I can't read this.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.000
I'm busy.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.070
I'll just check when I get back to the
office." And if they're doing that,

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.100
you've missed the whole
point of an iPhone app,

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.600
right?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.960
It's got to be portable.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.750
So make sure everything's easy to read.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.790
You want to plan for slow
internet connections.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.420
Design your app to feel fast.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.820
Many of your users are going to
be on slow cellular networks.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.470
And you shouldn't make your
app feel like a web page.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.800
Take advantage of the fact that
you're building a native iPhone app.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.510
And so when a user interacts with
an element on your screen that's

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.060
going to require a network load,
you should immediately transition to the

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.380
screen that's going to load that data.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.400
So you get that nice
animation right away,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.640
immediate feedback.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.600
And then that's where the progress
indicator should tell them,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.800
OK, now we're waiting for some data.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.460
If you just stay on the initial
screen when the user taps,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.880
it feels a lot like just a website,
right?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.560
And a lot of users won't even
notice that progress indicator

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.770
that you put on the screen.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:37.370
And so they'll continue tapping on that
network load and maybe even slow it down,

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.110
right?

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.920
So really think about how
to make your app feel fast.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.900
And a lot of times that's just
providing immediate transitions.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.720
It really breaks down the
load time of the internet,

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.480
because something happens right away.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.510
It feels faster.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.100
and plan for no internet connections,
right?

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.300
Your app should feel useful.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.420
And again, don't make it feel
like a static web page.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.890
This is the NPR News app.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.960
This is a great app for reading
all the content that's on NPR.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.370
And what they do, when you load it,
it actually loads all those top

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.460
stories into the background.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.520
It first loads the text,
and then it loads the photos afterwards.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.200
And it caches all of that, right?

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.810
And so they were thinking about
intermittent internet connection.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.780
So they first get the text,
then they'll go through and

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.730
get photos for each story.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:32.120
And so if you're maybe reading the
news on your morning commute on the

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.440
train and you go through a tunnel
and you lose the internet connection,

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.450
you're still able to tap on any of
these articles that you've never

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.500
tapped on before and read that article,
right?

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.390
That's really useful.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:46.060
They really thought about the
extreme portability of the device.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.560
And so in your app,
think about what your users might

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.520
want to do when they're offline.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.480
So put your app in airplane
mode and really think about what

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.690
the user could benefit from.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.540
Okay, so that was the iPhone.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.910
Remember to always design
for the extreme portability.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.500
Make sure that the UI doesn't
feel cluttered and confusing.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.580
And then it's easy to get to
all the information that you

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.320
want to get to very quickly.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.460
Okay, so now let's talk about the iPad.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.200
So, like the iPhone,
the iPad is extremely portable, right?

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.730
But it's not pocket-sized.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.290
What I said earlier was the iPad's unique
screen is what you need to always think

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.420
about when you're designing for it.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.710
So if you're bringing an app
from the iPhone to the iPad,

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.940
there's a lot of new
considerations to think about.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.330
What used to just fill the entire
screen of an iPhone doesn't

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:48.940
even fill a section of the split
view or a popover on the iPad.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.520
And this 10-inch screen makes the
iPad great for consuming content.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:59.620
So viewing photos or reading magazines.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.400
Watching movies.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.680
Because it's 10 inches and you
hold it so close to your face,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.380
it's actually a very
intimate viewing experience.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.440
It feels a lot like watching a television
that's on the other side of the room.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.990
But with the iPad,
you can reach out and touch that content.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.770
And those of you who've made a
FaceTime call on the iPad know how

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.780
intimate this experience can be,
right?

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.140
It feels very different from
an iPhone FaceTime call,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:24.140
right?

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.860
Because of the large size of the screen.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.650
- But when the iPad first came out,
a lot of critics were saying,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.020
"What's so special about the iPad?

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.500
"Isn't it just a big iPod
touch?" You've all heard this.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.370
It's just a big iPod touch, right?

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.050
So I wanna read you a great quote.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.370
Calling it an iPad, a big iPad touch,
is like calling a heated

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.540
swimming pool a big bathtub.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.140
So both have hot water,
but it's the size that defines

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.240
the way that you use each one,
right?

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:02.620
Because the bathtub is so small,
it's a very utilitarian thing, right?

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.990
You use it to clean
yourself or maybe to relax.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.030
It's very personal.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.160
The size of the swimming pool
completely defines the way we use it.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.100
We use it to exercise or to play.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.100
It's a place we interact
with other people.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.600
Similarly, the size of the iPad defines
the way that we use it.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.800
It's very different.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:28.460
For one thing, both of your hands can
fit on the iPad screen.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.710
Data entry is much faster.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.880
And the iPad's great for
representing real world objects.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.220
So this is drums in GarageBand.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.400
And I hope many of you have had
a chance to play with this app.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.080
It's a lot of fun.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.200
And you're able to just
kind of tap on the drums.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.260
It feels all realistic.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.660
You see all the movement.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.500
And it's great.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.750
We could have done this on the iPhone,
but it wouldn't have felt the same.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.430
So when you're designing for the iPad,
always take advantage of that screen

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.940
and make sure you're showcasing content.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.990
Don't just fill that screen with
unnecessary controls and all the

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.810
features that you may have cut
out from your desktop app because

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.550
now they'll fit on the screen.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.340
You still need to think about
how to showcase the content.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.540
So this is Pages.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.660
This is an app from our iWork suite,
right?

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.980
And it's an app with lots of features.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.870
But notice how much the
document just fills the screen,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:26.390
right?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.160
There's just a single toolbar at the top.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:34.860
No matter how many features your app has,
you should always try to provide all

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.240
the commands in a single toolbar.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.420
And put it at the top of the screen so
it pairs well with the OS status bar.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.200
And it doesn't feel like there's a
window or frame around all the content.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.430
And also,
it's much easier when a keyboard slides

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.100
up where the content needs to scroll
that the user doesn't need to worry about

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.410
that control bar kind of moving around.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.680
So this is an app called Architizer.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.690
This is a great app.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.740
It's a free app on the App Store.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.290
And it's an app that lets users
view different architecture

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.100
projects from all over the world.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.340
And Architizer actually had a
website before the iPad came out.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.160
They still have a website.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.940
And it allows you to view these
different projects that different

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.480
architecture firms are submitting,
these gorgeous photos.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.740
But when the iPad came out,
they completely rethought

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.260
the design for this device.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.930
And so you no longer have the
paging controls around the website.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:35.960
There's no all this extra different sets
of data that's surrounding these photos.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.340
You just use your finger and swipe.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.960
And as you swipe,
you just see more and more photos of

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.510
these gorgeous architecture projects.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.490
They really rethought
the design for the iPad.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.990
Once you've thought about how to
showcase the content in your app,

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.690
you should think about how
to enhance the interactivity.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.700
Remember that it's not just
about extra features in the iPad.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.700
So in the Photos app,
we took a lot of time to think about

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.500
how to make interacting with your
photos a lot more fun and natural.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.700
We didn't just add in
all this extra stuff.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.220
We really thought about the
transitions and how the users were

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.690
going to interact with the content.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.490
This is our choice.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.130
This is an interactive book from Al Gore.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.920
And our choice won an
Apple Design Award last night.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.280
It's a really fun book to interact with.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.030
And the content, again,
fills the screen here.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:33.420
And so when you're using our choice,
there's no table of contents.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.410
You're easily able to just move
the different photos and the text.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.710
You're able to pinch, flick,
swipe your way around.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.700
And it looks great.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.970
And it's fast to get to the different
places that you're looking at,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.380
the different chapters
or the different pages.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.340
Or infographics or whatever it may be.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.590
And it's also a lot of fun.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:54.800
This is Flipboard.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.600
This is an app that many
of you are familiar with.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.740
And this is an app that lets you
consume different internet feeds.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.050
So you can set up your
Facebook or Twitter account or

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:07.790
just follow other RSS or other
news sources that are on the web.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.810
And they really rethought this
whole concept for the iPad.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.090
So they took the design and said,
you know,

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.300
what makes the most sense on this
device or what do we want users

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.130
to experience on this device?

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.250
And it feels a lot like a
magazine reading experience.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.400
So you're able to just
flick the different pages,

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.240
flip them over.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.160
And it's a great way.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.430
It's not just this boring old
website that you're used to seeing

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.110
everywhere else and you're scrolling.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.800
They really thought
about the iPad's design.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.870
And in your app,
you need to think about how to take

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.520
advantage of this device as well.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.150
Okay, so popovers.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.540
Because the iPad screen is so large,
popovers are a great tool because

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.050
they provide context to the different
actions that a user may be doing,

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:52.430
right?

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.490
So this is the Photos app,
and so what happens when you have a

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.350
photo and you tap that action button at
the top is we throw out a popover and

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.560
it provides all the sharing options.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.780
And the contextual nature
of popovers is great.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.090
You're able to see the commands as
well as the content that they're

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.010
applying to right at the same time.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.460
And the popover is pointing
right back to the control.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.980
And so we use popovers in a lot
of different areas in our app,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.100
and they're great.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.620
So this is Numbers.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.240
So like Pages,
it's an app with lots of features.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.820
But we're able to really just
concentrate on the content here,

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.450
right?

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.280
There aren't controls all over the
place because what we did here is we

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.500
just provided the options that make
sense for the selected item in Numbers,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.190
right?

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.760
So if you have a chart selected,
when you go to the media

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.310
popover or the media button,
a popover comes out.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.560
And you just get different chart options.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.770
So there aren't all these extra controls,
but there's still a lot of

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.130
functionality in this app.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.090
But it looks really simple to use.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.900
We use popovers to display
different settings.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.470
This is iBook.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.440
And in iBooks, again,
the user should just

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:01.470
be focusing on reading.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.740
That's what they want to do.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.570
They don't want to look at an interface.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.900
But when they tap,
the controls show up on screen.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.940
And if they tap the display button,
they're able to see a bunch of settings.

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.440
So they can choose different
typefaces or other display settings.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.010
But when they tap outside of that area,
the popover just goes away.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.550
And they're back to
whatever they were doing.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.140
It's really fast.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.600
Remember that there's two
types of popovers on the iPad,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.140
modal and nonmodal.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.770
And nonmodal popovers are
what you see in most places.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.050
And they behave the way
that I just described.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.120
When you tap outside of them,
they just disappear.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.220
They're really fast to use.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.290
And so if you're designing a
nonmodal popover into your app,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.600
don't put a cancel
button at the top of it.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.120
Users will get confused about
what the cancel button is for.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.400
They'll think they need to read
every single option in that popover

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.860
because it's going to do something.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:59.060
And it also just adds visual complexity
to the popover where it's not necessary.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.320
So the only time you should have
a cancel button in your popover

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.740
is when you use modal popovers,
rather.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:10.740
And we use modal popovers when the
task's just a little bit more involved.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.560
So in editing an event in calendars,
this is a task that requires the

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.820
use of a keyboard or a picker.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.820
And users don't want to lose data
if they tap outside of that popover.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.090
Right?

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.920
So again, don't provide a cancel button
unless you really need it.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.620
And then you should
provide a modal popover.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:34.440
But as much as possible,
try to provide non-modal workflows.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.170
And just use the non-modal popovers.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.060
They're a lot faster.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.700
So you always want to provide contextual
feedback in an iPad app as well.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.980
So this is iTunes, the iTunes Store app.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.320
And we use animation throughout this app.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:53.380
So when you want to preview an album,
you just tap on it.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.730
And the cover art flips around.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.180
And there's a list of songs.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.930
And if you want to preview one,
you tap on the song.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.900
It animates to let you know it's
downloading from the internet.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.420
Then it animates again to let you
know how much is left in that preview.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.340
And then if you buy it,
it jumps over into the Downloads tab.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.340
So you can continue looking at
the other songs in that album.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.110
We don't force you to go over there.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.340
So it's a great way to just inform
users about what's going on.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.170
So let's take a look.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.220
So you just tap it.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.330
It flips around.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.500
[Transcript missing]

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.040
And then it just hops out.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.760
And notice that this
animation isn't gratuitous,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.420
right?

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.890
It's actually communicating
useful feedback about

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.420
what's going on in the app.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.720
So just don't add animation for the
sake of having animation in your app.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.400
Really think about the different
contexts and how you can provide really

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.170
meaningful information to your users.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.840
Okay, so take advantage of the fact that
when a user launches your app,

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.760
you can turn their iPad into
whatever you want it to be,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.210
right?

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.170
So this is DJ.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.820
And this is an app that also won
an Apple Design Award last night.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.940
It's a beautiful app and it
represents a set of turntables.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.210
And they've really added
physicality and realism to their UI,

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:13.910
right?

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.970
It looks like a real set of turntables.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:17.380
It's fun to interact with.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.340
And if you're a DJ,
right away you know what

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.030
all the different things do,
right?

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.190
There's the fader,
the different level meters,

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.420
you can even move.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.900
the needle to different
parts of the record.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.480
And so it actually informs
the user on how to use it,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.480
right?

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.480
And if you're not a DJ,
the beautiful graphics make you

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.480
want to interact with this app,
right?

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.480
Whenever I've shown this app to
somebody who hasn't seen it before,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.480
they want to grab my iPad
and just play around with it.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.480
They want to be the DJ, right?

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.840
This is Mathboard.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.640
This is an app for children
to learn basic arithmetic.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.800
And they've mimicked a classroom
chalkboard in their app,

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:52.990
right?

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:56.940
And so they've really paid attention
to all the little details here.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.580
The entire screen of the
iPad looks like a chalkboard,

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.140
right?

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.630
So they've got the colored chalk.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.460
They even got the wood trim
and the eraser up there.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.220
And if you look really
closely at this app,

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.070
there's actually chalk
residue on the slate,

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:09.320
right?

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.870
So it really feels natural.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.790
This makes the app a lot more fun
for learning math to young children,

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:17.480
right?

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.010
So in your app,
think about what kind of graphics make

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:24.100
sense and what kind of things you can
represent in the real world that will

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.720
help users learn how to use your app.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:30.060
Don't force physicality and realism
to your app if it doesn't make sense,

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.390
right?

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:33.870
There are advantages to the digital
world and what you can do there.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.400
But when you are able to provide
physicality and realism into your app,

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.480
it makes for a really great
first and lasting impression.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:45.660
Okay, so on the iPad,
you also need to consider

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.140
both orientations,
right?

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.600
Users expect to use your app in
whatever orientation they have

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.400
their iPad in when they launch it,
right?

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.820
And you should try your hardest
to meet this expectation.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.190
So you're all familiar with how
mail handles the orientation change,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.740
right?

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.920
It's a split view, and when you go from
landscape to portrait,

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.190
you see more of your message, right?

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.790
The inbox kind of hides
away into a popover,

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.510
and you can kind of swipe
to get it to come out.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.110
If you're using a split view,
hopefully you're doing

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.360
something very similar.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.900
It's pretty straightforward.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.800
But many developers
that I meet with ask me,

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.800
they say, we want to provide support
for both orientations,

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.230
but it's a little bit confusing.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.730
We're not sure what makes
sense in our custom UI.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.600
So I want to provide some
tips on what you should do,

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:33.230
what you should think about when
you're designing for both orientations.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:39.220
So remember that users are rotating
the device to see more content.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.200
They don't want to see different content.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:44.360
Many magazine apps that I've seen,
when you rotate them,

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.660
you see completely different photos
or news articles on the screen.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:51.550
And not only is this confusing for users,
most people just won't even

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.790
find that other content,
so they'll miss out completely.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.390
And so what a lot of other apps
have done then is provide these

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.140
annoying graphics on the screen,
and some of them even animate,

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.140
telling you, hey, rotate the device now.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.140
And if you rely on these graphics to
tell users how to hold their device,

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.990
it means you're out of line
with what they're expecting,

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.650
right?

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.640
Don't require users to
change orientations.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.650
So if you can't provide support for both
orientations throughout your entire app,

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.330
just be consistent and
stick with just one.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.960
If you require users to turn
their device at certain points in

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.420
their workflow and certain tasks,
it's going to feel really confusing.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.760
It might feel pretty buggy.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.320
They're looking at something
and then everything's sideways.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.270
Do I turn my head?

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.350
What's going on?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.370
So just be consistent and stick
with one orientation if you

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.860
can't provide support all around.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.160
And maintain focus on
the primary content.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.390
Remember,
you want to make it easy for users

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.640
to continue doing whatever they were
doing when they rotated the device.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.990
So if they're reading a news article,
they should easily be able to just

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:04.050
continue reading whatever part
of the story they were just in,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:04.680
right?

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:10.580
So really think twice about reformatting
content or rewrapping text lines.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.720
And if you do need to reformat content,
an animation is a great way

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.880
to provide the feedback about
what just happened to it.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:24.740
And if you are going to use animation,
a good tip to think about is really

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.630
just think about whatever content
you have in your app and think

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.940
about if it was a real world object,
what would happen to it with gravity

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.880
if you were to just rotate it?

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.740
And that should be the
basis of your animation.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.890
Okay, so that was the iPad.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.950
Always remember to design for this
large 10-inch multi-touch display

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.780
and treat it like a unique device.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.690
So now let's talk about the Mac.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.330
So in Lion,
we've gone through and updated

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.740
every control in AppKit.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.240
And so if you're using standard
AppKit controls in your Mac app,

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.930
you'll be all set.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.380
It'll feel right at home
on the new interface.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.080
But if you've customized the
UI of different buttons and

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.230
other controls in your app,
and they look old or they mimic

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.580
some of our old Aqua controls,
make sure that you're

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.910
refreshing your interface.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.740
Otherwise,
it's just going to feel dated and

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.830
kind of buggy when Lion comes out,
right?

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:24.050
We've kind of made a lot of
the gradients more subtle.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.240
Buttons are flatter.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.640
Edge treatments just aren't as strong.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.620
And you should really take a
look at what we've done to the

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.400
different controls in AppKit.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.060
A lot of the subtle changes that
we've made to these controls

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:42.200
in AppKit go a long way to
showcasing the content in your app.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:47.190
And so this is something that we
definitely learned from iOS and the iPad.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.840
Content is really important.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.060
And so one of these things that
you'll notice is the sidebar icons.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.120
They're now monochrome.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.200
They're not color.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.740
And you need to now provide monochrome,
white,

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.760
transparent PDF icons for your app.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.740
And it really makes the rest of the
content in your window stand out.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.200
In some of our other apps like Mail,
we've also reduced color

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.590
in the toolbar as well.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.000
So content again comes
out a little bit more.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.590
And a much more noticeable
change is that scroll bars aren't

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.890
visible when you're not scrolling.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:28.450
So there's a lot less attention to
different interface elements in a window.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.690
It's about the content.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:35.050
So good tips for designing lists now
that scroll boards aren't visible

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.880
is that you should think about
providing nonintegral amount of rows

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.260
when you can so that data kind of
gets cut off in that viewable area.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.040
And that way users know that they
can kind of just grab their mouse

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.170
or trackpad and flip to see more.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.000
Design a beautiful icon for your Mac app.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:58.800
This is something that Mac users expect
much more than users of other platforms.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.000
It gives users their first impression
of your app on the Mac App Store.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.200
And I'm sure many of you have this
situation where you're downloading

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.560
an app from the App Store and
you see the icon and it's okay,

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.000
but it's not great.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.320
And it makes you wonder,
how much care and consideration did

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.390
the developer put into this app?

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.550
It might be buggy,
they didn't think about how to

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.200
simplify different workflows.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.900
So it's really important
to design a beautiful icon.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.280
And with Launchpad,
it's more important than ever before.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.730
If you're coming from iOS,
make sure you design a

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.400
new icon for the Mac.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.720
Those rounded square buttons in iOS just
doesn't feel appropriate on the Mac,

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.400
right?

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.400
On the dashboard or on the
launch pad or on the dock.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.400
So this is GarageBand.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.360
These are both of our icons.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.390
But one is clearly designed for the iOS
and the other is designed for the Mac.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:53.800
There's a distinct shape so it's
easy to find in the user's dock.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.120
And designing an icon is
a highly specialized task.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.570
So even if you're the type of
developer that's designing all the

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.530
UI yourself and using standard app
kit controls and interface builder,

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.840
you haven't hired a
designer to help you out,

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:13.120
you should at least hire a
designer to design your icon.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.130
So popovers are now on the Mac.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.550
They're standard app key control, right?

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:23.620
And like the iPad,
they're great for managing complexity.

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:28.630
In iCal, we realized that users don't
often turn on and off calendars.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.680
It's not a task that they frequently do.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.880
So we put those controls in a popover.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:39.180
This, again, allows the content of the
window to really stand out.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.990
We also use popovers in Safari.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.620
We replaced the need for the
utility downloads window.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.180
And this is great because the user
doesn't need to manage their interface,

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:50.610
right?

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.700
And the downloads window
was always kind of annoying.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.920
It kind of popped up,
then got hidden behind,

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.940
but it was peeking through.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.220
You'd close some windows and
you'd discover it was still open.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:02.220
Well, with popovers,
the user doesn't need to

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.700
manage their interface.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.560
And this is really important
because in full screen,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.980
these utilities and floating palettes
and other things that are around the

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.050
screen just aren't going to make as
much sense in your full screen app.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:17.050
And so popovers are a great way to
provide a lot of these controls in

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.600
your full screen version of your app.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.080
So let's talk a little bit
more about full screen.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:26.600
So if your app is about consuming
content or creating content,

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:31.400
your users are really going to appreciate
a well-designed full screen app.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.240
Now if your app is kind of a utility type
of app that users don't frequently use,

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.860
maybe it runs in the background, well,
full screen might not be appropriate.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:44.360
It's not for every app
on the Mac App Store.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.950
But remember that lots of
our users are running 11-inch

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:49.440
or 13-inch MacBook Airs now.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.560
And they're going to want to run every
app that they have in full screen.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.600
With the gestures,
it's just so easy to swipe between them.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.520
It's this great controlled experience.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.320
So let's talk about some tips for
designing your app for full screen.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.660
Think about the user context.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.650
So here's preview in full screen.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.400
When a user enters full
screen for preview,

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.660
we hide the toolbar by default.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.440
Because we thought about what's the user
likely to do in full screen in preview?

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.780
They want to read the document.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:21.980
They're not likely to search for
different things or make annotations.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.910
In your app, think about what your
users are going to do.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.020
In Mail, we show the toolbar by
default in full screen.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.620
Because users are frequently
going to need to tap on the

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.260
different controls up there,
even in full screen.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.830
right?

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:36.640
Don't remove features.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.360
Users will get really frustrated if they
constantly have to exit full screen just

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.060
to complete common tasks in your app.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:47.460
And maybe it's OK to not provide
functionality for everything,

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.450
settings, or setting up accounts,
something that you do maybe

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:51.900
once or twice in an app.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:57.020
But everything else that they normally do
should actually operate in full screen.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.540
Focus on content.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.940
This is iPhoto.

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:05.140
In full screen,
the whole interface gets dark.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.900
It really makes the photos and
videos in your library just pop out.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.200
This dark interface would have felt
really out of place in a window

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.670
because it just wouldn't match any of
the other interface elements on OS X.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.730
But take advantage of the
fact that in full screen,

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.180
you don't need to match
any of that other stuff,

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:22.800
right?

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:26.960
And so you can use these darker interface
controls or whatever makes sense for your

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.040
app to really have a full experience.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.880
Take advantage of the
horizontal real estate.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.460
So, Macs come in different
sizes as I talked about,

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.850
11 inch to 27 inch,
but they all have 16 by

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.540
9 screen aspect ratios.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.820
So, when we redesign mail,
we move the messages from above the

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:51.360
selected message over to the left
to take advantage of this space.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:56.680
And this is a consideration for the
window mode of your app as well.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.850
But it makes a huge
difference in full screen,

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.200
right,
when it's filling that entire screen.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:08.080
OK, so on the Mac,
users also expect the graphics and the

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.260
whole experience to be really engaging.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.270
This is something that's
also unique about OS X.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.300
So this is photo booth in mind.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:19.210
And those curtains, they look great,
and they kind of animate open and close,

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.180
depending on what you're doing.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.360
It sets up this mood for
how much fun this app is.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:26.780
This is versions.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.700
This is a utility feature,
but it looks great.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:33.320
And the graphics actually
tell the user what's going on.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.380
The three-dimensional view of
the different versions going

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.240
back into time and space,
it's actually helpful.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:41.690
Don't just add over-the-top
graphics to your app just

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.290
for the sake of having them.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.970
Really think about how to provide
useful feedback about what's going

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:51.700
on in your app and kind of setting
the mood for what you want your

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.380
users to kind of think about.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:59.900
OK, so the last thing I want to cover
on the Mac side are gestures.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:03.130
So as I mentioned earlier,
we really think that the new

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:07.720
multi-touch gestures in Lion are going
to fundamentally change the way a lot

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.760
of people interact with the computer.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.240
But you need to be cautious about
implementing gestures in your app.

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.540
So let's go over some rules.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.700
Support the standard behaviors.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.240
This provides consistency across
all the different apps that a user

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:26.200
is going to be using on the OS.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.600
And think about the different
gestures that make sense for your app.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.060
Don't just add all the support for
all the new multi-touch gestures

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.660
in your app because you think it's
going to be cutting edge and cool.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.340
If it doesn't make sense,
users are going to get frustrated.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.600
It's going to feel gimmicky.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.640
So just think about the
ones that make sense.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:49.600
Think about gestures like
accelerated keyboard shortcuts.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:54.820
Every command that you have hooked up
to a gesture should have an equivalent

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.500
UI affordance or keyboard shortcut.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.850
A lot of users won't have
trackpads attached to their Mac.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.210
If you just rely on the gesture alone,
you're going to be

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:05.200
cutting those users off.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:10.600
Other users might disable the
gestures for accessibility reasons.

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.700
So make sure you don't
rely on gestures alone.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.300
Provide responsive feedback.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.260
When a user interacts
with their touch screen,

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.270
the screen should update and
let them know what's going on.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.770
So if you're rotating a photo,
the photo should actually rotate so

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.290
it feels like you're grabbing it.

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:29.350
And if you're swiping,
items should come in from

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.290
the left or the right sides.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.850
Be careful about
defining custom gestures.

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:40.990
Most users won't discover them and they
probably won't remember them either.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.020
Again,
going back to the keyboard metaphor,

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:47.890
a custom gesture is a lot like
an obscure keyboard shortcut.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.530
Users just won't remember about it.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:51.600
Sometimes they'll just
discover it accidentally.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.700
Like, what just happened there?

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.700
So be really careful about
defining custom gestures.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.300
Okay, so that was the Mac.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.850
Really take the time to learn about
all the new features and the way that

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.350
we've redesigned the interface for Lion.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.310
Make sure that your app
feels at home on OS X.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.520
OK, so I know I covered a
lot of material today,

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.260
so I want to leave you
with some final thoughts.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.420
So at the beginning of the talk,
I talked about how each of these

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.580
different devices were unique.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.280
But I hope you now realize that
there's a lot of similarities

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.660
between the different devices,
right?

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.940
Your goal is the same.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.600
You're trying to make
your app easy to use.

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:35.100
You want to showcase content
on all the different devices.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.710
It should be beautiful.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:40.240
They expect a really engaging experience.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.760
But you need to consider the
unique characteristics of each

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.700
device to accomplish this goal,
right?

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:49.300
You need to design for a specific device.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:52.090
On the iPhone, you should think about
the extreme portability.

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.460
Think about how to make
it fast and reliable.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.740
On the iPad, make it immersive.

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:57.690
Make it fun.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.200
Make the graphics beautiful.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:05.010
And you can use realism to take advantage
of that large multi-touch screen.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:09.730
And on the Mac, think about OS X,
all the great features it provides.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:13.400
Think about why Mac users
love to use a Mac.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:16.910
And make sure that your app doesn't
feel just like another web page or

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:20.580
an app from a different platform
that was just ported onto the Mac.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.530
It won't be as successful as it could be.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.010
And refine your feature set.

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:33.900
When you target a highly focused
set of features for your app,

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.500
you're able to ensure that everything's
going to work out just right.

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:40.880
You can deal with animations,
the graphics, different edge cases that

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.580
might come up in the later
part of your development cycle.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.340
If you just try to build
so many different things,

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:49.690
you're often going to need to
sacrifice the UI and user experience

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:51.390
of different parts of your app.

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.150
Think about the different
features that we provide in the

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.540
different platforms that we have,
right?

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.010
So iMovie, Mail, iWork.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.920
We have apps on the iPhone, the iPad,
and the Mac.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.240
And think about which features that we
put in there and what makes sense for

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:09.040
all the different ways that people use
each device that I've been talking about.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.640
And finally, delight your users.

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:18.060
Remember that your goal is to enable
your users to use your app in the most

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:21.440
intuitive and delightful way possible.

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.060
And I hope you can get started
with a lot of the tips that

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.130
I went through today on your app.

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.980
So I didn't cover so many
different topics on UI.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.980
So please make note of my email address.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:38.710
And get in contact with me later this
week or after the show if you have

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.630
specific questions on the UI in your app.

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.280
And make note of the human
interface guidelines where we

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.320
keep them on our developer site.

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:50.020
And we're working really hard on
an update for the Mac OS X human

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:50.840
interface guidelines.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.550
So stay tuned about that.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.690
All right, thanks for listening.
