WEBVTT

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.540
That's my cue.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.130
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.740
Thanks for coming.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.790
It must have been the LLVM session before
us that really brought you into the room,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.090
and you're just hanging out for this.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.300
Hopefully, you're here for building
iAds with iAd Producer.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.230
My name is Mark Malone,
and I'm part of the iAd team.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.300
And I've got some pretty
exciting stuff to show you today.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.300
I'm really proud to be the one up here
on stage to be showing you this tool.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.430
There's a lot of power
within iAd Producer,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.270
and it does a lot of things for you.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.600
And it was released in
December of last year,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.040
and this is the first opportunity
that we've been able to be on stage at

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.250
WWDC to actually show off the product.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.190
And so, brief agenda of what
I'm going to go through.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.400
First, I've got a couple different videos
that I took of a couple ads that

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.300
are out there just to give you
a feel for the iAd experience.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.540
And then we're going to dive into
the tool and talk about sort of

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.300
the code-free design techniques
that the tool really affords you.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.470
The ability to get in and use high-level
objects to build a lot of functionality,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.300
a lot of creativity
without a lot of work.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.350
And then, of course,
there's programmers in the room,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.790
hopefully, going beyond that,
going beyond sort of the drag

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.290
and drop and instantiation of
objects that are created for you.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.740
How to take it the next step
is something that's a big

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.300
part of iAd Producer as well.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.300
It's not just templates.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.290
It's also going beyond that.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.290
And then finally,
how to share your ad with other folks.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710
Once you create an ad,
you want to stick it on a device

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.300
or send it to your customers.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.420
There's ways that you can share
them using the tool and outside

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.300
of the tool that I'm going
to walk you through as well.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.220
So let's get going with just a quick
overview of the iAd experience.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.300
This one's pretty clever.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.380
It's one of the earlier ones that
was created with iAd Producer,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.300
and it's for Guinness.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.300
And it uses a nice chalkboard
background like you'd find in a pub.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.290
And it's got four different options
that you can go in and navigate.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.390
And the first one is the ability to
go and download the Pub Finder app

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.290
from Guinness right within the ad.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.990
And so that's pretty sweet,
not having to exit out of the ad in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.300
order to download this particular
application on your devices.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.190
Like one of those great features.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.400
It also has this challenge game in
that you can question and answer sort

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.280
of if you do the questions right,
then you get a surprise at the end.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.430
And it's got this pour
capability within it as well,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.340
which is sort of you swipe
through the various steps of

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.300
pouring your Guinness beer,
which is extremely important.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.300
To get it right,
you've got to have the right glass.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300
You have to have the
glass at the right tilt.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.270
And you need to pull the tap with
just the right velocity so that you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.300
can get that beer with the foamy
head that you love at the end.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.300
And that's what this ad is here.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300
And the way that you go between these
steps is by swiping your fingers across.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.180
And there's also some arrows
that they put up there to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.860
give you a visual way to say,
"Ah, okay,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.250
if I go and tap on these arrows,
that's another way that I can go and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.050
navigate it." It's got another cool
feature that you'll see in a lot of iAds,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.300
especially ones with rich content above
and beyond just sort of the brand itself.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.280
A lot of folks have imagery that they
want to offer up to the customers,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.340
people that are viewing these
ads and have them set their home

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.290
screen and those types of things.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.710
And so,
this is a great way to go and get the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.300
brand front and center on the device
for the home screen and the lock screen.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.210
And again,
setting that as staying within the ad,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.300
staying within the developer
application as well.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.070
And so,
that's an example of an iPhone ad.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.270
And here's one that
just released this week.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.300
This is for Falling Skies.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.220
And it's a series that's
going to start up in June.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.300
And this is an iPad ad.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.940
And the nice thing about it is
it's really taking advantage of the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.300
large landscape afforded on an iPad.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.300
And so, they've got these data or
image wells lined up there.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.120
And you can tap on each one
of the wells and watch a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.300
preview of the upcoming season.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.270
And so, they've really put in a
lot of exciting content.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.300
And this is showing video in line,
which is sweet.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.300
It's not going full screen and
taking over the entire page.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.860
And so, that's sort of making use of some
really nice HTML5 whizziness to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.160
create a really great experience.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.300
And they also have some
stills in here as well.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.220
So, some stills from some of the scenes.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.180
When they were shooting,
they've captured those

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.290
through them in here.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.250
And so, you can resize them in
the same sort of thing.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.300
Save them as backdrops or lock screens,
those types of things.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.260
So, those are a couple examples.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.720
I'll talk through sort of the
features and how you can go and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.300
add that within an iAd for sort
of the rest of the progression.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.850
Sort of the killer feature that's
remaining in this particular ad is the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.300
fact that this particular movie series
has a release date associated with it.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.540
And we've exposed the calendar
APIs to folks who have gone and

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.250
built iAds so that they can go
and add an event directly to the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.300
user's calendar from within the ad.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.990
So, that's particularly sweet in this
particular circumstance because

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.300
this season has a start date.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.880
And if the user wants to
add it to their calendar,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.300
they can do it right from within the ad.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.280
And boom, it's on their calendar.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.300
It's going to get synced wherever
their calendar events go.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300
So, that's pretty nice as well.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:08:30.700
[Transcript missing]

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.980
So this is an iAd Producer project and
the typical way that you'll go through

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.800
and create one of these projects,
create your iAd,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.680
is basically beginning from some sort
of design effort where you're comping

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.680
up what you think should be the creative
vision for your particular customer.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.340
And then there's typically a development
stage where you hand it off to somebody

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.760
to add some nuance perhaps to go sort
of beyond sort of what's built in.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.380
And then there's this
deploy capability where,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.640
okay, now let's go put it on a device,
put it out there where

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.140
other people can find it,
put it where our customers can review it,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.860
and that sort of stuff.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.920
And so that's the way I'm going to
divide the rest of this presentation

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.400
up into these three buckets.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.670
And I'll start with design.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.490
So at the get-go,
if you haven't seen iAd Producer,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.720
this is what it looks like,
especially when you first launch it.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.100
It provides a widescreen
bird's-eye view of the overall ad.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.160
And it shows proxies for all
of the pages from the band.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.080
It shows the banner all the
way to the leaf pages that

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.470
you've created for your ad.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.280
And it does it for
iPad as well as iPhone,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:39.360
any iOS device you could create
in iAd with this tool within it.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.300
And don't let sort of the orientation
of the objects on the screen fool you.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.180
I mean,
you're always going to have a banner and

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.860
some sort of splash while your ad loads.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.460
But how you arrange the leaf
pages over on the right-hand side,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:56.130
whether you have a menu
with a bunch of leafs,

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:56.140
sort of the hub-and-spoke model,
or you decide to go right to one page,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.320
and then sort of sequentially
go through those pages,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.790
you can really design
your ad any way you want.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.010
This is sort of the template
that we use for most ads that

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.570
you'll see out there on the wall.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.500
But the reality is you can arrange
the pages in any sort of fashion

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.300
and navigate them the way you wish.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.600
So let's go ahead and start with the ad.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.510
As a designer,
when you're in design mode,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.290
you're choosing objects from
a palette of built-in objects.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.810
The fact that I'm in the context of
a particular page here will drive

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.700
the objects that are there for me.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.750
And there's things like
text fields and labels,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.060
as you would expect,
but there's really a lot of

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.690
high-level functionality that's
in this object palette as well.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.690
So you can throw a scroll view on there,
sure, that's pretty straightforward,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.700
but you can also put a
carousel on your page.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.630
And dropping the carousel
on there instantiates one,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.640
and it also adds all the
functionality to it as well.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.950
So you get the visual capability
of a carousel as well as

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.700
all that interactivity.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.820
And that's all hooked up just
by using these various objects,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.700
and I'll demo that in just a second.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.630
And when you're in design mode,
it's all about not writing code.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.960
So you go and you grab from
your object's palettes,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.500
you lay these items out on a screen,
and then the way that you

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.630
go and you style them is
through a property inspector.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.680
For a selected item,
you can go and twiddle some items.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.700
Over on the right-hand side,
use rotators or a slider,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.700
maybe type a little text
into a particular field.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.490
But it's all about at this stage
when you're in design mode,

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.670
not writing any code.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.100
Just selecting objects,
setting various properties,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.610
and then moving on to the next step.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.520
And the same thing is true
for animation as well.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.920
We've got built-in animation,
so you can select an item and say, "Okay,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.440
for this particular item,
I want it to move on the screen in

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.240
this sort of way." And we'll take
care of generating all the required

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.700
actions in order to make that
animation happen when the ad is done.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.700
So again, the goal is to make it
code-free at this step.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.670
You're in design mode,
and it's pretty straightforward to go

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.700
and add a lot of functionality just by
setting bits and not writing any code.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.030
We also keep all of the assets
associated with an ad there within the

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.700
project over on the right-hand side.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.240
So if you've got images
that you've brought in,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.050
you just drag, drop them onto the canvas,
light them up however you want,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.700
style them.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.700
All of the assets are kept
over on the right-hand side.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.650
They're delivered with the project.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.700
But they're also small.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.970
And they're smart enough to
know that they might have come

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.680
from a folder on a server,
for example.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.210
And so when they change, perhaps,
out on the server from

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.590
FPOR to the real deal,
there'll be an indication over

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.210
on the right-hand side that,
"Oh, there's a new version of

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.700
that image available."
And then you can re-import it.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.700
So it's really nice.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.240
It creates a self-contained
unit that contains all of the

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.700
assets associated with it.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.450
And then finally,
the way to go and experience on the

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.700
device is there's the ability to share.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.750
And so as long as I have an
iPhone that's on the same

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.200
Wi-Fi network with the laptop,
or the workstation that

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.050
I'm building this ad,
I can launch the iAdTester on my

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:47.220
iPhone and experience the ad as
it is built and running within

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.700
the iAdProducer application.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.700
And so I'll show that
in a second as well.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.790
You launch iAdTester,
you'll see the machine that's got it,

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.700
and you can choose from
the various banners.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.700
You launch it, and you can really
experience it on the device.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.650
This is great because it means
you can go back and do some subtle

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.970
tweaks over in the interface,
go back to iAdTester, pull it up,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.700
look at it, it's like, "Ah, yeah,
that's the way I wanted it to look."

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.700
So that's sort of a killer feature from
an experience and refinement perspective.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.430
So with that,
what I figured I'd do is get out of

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.630
slides and have some fun with a demo.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.700
So right now I'm in the iOS simulator,
and I've got iAdTester launched.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.340
iAdTester is installed automatically
by iAdProducer when you first

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.680
launch one of the ads that you're
building within iAdProducer.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.710
And you can see that I've got this
one particular ad that I've embedded

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.700
within the tester so that I can show
you what we're going to go and create.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.700
And so this is the Hudson Telegraph demo.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.000
You'll see this in the next rev of the
tool that'll be included in the extras

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.700
directory when you download the image.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.700
And it's sort of this steampunk
sort of ad that tells you that,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.900
you know, sending a telegraph is really
the most modern way to go and

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.700
send a message across the USA.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.700
So it's clearly got
some convincing to do.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.410
But you saw that when it loaded,
it had this nice little animation

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.670
in of the text at the bottom.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.690
That letter flew in.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.800
And if I go into it,
you'll see this drop-down

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.690
animation that's provided
there and then three buttons.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.700
There's this image here.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.200
If I hit history and rotate the device,
then here's an ad that's got a

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.700
bunch of different little sort
of pieces of content in there.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.690
Sort of tells the story of the
Hudson Telegraph over time.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.700
And I can interact with this
just by moving across the screen.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.630
And then it has a locations
and a try it capability.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.030
The locations allows you to
basically find where the local

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.700
telegraphs are in your area.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.940
So you can go and send out that great
telegraph that you want to send to

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.700
get your message across the USA.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.700
And there's this little try it bucket
here where I can go and type some text

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.930
and have it converted to Morse code,
which is incredibly useful as well.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:16.600
[Transcript missing]

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.640
So at the get-go,
the first thing it asks you is

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.820
what kind of ad you want to create.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.730
Do you want to create one
for iPod Touch or iPhone,

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.980
or do you want to create one for an iPad?

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.440
And we're going to
recreate that Hudson one,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.980
so we're going with the iPhone.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.560
And right away,
you get that bird's-eye view.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.060
And we haven't done anything here yet.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.140
We haven't laid out any
content or anything.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.300
And so it's got basically the
standard hub-and-spoke template,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:37.800
as I said.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.990
But, of course, you can go and change it.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.700
But it's sort of laid out
with these placeholders.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.170
It says, "Hey, let's go build an ad.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.340
Here's some places where
you can drop some things."

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.060
If I double-tap into one of these
pages or double-click to go into them,

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.540
you'll see that the first thing you
see is a series of templates that can

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.830
be the starting points for the banner.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.040
I double-clicked on a banner,
so it's bringing up banner templates.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.840
If I double-click within
one of the other leaf pages,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.000
then it'll provide
templates for that as well.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.960
And so there's things like
image text or dynamic text.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.400
It's got a text widget that does
some cool animation automatically.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.000
There's one that's just a pure image.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.160
And of course,
you can create one that's blank as well,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.000
and that's the one that
I'm going to choose.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.200
You don't have to pick a template.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.560
It's just blank.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.310
And once you choose a template
or a placeholder for this

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.880
particular page that I'm on,
here's the banner,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.500
it'll create this little
proxy of what it looks like.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.460
And it's a blank banner.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.940
It doesn't have any content on it,
so naturally, it's going to look fairly

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.120
uninteresting and blank.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.790
But now,
the next time I double-pump to go

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.200
in and take a look at this banner,
it pulls me into sort

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.950
of the drill-down view.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.840
Once I'm in this view,
I can start dragging elements on.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.840
And I can start building my banner.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.720
You'll notice over here
on the left-hand side,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.800
there's this gutter.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.840
The gutter allows me to go
and create multiple banners.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.470
You're going to have multiple banners
any time that you create an ad.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.580
And typically have a banner that's
specific to sort of the targeting

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.200
model that you might be using.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.140
You might have one banner that
targets one kind of individual

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.680
that draws them into the ad.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.240
Well, you're going to go and create
a banner for each one of those.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.870
And they'll show up
along the left-hand side,

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.440
but the sample,
I'm just going to run through

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.640
and create one quickly.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.680
And so you can hide this,
get a little more real estate.

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.370
There's this view option up
here where I can go to 100%

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.370
and see 100% of the pixels.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.630
Really give me a lot more real
estate to play around with.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:25.160
And there's some buttons along
the right-hand bottom side that

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.720
I can go and take a look at.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.320
And one of the things,
since I've got the banner selected here,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.920
is it tells me that, you know,
I'm on this particular banner.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.430
It's got a name of blank,
and I can change it,

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.570
give it some name that will
show up in the rest of the UI.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.280
Maybe I'll call it the right thing.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.970
banner.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.510
And I can do something to the banner
right here without dragging any

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.560
assets and mainly it's going and
setting the background properties

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.000
of this particular banner.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.590
And so we've built in the ability to
go and set gradients as a background

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.980
so you can go and choose a color,
drop it in, and drag the sliders around,

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.460
right?

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.990
Get simple gradients going in there.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.090
I can create one that's
linear just by swapping it,

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.990
change where the light source is
or where the gradient comes from.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.650
I can actually go and add multiple
points as well and create something

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.200
that's relatively hideous or attractive.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.440
But, you know,
this is how easy it is to go and

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.000
set a gradient as a background.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.680
Gradients are key backgrounds especially
because they're very lightweight.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.140
It's not using images and we
do all the work of actually

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.410
applying the gradient at runtime.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.600
There are other options in here.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.390
I can go and have an
image as a background.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.070
I can choose a standard color from
a color picker as the background.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.960
You get what I'm talking about.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.090
Pretty straightforward.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.780
I can even have something with none.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.540
Now I'm going to go and pull some
assets in to go and build this ad.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.100
And so what I'll do is I'll
click on the assets button over

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.520
on the lower right hand side.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.370
And as you can see I don't have
any assets associated with this ad,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.200
but we're assuming that you've got
some production capability within your

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.850
organization that has either already
created some web assets or somebody's

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.300
cutting things out of Photoshop files.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.400
Once you get those,
they're ready to go and drop into

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.400
iAd Producer and use them to go
and build out the ad experience.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.960
So I just went and
dragged that folder there.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.630
Again, if I had a server volume mounted,
I could point to it and just

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.100
import through the import assets
menu as well and point to it.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.540
And you'll see that we pull
in all of the assets that are

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.810
sitting within this directory
and organize them alphabetically.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.740
You can go in and type things like,
let me pull back all the

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.600
files that start with J.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.080
Or I can actually do it by type as
well by using the little gear here.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.980
Just show me those
images that are in here.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.330
Very selectors here in order
to go and pull back things

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.100
that I've already created.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.100
Very selectors here in order
to go and pull back things

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.100
that I've already created.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.100
Once you get those,
you can go and drag them

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.100
into your iAd Producer.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:36.300
And you can go and drag
them into your iAd Producer.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.610
in order to go in and pull
back things that I want.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.860
and filter it however I want.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.320
Make it go show all.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.860
And you'll also notice that up
here at the top it's got the

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.140
name of the image that I've
selected as I scroll around here.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.260
But it also has these
two size indicators.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.190
What we expect when you drag assets
into iEdProducer is that you're

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.340
giving us the retina display artwork.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.160
So we're expecting the full size display.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.340
And then what we'll do if you
haven't provided the half resolution

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.160
or the standard display is
actually take your high res art and

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.800
convert it to the standard display.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.290
And so with one image we'll automatically
generate that lower resolution display.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.200
Now that doesn't mean that you're
stuck with the one that we created.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.770
Maybe it's a fine line that when we go
and compress it in order to get the other

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.650
resolution it sort of loses its fidelity.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.640
You can always right mouse click on
the file and be able to go and swap

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.690
out that one X rendition that we
created and pull in your own one.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.500
And this is how you would go and
swap out different files as well.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:54.900

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.960
And then I'm going to go and
drop a couple more objects.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.900
And I showed you in the slides
the objects menu has a series of

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:05.040
things that are just grabbable
right out of the palette and

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.400
droppable right onto the page.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.180
Depending on the context that you're in,
I'm in a banner context,

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.710
then this list is going to be
filtered down to things that

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.530
are appropriate for a banner.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.600
And so one of them is a label.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.910
And so I'm going to recreate
that Hudson Telegraph fly-in

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.700
text using a couple labels here.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.770
I've got a label selected.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.790
If I go back to the inspector,
you'll see that it's changed based on

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.570
the fact that I've got a label selected,
and I can go and change

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.710
the name of that label.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.800
I can play around with its sizing
using the metrics inspector.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.600
I also have style capability.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.710
I can play around with the text as well.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.690
And so that's pretty hard to see there,
so I'm going to select it and actually

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.430
choose some white text so that it's
the color that shows up best here.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.160
Great, that's my label.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.320
I can also change the font here.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.040
I've got a font picker.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.590
The fonts that are here in the
dropdown are the ones that are

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.130
guaranteed to be on the device.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.630
You might have a slew of
fonts on your workstation,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.970
but these will only show up the ones
that you either imported into the project

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.950
as SVG fonts for custom fonts or that
are guaranteed to be on the device.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.080
So it's filtered down for you.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.860
And the Cochin font is the
one that the sample uses,

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.660
so I'll go and use that font.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.370
I'm going to want to add a
little bit of shadow so that that

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.930
text sticks out a little bit.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.180
And it said the Hudson.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.510
And to the graph.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.600
Go ahead and give it
a little style there.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.060
"Judge it out so I can see the thing,
maybe do a little left alignment,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.180
shrinky dink down a little bit."

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.160
Pretty straightforward.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.300
It had another piece that flew
in from the right-hand side,

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.310
so I'm just going to
go and copy and paste.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:55.220
Another because I want to preserve
that same style for this one

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.220
and that was the fastest way to

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.900
Send... Send a message across the USA.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:01.890
Fonts preserved.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.530
Let's go and shrink
that down a little bit.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.800
Field down so I don't have to select it.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.640
Sort of line it up.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.120
You'll see that we've got the
alignment line showing up so I can

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.460
get everything perfectly aligned.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:21.020
But I can also go into the metrics and
do accurate pixel alignment as well.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.560
So those are my two little pieces of
text that I want to have in this banner.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.220
I also had this letter that flew in
as part of the animation when the

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:34.350
banner showed up on the device and so
I've got this little letter PNG here.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.740
I'm just gonna go and
drop it right on there.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.570
So that's great.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.660
I've went and I've built up this banner.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.540
I can say whatever I want.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.400
I can pull in whatever images I want.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.700
I can set the background.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.680
You get the story.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.840
It's pretty straightforward
and easy to go.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.360
Now these items were animated in when the
banner was first shown within the tester.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.140
And so next we want to go and add
the animation and we do that within

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.640
the animation properties panel.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.980
And you just basically go
and choose the various,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.840
choose from the palette of various
built-in animations that we've got.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.780
There's an ability to set timing
functions for them as well as duration,

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.470
how long a particular animation should
last and when another one should begin.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:17.620
This little flag or the little
letter flew in and rotated.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.200
I think I'm gonna want it to come
in last so I'm gonna bump it up to

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.660
be a second from a time perspective.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.590
And then these two guys I want to
have fly in from the left hand side,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.880
that one, and have it fly in right away.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.220
And then maybe have this one come
in from the right hand side and have

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.000
it come in just a wee bit later.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.180
And you can see there's different
timing functions that are built

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.400
in that you're probably used to
if you're using animation in any

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.620
sort of web technology field.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.100
So that's it, simple banner,
straightforward to go and create.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.240
I can hit the simulator here,
bring it up.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:05.500
It'll go and export the ad as a file,
hand it off to iAd tester,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.480
and it should show up,
unless the demo gods are not with me.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400
Create ad.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.820
Make sure you're using the right version.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.410
Hit simulate.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:24.150
Great.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.200
So there's our little animation
and the little fly-in.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.040
Awesome.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.500
So piece of cake.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.740
Easy to create banner.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.910
But you'll notice when I go
and I rotate the device,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.360
It needs to support the
rotated model as well.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.200
When you build in a banner for iAd,
it's really just one banner.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.120
It needs to support both orientations and
of course the tool supports that as well.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.160
So let me put this back where I found it.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.150
go back into the tool and this little
arrow that you see up at the top

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.840
right hand side shows you what that
rotated orientation would look like,

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.640
so stretch things out a little bit,
now I can go and look

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.650
at it in landscape mode,
go and resize things,

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.900
move them around a little bit so they
look right for this particular screen,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.550
maybe I'll put this here
and center that there,

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:12.710
and this is a little bit too big so I'm
going to go and change the size so it

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.530
can fit right there where I want it,
and you'll see that it preserves

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.560
the changes between the two
different banner orientations,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.190
and now when I go and simulate it,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.440
"It brings it in,
go and rotate the device,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.090
it does the right thing
for the banner as well.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.640
So that's great.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.950
So it's code-free creation of banners."

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:40.720
Great, that's the banner.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.280
Let me go ahead and create a couple
more pages real quick just to lay

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.040
out a little bit more of the ad.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.360
We're not going to have
a splash page in this,

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.200
but we are going to have a menu
and a couple children pages.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.150
So when I double-click on the menu page,
it again brings me down

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.470
the template choice.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.590
I've got a series of templates
that I can go and pick from,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.640
one that's blank, of course.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.770
You can always start from
scratch and just drag objects on.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:05.170
There's this wipe clear one from the
Klondike and the Campbell Soup ad.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.850
If you've seen those,
then we've built that into

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.000
a template that you can use.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.520
A couple button ones,
and I'm going to use this little

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.580
button ones here to go and add
the rest of the functionality.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.600
It goes,
creates a proxy for that menu page.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.860
When I double-click, it brings it up,
and you'll see it's got all these

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.880
placeholders basically ready for me to
go and do something interesting with.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.980
Now, anytime you see this little
mountain with sun there,

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.390
that's an image well.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.000
It means you can drag
and drop an image there.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.450
As you saw within the banner,
I was able to just grab an image

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.000
and drop it anywhere on a page.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.900
You can still always do that,
but this is just a

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.490
nicety to indicate that,
hey, this is a place that you

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.000
can go and drop images.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
So I'm going to go and grab my teletype
and throw it there in my telegraph.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.400
I can do a line.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.000
You see the little alignments.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.820
And I've got this little grouping
of buttons that you'll see here.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
This is the grouping
that's sort of attached.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.670
They move together.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.200
It's because this grouping has
some smarts associated with it.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.160
This button collection is actually
connected programmatically

00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.200
to those other child buttons.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.700
And it's connected to those
other child pages that I have

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.200
over on the right-hand side.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.950
And so as I go and add more child pages,
this particular grouping will

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.190
automatically update to have a button
for each subsequent page that I add.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.030
So it's just a real nicety
for making things easy to go

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.200
and go the next step with.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.680
And so if I double-click to go
into this particular container,

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.110
that's when I can select a button.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.660
And if I go over to the inspector,
you can see that buttons already

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.090
have some default functionality.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.200
I can tell it to go to any
particular page that I want.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.990
What I wanted to do though is go and
style this to look like it should for

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.200
the demo that I showed you earlier.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200
So I'm going to use this Seminary font.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.200
The Seminary font is an SVG font that
was part of the project that I imported.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.200
So it's a custom font
associated with this brand.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.190
And maybe I'll make it
a little bit bigger.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.320
And because this is in a collection,
it means that like items can be treated

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.000
sort of the same within this grouping.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.600
And so you'll see that there's this apply
style to all buttons option that's there.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.770
This container is smart.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800
It knows that there's
multiple buttons in here.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.210
And so if I go and hit
apply style to all buttons,

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.800
boom, my font is changed across all
of the buttons that are there.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.030
There's another way that
I can remember styles as well

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.790
and use them in other places,
not just within a container.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.800
I've got this little
style drop-down here,

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.300
and I can go and define this
button style that I have here

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.250
as something that's custom.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.070
Give it a name, maybe call it button.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:34.200
[Transcript missing]

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.630
Going back to the overview,
it's updated the proxy so it looks right.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.190
Let's go and create this page.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.140
Now, this page was that history page.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.880
It was a landscape page and it
had this flow view within it,

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.930
a bunch of images that move side to side.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.910
So that's the one I'm going to pick here.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.170
Go ahead and hit choose.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.830
And it's created the proxy here.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.890
Of course,
it has no content because it was

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.720
really just a blank landscape view.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.290
But you'll see it created that little
back button for me automatically.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.160
That's built into even the blank
template as well so that you

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.510
don't have to worry about that.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.080
Now, something else that I can do here,
I'm still out at the project level,

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.670
is without anything selected,
I can go and I can set the background

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.600
properties of all of the pages.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.120
And actually,
all of the subsequent pages are set

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.980
automatically if I go and set the
background at sort of this project level.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.210
And so this particular page has an
image background and I'm going to go and

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.990
choose the background landscape for it.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.630
Hi, I'm Mark Malone,
the founder of iAd Producer,

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.500
and I'm going to show you how to create
a dashboard for your iAd Producer.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.040
create that little history component.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.660
So first thing I've got is this
button here and I want it to look like

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.550
the rest of my buttons so I created
that style over the other page.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.800
So I'm going to go choose button
and voila it's got the right font.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.040
If I had a shadow or other
styles associated with it I would

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.480
have gotten that right away.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.950
If I go and update that style,
that button style any time within

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.690
any of the pages I can effectively
make that style get applied to

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.680
all of the elements that use it as
well just by resaving the style.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.320
So all the elements that use
that style with that name will

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.460
automatically have it applied.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.080
Now that I'm on a full screen page versus
the banner you'll see that the objects

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.280
that are available to me have changed.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.900
I've got more options available to me
and things like high level scroll views

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.250
and carousels and gallery views and
flip views all sorts of things in here.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.270
A shake view there's that wipe
clear thing I can also have

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.740
on any child pages I want.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.580
I can go and drop a video element.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.120
What I'm going to use
here is the gallery view.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:05.110
The gallery view is one of the
sort of standard iOS device user

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.300
experience elements that you've
probably seen where you just basically

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.960
swipe and page through content.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.360
The Guinness ad actually used that
for swiping through the various

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.960
steps of going and pouring your beer.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.490
So you can go and sort of resize
it so that it looks good on here.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.490
Sort of move things around,
position them where you want.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.710
You'll see that it's got
a built in reflection.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:31.440
I'm not too into that reflection so
I'm going to go ahead and look at the

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.440
reflection inspector and turn it on.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.440
I don't need a background on it.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.650
Let me go and select it.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.940
Go ahead and turn off the reflection.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.060
It's got the little built in page
dots as well for doing navigation

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.340
as you would expect in iOS.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.570
Those are completely impossible to
see so I'm going to go and change

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.720
that to a color that's something
a little bit easier to see.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.940
Good I've done that.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.740
And now this is an image well right.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.290
It's got the little mountain
and the moon or the sun.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.300
It means I can go and
drop images in here.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.760
And the object itself will do some
really interesting things with it.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.420
And it's also as you'll
notice if you double click

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.300
on it it'll just click on it.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.890
It's this container view
much like that button was.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.700
And so it's got a lot of smarts
that are associated with it.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.050
It's got this concept of multiple
cells that I can navigate through.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.170
The user navigates through these
when they swipe but as a designer

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.310
I can navigate through here using
the right and left arrows and I can

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.640
place individual elements within
these cells when the user swipes.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.100
It's not just moving one thing across
and repeating it multiple times.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.160
It's actually giving me this
bucket that I can drop in different

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.970
content for each one of these views.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.670
And it's got the little gear here.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.390
I can add and delete, move things around.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.420
So that's the view.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.390
Let's go and throw our
content in there real quick.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.620
I've got these history images.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.100
Boom.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.420
Just going to go and drag
and drop them on there.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.460
And then this object is smart
enough that it says oh you went

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.500
and you dropped five items on.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:52.270
This particular flow view only had
four cells when it was first created.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.570
And so it went and created
one for that final one.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:58.090
And like I said if you don't like it
you can go ahead and go and delete it.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.370
But it went and spread those
images across the various cells.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.370
So now if I don't like the placement
I can go and arrange them here.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.260
But what's really most interesting
is the fact that I can do other

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.380
things within this container.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.860
So once I'm drilled in within one of
these cells well then I can go and grab

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:21.580
objects and do other things as well.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:21.770
So I've got my image here and
I want some text about it.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.770
I believe that was smoke signals.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:32.800
[Transcript missing]

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.180
"Stretch it out, right,
so I've got complete editing

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.600
capability within here.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.360
Copy and paste it.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.350
And it had some other text in here.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:04.680
Resize things how I like, lay it out,
spell it correctly.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.570
"Spell it correctly, resize it to fit,
and then you'll see when

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:16.240
I navigate through these cells
that the content goes with it.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.390
And I can go through and do the
same thing to all of the cells.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.160
And I can drag other things.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.600
It doesn't just have to be labels
and images into these cells.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.040
I can drag carousel
views or video elements.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.400
This could be a swipe through
various trailers for a movie perhaps.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.150
So it's got a lot of
high-level functionality.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.190
And if we go and we simulate it now,

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.480
You'll notice when I tap on the banner,
it takes me right into that

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.690
page that I was last editing.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.300
I don't have to go all the way
through the menu structure.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.440
And now it's got that capability.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.870
And if I was previewing it on the device,
I would be able to swipe

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:49.590
with my finger there.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.820
It's all built for you.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.230
Menu takes me back, and boom,
I'm good to go.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:59.020
Now one quick thing to
show you is the fact that

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.140
Back here, these pages, I said,
these buttons,

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.870
each one that you see here is
actually hooked up to a button here,

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.250
even though these are proxies.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.670
And there's some intelligence
that you'll see that this

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.450
particular page was named blank,
but if I go and I call it history,

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.310
for example, it should update the button
to say the right thing.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.320
And now this particular
button is history.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.420
And as I go and add the other templates,
it's going to do the same thing.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.960
So they can stay synchronized in
that sort of way really easily.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.710
Now, if I go and I rename the button,
give it something completely different,

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.380
it will preserve whatever
name I associated with it.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.690
But the page name will stay the same.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.440
So it's helping you out,
but it's not getting in your way.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.910
Let me just quickly go and
build out this other page.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:38.880
This page was a map.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.780
So I'm going to choose the map template.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.960
It's in portrait mode.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.030
And you'll see that it went and
grabbed the default background that

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.990
I selected earlier at the project level.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.370
So that's great.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.150
If I double-click in to view the details,
well,

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.100
this isn't the kind of font I want in
order to stay in line with my demo.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.760
I want to use CoachIn there.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.390
I've got my little button.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:02.860
I want to make sure that
it's It's my button style.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.910
That's great.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.960
And this map plugin's
got a lot of smarts.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.380
It already has all the
mapping tile capability.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.370
All I really need to
do from a customization

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.920
perspective is give it a pin.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.430
I don't want the default
red pin that gets dropped.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.430
I want my brand or
whatever to be the pin.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:21.460
And so I've got this little
telegraph pin that we've created.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.250
And you can see that it's sort
of off-center from the center

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.280
of the bullseye there where the
point's actually going to be.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.200
And that's because images,
we don't necessarily know where

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.640
the center of your image is.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.480
And so it's up to you to go and align it.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.050
And you do it through twizzling these
little selectors here and setting

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.060
the offset position to exactly just,
you know,

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.960
where it looks right on the screen.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.840
And so that looks about right.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.340
So now my pin is centered.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.300
I can go and drag some other
assets in here to make it look

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.180
A little closer to what
the demo here looked like.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.180
I can go and change the order.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.180
I can send the text or the layers back
and front just by selecting the various

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.180
objects and the right mouse clicking on
it allows you to play with the Z index.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.180
My button's all hooked up because
it was given to me by default.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.180
And let me go ahead and simulate.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.180
Take a look here.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.700
It'll go and load my banner.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.160
Again,
I'm working on a page that's further in,

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.500
so you see I get the
automatic map experience.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.240
There's that button
asking me for permission.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.900
The ad name is automatically there.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.320
It'll drill in.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.520
It'll use the default pin
locations that are built in,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.900
which are basically locations
of Apple retail stores,

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.400
but you can go and provide a list
of lat/longs to the tool as well,

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.500
and we'll drop pins in
the right places for you.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.930
The menu's all hooked up.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.930
Takes you right back.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.930
So, it's pretty sweet.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.930
A lot of functionality
without a lot of work.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.930
What do you think?

00:38:54.700 --> 00:45:25.200
[Transcript missing]

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:28.400
and you can embed a map as you
saw in that particular demo.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.780
And this is what the code looks like.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.000
So like I said,
you can go into iAd Producer,

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.930
you can use our buttons and
our widgets to go and do this,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.100
but you can also call these
things programmatically.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.590
And so here's an example of what it takes
to go and save something in the calendar.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.320
It's incredibly straightforward.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.430
Basically,
you go and you define the event

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.860
information associated with the event,
the various details, begin, end date,

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.300
some descriptive information,
and then you call present composer.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.300
And then the operating system
will take it from there.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.300
It'll show the standard
calendar event creation widget.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:57.800
The user is very familiar with that.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.500
So they'll go in and they'll say, "Oh,
yeah,

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.040
I do want this thing on my calendar."
They'll choose their particular

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.710
calendar and take it the next step.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:04.900
And there's a callback there.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.980
So within your ad,
you'll also know whether they

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.650
hit the done button and actually
went through the process or if

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.100
they hit cancel and jumped out.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.640
And so if that's something that you're
keeping track of within your ad,

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.580
you can do that as well.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.640
So it's device integration,
but the key point is it's

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.100
never exiting back out,
out of the developer's

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.070
application or out of the ad.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.940
These sheets to either send
an SMS or send a mail or get

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.100
something on the calendar,
they come up on top of the ad.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.400
When the sheet goes away,
they've added it to their calendar.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.390
They're still right there
within the application.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.070
They haven't gone anywhere.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.970
So these are the core technologies
that you're going to use whenever

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.200
you're doing any sort of development.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.580
And the way that you basically
add custom code to your project

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.200
is in a couple different ways
that I'll go through real quick.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.880
First and foremost,
if you've got existing JavaScript files

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:52.130
or JavaScript files you've created
as subclasses of our objects,

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.200
you can just go and
import those as assets.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:58.600
The same way I drag that folder of
images and such into the project,

00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.890
you can drag in your JS files.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.100
You can drag in your CSS files.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.460
You can also combine your own
custom JavaScript and CSS files

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.800
into an incredibly powerful thing
called an IAD Producer plugin.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.340
And the Producer plugin allows you
to go and basically take a component

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.990
that you've written as a developer
and drop it into IAD Producer and

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:20.670
expose to a designer that doesn't
really want to see your code and that's

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.400
a lot of high-level functionality.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.010
So maybe you've subclassed the carousel
view to make it tilted and make it

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.700
spin in a different sort of way.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.320
If you wrap that within the plugin,
it means the designer can go, "Oh,

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.720
let me drag in this horizontal
carousel." They'll drop it in

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.670
and through the plugin API,
you can also expose over on

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:40.650
the right-hand side all of the
inspectors to go and set the

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.300
various properties that you expose.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.000
They don't have to go and
look at any of the code.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.610
They can play with the tilt or
whatever you've exposed as the

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:47.780
properties on those objects.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.700
So these are incredibly powerful
and a great way to go and extend it.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.300
You can also do some inline programming.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:58.100
All of the elements that are controls
within the ad that you're building out,

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.510
if you right mouse click on
them like a button for example,

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:03.600
there are events that are fired
when a user taps on those.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.730
If you've got some JavaScript that
you want to fire at that particular

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.930
point when the user taps on a button,
you can go ahead and throw it inline.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.350
All you do is choose a particular
event that you want to hook into,

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.900
paste your code in there,
maybe you call to an external function

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.040
that's in a JS file that you imported,
that's another way to go and

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.000
add your own functionality.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.840
And of course I mentioned earlier on
there's a debugger that's there and

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.330
so as you're writing your custom code,
if there's an issue that

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.700
happens while you're running
through it within the simulator,

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.720
boom,
it's going to stop on a break point or

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.200
it's going to stop where the error was
and give you quite a bit of feedback.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.180
So I've got a quick demo for
going and doing the custom code.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:44.940
So what I'll do next was that last page
that we saw in the Hudson Telegraph demo,

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:49.000
and that was the adding a field where
a user could go and type in some text,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.700
and then they shook the phone in order to
go and convert that text to Morse code.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.530
And so when I imported
all of these demo assets,

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:01.230
you might notice over on the right-hand
side there's this morseconverter.js

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.240
file that I imported in there as well.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.740
And if I open it up and I look
at the contents of this file,

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.650
it's got a lot of comments at the top.

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:10.950
But if I get down into
the real meat of it,

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.860
you'll see it's got basically an
array of characters and then the

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.260
equivalent in Morse code of those
characters in dots and dashes.

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:20.770
And the most interesting thing of this
function of this particular code that

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.850
I've pulled in is this convert text
field function that's here down below.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:23.860
So when the user clicks
on the text field,

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:23.860
it's going to be able to see the
text field that's here down below.

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.700
So when the user shakes the phone,
it converts the field that's

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.260
being passed to this particular
function into the Morse equivalent,

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.150
basically looking at the
characters and converting it.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.390
So that's what we're
going to go and call.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.020
And so let's go and build
up this page really quick.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.090
I'm just going to choose a blank page.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.300
In portrait mode,
get the default background,

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.590
get my button there, go to the inspector,

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.690
"Make my button pretty like
the rest of the buttons." Boom.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:54.510
Piece of cake.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.130
Got a couple assets
here to go and drag on.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.950
Little background for the canvas.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:16.600
[Transcript missing]

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.590
I'm just going to go and type
some text in here just so I don't

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.000
have to type it on the simulator.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.290
Hello iAd.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.760
Great, I've got that there,
all nicely aligned, looks good.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.670
Oh, that's not aligned.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:56.700
[Transcript missing]

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:11.100
[Transcript missing]

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.540
I can go and save that modified
one as a new style or I can say,

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.390
"No, I want all my buttons
to have that shadow,

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.610
but I'm not going to do that now."
So this is a button control and if

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.140
I go and I right mouse click on it,
then you see that I've got various events

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.240
that are fired when this is tapped on.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.180
The one I'm going to plug
into is the touch-up inside.

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:30.900
This means the user tapped their
finger down within the button

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.650
and then they lifted the finger
while it was still over the button

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:36.660
versus dragged out and then lifted,
which is sort of a cancel.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.880
So I'm going to go and use the
control touch-up inside and you'll

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:41.690
see it brings up a code window.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.570
And so I'm in a JavaScript editor and
I can do really interesting things

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.500
here like have this conversion happen.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.680
You'll see what's really interesting
here is that the comments are

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.960
actually valuable and placed
here for you at the get-go.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:58.180
You'll see that it basically shows you
how to go and create local variables,

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.060
how to access a global variable if
you've got one defined somewhere else.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.130
You can look at the center
of the various events.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.080
If you want to get a
reference to the page,

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.700
this is how you go and do it.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.700
For my particular example,
what I want to do is I want to

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:11.700
go and create a global variable.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.360
I want to go and get the content
out of that text field and pass

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.200
it off to that convert method.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.900
So I'm just going to go and
copy that text that's there,

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.710
paste it in.

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:24.910
So this basically says, "Okay,
for this particular page or

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.580
for this button that I'm on,
go and ask for its view

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.950
controller." And the view
controller has this outlets array.

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:36.230
So the outlet is basically the
name of the object that I went

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.800
and changed for the page name
or for any element on a page.

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.600
So the button is an outlet,
the field is an outlet.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.050
Anything that's sitting
there on a page is an outlet.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.500
And this particular array holds a
reference to everything that's on a page.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.100
And so that text field
is called text field.

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.180
If I go over and click on it here
and look over in the inspector,

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:55.300
yes, it's called text field.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:55.780
That's great.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.260
So I'm getting the right one.

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:01.230
And I'm just pulling it out of
that particular array by name.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:06.290
And so what I'm going to do next is then
I'm going to go and call my code convert.

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:15.460
I'm going to go ahead and add a
new text field and it's a function.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:18.340
And I'm just going to pass in
that text field call there.

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:22.800
iAd Producer:
I've added code to this button,

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:26.690
if I right-click on the
button the event is selected,

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:30.460
so there's an event
associated with this control.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:36.040
When the user touches up inside of it,
it should call the JavaScript function

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.950
and convert the text.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.010
iAd Producer:
There's other places that you

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.900
can hook into events as well,
not just the controls that

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.940
you go and drop onto a page,
but there's events associated with the

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:48.820
ad loading and the ad being paused,
transitions between pages.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.820
iAd Producer:
You can hook into an event of a page

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.290
coming onto the stage and have an
event that's fired as it goes off.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.420
You can have all sorts of
things laid out there in code.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.570
iAd Producer: The way you see those is
you go up to the code menu,

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.820
and here's the object events
for my selected object,

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.530
but the page events are here as well.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:08.020
iAd Producer: Maybe I want to do
some some wizzy layout.

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:11.050
iAd Producer: Before the page appears,
I'd go into this particular

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:12.810
code editor and do it there.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.900
iAd Producer:
The global events are here as well,

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.750
and this is where the shake
event actually occurs.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.430
iAd Producer: Shake is a global event,
and if I wanted to hook this

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:23.060
up to the shake functionality,
that's where I go and do that.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:27.330
iAd Producer: Alright,
so with everything fingers crossed,

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:30.350
well typed, hopefully no typers,
I've got my code in here.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.570
iAd Producer: If we go and hit simulate,
it's going to go and regenerate the ad,

00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:36.110
load it within the simulator.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:55:04.800
[Transcript missing]

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.800
So I've got some custom
JS that I've got in here.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.420
I've also got some custom CSS.

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.740
And if you take a look at this file,
it basically has a very simple

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.070
keyframe animation set within here.

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.300
It looks for a page that's called Try It.

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.100
This is the selector up here.

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:23.020
And it looks using that same sort
of outlet mechanism for a particular

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:25.100
element on the page called Phone Image.

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:28.390
And then it applies this
WebKit animation to that.

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.020
So a couple things
that I have to do here.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:34.300
First and foremost is I need to make sure
that my page is named Try It in order

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.060
to make sure that's going to get called.

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.140
So right now it's called blank.

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.970
I'm going to call it Try It.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:56:04.200
[Transcript missing]

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:10.000
Great.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.230
Try it to the page.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.240
Phone images the object.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.120
Looks like the selector's right here,
so this is the way it's going to go

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:18.240
and find the element on the page,
apply this particular style,

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:20.060
simple keyframe animation.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.200
Let's go ahead and load
it again in the simulator.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.130
Loads the banner.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:27.500
Boom.

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.490
Take me to the page, and voila.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.320
That little CSS style is applied.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.030
So whatever CSS you might
have in an external file,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.170
this is the way that you
go and apply it as well.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.550
You might have multiple files,
all sorts of different keyframes

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.910
that you want to apply to objects.

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:41.270
This is a great way to say,
"You know what?

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.060
I don't want to use that
drop-down selector for the

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.290
animation that's built in.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:49.330
I really want to apply my own." You just
basically find the element on the page

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:54.010
and apply the appropriate animation
that you've created out in CSS.

00:56:55.800 --> 01:01:03.100
