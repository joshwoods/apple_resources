00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.900
[Transcript missing]

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.570
Thank you.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.190
It always helps,
and I appreciate it very much.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.940
So...

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.300
We've got an awesome morning
together this morning.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.920
And thank you for coming so much.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.300
We have over 5,200 attendees here today.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300
We sold out within two hours.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.300
I'm sorry, this is the biggest place
we can get to have this.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.300
So I'm sorry for all those
people who couldn't make it.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.470
And we wish we could sell more tickets,
but...

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.940
We don't know where to have it if we do.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.860
So 5,200 attendees, over 120 sessions.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.180
Over a hundred hands-on labs where
you can take your code in and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.900
get help tuning it and porting
it to some of our newer devices.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.950
And there are over a hundred
Apple engineers here this week,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.200
a thousand sorry, Apple engineers here
this week to help you.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.310
So there's a lot of
Apple folks floating around.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.470
Grab them, make use of them,
and we hope you have a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.460
great week here at WWDC.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.250
Now, we're going to talk
about three things today.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.330
You know, if the hardware is the brain
and the sinew of our products,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.520
the software in them is their soul.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.700
And today we are going
to talk about software.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.250
We've got some great stuff to talk about.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.480
OS X Lion, the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.500
IOS5 and some kind of
interesting new cloud stuff.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.880
So, let's start with Lion.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.230
To tell us all about Lion,
I'm going to ask two of my colleagues,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.250
Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi,
to take us through Lion and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.100
give us some demos.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.590
Phil?

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.710
Thank you, Steve.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.830
Oh, good morning, everyone.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.640
How you doing?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.580
Yeah.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.910
Come on, energy in the room.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.730
This is the Developer Conference.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.500
and more.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.500
I am really honored to be the
first to present to you the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.060
first of our new products today.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.620
And this product is all about the Mac.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.720
And the Mac is doing incredibly well.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.760
Our customer base continues
to grow at a tremendous pace.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.400
We now have over 54 million active
Mac users around the world and growing.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.790
The customers love the products
and press and analysts have really

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.480
incredible things to say about it.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.380
Things like this from All Things D.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.260
There's really no other way to say this.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.850
The Mac is kicking ass.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.300
Now, that's really nice,
but what did John mean?

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.240
Well, this is what he means.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.280
The last quarter,
the PC market actually shrank year

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.190
over year 1%, while the MAC grew 28%.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.580
In my book, that's an ass kicking.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.350
Now,
lest you think this is an aberration,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.780
the Mac has outgrown the industry
every quarter for the past five years.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.440
It is going so strong,
and it's because the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.690
products are incredible.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.910
Products like the new MacBook Air.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.100
It's beautiful, it's thin, it's light,
it's fast.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.370
The whole PC industry wants to copy it.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.070
But as you know, we've been leading in
notebooks for a while.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.830
We were the first to really
drive the majority of our

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.950
PC business to a notebook business.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.880
And it's almost three quarters of the
Mac business that's been doing that.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.020
We are going to talk about the facts we

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.350
But whether you want a great new notebook
or a killer desktop with the new iMac,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.150
these Macs are the best that we have
ever made in the history of Apple.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.950
And they're great not just
because of the hardware they run,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.480
but because of the software.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.740
Mac OS X is the heart of the Mac.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.720
And if you're keeping track,
you know we launched

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.590
Mac OS X 10 years ago.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.490
We built it on a solid Unix foundation.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.720
We added to it the ease of
use and simplicity that we

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.670
know Apple's renowned for.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.530
And we built into it amazing
technologies for all of our great

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.050
developers to make the world's
best applications to run on it.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.240
And for those of you who are
around and remember this,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.600
this is what Mac OS X looked like
10 years ago when we launched it.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.300
It was a revolution in its day.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.670
And over the last 10 years it's
evolved to become more refined,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.500
more powerful,
more beautiful than ever before.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.880
The Mac OS X is looking
incredibly strong.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.800
So where do we take it next?

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.480
Well, next up in OS X is Lion,
a major release with

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.300
over 250 new features.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.540
And if you'd like,
we can go through every

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.710
one of them today.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.030
Well I'd love to,
I'm told I only have enough time to

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.880
tell you about 10 key new features.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.930
So we'll really get into
10 awesome features.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.100
First up, right into it, number one,
multi-touch gestures.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.370
One of the great things about
the Mac from the beginning was

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.430
that it ushered an era of a
graphic user interface with a

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.590
mouse and clicking and dragging.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.830
But so much has changed
over the last 10 years.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.290
We now build multi-touch trackpads
into all of our notebooks and

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.920
we offer them on our desktops.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.190
We've learned a lot from iOS as well.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.250
So now Lion can count on multi-touch.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.610
From the beginning you
can have beautiful,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.600
fluid, momentum-based scrolling.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.030
You can have incredible multi-touch
taps to zoom in on stories or pictures.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.990
You can dynamically zoom with beautiful,
fluid pinch motions.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.320
You can swipe through your photographs,
your slides, your web page.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.830
All with an incredible physical
realism that's never been possible

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.780
with a PC operating system before.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.590
And this has implications
across the system in a lot

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.280
of little important areas.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.140
Here's a simple example.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.400
The scroll bar.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.430
Why do we have scroll bars?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.450
Scroll bars were there so you could
click with the mouse and drag and scroll.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.210
But now if you're pushing
your window with multi-touch,

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.310
you don't need them.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.440
They can disappear.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.110
You can have a much more
beautiful reading environment.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.370
But when you go to scroll,
they magically appear,

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.620
give you a sense of place
and proportional size.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.320
And then disappear.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.420
They disappear when you don't need them.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.520
So multi-touch is now built throughout
the system in a very powerful way.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.740
Number two, full screen applications.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.080
We've had some full screen
applications before and these are

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.400
really important for notebooks.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.870
11 inch and 13 inch where
you want to take advantage of

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.400
every pixel on the display.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.240
But developers have had to work
hard to make their applications hand

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.400
coded to do full screen applications,
including apps like iPhoto.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.450
Well now with Lion we've built in
a standard method for developers

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.400
to create full screen applications.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.280
And it has a simple system control
in the top right so all users

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.400
know where to tap and then bring
their applications full screen.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.190
But this isn't full screen like
it was before because now you can

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.420
keep your application running full
screen with a simple swipe gesture,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.520
get back to your desktop,
get something you need,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.400
go back to your application,
never having left full screen.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.160
In fact you can have more than
one full screen application

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.570
running at the same time.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.470
So we've worked on a number of our
applications to bring them into

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.750
the new full screen mode of Lion.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:50.050
System applications like Safari, Mail,
iCal, iLife applications, iPhoto, iMovie,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.560
GarageBand,
iWork with Keynote and Numbers and

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.840
Pages and all these applications
going full screen so you have a great

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.630
experience right out of the box.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.280
Here's an example of how it looks.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.060
This is now running
full screen in Safari.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.660
You can have a beautiful place
for viewing your documents and now

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.130
there's a new feature since we've
got all this extra room on the left

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.580
hand side called the reading list.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.790
Keep track of things you
want to get to later.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.600
Here's iCal running full screen.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.170
Here's preview showing you PDF documents
running full screen so you can

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.590
just have a beautiful experience
like we've never had on a computer

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.840
before with full screen applications.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.700
Next feature.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.130
For many users,
this will be the best feature of Lion.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.700
It's called Mission Control.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.230
Now,
we all like to run a lot of software.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.480
At Apple,
we've created many features to help

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.440
customers find just what they need.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.470
Expose for finding a document,
dashboard for getting at a quick widget,

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.170
spaces for organizing
your work environment,

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.080
but didn't it all work
together in one unified way?

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.280
Well, now with Lion,
we've unified that with a simple

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.610
gesture to get into Mission Control.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.160
And this is a bird's eye view of
everything going on in your system.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.190
On the main window, well,
that's the current desktop you're working

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.710
on with all the documents now organized
by what application is running on them.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.370
And you can tap on any document
and bring it to the front.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.530
That's right there,
center for you to work on.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.580
Up above are all your spaces.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.940
So you can have multiple desktops,
you can have multiple

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.900
full screen apps running,
get to any one with a single tap.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.940
And on the left of those spaces
is a new special one just

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.000
for your dashboard widgets.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.000
You can get to again with a single tap.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.940
So that's mission control.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.180
What I'd like to do now
is before we move on,

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.730
have Craig Federighi come up and
give you a demo of these three

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.140
new features all working together.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.540
Craig?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.620
Hello.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.290
Good morning.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.240
So let's take a look at Lion in action.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.540
And we're going to start with gestures.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.140
Great place to experience
gestures is here in Safari.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.890
The first thing you'll notice--

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.330
Apparently something funny.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.380
Is that how simple this UI looks
because there are no scroll bars.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.250
It's a really clean look.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.500
We don't need scroll bars anymore
because we can simply push

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.230
the content with our fingers.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.540
We can flick and get momentum,
get a nice little bounce.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.800
The page feels really
alive beneath your fingers.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:21.000
You can also expand your fingers
and fluidly zoom just like that.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.380
Zoom out and you get
a nice little bounce.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:58.500
[Transcript missing]

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:05.380
In fact, I can swipe through my entire
Safari browsing history just like that.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.330
Really smooth.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.900
Next up,
I'd like to show you full screen apps.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.700
I'm going to launch iPhoto here,
and you can see that iPhoto's adopted

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.900
Lion's standard new full screen control.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.120
So I'll just take iPhoto full screen.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.270
It's a great way to
look at my photo album.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.690
If I want to get back to my desktop,
take three fingers,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.210
and I can just swipe iPhoto
away and back to my desktop.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.650
But I didn't have to leave iPhoto
and take it out of full screen.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.170
It's actually right there.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.670
Take a peek at it, go back,
just like that.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.860
We love this so much that
we made gestures accessible

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.270
in exactly the same way.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:46.000
Swipe over to the left,
and I have access to my dashboard.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.710
You can see Safari supports
full screen as well.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.320
Let's go take our
Safari window full screen.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.050
So now we have our dashboard over
our desktop over here to the left.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.880
We have Safari and of course,
iPhoto is still there

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.240
in full screen as well.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.690
You'll notice how Safari is making
great use of all the available

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.740
space on the screen for my content.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.450
But if I want to get at my bookmarks bar,
my menu, just go to the top.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.460
You see they slide right
out like that really nicely.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.180
And when I want to exit full screen,
I have a control right there in the

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.320
upper right animates right back out.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.260
Let's take a look now at Photo Booth.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.860
This is an app.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.730
Absolutely born to run in full screen.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.500
You can see I'm surrounded by
the curtains of the Photo Booth

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.590
and in here I can experience some
fantastic new face detection effects.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:39.880
So notice as I move,
the birds actually track.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.000
That's the most important
feature in Lion.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.880
And we can also use this face
tracking technology to perform

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.360
some targeted facial enhancements.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.850
For instance,
I can finally have those big

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.020
eyes that I've always hoped for.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.150
So let's take a picture of that.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.930
So that's pretty cool.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.880
So playing around, yeah,
that's great stuff.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.310
So, you know,
you can spend hours at this.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.440
So full screen is fantastic.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.510
But of course,
Mac users love to do a lot of

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.860
things at once and that often means
that they have a lot of windows.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.960
In fact, my desktop often looks a
little bit more like this,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.440
right?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.750
I've got a lot going on.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.030
So how do I get across all of
those different activities?

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.340
Well, I just take three fingers,
swipe up on the trackpad,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.980
and I'm in mission control.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.220
From here,
I can get at any window I want.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.250
So if I want to get at iCal here,
I click, it comes forward,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.280
sweep back into mission control.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.810
Over to dictionary, same thing.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.930
And across the top,
you see I have my dashboard, my desktop,

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.100
my full screen apps.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.250
So I want to get to iPhoto, just click,
comes forward from anywhere,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.580
three fingers up,
and I'm back in mission control.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.510
I can also quick look my windows.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.950
If I just hit spacebar here,
get a better look at my calendar,

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.160
or take this pile of preview
windows and spread them apart

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.660
with a little gesture up.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.190
But you know what's really awesome is the
way that multiple desktop spaces are now

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.610
integrated right into mission control.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.120
Just take my mouse up to the corner of
the screen and a little space pops up.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.170
I click, I've just created a new space.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.730
And I can populate it by just
dragging the windows I want to work

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.140
with in that space just like this.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.630
And I've set up a new desktop.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.290
and many more.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.300
So, that's really useful.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.480
I can swipe through the spaces,
of course, here in Mission Control,

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.250
go over to my desktop and if
I want to then take even an

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.640
entire app and all of its windows
and create a new space for that,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.640
I can click on the preview icon,
drag the whole pile to the corner.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.340
I've just created another space.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.690
And the spaces are just as easy to
clean up as they were to create.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.100
I just click,
they delete and they--windows fly right

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.420
back to my original desktop space.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.380
So that is mission control.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.290
Thank you very much.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.750
Thank you, Craig.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.270
You see how these new features now
work seamlessly together to create

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.560
an incredible experience in OS X,
unlike anything we've had on

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.640
a personal computer before.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.940
Next up, the Mac App Store.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.380
We launched the
Mac App Store this past January,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.400
and users have found out that it
is the best place to purchase and

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.050
discover new software applications.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.140
Now, for years,
there have been many software

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.020
channels to buy PC software,
and they all work kind of the same way.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.950
You hop in your car, you drive downtown,
you buy a DVD if they happen to have it,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.670
you drive back home, you load it up,
or you wait for it to come, mail order,

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.770
well, no more.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.510
Well, now at the Mac App Store,
you can get your software right from the

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.110
comfort of your own home on your Mac.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.350
And in the last six months,
something incredible has happened.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.280
The last six months,
the Mac App Store has now become

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.580
the number one PC software
channel for buying software.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.620
That's incredible.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.240
It's incredible.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.200
passing Best Buy and
Walmart and Office Depot.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.200
And the developers that have gotten
on board with the Mac App Store have

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.240
seen some great success too.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.240
For example, Autodesk.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.680
They brought their Sketchbook
Pro application to it,

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.240
and since they put it
on the Mac App Store,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.300
they've seen a million
new users on the Mac.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.450
Ferrell Interactive has brought a
host of games including Mini Ninjas.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.400
Hopefully you've all played it.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.400
Doubling of overall revenue since
they brought it to the Mac App Store.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.450
And small,
great developers like Pixelmator has

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.400
brought their amazing new image editing
application to the Mac App Store.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.360
They've seen a quadrupling
of the revenue.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.400
In fact, they made a million dollars
in their first 20 days.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.400
So the Mac App Store has been a big
hit for large and small developers.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.400
So what's new and lying?

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.390
Well first, it's built right in.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.390
You don't have to go and download
it and get it and decide to use it.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.400
It's built in for every Mac user.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.400
And there's a lot of great features for
you developers to take advantage of.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.290
Some of them you're used to from the
iOS App Store like in-app purchases.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.390
You can now build those in.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.980
Push notifications if you want to alert
users about important information.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.640
You can make your
applications more secure.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.270
There's a built-in sandboxing
method now in the Mac App Store.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.110
And for users,
downloads will be even faster because you

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.260
can get these updates as Delta updates.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.640
So that's the Mac App Store.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.680
It's a really important part
of the whole experience of

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.800
Lion as you'll hear more about.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.500
Number five, a simple but powerful idea,
Launchpad.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.570
Wouldn't it be great if no matter
where you are in your system,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.430
if you want to get in an
application and quickly launch it,

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.500
you can with a simple gesture.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.500
Well now you can with Launchpad.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.960
You simply make a simple gesture,
a pinch motion, and all your applications

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.500
fly onto your screen.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.500
No matter where they are in your system,
Launchpad knows where they are.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.870
You can have multiple pages
of applications that you can

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.500
organize any way you want.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.580
When you go and buy a new
application on the Mac App Store,

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.500
it downloads,
installs right into your Launchpad.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500
And you can make it
look however you'd like.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.660
You can rearrange your icons,
you can create folders just

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.370
as we're used to from iOS,
and now you can do that

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.500
on your Mac as well.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.730
So that's Launchpad.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.850
Next.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.940
Resume.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.030
Here's a simple idea.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.880
From the beginning with a computer,
you've had to run applications.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.880
Sometimes you quit them.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.190
You go back and you're
back at the starting point.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.820
You have no more windows open.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.360
Your documents aren't open.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.290
You usually have to pick a template.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.250
Why can't applications get
you back to work quickly?

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.320
Well, that's what resume does.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.770
Now when you launch an
application in Lion,

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.030
it brings you right back to
where you were when you quit.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.920
It remembers what
documents you were open.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.480
It remembers the text that was selected.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.310
It remembers where the palettes
were and the windows and

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.070
everything just how you like it.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.610
And resume doesn't work
just on an application.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.800
It works system wide.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.350
So the next time you have to shut down
and restart your Mac for a reason,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.790
maybe you've installed some new
software and it asks you to reboot,

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.240
yet you like everything
just the way it is.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.460
Well, don't worry.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:05.890
You get the new login window.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.990
You log in and Lion will bring you
back to the work environment as

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.580
you left it when you restarted.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.560
All your applications running,
all those spaces you set up,

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.400
all just the way you like it.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.930
Thank you.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.460
So that's with Zoom.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.020
Number seven, autosave.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.820
From the beginning of using computers,
we've all had to remember

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.210
one really important fact.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.940
Save, save,
save all your work as you're going.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.180
Whether it's file save
or Command S on a Mac,

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.440
you better keep saving.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.120
'Cause the one time you might
forget to save what you're doing,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.300
something goes wrong and
what are you gonna hear?

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.720
You should have saved what you're doing.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.570
Why should you?

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.560
Why can't the computer help you?

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.280
Well, that's what Lion does.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.500
As you're creating a document,
Lion can automatically save

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.480
it in the background without
you having to do anything,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.820
without you having to see anything.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.240
Your work is just being saved for you.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.320
This is a really powerful
but simple thing,

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.580
but as we got into it,
we found there's more things we can

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.760
do for you since we're autosaving.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.140
So if you zoom in on the
title bar of your documents,

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.370
you'll see the name of your
document is actually a menu now

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.860
that you can tap on and take
advantage of the power of autosave.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.020
But for example,
let's say you're doing work and you

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.000
don't like the work you did and you're
worried it got autosaved over what

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.520
you'd like that you had done previously.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.010
Well, now you can just select revert
to last open and get back to

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.740
where you were when you started.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.250
Or maybe you love the changes you've
made and they're exactly what you want.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.600
You don't want it to ever get
autosaved over it again because

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.580
it's perfect the way it is.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.470
You can just select lock and
now your document's locked.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.530
It's like a template and
nothing can ever change it.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.900
You can even write from
within the application,

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.170
so like duplicate and create a second
document just like the first one that

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.970
you can start working on another version.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.100
So you have the power of all of this.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.540
Right from the title bar of your window.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.130
So that's autosave.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.480
Now autosave gave us a great idea
to go even further with the next

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.420
feature and that's called versions.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.610
So you're working on a document,
you're entering the text,

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.270
you're formatting, you're adding copy,
you're adding graphics and all along

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.430
autosave is saving your document.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.620
In fact,
it's saving all these versions of

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.360
your document as you're working.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.700
So we call that versions.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.920
It's automatic.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920
You don't have to do anything.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.720
We'll do it for you with Lion.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.680
If you love something in a split second,
you can of course take a

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.140
manual snapshot if you want.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.540
And it's very efficient.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.280
We only store the difference
between the versions.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.550
They're not whole new documents.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.480
and you don't have to worry if you
ever share your work with someone else

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.600
that they're going to get all that back
work that you don't want them to get.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.100
When you copy it off or
you send it in an email,

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.600
we only send the current version.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.600
So how do you take advantage of
this power of autosaving versions?

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.510
Well again, go back to that menu on the
top and there's another choice

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.600
there that you may have noticed.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.390
Browse all versions.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.600
You tap on it and you get
this beautiful new interface.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.600
It looks a lot like Time Machine.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600
But rather than being
about your whole system,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.600
it's about that one
document you're working on.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.600
On the left is the current version,
on the right all the past versions.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.600
And you have a time scale on the
right just like Time Machine.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.590
You can scroll back through
them and they're all live.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.600
You can switch and make
any one the current one.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.590
You can even cut and paste between them.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.600
So that's versions.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.600
What I'd like to do is ask Craig to
come back up and give another demo

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600
showing how this all works together.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.600
Craig?

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.390
Go again.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.230
All right, well,
let's start with Launchpad.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.280
You see it's an icon
right here on my dock.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.590
I click and I get an instant view of
all of the applications on my system,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.400
no matter where they're installed.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.400
I can page through them
really nicely with gestures.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.400
And when I want to launch,
let's say like address book,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.400
it's just a single click to bring it up.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:51.390
I can also gesture with a
four-finger pinch to get in as well.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.540
So of course when I want to
add things to my Launchpad,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.660
the best way to do that
is with the Mac App Store.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.880
I'm going to launch it right here.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.600
You can see on the Mac App Store we
have great featured applications,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.180
top paid and free apps, categories.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.840
We have also all of your purchased apps.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.940
So then if you buy another Mac or
you buy on one Mac and you want

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.350
to get the app on the other one,
you can download them here

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.050
at no additional charge.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.330
And of course, updates.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.540
With just a click,
you can bring all the apps you

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.360
have installed on your system
from the App Store up to date.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.120
Well now,
let's try adding Twitter to our Mac.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.240
We're going to click here and
go to the Twitter product page.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.060
And with a click, you can buy.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.940
The app actually lifts up out
of the App Store and flies

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.990
right into my Launchpad,
downloads and is ready to use.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.210
From here, I can just click and
position it wherever I want.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.350
I can move it maybe to the first page.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.910
And as you see, we have folders like
this productivity folder.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.730
Works great.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.510
If I want to create my own folder,
just pick something up, drop it,

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.750
and I've created a folder
just like that in Launchpad.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.210
Next, I'd like to show you just how
fantastic the Mac is now with

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.550
Lion working with documents.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.680
I'm going to open a document
that I've been working on here

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.090
on the history of guitars.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.550
When I start editing a document,
often I'll position my windows

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.500
just the way I like them,
like this, maybe open up some inspectors,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.470
position them the way I want them,
and then I'll set down to editing.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.960
Now, this guitar, this is my guitar.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.110
I'm going to open it up and
I'm going to create a new one.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.530
And this looks maybe a little bit
too metal for my target audience,

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:28.490
so I'll delete that, take this,
move it aside, maybe change the font

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.010
here on this document.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.040
So, I'm done with my edits for
now and I'm going to quit.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.670
And I want you to watch
what happens when I quit.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.790
Absolutely nothing.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.740
I wasn't prompted to save.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.270
I didn't need to be because Lion was
actually saving for me all along.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.690
But it wasn't just saving my document,
it was saving exactly the

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.460
state of how I was working.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.960
So now when I go back
and launch pages again,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.510
you see it brings back all my
inspectors just the way they were,

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.070
brings back my window
position where it was,

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.690
and even has my text selection
highlighted just as I left it.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.140
Perfect restore.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.370
But we're not just storing the
latest version of the document,

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.190
we're keeping a history of
the document as it's edited.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.790
So if I want to go back,
maybe I regret these edits,

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.970
I want to get back to
the previous version,

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.160
I go right here and browse all versions.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.740
And I'm taken right into the star field
where I get a view of my current version

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.200
on the left and the history on the right.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.250
If I want this previous
version to become current,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.910
I click restore, it picks up,
flies on top,

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.330
and becomes the current version.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.940
And I'm restored.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.170
But you saw there was actually
more history than that.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.340
I'll go back into the star field here.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.340
You can see I actually
have a full timeline here.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.560
On the right, I can go back to the very
beginning of this document when

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.630
it was just a few paragraphs,
or step forward as I was

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.330
adding pages and so forth.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.070
But when I restore a document, you know,
very often I don't want

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.140
really the whole old version.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.200
I like mostly what my
new document has become,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.230
but often I want to harvest maybe just
an image or perhaps a particular slide

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.620
and bring it into the current version.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.260
With versions I can,
because these two windows

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.470
are actually live here.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.430
So if I have on my current version,
maybe a page that can really use an

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.600
image to punch it up a little bit,
and I go back to this past version,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.250
I see, oh look, there's a guitar that
would be just perfect.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:26.020
Well I can just select the
guitar in the old version,

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.220
copy it, and then paste it right
into the latest version,

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.200
and like that, I've created just the
document I was looking for.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.300
And that's versions.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.190
Thanks.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.970
Thank you, Craig.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.010
Next, number nine.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.240
Well, as long as we've had computers,
we've wanted to share documents.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.040
We have a new feature to help you do
that and make it easier than ever.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.790
It's called AirDrop.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:57.100
You've got your computer,
your friends got their computer,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.000
and trying to get documents between
them has always been such a pain.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.590
In fact,
the easiest way to do this that no one's

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.890
done better than is good old sneaker net.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.840
Copy it off of one,
walk over to your friend's computer,

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.790
copy it back on.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.080
Well,
Lion solves that with a new technology.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.100
AirDrop.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:42.080
That's a peer-to-peer
Wi-Fi-based network.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
So how does it work?

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
When you go into the finder in Lion,
you'll see on the sources on the

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
left a new choice called AirDrop.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
You tap it,
you get a new display inside the finder.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
What you see is yourself, center,
bottom right there,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
and the people around you who are
also running AirDrop at the same time.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
You see their pictures.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
If I want to drag a document
over to Shana's computer,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.080
I just drag the document
on top of her picture.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.310
And it asks me,
are you sure you want to send this?

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.460
And I confirm I do.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.960
On Shana's computer,
because she's also now running AirDrop,

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.100
she sees, pops up over my picture.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.680
I'm trying to send her a document.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.380
She confirms she wants to receive it,
and it downloads right

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.840
into her downloads folder.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.680
And that's it.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.640
That's what it takes to now wirelessly
share files between Lion computers.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.840
So it's a peer-to-peer
Wi-Fi-based network.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.320
There's nothing to set up.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.340
It's auto-discovery, auto-setup.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.760
We have confirmation on both ends,
just to be safe.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.860
Your data's protected over
the air because it's fully

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.340
encrypted as it's transferred.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.060
So that's AirDrop.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.170
And that brings us to number 10.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.540
Number 10 is Mail,
a completely new version of Mail in line.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.650
It's beautiful.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.490
The layout on it is incredible.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.750
It works in a window.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.300
It takes advantage of full screen.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.800
You can work in a two column or if you
want to have access to your mail sources,

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.770
a three column view
right there on the left.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.780
And you see that the design
of it's really optimized

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.360
around reading your mail.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.550
You have a beautiful full
height message window.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:49.020
On the left in the message list,
you see snippets like we used

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.010
to from iOS now built into mail.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.460
Across the top, you have a favorites bar.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.610
Sort of like a browser does.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.240
Now in mail, that can be favorite folders
where you like to keep things

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.410
you want to get at quickly.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.190
Probably one of the most
powerful features is searching.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.310
With searching now,
we have new search suggestions.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.040
So you start to type
what you're looking for,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.870
and mail recognizes whether that's
a person or a subject and prompts

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.900
you with the choices you have
across your entire mail database,

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.390
which you can find quickly.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.530
When you select one,
it becomes what we call a search token.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.130
That's an interactive search token
where you can set some parameters on it.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.970
And you can have more than one and
create Boolean searches if you want.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.280
Probably the best feature of the
new mail is something we call,

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.510
yes, you can love that.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.050
It's okay.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.240
Boolean searches.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.860
Probably the best feature is
something we call conversation view.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.040
In mail today,
as you've got a conversation going,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.820
you've got some messages you've
responded to or replied and forwards,

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.780
you see the mail gets longer and longer
and they're indented and color-coded,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.260
things stripped out,
it gets more and more difficult

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.920
to follow the flow of this and
appreciate the messages that were sent.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.290
Well now, in line,
there's a brand new conversation

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.390
view that shows your messages
just as they were sent.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.500
You see the messages,
you see the people who send them,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.200
you see the attachments still in line,
all there for you to view.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.830
Yet it's completely compatible
with doing email with other people

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.200
who don't have Lion and can't
get the same beautiful view.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.200
So that's Mail and Lion.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.600
I'd like to bring Craig up for
one last demo to show off Mail.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.600
Okay, well I absolutely love
the new mail in Lion.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.240
Let's take a look.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.850
So it's got this great
full-height message list.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.400
It's perfect for laptops.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.940
Just like this.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.780
I've got my message list
on the side with snippets.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.090
It makes it really easy to find
the message I'm looking for.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.060
We have this new favorites bar
across the top so I can click

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.570
through my mailboxes really easily.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.830
But if I want to get
back to my full list,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.410
they're available right here as well.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.040
I really find the new
search to be just awesome.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.250
Because when I search,
I'm often searching for a person,

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.120
let's say like Phil,
I start typing "ph." See,

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.420
it prompts me for people in
my mail right now that match.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.960
So I go "Phil Schiller,"
found messages from Phil,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.610
just like that.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:17.190
I can use, I can retarget the search to
specific inboxes or search all.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.300
And of course, as Phil showed you,
I can pick whether I'm searching for

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.100
"from," "to," or the entire message.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.030
Well, suggestions don't just apply
to searching for people.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.520
They also work for other things as well.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.890
Like let's say a subject.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.850
I'll search for "trip." You see
that it's actually prompting me.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.230
Do you want to search for
messages that contain "trip"

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.750
or where "trip" just appears in
the subject line or even suggest

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.290
specific subject lines that match?

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.980
So I can select this,
and I've done a subject search

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.750
on "trip." What about dates?

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.950
I'm going to type "March," start typing
"March." There you see it prompts me,

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:48.990
March 2011.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.800
And like that, I've searched for all
my messages in March.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.970
But what's really awesome is
the way you can combine these

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.360
really quickly to pinpoint just
the search you're looking for.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.510
So let's say I'm looking for
a message that Phil sent me.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.600
It's a subject with
something about reservation.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.940
It was from Phil Schiller,
and it was last month.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.590
Like that, it drills down to exactly the
message you're looking for.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.700
It's really nice.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.920
As awesome as that is,
my favorite feature is conversations.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.310
It's this beautiful view of all
the messages that were sent in the

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.030
conversation just as they were sent
with all the images and so forth.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.630
And you'll notice that all of that extra
forwarded reply text that's redundant in

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.110
the conversation is stripped right out.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.950
It's gone.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.610
But if I want to show it and I want
to see mail the way it kind of

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.090
looks in lesser mail programs,
I can click like this.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.020
It folds right out.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.790
Yeah, this is awesome.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.140
And if I want to reply to a
particular message in a conversation,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.650
I can hover, we get a reply control,
and watch this animation.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.300
So message hops right out.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.850
So that's great.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.860
And finally, when you want to file a
whole conversation away,

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.480
you can just drag it all at once,
drag all the messages,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.910
put it in your folder, and you're done.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.130
That's mail in Lion.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.200
Thank you.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.490
So those are the top 10 features of Lion,
and there is so much more for you

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.070
to learn about and discover in Lion.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.540
Amazing features.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.490
Just to bring up a few,
don't Windows users who want to

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.400
upgrade to a Mac deserve a migration
feature just like we Mac users have?

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.730
Well now there is in Lion.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.550
When you upgrade from Windows,
we can help you migrate and get

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.320
to a better computing experience.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.160
There's FileVault too.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.440
Yeah,
so for all of you who want more security

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.080
and encryption in your hard drive,
you have that.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.210
FaceTime's built in.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.980
Even server's all new with Lion.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.780
Server isn't another operating system,
it's just a bunch of applications you

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.680
can purchase to run on top of Lion.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.180
So amazing depth of features for you.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:07.660
And for all the developers out here,
we have over 3,000 new APIs for you to

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.730
take advantage of the power of Lion.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.110
Amazing stuff.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.630
You can do all the things we showed here.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.580
You can have full screen applications,
you can create versions,

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.820
you can take advantage of autosave.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.680
All of that can easily be
done with all these new APIs.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.650
So Lion is an incredible new release.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.590
So how are we going to get it?

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.780
Well in the past,
one thing every version of

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.920
Mac OS X has shared in common
is it came on an optical disk.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.510
No more.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:36.840
Now, Lion will be available
only in the Mac App Store.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.300
And that allows us to make it the
easiest upgrade you have ever seen.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.500
When it's ready,
you'll go into the Mac App Store and

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.770
you'll see a page there
where you can read about it,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.420
see screenshots, read reviews.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.440
And when you're ready, click buy.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:36:00.680
And it downloads right onto your Mac and
starts the upgrade process right there.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.170
So it's on the Mac App Store.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.840
It'll be about 4 gigabytes in size,
about the same size as a single

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.820
HD movie that you might download.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.060
It installs right in place,
no more rebooting from an optical disk.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.920
And because it's part
of the Mac App Store and

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.360
the Mac App Store rules,
it follows the same rules.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.410
When you purchase it,
you can use it on all of your

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.700
personal authorized Macs.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.310
You don't have to buy multiple copies.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
That's Lion.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:30.720
I know what you're thinking,
what should we charge for this?

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.700
Well, what would you charge?

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:37.360
Well, in the past, most major releases of
Mac OS X have been $129,

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.040
and I think there's a lot here for $129.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.880
But we love it so much that we want to
make it available to even more people,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.790
so we're going to price
it at just $29.99.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.100
I was hoping you're going to like that.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.850
So when do you all get your hands
on it here at the conference?

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.660
We're going to have a developer preview,
the latest developer preview

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.260
available today for you to
download and take advantage of

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.610
everything you've seen up here.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.370
And for customers,
one will be available in July.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.680
So very, very soon, coming in July.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.040
So that is Lion.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.540
That's the first for new products
we wanted to tell you about today.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.050
The next product we're going
to talk about is iOS 5.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:35.180
And to do that,
I'd like to invite up Scott Forstal.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.280
Welcome!

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.340
So I'm here to tell you about iOS 5.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:55.750
Before I get into the cool stuff,
let me give you a quick update on iOS.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.300
As you know, iOS powers the iPhone,
the iPad, and the iPod Touch.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:11.820
And to date, we have sold, wait for it,
over 200 million iOS devices.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:21.490
and that makes iOS the number
one mobile operating system with

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:27.090
more than 44% of the market.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:36.070
Now the latest addition to
the iOS family is the iPad 2,

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.880
which is an incredible product.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.660
Even thinner and lighter
than the original,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.330
it comes in black and white,
it has cameras in the front and back.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.780
It is an amazing product.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.020
And our customers just couldn't
wait to get their hands on it.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.020
Or else they actually did have
to wait to get their hands on it.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.670
In the first 14 months,
we have already sold more

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.920
than 25 million iPads.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:12.640
We created a whole new category
of device with the iPad and

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.800
have sold more than 25 million.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:20.080
The iPad 2 joins the iPhone
and the iPod Touch for an

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.800
incredible line up of iOS devices.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.950
We've got some great stores to
go along with these as well,

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.800
like the iTunes Music Store.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:36.630
We've already sold more than 15 billion
songs from the iTunes Music Store.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:44.080
This of course makes it the number
one retailer of music in the world.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.000
Next is the iBookstore.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.410
You know we launched the iBookstore
just a little more than a year ago.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.540
Already all six major publishers
have signed up and are providing

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.200
books to the bookstore.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:56.880
Our customers love it.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:02.720
Our customers have downloaded
more than 130 million books.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.310
Great.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.200
and of course there's the App Store.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:16.230
Now the size and momentum of the
App Store is really hard to fathom.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:22.520
There are currently more than
425,000 apps on the App Store.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:29.020
And more than 90,000 of these were
made specifically for the iPad.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.160
They take full advantage of
the large touchscreen display,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.480
and they make the iPad a better product.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.150
So we'd like to thank our
developers for these great apps.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.500
Now our customers love it.

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:52.560
Our customers have downloaded more than
14 billion apps from the App Store and

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.700
that's in less than three years.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.010
It's amazing.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.140
Now our developers are being
well rewarded for this.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:07.290
Apple so far has paid out more than two
and a half billion dollars to developers

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.300
building apps for the App Store.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.820
Thank you.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.420
Now these apps, as you know,
cover every genre imaginable.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.050
There's great travel apps like this
walking tour from Lonely Planet.

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:28.690
They're incredibly addictive games.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:34.240
I'd say even mind-controllingly
addictive games like Tiny Wings.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:39.140
Great entertainment titles like HBO Go,
which lets you take HBO wherever you are

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.500
and you can watch it right on your iPad.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:46.700
There are deep apps like Mobile Mim,
which allow physicians

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.940
to look at CT scans and
PET scans right on their iPad.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:53.470
And this has been FDA approved.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.700
This next one from Jepson
has been FAA approved.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:02.400
It allows pilots to look at the
charts and the maps for airports

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.990
around the world right on their iPad.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.500
And there's great business apps out
there like WebEx which allows you to

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.030
have a multi-party video conference
and really hold a virtual meeting.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.950
So, some great apps out there.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:23.680
For our stores we have more than
225 million accounts all with credit

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.180
cards and one click purchasing
to make it really easy for our

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.790
customers to find what they want,
purchase it and download it

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.040
directly to their device.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:38.040
These stores go with an
incredible line up of iOS devices.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.820
Let's talk about the future
of iOS and that is iOS 5.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.350
OS5 is a major release.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:54.480
This is incredible for our
developers and for our customers.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.980
For our developers,
there are more than 1,500 new APIs and

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.810
some great enhancements to our tools.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.980
For our users,
there are more than 200 new features.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.540
Let me go ahead and
walk you through 10 now.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.410
Number one, notifications.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.660
I'm sure you're all
familiar with notifications.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:31.290
It looks something like this,
and it looks best when giants are on top.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.950
So you can get scoring alerts,
you can have alerts that pop up,

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:40.100
they can have audio, they can also badge
the home screen icons.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.640
Well these have been massively popular.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.610
In fact,
we have already pushed more than a

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.220
hundred billion push notifications.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.980
It's scaled beautifully.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.680
We've heard from our customers that
they're receiving so much money,

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.270
they'd like a better UI to get them.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:59.200
And we agree.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.200
And so we've built something that solves
some of the problems in the current one.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.200
Currently, when you get a notification,
it interrupts you.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.800
So if you're playing a game,
you get a modal alert,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.200
you have to deal with that modal
alert before you can go on.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.410
Also, in the lock screen,
you get this nice list of

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.060
things that have happened
while your phone's been locked.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.200
But when you unlock it,
that list isn't persistent.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.200
There's no way to get back to that list
and go through those notifications.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.410
Well,
we have designed a solution that solves

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.160
those issues and goes far beyond it.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.200
And we call it Notification Center.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.120
Notification Center is a single place.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.460
which combines together
all of your notifications.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.540
You can get to it at any time
from anywhere on your iPhone or

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.530
iPad or iPod Touch just by swiping
your finger down from the top

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.410
to reveal the notification center.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.260
So we think it is beautiful.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:07.090
It has your missed calls and voicemails,
text messages, mail messages,

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.800
scoring alerts, Facebook updates,
any push notifications that come

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.040
from the App Store all end up
right here in Notification Center.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.700
And we've even added stocks
and weather right up top.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.930
Now we didn't stop there.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.620
Notifications are no longer interrupting.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:27.920
So now if you're playing a game and
someone sends you say a text message,

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.320
get a nice animation from the top,
it's right there.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.190
We can keep on playing your game and
it'll automatically dismiss itself.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.900
You could have just tapped on it
and it would take you to that app.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.500
But it doesn't matter because you can
always get back to it anytime just by

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.300
swiping your finger down from the top.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.400
We've also improved the lock screen.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.490
You can see more information
for notifications here.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.940
And one of my favorite
features is for any one of the

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.540
notifications in the lock screen,
you can just slide your finger across

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.440
it and it takes you directly to
the app that sent the notification.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.520
Let me go ahead and just
show this to you now.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:20.500
So I've got a phone here running iOS 5.

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:21.730
You can see more information there.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:27.160
Now I'm just going to swipe my finger
right across that text message and

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.680
it takes me directly to the messages
app and right into the conversation.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.860
It's really convenient.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.570
Now to get to the notification center,
just swipe my finger down

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.730
from the top and there it is.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.510
Dismiss it by swiping up.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:42.230
Really nice animation.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:46.650
You can see that we're still in
winter here in San Francisco.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:53.040
I get all of my messages here,
so text messages and scoring alerts.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.200
Down at the bottom here I have
some alerts from MLB.com at bat.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.750
If I tap on that X button,
I can just go ahead and clear that out.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.000
If I see another notification
like the Facebook one,

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.880
I tap on it,
takes me directly to the Facebook app.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.780
So it's really convenient,
and at any time again,

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.530
swipe down from the top and you
get back to Notification Center.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.800
And that is Notification Center.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:29.700
Number two is Newsstand.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:35.580
You know,
I love reading newspapers and magazines

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.170
right on my iPhone and my iPad.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.470
And recently, we added subscriptions.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.910
This makes it easier for you to get all
the new issues without missing anything.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:51.390
Already, most of the major publishers of
magazines and many of newspapers have

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.230
signed up to support subscriptions.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.220
Now, these are incredible titles.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:01.170
Things like National Geographic.

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.340
and Spin.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.240
So great music magazines and of
course when you read these on

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.190
your iPad you get audio and video
in addition to all the articles.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:18.270
Vanity Fair, science magazines like
Popular Mechanics and Popular Science.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:26.810
Esquire, GQ, fashion magazines like Elle,
the Oprah Magazine,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.730
tech magazines like Wired,
and automobile magazines,

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.660
and sports magazines, the New Yorker.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.000
Newspapers, new ones like the Daily,
but also the New York Times.

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:41.990
The San Francisco Chronicle.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:46.140
Daily Telegraph,
and other international papers.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:51.460
And we've now created a single place
right in the App Store that combines

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.100
all of these newspaper and magazines.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.980
So you can find them all in one place.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.330
When you purchase them,
they're automatically downloaded

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.850
and placed in the newsstand.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.660
It's a new place right
on the home screen.

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:08.000
Looks like this beautiful news rack.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.680
In addition to this,
we do background downloads.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:23.550
So if a new issue comes out,
say of a newspaper while you're sleeping,

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:27.870
when you wake up and pick up your iPad,
that new newspaper is already

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.440
there ready for you to read it.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.200
And you can read it offline.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:39.010
On top of this,
we set the cover to be the front

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.640
page of the new newspaper and
we'll set it to be the cover of

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.800
the new magazine for magazines.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.790
So that is Newsstand.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.090
Next is Twitter.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:03.130
Now as I'm sure everyone's familiar,
Twitter is an incredibly popular service.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.220
People send more than a
billion tweets per week.

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.720
And we hear from a lot of our
customers on iPhone and iPad and

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.120
iPod Touch that they love Twitter.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:16.120
And so we want to make it even
easier for all of our customers

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.290
to use Twitter on iOS products.

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.380
We're doing a number of things for this.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.690
First, we're adding single sign on.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.860
So now, when you go to the settings app,
it's built in on the iPhone or iPad.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:33.110
You can enter your username and password
and now you're configured for Twitter.

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.220
For any app you download
off the App Store,

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.310
it'll just say can
I use your credentials?

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.180
When you say yes, you're logged in.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.550
You don't need to re-log
in every single time.

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:43.440
So single sign on.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.270
Next, we've integrated Twitter in
with many of our apps,

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.400
like camera and photos.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.850
So now if you're at a concert
and you take a photo and you

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.400
want to tweet that photo,
just tap on the action button,

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.730
it's a new option tweet,
and it brings up this

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:03.780
beautiful tweet sheet.

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:08.140
It gives you a nice
thumbnail of the photo,

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:11.700
gives you a countdown of how many
characters you have left to type,

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.490
and you can even optionally
add your location,

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:17.500
tap on that,
and then you've tweeted the photo.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.890
It's that simple.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:29.220
In addition to tweeting
from photos and camera,

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.940
you can tweet articles from safari,
websites.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.890
You can tweet videos from YouTube,
and you can tweet about

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.740
businesses or locations from maps.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:42.700
Beyond all of this,
we added integration with contacts.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:45.490
Now you might have a lot of
contacts that don't have photos,

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.420
but Twitter may have
photos for those people.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:52.500
And so you can use Twitter to
automatically update the photos

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:58.000
in your contact list and even
the @ username for your friends.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.940
And that's Twitter integration
throughout the OS.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.800
Next is Safari.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.840
Safari is the best mobile
web browser out there.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.700
It's also the most popular.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:23.600
In fact, nearly two-thirds of all mobile
web browsing is done on Safari.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.590
Beyond this,
we took Apple's Safari engine

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:28.600
and open sourced it.

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.980
And it's the basis of all
web browsing on Android.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.690
So Safari Engine is the basis
of more than 90% of all web

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.800
browsing on mobile devices.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.920
Well, in iOS 5,
we're making Safari even better.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:44.880
We've got some great features.

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.390
The first is Reader.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:52.280
Safari Reader becomes available up
here as a new button when you're

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.940
reading a story on a website.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.740
If you just tap on that button,
we take the story you're reading

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.280
and make it front and center.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.920
We get rid of all the distractions,
set the font size right,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.750
and even if it's a multi-page story,
so you'd have to tap through multiple

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:14.500
web pages normally to get to it,
we put it in a single scrolling story.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.780
It's really convenient.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:27.030
on top of that you can now
email the contents of the story

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:31.320
before you could just email
the link but now when you email

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:37.280
You get the link plus the
contents in your Compose window.

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:41.740
And all of this works
really well on the iPad.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.410
It works great on the iPhone as well.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:45.700
It's the perfect size for it.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.460
It sets the font size right.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.140
It's really nice to read stories.

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:50.100
So that's Safari Reader.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.740
The second one is Reading List.

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:59.680
Reading list is a simple and
convenient way for you to quickly

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.100
save a story to read it later.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.520
Just put it in the reading list and
when you add an item to reading list,

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.330
it gets added to the reading
list on all of your iOS devices

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:15.070
and even the reading list on
Safari on Mac and Safari on Windows.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.890
So if you don't have time to
finish it here on the iPad,

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.580
you can finish reading
it later on your iPhone.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.660
And the next feature is tab browsing.

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:35.190
We have added full tab
browsing on Safari on the iPad.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.200
And you know, let me just show it to you.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.020
Alright.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:49.140
So here I have an iPad running iOS 5.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.940
I'll launch Safari here.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.230
And the first thing you'll see with
tab browsing is it is lightning

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.800
fast to switch between windows now.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.740
Just tap on it and you're there.

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.340
Great.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.700
Now I'm on the DP review site,
which is a fantastic

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.320
review site for cameras.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.470
And they have really extensive reviews.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.300
In fact,
you normally have to tap through many,

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.460
many pages to read the whole review.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:17.640
If I look at this one here,
it's 20 pages long.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:23.180
If I tap the Reader button here,
it loads the entire story up in Reader.

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.460
Now I can just scroll through.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:29.320
It gets rid of all the distractions,
lets me concentrate just on the content.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.260
That is Reader.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.490
You even see that when it
goes between pages here,

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:43.390
where you would have had
to tap to say next page,

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.960
it automatically gives you a
little page break so you know when

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.060
it's going through those pages.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:52.290
Now let's say if I don't have time
to finish the story right now,

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:57.080
I can just tap the bookmarks bar
item and here I have reading list,

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:01.380
I tap plus and now it's added
this to my reading list and again

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:05.160
I can go finish this on Mac,
on Safari on my Mac or any

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.420
of my other iOS devices.

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.540
It's great.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.700
And if I really like this
and I want to tweet about it,

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.240
let me show you the
Twitter integration while we're here.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:17.100
I tap tweet, brings up the tweet sheet.

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.190
We do completion,
so I have a friend Gary Dunn,

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:24.520
so I hit at G,
automatically fills in the name,

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:31.220
tap that and say I like this one.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.650
and I can optionally add my location,
tap send and it's tweeted.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.340
It's that easy.

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:42.980
So some really great Safari enhancements
and Twitter integration throughout.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:55.800
[Transcript missing]

00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:01.410
All of us are constantly
creating lists of things.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.800
Lists of things to do,
lists of things to buy,

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:05.310
like a grocery list.

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:09.450
Some of them have a place associated,
like don't forget to walk

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:10.660
the dog when I get home.

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:14.370
And some have a time associated,
say buy concert tickets Monday at 10am,

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:15.980
so that's when they go on sale.

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.880
Wouldn't it be great if...

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:23.660
You can get rid of all these scraps of
paper and store all this on your phone.

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.290
But beyond that,
if your phone actually reminded

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:31.020
you to do things as opposed to just
statically keeping a list of things,

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.980
well that's exactly what
the Reminders app does.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.780
On the Reminders app you
can store lists of things,

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.250
multiple lists,
so things for a trip to San Francisco,

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:42.380
or a birthday party, or a grocery list.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.980
You can store dates associated
with these reminders,

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.020
so you'll be reminded on that date.

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:51.360
You can also assign location.

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.840
This is really cool.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:58.100
I can set up a reminder to say,
"Remind me to call my wife when I leave

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:03.190
the convention today." And it'll set
a geofence up around Moscone Center,

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:07.360
so when I get in my car to leave,
it'll pop up and say "Call."

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.200
It solves the problem of
"I'm leaving right now,

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.190
I promise." Call in the car.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.400
You can of course search through all your
reminders and reminders will sync with

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:30.130
iCal on the Mac using CalDAV and even
with Outlook on Windows using Exchange.

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.960
And that is reminders.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:42.890
Next is camera.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.680
You know, the iPhone 4 is widely regarded
as having one of the best

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.200
cameras on a mobile phone.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.820
It's also one of the most popular.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:57.030
In fact,
if you look at cameras used to take

00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:01.830
photos and then post them to Flickr,
now this is all cameras,

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:07.890
not just cameras on phones,
you see where the iPhone 4 is.

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:14.480
It is already by far the most
popular camera on a phone to take

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.900
photos and it very soon will be
the most popular camera overall.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:22.900
We want to make using the camera even
better and that's what we're doing.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:26.400
The first thing we're doing
is making it way faster to

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.290
just get in and take a photo.

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:39.130
So now, if there's some moment happening,
your kid's doing something really cute,

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:41.780
you want to capture it,
you double click that home button,

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.760
you get a new camera icon.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.520
When you tap on that camera icon,
you're brought directly and

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.380
immediately to the camera and
you're ready to take a photo.

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:59.230
What's really cool about this is
even if you have a passcode set,

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:01.300
we'll take you right
in to take a new photo.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.080
We'll protect it as you can't see
any previous photos you've taken

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.620
or anything else on the phone
without typing your passcode.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.240
But you can start taking
a picture immediately.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.640
And you can even use the volume
up button now to click the photo.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.240
And that sound, I think people say,
use the shutter button

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:29.300
to turn your volume up.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:35.130
So, in addition to this,

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.380
We've added optional grid lines so
you can use the rule of thirds to

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.540
compose your photo or line it up.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:48.210
You can now pinch to zoom
right within the camera.

01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:51.850
If you hold your finger
over part of the scene now,

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:55.100
we'll set the auto exposure
and auto focus lock.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.530
You can even move it around, you know,
stick to that.

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.600
Now,
this is a really advanced feature and

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.000
we've brought it to the iPhone and we've
made it really easy for everyone to use.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.160
Now next,
once you've taken your great photos,

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.500
you can now edit them
right on your iPhone.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.100
and your iPad.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:25.300
You can do things like crop and rotate,
red eye reduction.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.620
So if you've taken the photo at left
where the flash has caused a red eye,

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:33.980
you can automatically remove that
red eye right on your iPhone or iPad.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.880
And we even brought over the one click
enhance that we pioneered in iPhoto

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.910
on the Mac and it brought that to iOS.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.150
So you can see when you applied
one tap enhance to the right how

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:49.750
the color tones look so much nicer,
how it pulls detail out of shadow.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.260
It's really nice.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.780
So some great photo editing features
and really nice camera enhancements.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.120
Next is Mail.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.650
Now Mail is one of the most used
applications on both the iPhone,

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:15.050
iPod, and iPod Touch.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.360
and we're making it even better in iOS 5.

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:22.600
We're adding rich text formatting
so you can set things as bold,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.150
italic and underline.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.440
You can control the indentation.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.350
So you're forwarding something,
you can unindent it or further indent it.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.600
You can now drag the
addresses between 2CC and VCC.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.900
Don't have to retype them again.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.000
We've added support for flagging
so you can flag and unflag.

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:50.100
This next one has been an
incredibly popular request.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:53.700
In addition to searching from, to,
and subject, you can search the entire

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:58.040
contents of all your messages,
both the messages on your phone and all

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.600
the messages back on the mail server.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.620
So search the entire
contents of your messages.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.770
For the iPad, we added a really nice
swipe to inbox gesture,

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.820
so it makes it really nice
to use this in portrait.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.620
You swipe it on, tap on something,
swipe it off.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:19.140
And with every release of iOS 5 or iOS,
we continue to add more support

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.790
for our enterprise customers.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.530
And one example of that in iOS 5
is we've added support for S MIME.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.370
So now...

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.300
I think we've done a
really nice job of this.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.450
Now if you have the
certificate of someone else,

01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:38.180
you automatically get this lock
icon right in the addressing field

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.500
to show you this will be encrypted
when sent to the other person.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.860
Let me just go ahead and give you a
demo of a few of these features now.

01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:51.260
All right.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.990
So first I can show you a simple gesture.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.430
I can just pull on

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.340
The Inbox, right from there.

01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:58.730
So anywhere you are
when you're in portrait,

01:03:58.850 --> 01:03:59.220
just pull it on.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.460
You don't have to go hunt up and
find the right button for it.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.020
You can see we have flagging here,
so I can tap on that flagged message.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.400
One other feature we've added is
a built-in dictionary throughout

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.020
the OS as a service now.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.260
So before,
we had a dictionary in the iBooks app,

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:17.740
but we now have brought that
to the entire OS so all apps

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:20.090
from the App Store can use it.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.650
So here, if I just press down,
let's say on leeches,

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.590
I don't know what that is, let's say,
I get a define in addition to copy,

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:30.600
tap define, there it is,
built-in dictionary.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.270
It's great.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.740
If I say respond to this message, again,
I can grab one of these addresses

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:46.100
and now just drag it to BCC,
drag it to and rearrange it.

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.020
It's really nice and easy.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.600
There's one more feature
I want to show you,

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.420
and it's actually a system-wide
feature having to do with the keyboard.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.850
When we released the original iPhone,
we revolutionized the way people

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.340
would type on multi-touch displays.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.590
And we keep on challenging
ourselves to make that even better.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.100
We have a new variant of the
keyboard in iOS 5 for the iPad,

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.280
which we think people who like
to type with their thumbs while

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.370
holding it are really going to like.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.080
In the bottom right,
you see the keyboard button,

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.940
and now it has some grab handles.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.340
If I just take those and drag it up,
it splits it into two.

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:30.400
And so what it does is it just moves the
keys closer to your thumbs on the side

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.110
so you can put it wherever you want.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.580
It's really nice and it's persistent
for every app in the system.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:37.760
It just stays where you put it.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.060
If you want to put it back down,
just press and hold, say dock and merge,

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.470
it goes back down to the bottom.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.190
So even a split keyboard.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:59.300
[Transcript missing]

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.870
These incredible devices,
the iPhone and the iPad,

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:26.070
and people get them.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.430
Home,
they open up their box and they see this.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:38.900
I said, "What?" Now we're living
in a post-PC world.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.480
In fact, especially with the iPad,
we're ushering in the post-PC world.

01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:46.280
We have a lot of customers
coming to us and saying,

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.620
"I want to buy an iPad as my only device.

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.040
I don't own a computer.

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:54.220
I want to buy an iPhone
as my only device,

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.120
my only actually internet
access for where I live.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.000
It will be my iPhone."

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.010
We know we're selling to a lot
of places where the households

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.340
just don't have computers.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.230
And they want to buy an iOS
device as their only device,

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:11.080
and that's exactly what we're
going to support in iOS 5.

01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:14.260
Now,
when you take your iPhone out of the box,

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:18.370
instead of seeing this,
you're going to see this.

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:29.400
You can now set up and activate
your device right on the

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.640
device and you are ready to go.

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:32.600
It's that easy.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.740
And of course there's some other things
we had to do to make this possible.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.200
Software updates are now over the air.

01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:52.800
So you no longer need to go and plug into
a computer just to update your software.

01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:56.750
And of course, they're now Delta updates.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.820
So instead of downloading the entire OS,
you just download what's changed.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:09.760
Now the next thing we did is we looked
at all of the apps in the iPhone,

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.280
iPad, iPod Touch, and asked ourselves,
what are the reasons that people

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.980
go back to a computer today?

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.820
And let's add that
functionality right to iOS.

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.900
So for instance,
you used to have to go back to a computer

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:24.360
to create calendars or delete calendars.

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.260
You can now create and delete
calendars right from iOS.

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:30.960
You saw for photos,
we've added really significant

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.900
editing functionality in there.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.940
So you can crop, rotate, one tap enhance,
red eye reduction right

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.820
from within your iOS device.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.900
Even in mail now,
you can create mailboxes and

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.440
delete mailboxes right from iOS.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.520
So we looked at all of the apps
in the iPhone and the iPad,

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:53.140
added that functionality,
so now if you want to cut the cord,

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.010
you can.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.380
Next is Game Center.

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:11.170
iOS is the most popular
gaming platform on the planet.

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:17.100
There are more than 100,000 game and
entertainment titles in the App Store.

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.650
And so about nine months
ago we launched Game Center.

01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:23.110
And we did it to make it even
easier for people to find players

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.030
to play games against and also to
make it easy for you to compare how

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:29.230
you're doing against your friends.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:36.760
Well, in just nine months we have
50 million Game Center users.

01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:43.680
To put that into perspective,
Xbox Live has been around

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:50.970
for about eight years,
and they have around 30 million users.

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:57.510
So Game Center is very popular and
we're making it even better in iOS 5.

01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:59.840
To make it more fun and
social we're adding photos.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.540
You can see photos of your friends,
change your photos.

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.800
You can now compare yourself
against your friends using

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.100
achievement points per game.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:12.320
You can see friends of friends as well.

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:17.760
You also will get recommended friends
that might be great people to play

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.800
some of the games that you like.

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.940
We've also added game recommendations.

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:25.160
So there might be some
really great games out there,

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.800
maybe they're new,
that you don't know about.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.800
And we'll help you discover those.

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:33.630
Once you've discovered a game you like,
you can purchase and download

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.800
it directly from Game Center.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.800
Now this is great both for our
customers and for our developers.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.590
Another thing we've done for our
developers is we've added support for

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:48.120
turn-based games right into the OS.

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:54.540
There are some great turn-based
games out there like Scrabble,

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:56.680
but the developer had to
do all the work for that.

01:10:56.730 --> 01:11:00.880
And now that's supported
right out of the box in iOS 5.

01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:05.180
So some really nice
enhancements to Game Center.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.750
Next.

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:13.020
is iMessage.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:19.880
Now, I believe we have the best messaging
client out there on the iPhone.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.520
It works tremendously well
to send text messages,

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:28.950
send photos, send videos,
and our customers love it.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.700
and our iPhone customers.

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:36.200
But what about our iPad customers
and our iPod Touch customers?

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.640
They've been asking us for a
messaging solution and so in iOS

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:46.920
5 we are launching a new messaging
service between all iOS 5 customers.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.310
and we call it iMessage.

01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:01.890
So iMessage supports the iPhone,
the iPad and the iPod Touch.

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:07.220
It does everything you've come to expect
from our messaging app on the iPhone.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:11.380
So you can send text messages, photos,
videos, send contacts,

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:16.360
do group messaging,
everything you've come to expect.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.130
And we've added some
really nice new features.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:21.100
Things like delivery receipts.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.020
So you can see if it's been delivered
to the other person's device.

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.160
Optional read receipts.

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:27.370
So you can see if it's been read.

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:31.540
This is one of my favorite
typing indication.

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:34.360
So you can tell now if someone starts
typing and they're responding to you,

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.380
you know you're about
to get that message.

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.110
iMessages are pushed to all your devices.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:46.300
So if you start a conversation on your
iPad and later pick up your iPhone,

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.430
you can pick up right where you
left off with all the context

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.100
of that conversation to date.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:01.250
is supported over both 3G
and Wi-Fi and everything is

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:05.330
sent encrypted over the air.

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:09.160
And I'd like to just give
you a demo of iMessage now.

01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:10.940
To do so,
I'd also like to invite up Jaws,

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:13.410
Vice President of Product Marketing,
to help me.

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:15.630
Hey, Jaws, Scott.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.300
Thanks for having me.

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.300
Absolutely.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.300
If you don't mind,
I'm going to play a game though.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.300
Playing a game, okay.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.300
Try not to bother me.

01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:25.290
Product marketing.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:32.300
So he's on the iPhone on the left,
I'm on my iPad on the right hand side.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.170
I'll go ahead and launch messages here.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.240
So here I have a
conversation going with Jaws.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.300
Normally we don't stand next to each
other when having these conversations.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.300
So most I've talked to you all week.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.160
Let's grab lunch after the show.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.300
No.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:49.520
Okay, so when I send this to him,
you'll notice as he plays the game,

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.300
it comes in right at the top.

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:57.520
and he can keep on playing the game
so it's not interrupting him as he

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.300
does his lovely job playing this game.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.300
I'm on a roll, don't bother me.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.940
But at any time,
he can get right back to that message.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.440
Uh-oh.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.340
At any time.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.740
I think this might be a good time.

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:13.240
At any time.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.790
It's so addictive.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.040
Just by pulling down, tapping on that,
takes him right to this.

01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:23.260
Now, as he starts typing,
see on my side where there's

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.120
the three dots in the blue,
and that lets me know

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.450
he's currently responding.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:31.700
Well, check maybe some other
messages while he's doing so.

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:35.420
So then when he sends the message,
you see where it sends,

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.950
he gets a little delivered,
it already knows it's been

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:40.040
delivered right to my device.

01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:44.080
And when I tap on his message,
it sends a read receipt

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.120
saying read 11:15 AM,
he knows I've read it.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.550
So read receipts great.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.600
We can also send high
quality photos and videos.

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:02.700
Let me go ahead and choose a photo here.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.900
Alright,
maybe we can have a picnic by the bridge.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.900
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.300
Send him a little picture again.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.710
You can tell from the dots on his
side that I'm composing it right now.

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:14.900
Send it off.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:19.340
And again,
we go over Wi-Fi as well as 3G.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:23.550
sends it over, and again he gets it,
nice, high quality,

01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:26.240
and the entire transmission
is encrypted over the air.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.960
And again, I'm on my iPad,
so it supports iPad, iPod Touch,

01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:32.100
and iPhone.

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:33.290
Thanks, Joss.

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.170
Can't wait for lunch.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.660
So iMessage.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.370
And we're actually building this on the
push notification system we've built,

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:48.640
so we know how to scale this.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.400
We have incredible
features here in iOS 5.

01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:59.280
Notification system,
which is just really nice.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.470
Newsstand makes it even better to
read your newspapers and magazines

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.480
right on your iPad or iPhone.

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:08.360
Great Twitter integration,
a new reminders app.

01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.620
You can be PC free if you want.

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:14.500
And the new iMessage application.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:19.800
And these are just 10 of the
more than 200 new user features.

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:23.180
There's really something
for everyone in iOS 5.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.640
And there's other things
like AirPlay mirroring.

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:30.820
You can now mirror your entire
iPad 2 right to your television

01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:39.180
wirelessly using Apple TV.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.160
Wi-Fi sync to iTunes.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.320
Before you had to --

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.670
Exactly,
before you had to go back and plug

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:56.680
into your computer to sync and now when
you are charging at night let's say,

01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.880
your iOS device will automatically find
iTunes over Wi-Fi and sync with it.

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.110
And before it syncs,
it will back itself up

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:06.210
so you automatically get
backed up every single day.

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:13.550
There's also some really nice
new multitasking gestures,

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.610
so you can just flick
right between your apps.

01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:17.640
It's really nice.

01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:20.190
Not only is there something
for every one of our customers,

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.470
there's something for every
one of our developers.

01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:27.170
some great new development tools
including significant enhancements

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.630
to Xcode instruments in the simulator

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.280
Even Core Image,
we brought over the powerful

01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:38.910
Core Image Framework
from Mac OS X to iOS.

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:44.470
This allows developers to do complex
image operations like red eye reduction,

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:47.900
face detection,
right from within their apps.

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.900
So you're asking yourself,
when are you getting it?

01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:54.980
And the answer is,
we are giving a developer

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.730
seed to you today.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.440
This is going to be great for the
conference as you learn about all the

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.930
new APIs and all the sessions this week.

01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:15.740
You can go and use those
APIs immediately using your seed.

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.580
And iOS 5 will ship to all
of our customers this fall.

01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:24.340
iOS 5 will support the same
devices that we supported

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.600
with our last software update.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:32.210
So that's the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4,
all the iPads, iPad and iPad 2,

01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:35.700
and the third and fourth
generation iPod Touch.

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:38.680
And that is iOS 5.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:39.950
Thanks.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.810
And that is the second of the software
products we want to tell you about today.

01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:59.150
To tell you about the third,
I'd like to turn it back over to Steve.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.100
You like everything so far?

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.100
Good.

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.900
Well, I'll try not to blow it.

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:21.100
So I get to talk about iCloud.

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:25.280
We've been working on this for some time
now and we're really excited about it.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.940
About 10 years ago,
we had one of our most important

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:36.420
insights and that was that
the PC was going to become the

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.950
digital hub for your digital life.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.180
What did that mean?

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.080
Well, it meant that that's where you were
going to put your digital photos.

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.110
Where else were you going to put them?

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:54.230
Your digital video off your digital
camcorder and of course your music.

01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:54.940
Right?

01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:00.320
You were going to acquire it in the
device or potentially on your Mac.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.890
And you were going to basically
sync it to the Mac and everything

01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:07.030
was going to work fine.

01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:10.630
And it did for the
better part of 10 years.

01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:14.390
But it's broken down
in the last few years.

01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:16.090
Why?

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.500
Well, because devices have changed.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.490
They now all have music.

01:20:21.970 --> 01:20:24.460
They now all have photos.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.640
They now all have video.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:30.670
And so if I acquire a song,
I buy it right on my iPhone,

01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:34.480
I want to get that to my other devices.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.110
Right?

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:38.500
I pick up my iPad and it
doesn't have that song on it.

01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:41.500
So I have to sync my iPhone to my Mac.

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:44.500
Then I have to sync my other
devices to the Mac to get that song.

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.510
But then they've deposited
some photos on the Mac,

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:51.500
so I have to sync the iPhone again
with the Mac to get those photos.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:56.410
And keeping these devices
in sync is driving us crazy.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:03.990
and many more.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.160
We have a great solution
for this problem.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.460
And we think this solution
is our next big insight,

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:15.800
which is we're going to demote the
PC and the Mac to just be a device.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:20.200
Just like an iPhone,
an iPad or an iPod touch.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:24.630
And we're going to move the digital hub,
the center of your digital life,

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.160
into the cloud.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.480
Because all these new devices have
communications built into them,

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:35.140
they can all talk to the
cloud whenever they want.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.170
And so now.

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:41.710
If I get something on my iPhone,
it's sent up to the cloud immediately.

01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:44.020
Let's say I take some pictures with it.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.530
Those pictures are in the cloud
and they are now pushed down to my

01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:51.700
devices completely automatically.

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:57.130
and now everything's in sync with me
not even having to think about it.

01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:00.630
I don't even have to take
the devices out of my pocket.

01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:03.300
I don't have to be near my Mac or PC.

01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:10.260
Now some people think the cloud
is just a hard disk in the sky,

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.500
right?

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:15.950
And you take a bunch of stuff and
you put it in your Dropbox or your

01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:19.440
iDisk or whatever and it transfers
it up to the cloud and stores it

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.640
and then you drag whatever you want
back out on your other devices.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.260
We think it's way more than
that and we call it iCloud.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:32.210
Now iCloud stores your content
in the cloud and wirelessly

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.930
pushes it to all your devices.

01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:40.790
So it automatically uploads it,
stores it and automatically pushes

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.530
it to all your other devices.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:48.500
But also it's completely
integrated with your apps and so

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.860
everything happens automatically.

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:52.150
And so you can see that
iCloud stores your content in

01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:52.620
the cloud and automatically
stores it to all your devices.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.920
And there's nothing new to learn.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.200
It just all works.

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.020
It just works.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.340
And you might ask,
why should I believe them?

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.420
They're the ones that
brought me Mobile Me.

01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:25.340
It wasn't our finest hour.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.180
Let me just say that.

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:28.500
But we learned a lot.

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:33.060
Now, the three core apps in
MobileMe were Contacts,

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.700
Calendar, and Mail.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.270
Three things we'd obviously
like kept up to date.

01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:42.780
We've thrown them away,
we've re-architected and rewritten them

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:46.930
from the ground up to be iCloud apps.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.380
and we've put them on all of our devices.

01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:56.230
So, as an example, in contacts,
when I make a new contact on my iPhone,

01:23:56.230 --> 01:24:00.900
it's automatically brought up to the
cloud where it's stored on the cloud,

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:05.140
right, the truth is on the cloud,
and then it's automatically

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.950
pushed down to my other
devices so they're all in sync.

01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:10.180
It's that easy.

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:15.520
I just update a contact on my iPhone
and don't even think about it and that

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:20.190
contact is updated on all my other
devices and if I change it on any device,

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:26.260
it's updated on all devices wirelessly,
automatically without me doing a thing.

01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:30.360
So that's contacts, here's calendars.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.360
Works much the same way.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.710
I make a new calendar event on my iPhone,
it's stored in the cloud,

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:39.060
and it's pushed to my other devices.

01:24:41.150 --> 01:24:41.950
Pretty cool.

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:45.390
We've also added calendar sharing.

01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:50.060
So as an example, if I'm sharing a few
calendars with my wife,

01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:53.250
school and soccer calendars, let's say.

01:24:53.730 --> 01:25:00.600
Right, and I add a new calendar for a
teacher-parent conference on my phone.

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:04.060
It's again automatically
pushed up to the cloud.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.290
and automatically push
to my wife's iPhone.

01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:15.830
If she adds an appointment
for a soccer game,

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.320
again, goes up to the cloud
and back to my iPhone.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.720
It's that simple.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.540
And so calendars has,
it stores your calendars in the cloud,

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:33.220
changes on any device or push to all your
devices and we have shared calendars.

01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:35.860
We think you're going to
love the new calendars.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.020
It just works.

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:39.840
And then we have mail.

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:45.410
Mail was in the best shape of all,
but it's even better now.

01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:49.400
We give you a mail account at @me.com.

01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:53.630
Your new messages again are pushed to
all your devices and like we're used to,

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:58.200
your inbox and folders are all
kept up to date on all devices.

01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:02.990
So that's mail and no ads.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.630
We build products that we want for
ourselves too and we just don't want ads.

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.710
So we can't get there.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:22.970
So these are the three apps that
formed the core of MobileMe.

01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:27.800
We used to sell them for a
subscription price of $99 annually.

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.600
As of today,
this product ceases to exist and those

01:26:32.710 --> 01:26:35.840
three apps are now going to be free.

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.680
But we didn't stop there.

01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:59.820
We've got three more apps that we've
brought into the iCloud universe.

01:26:59.820 --> 01:26:59.820
The first

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:05.110
is of course the App Store.

01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:07.560
The App Store,
you've bought a lot of apps

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.040
so far and you can buy them of
course directly on your devices.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.640
Maybe the app you want isn't on
the device you've got with you.

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:22.000
So for all your purchase history now,
you can see it on all your devices,

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.900
even if the app's not there.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:32.140
and we've added this button here which
is download from the cloud and if

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.940
you want that app on that device you
just push that button and that app

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.900
is automatically sent to that device.

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:39.400
Right?

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.840
And there's no extra charge.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.740
No extra charge.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.540
Now we've done that for
your purchase history,

01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:49.580
what about for devices
you buy in the future?

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.660
Well for devices when you
buy them in the future,

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:55.650
you want to buy Yelp let's say,

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.680
The cloud downloads it
to all your devices,

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:02.610
again at no extra charge,
all automatically.

01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:09.610
So that's what we're
doing with the App Store.

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.280
iBooks, same thing.

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:16.340
You've got your purchase history of all
the books you've bought on any device.

01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:18.780
You want to get it on your iPhone, say.

01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:21.860
Just push the button,
it downloads to that device.

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:27.740
When you buy a new iBook,
let's say you want to buy this book here,

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:31.880
The Wave,
it downloads it to all your devices now.

01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:38.390
and if you're reading it on one device,
let's say you're reading it on your

01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:42.380
iPad and you've just got to run,
you get to a page,

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.820
you bookmark that page,
that bookmark is sent up to the cloud and

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:50.370
stored and again pushed to all your other
devices so maybe you can read another,

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.720
the rest of the chapter as an
example on the train to work.

01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:56.490
It all just works.

01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:04.350
and now backup.

01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:06.690
We talked about being PC free.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.290
Scott talked about how you can
wirelessly backup your devices

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:14.320
daily to your PC or your Mac.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.890
But let's do it to the cloud as well.

01:29:17.890 --> 01:29:19.980
For those people that want
to be completely PC free.

01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:23.510
So we've added wireless
backup to the cloud.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:28.700
[Transcript missing]

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:33.370
We're going to back up a lot of your
important contents to the cloud.

01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:36.320
If you ever get a new phone
or have to replace a phone,

01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:39.820
you literally type in your
Apple ID and password and

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:43.120
everything will be loaded onto that
phone automatically and wirelessly.

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:56.750
So we automatically do daily
backups to iCloud over Wi-Fi.

01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:02.560
We back up your purchased music, apps,
and books.

01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:06.620
We back up your camera roll
with your photos and videos.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.080
We back up your device settings.

01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:12.330
And we back up your app data.

01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:14.160
All to the cloud.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.500
So that is backup.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:25.700
And those are three other
apps that come with iCloud.

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:29.000
But we couldn't stop there.

01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:36.210
And so we have a final
three apps that are amazing.

01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:39.780
The most inventive part of iCloud,
I think.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.280
And I'd love to tell you about them.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:51.900
[Transcript missing]

01:30:54.670 --> 01:31:01.380
If I'm on my iPad and
I create a Pages document,

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:01.380
right,

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.650
I create a pages document and
it automatically uploads it

01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:08.390
and stores it in the cloud.

01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:13.990
When I close that document completely
automatically and it then pushes it to

01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:17.210
all the devices that I have pages on.

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:24.360
So I can get the document
between my devices.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:31.180
And we have put that into pages, numbers,
and keynote.

01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:34.370
As a matter of fact,
the versions we just released

01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:36.430
last week have this in there.

01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:41.500
And to demonstrate what
this is like with iWork,

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:44.740
I'd love to invite Roger Rosner,
who's our VP of iWork,

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.660
up to give us a quick demo.

01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:51.730
Thank you, Steve.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.900
All right, let's take a look at how iWork
and iCloud will work together.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.550
Let's say you're working on a
Keynote presentation on your iPad,

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:05.550
making a beautiful presentation
with all those awesome Keynote

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.440
graphic effects and animations.

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:11.930
You're away from home,
you didn't bring your iPad with you,

01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:15.590
and you run into somebody who
wants to see your presentation.

01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:20.080
Well, the good news is,
last week we shipped iWork for iPhone.

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.630
And even better,
for anybody who bought an

01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:25.620
iWork app for your iPad,
you can download that app for your

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.640
iPhone at no additional charge.

01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:30.920
So let's fire up Keynote on this phone.

01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:34.570
This is the first time we've run it here,
so it's going to say "Hi."

01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:39.180
Then it's going to say,
"Do you want to use iCloud?" We say yes.

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.930
And immediately,
it sees all your Keynote presentations

01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:45.090
that you've been working on in the cloud,
and starts to download them in

01:32:45.170 --> 01:32:47.070
the background to your iPhone.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.220
So I'll open this one
we were just looking at.

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:52.370
And as you can see, it's all there.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.360
I didn't even remember what
slide we were looking at.

01:32:55.370 --> 01:33:00.800
And if I want to, I can just hit play,
play it right on my iPhone.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:05.120
And I put exactly zero effort
into getting that file over here.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:05.460
Pretty neat.

01:33:14.150 --> 01:33:18.940
Of course, all the iWork apps use iCloud,
so let's take a look at Pages.

01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:22.990
And imagine you're out and you're
inspired to make some changes to

01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:24.780
a document you've been working

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.290
So I'm going to move
this graphic over here.

01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:31.580
Maybe I just took a photograph
that I think would be great

01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:33.020
to spruce up my cover page.

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:37.440
So I'll go to my camera roll,
insert my graphic,

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:41.420
use alignment guides to place it,
and I'm done.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.860
And I stick the phone in my
pocket and I forget about it.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.930
And in the background,
iCloud is grabbing all those

01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:52.330
changes and then immediately
pushing them back down to my iPad.

01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:55.460
So when I get home, pick up the iPad,
fire up pages,

01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.880
you can see in the upper left,
my document thumbnail

01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:59.200
has already been updated.

01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:11.820
And there are all my edits,
absolutely no effort on my part.

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:14.820
And that is how iWork works with iCloud.

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:16.100
I think you're going to like it.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.580
Thank you.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:39.300
[Transcript missing]

01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:45.960
A lot of us have been working for 10
years to get rid of the file system.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.700
So the user didn't
have to worry about it.

01:34:47.770 --> 01:34:50.030
When you try to teach

01:34:50.700 --> 01:35:14.900
[Transcript missing]

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:20.080
But the piece that we weren't
finished with was how do we move those

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.960
documents around to different devices.

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:27.740
And documents in the cloud
solves that problem for us.

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:40.720
and others.

01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:41.940
The apps can store documents in iCloud.

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:41.940
iCloud pushes those documents to
a user's devices automatically.

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:41.940
The documents update on all
devices when changed on any device.

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:48.870
and we are releasing API for all of you.

01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:01.990
It's really easy to tie your apps
into iCloud's storage system.

01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:06.550
and again you can have complex documents,
apps like pages,

01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:12.020
or we've got another storage
facility for key value data.

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:14.460
So as an example, if you've got an app
that just tracks stocks,

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:17.940
you can just update the key
value pairs and we'll store

01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:19.860
that in the cloud as well.

01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:24.770
So,
documents and key value data works across

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.890
all iOS devices and Macs and PCs too.

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:40.290
So we think this is
going to be pretty big.

01:36:40.290 --> 01:36:43.260
And that is documents in the cloud.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.600
[Transcript missing]

01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:55.000
and it's called PhotoStream.

01:36:55.050 --> 01:36:59.100
And it's going to bring
the cloud to photos.

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:02.840
How many times have we
taken photos on our iPhone,

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:06.040
maybe of our kids in the afternoon,

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:10.690
and wanted, when we got home,
to share them on an iPad and have to go

01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:13.240
through the process of moving them over.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:18.000
Wouldn't it be great if by the time I got
home they were already there on the iPad?

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.000
Well that's what PhotoStream is going
to do for us across all of our devices.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:29.990
So again I take photos on any device,
puts it in the camera roll,

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:33.760
That will be automatically
uploaded to the cloud where

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.990
it's stored and automatically
downloaded to all my other devices.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.620
including in this case a Mac.

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:47.720
And so I've got my photos on my iPad
just waiting for me when I get home.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:53.860
Now, in addition, I can import photos.

01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:57.080
Right into iPhoto as
an example on the Mac.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.040
It'll upload those to the
cloud and do exactly the same

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.210
thing with them by pushing them
down to all my other devices.

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:06.290
So it's apps that I,
it's photos that I take

01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:07.930
or photos that I import.

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:11.940
and we built this right into the apps.

01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:14.320
I hope you've seen that as
we've gone through this.

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:17.910
We've built this right into the app
so there's nothing new to learn.

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.060
So PhotoStream on the iPad's photo app,
we've built it right in,

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.710
right next to albums.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.240
We have a button called PhotoStream.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.380
You push it and you're
looking at the PhotoStream.

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:29.900
It's that simple.

01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.680
There's not a separate app
that you have to go learn.

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.900
It's right there in your Photos app.

01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:38.400
It's right there in your
Photos app on your iPhone.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.660
It's just right there with
all your other albums.

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:42.650
There you go.

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:43.780
PhotoStream.

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:54.470
On the Mac,
we built it right into iPhoto,

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:58.050
and so it's right there on the side,
your photo stream.

01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:06.170
and on a PC they don't have a photos
app so we use the pictures folder.

01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:13.400
In addition to that,
we've even built it in to Apple TV.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.100
So Apple TV...

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:26.160
Apple TV talks directly over the internet
directly to the photo stream servers.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.380
Doesn't even go through your PC.

01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:31.200
Talks directly to the photo stream
servers so you can watch the

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.600
photos right on your Apple TV.

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:43.830
So, one of the problems we faced was
that photos are large and will use

01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:47.190
up all the memory on your devices.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.190
They're also large.

01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:52.320
They'll consume vast amounts
of storage in our server farms.

01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:55.000
So we've came up with a great scheme.

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.400
We're going to store
photos on your devices.

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:01.470
We're going to store the
last thousand photos.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:03.420
The Last Thousand.

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:05.990
And any photos you want
to keep permanently,

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.210
just move them into an album
and they'll stay forever.

01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:13.130
But they'll be parading by you,
The Last Thousand photographs.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.380
on your Mac or PC,
because we have more storage,

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.130
we'll store all of them.

01:40:19.130 --> 01:40:21.220
You can get rid of them
by just deleting them,

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.020
but we'll store all of them.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:25.950
And on the server,
we'll store them for 30 days,

01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:29.460
which is more than enough time for
all your devices to connect and

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.610
automatically download those photos.

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:37.060
So we think we've got a great system
here that's going to move our photos

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.020
around among all of our devices,
even Apple TV,

01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:46.820
so that when I take a photo anywhere,
I can view it on all my other devices.

01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:49.030
We think this is going
to be really exciting.

01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:53.150
To demonstrate this, I've asked Eddy Cu,
our VP of Internet Services,

01:40:53.150 --> 01:40:55.930
to come on up and give
us a demo of PhotoStream.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.290
Thank you Steve.

01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:00.110
Yep.

01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:02.870
So I want to take some
photos to start with.

01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:06.030
Now I love cars and I happen to
have brought one of my favorite ones

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:09.190
with me here today and here it is.

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:16.170
and we're going to go to our my
iPhone and launch the camera app.

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.200
Lightning McQueen is looking good.

01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:26.500
I love the headlights.

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:35.170
And now these photos are on my iPhone,
but let's go look at my iPad.

01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:43.160
Now we've built PhotoStream
right into the Photos app.

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:46.200
So right next to Albums is PhotoStream.

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.940
And there is the pictures I just took.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.640
I didn't have to learn
anything new at all.

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:02.500
And if I want to save them
permanently on my iPad,

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.920
I can just select them and
move them to an existing album

01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:07.180
or even create a new album.

01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:12.000
That's it.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.840
Now these photos aren't just on my iPad,
they're on all of my devices.

01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:21.160
Let's move over to the Mac where
I've got iPhoto running.

01:42:21.330 --> 01:42:25.000
And we've built again
PhotoStream right in.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.130
And there are the photos I just took.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.640
So now when I take a photo
on one of my devices,

01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:43.160
they automatically appear
on all of my devices without

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.880
having to do anything at all.

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.110
It's that simple and that's PhotoStream.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:05.300
[Transcript missing]

01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:10.400
Photos you take or
import upload to iCloud.

01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:16.480
iCloud pushes them to all your devices,
works over Wi-Fi.

01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:22.410
iCloud stores each photo for 30 days,
which is plenty enough time for

01:43:22.410 --> 01:43:25.070
all the devices to be connected.

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.100
Devices store the last thousand photos,
and again,

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:30.160
you can just drag them to an album,
they stay forever.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.410
And Macs and PCs store all photos.

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.150
So we're really,
really pleased with PhotoStream.

01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:42.400
We think you're going to like it a lot.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:49.790
Last but not least is
iTunes in the cloud.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.370
You know, it's the same old story, right?

01:43:59.370 --> 01:44:04.570
About I buy something on my iPhone,

01:44:06.130 --> 01:44:09.160
Right, well,
and it's not on my other devices.

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.800
I grab my iPod and I go to listen to that
song I bought yesterday on my iPhone,

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.630
it ain't there.

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:19.960
Well, the first thing we've done, again,
is for the songs you've already bought,

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:25.310
we've added a purchase button that
shows you your entire purchase

01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:29.220
history of all the iTunes songs
you've bought on any device.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.320
You can look at it by all
songs or recent songs,

01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:34.470
or you can look at it by artist.

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:39.050
So I'm going to pick Bob Dylan here,
and I can download any of these

01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:42.990
albums that I've bought on iTunes
to this device just by pushing

01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:45.240
that cloud download button.

01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:49.840
Or I could go in to one of
them and just download whatever

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.400
songs I want to this device.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.000
So anything I've bought,
I can now download to any of my

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.500
devices at no additional charge,
which is great.

01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:11.820
This is the first time we've
seen this in the music industry.

01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:15.810
No charge for multiple
downloads to different devices.

01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:23.490
and for the future I flick one switch
to on and now any song I buy on

01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:25.980
any device again will automatically

01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:32.680
The Keynote is a great way to make
sure that your devices are being

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:35.210
downloaded to all of your devices.

01:45:35.290 --> 01:45:39.210
So when I want to buy a song,
in this case an Adele song,

01:45:39.210 --> 01:45:41.830
it will push it to all of my devices.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.250
So to give us a demo of that again,
I'd like to invite Eddy up.

01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:47.490
Thank you.

01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:52.970
Thanks, Steve.

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.490
So I'm on my iPhone,
and I want to listen to a song I'd

01:45:56.630 --> 01:45:59.570
previously purchased on iTunes,
but it's not in the music

01:45:59.570 --> 01:46:00.980
library on this device.

01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:04.400
Well, now I can easily just go
to the iTunes Music Store.

01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:07.640
There's a new purchase
tab right on the bottom.

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.780
And now I'm seeing all of the
purchases I've ever done on iTunes.

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:17.140
I can even look at them,
the songs that are not on this

01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:20.400
device that I previously purchased
by just tapping that button.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.020
Now I'm going to look
for a Foo Fighters song,

01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.810
I think it's called "Walk".

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.200
and there it is.

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.240
And just tapping the iCloud button,
it downloads to my iPhone.

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.020
Again, because I'd previously
purchased this song,

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.360
it's downloading at no additional cost.

01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.660
Let's go ahead and play it.

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:56.650
Just finishing downloading.

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:10.500
Now that's great,
but iTunes in the cloud is even better.

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:13.040
Let's see what happens
when I purchase a new song.

01:47:13.130 --> 01:47:17.040
And if we can bring up my iPad,
I'm going to go ahead and launch

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.030
our new music player in iOS 5.

01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:22.400
And on my iPhone,
I'm going to go back to the iTunes store.

01:47:22.450 --> 01:47:25.670
I want to buy a new song.

01:47:25.670 --> 01:47:27.700
And I want to look at
Bruno Mars' new album.

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.000
I know he has a hit song.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.700
I think it's called Lazy Song.

01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:31.430
That's it.

01:47:31.770 --> 01:47:33.810
We can preview it.

01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:42.730
That's definitely it.

01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:46.300
Now I'm going to buy it, but before I do,
notice on my iPad I don't have

01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:49.180
any Bruno Mars songs at all.

01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:51.750
So we're going to go ahead and buy.

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.840
and it's now downloading to my iPhone.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:59.380
And in addition,
there's the Bruno Mars song.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
and of course LaQuay.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:18.990
So now when I buy a song on one of
my devices it automatically downloads

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
to all of my devices without having
to sync or do any work at all.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.000
And that's iTunes in the Cloud.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.240
Thank you very much.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.460
Isn't this awesome?

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:44.340
So, music purchased from iTunes,
high quality, 256 kilobits AAC,

01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:49.440
and you can have up to 10 devices,
downloading your music to all of them

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:52.050
every time you buy it on any device.

01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:53.640
iTunes in the cloud.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:04.900
[Transcript missing]

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:27.600
[Transcript missing]

01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:30.900
So that's iCloud.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.540
It stores your content and wirelessly
pushes it to all your devices,

01:49:36.650 --> 01:49:42.130
and it's integrated with your apps,
so everything happens automatically.

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:47.610
So a competitor that doesn't own the
apps or doesn't have great developers

01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:50.170
to integrate with their apps,

01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:52.470
They can never do this.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.160
They can never make it so it just works.

01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.250
And that's what we've done here.

01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:59.490
So how do you get it?

01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:04.980
Well, when you upgrade your phone or
buy a new phone with iOS 5 on it,

01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:10.000
all you have to do is type in your
Apple ID and password and that's it.

01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:13.290
And you'll get a switch that's iCloud.

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.510
You can turn it off if you'd like.

01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:19.310
It'll be turned on by default
and you're up and running.

01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:24.800
We're also going to give everybody 5
gigabytes of free storage for mail,

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.610
documents and backup.

01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:31.580
And that's even more than it sounds like,
because we're not

01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:35.050
counting purchased music,
apps or books.

01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:37.300
Towards that five gigabytes.

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:50.700
Are we counting PhotoStream
towards that 5 gigabits?

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:55.310
When can you get your hands on this?

01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.310
Today.

01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:05.560
and David We're going to get
you all a developer beta today.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.000
And also today we're going to make
something available to end users,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.520
which is the iTunes in the cloud portion.

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:16.540
And it runs on iOS 4.3.

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:19.960
It'll run on all the supported
platforms when we ship it this fall.

01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:23.180
But today we're going to put it
out for 4.3 as a beta and everyone

01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:28.980
can get their hands on it and run
it on their existing iPhone 4s.

01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:31.120
So we think this is going
to be really exciting.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:37.670
And of course we ship iCloud concurrent
with shipping iOS 5 this fall.

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.520
So that is iCloud.

01:51:54.800 --> 01:52:03.000
[Transcript missing]

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:05.900
It pertains to iTunes in the Cloud.

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:08.520
As you recall,
iTunes in the Cloud is just

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:12.080
for the music that you've
purchased from the iTunes store.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.880
Now, at 14 billion songs, 15 billion,
excuse me,

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.870
that's a lot of songs out there that have
been purchased from iTunes music store.

01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:25.280
But you may have some
that you ripped yourself.

01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:29.160
and there's three ways
you can deal with that.

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:35.930
One, you can sync your new
devices over Wi-Fi or cable,

01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:38.720
and you only have to sync them once
just to get that music on them,

01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:42.740
and then you can rely on iCloud to
take care of getting all your new

01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:46.110
purchases off iTunes onto that device.

01:52:46.830 --> 01:52:51.330
Or, if it's just a few songs you love,
you don't want to leave behind,

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.400
you can buy those songs
that you'll miss on iTunes.

01:52:56.130 --> 01:53:00.390
We're going to offer a third way,
which is called iTunes Match.

01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:02.840
What is iTunes Match?

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:09.570
Well, iTunes Match uses the fact
that we've got 18 million songs

01:53:09.570 --> 01:53:13.000
now in the iTunes Music Store.

01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:17.410
And the chances are awfully
good that we've got the songs

01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:20.000
in our store that you've ripped.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.390
And so we wrote software
to scan those CDs,

01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:30.530
the non-iTunes music,
and match it up with those

01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:32.600
songs we have in the store.

01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:34.100
Right?

01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:39.690
And so we can give that music the same
benefits as music purchased from iTunes.

01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:42.540
and it takes just minutes, not weeks.

01:53:42.610 --> 01:53:46.400
If you have to upload your whole
library into some locker in the sky,

01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:49.050
that literally takes weeks.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:53.840
This takes minutes because we're
scanning and matching your library

01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:56.360
so we don't need to upload that.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.060
That large part of your library.

01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:02.590
And the few songs that remain, well,
we'll upload them.

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:05.680
But with 18 million songs,
we're most likely to

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:06.900
have what you've got.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:18.400
In addition,
iTunes Match will upgrade those songs

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.910
that match the 256 kilobits AAC.

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:33.420
and iTunes Match cost just $24.99 a year.

01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:36.140
So if you've got a bunch of music,

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:40.420
If you've got a bunch of music
that you didn't buy from iTunes,

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:43.880
you can get all the benefits of the
cloud service and more in terms of

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:46.720
upgrading your music for $24.99 a year.

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.760
Now, if you look and compare
that to some competitors,

01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:52.090
let's just look at
Apple and Amazon and Google,

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.560
you kind of get surprised.

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:57.110
Because, again,
the library and the cloud,

01:54:57.110 --> 01:54:58.740
we scan and match.

01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:01.720
The other guys, you've got to upload
your whole music library.

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:05.110
Again, it's going to take weeks.

01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:10.030
Music apps on your Mac and PC?

01:55:10.190 --> 01:55:12.120
Well, you're stuck with a web
app instead of iTunes.

01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:18.140
Upgrade to 256 kilobits per second.

01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:21.010
The other guys aren't
upgrading you at all.

01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:25.740
The annual price for
5,000 songs were $24.99.

01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:29.590
Amazon charges you $50 for the storage,
and Google hasn't announced

01:55:29.590 --> 01:55:30.900
their pricing yet.

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.080
Even at 20,000 songs,
we charge one flat price.

01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:39.170
Amazon's up to $200 for the storage,
and Google hasn't announced

01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:40.540
their pricing yet.

01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:52.840
Some of our customers won't
need this because they bought

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:55.560
a lot of their music on iTunes,
but for those that do,

01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.600
it's an industry leading offering,
let's put it that way.

01:56:00.970 --> 01:56:05.280
So that's iTunes Match and it
goes along with free iTunes in

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:11.130
the cloud and that's what it is.

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:22.400
If you don't think we're
serious about this,

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.960
you're wrong.

01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:31.660
This is our third data center
that we just completed.

01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.880
It's in Maiden, North Carolina.

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.060
This is what it looks like.

01:56:37.130 --> 01:56:41.240
It's rather large.

01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:46.610
It's as eco-friendly as you can make
a data center with modern technology.

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.990
and we're pretty proud of it.

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.910
Just to give you a feel for its size,
see those two little dots on the roof?

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.620
Those are two people right there.

01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:04.540
So it's a pretty large place
and it's full of stuff.

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:09.210
Full of expensive stuff.

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:16.440
We are ready, we think,
for our customers to start using iCloud,

01:57:16.490 --> 01:57:19.340
and we can't wait to
get it in their hands.

01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:24.260
So iCloud is the third thing
we want to talk about today.

01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:29.280
I hope you like all the three things
that we've unveiled this morning.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.800
And again, we've got a great week
planned for you with...

01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:42.060
5200 attendees, over 120 sessions,
over 100 hands-on labs,

01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:44.990
and over a thousand
Apple engineers here all week.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.670
So please ask us for any help you need.

01:57:48.670 --> 01:57:49.950
That's why we're here.

01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:55.660
So go at it, have a great week,
and thank you very much

01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:56.600
for coming this morning.
