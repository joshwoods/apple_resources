you even have multiple.Now you can easily run those same appson Apple's latest platform.The majority of iOS apps look and feel greatright out of the box.For example, check out the iPad Calendar apprunning unmodified in the simulator.It looks and feels just like iPadand everything works exactly as I would expect.I can see different timelines, zoom into detailsabout specific events, and add new ones.And Maps, which runs in its iPad versionfollowing the recommendations I'm about to cover.I can spin the globe beautifully.I can also look up specific destinations......and visit famous landmarks.In this video, I'll introduce iPad and iPhone appson this new platform.I'll start by covering the built-in behaviorsyour app gets for free.Next, I'll talk about the functional differencesyour app should be aware of and what you should do about them.Finally, I'll explain how to decidewhether the Designed for iPad experienceis best suited to your app's needs.This new platform is built on the foundations of iOS.We enhance that shared bedrock with additional system support.The combination of the two makes it more than likelythat your app will run beautifullywithout changing anything!iPad and iPhone apps are displayed as windowson this device, in their light mode style.The system prefers the iPad variant of your appin landscape orientation,but if your app only supports iPhone,the system displays it with an iPhone aspect ratioin portrait orientation.If your app supports multiple orientations,a rotation button is provided above the top-right cornerof your window,so people can rotate each scene to their preference.When you grab the corners of your app,the system scales its window, preserving the aspect ratio.When you reach the minimum or maximum size,the corners bounce to reflect that.The scaling is managed by the systemso your app gets all of this support for free.People interact with content on this device via natural input.They look at something and tap their fingers togetherto select it or reach out and touch content directly.They may also use a Bluetooth trackpad or game controller.All of these system-defined interaction methodssend events that your app is already familiar withso you can continue to leveragethe same event-handling techniques that you already use.System views like the document manager and photo pickermatch the system appearance to help your app fitinto the look and feel of the platform.If your app supports Touch ID or Face ID,LocalAuthentication automatically forwardsthose implementations through Optic IDso your app supports the latest authentication technologywithout any additional work on your part.Now, there are a few things that are differentabout this platform compared to iOS.Apps on this device can be viewed in portrait or landscape.That's nothing new compared to iPad.But unlike iPad, there's no notion of rotatingthe entire device.Because the device's orientationdoesn't inform your app's orientation,you may want to specify which orientationyour app prefers for new scenes.People can still rotate scenes latervia the system rotation button.You can express a preference by adding the newUIPreferredDefaultInterface Orientation keyto your app's Info.plist.If you don't provide one,the system will use its default orientation.This key is unique to this platformand will not affect other platforms.There are a couple other plist keysthat also have special meaning on this device,even though they're not new.The system uses UISupportedInterfaceOrientationsto decide if your app's windows need a rotation button,and App Store Connect relies on UIRequiredDeviceCapabilitiesto determine if your app is compatible with this new device.All suitable apps are automatically made availableon the App Store.If your app relies on specific featureswhich are not available on this deviceor if there's a reason your app doesn't make senseon this platform, you can manage availabilityin App Store Connect.For more information,watch "Explore App Store Connect for spatial computing."Take a moment to add those keys to your Info.plist if necessaryor confirm the existing values are still accurateand up to date.Gestures on this device work differentlysince folks use their eyes and hands to interact with content.There are a maximum of two simultaneous inputsas each hand is a distinct touch.All system gestures that expect two touches or fewerwork seamlessly.Custom gesture recognizers are also supported,but you may need to update them to run smoothlywith the natural input expectations.One of the most updated frameworks is ARKitwhich has evolved significantly to be more powerful than ever.We've designed new APIs and experiences from the ground upto account for fundamental differencesin platform architecture and privacy needs.That means your existing ARViews and ARSessionswon't work on this device as they do on iPad and iPhone.Check outthe "Re-imagine your ARKit app for spatial experiences" videoto learn about all the new ARKit capabilities you can leverageby rebuilding your app for this platform.Location support for this device is a lot like iPad:location can be approximated via Wi-Fi or shared via iPhone.More details are providedin the "Meet Core Location for spatial computing" video.Look to Dictate is a convenient new input techniquethat allows people to quickly navigate through an appusing only their eyes and voice.When enabled, a microphone iconreplaces the magnifying glass in search fields,and you can look at the microphone and speak to search.This API is offered on search bars.It's disabled by default for iPad and iPhone appsrunning on this platform to allow you to verify the behaviorand decide where you want to enable it.And it's a no-op on iOS and iPadOS,so there's no need to conditionalize your supportby platform.You can enable Look to Dictate in SwiftUI by addingthe .searchDictationBehavior() modifierto your searchable view.For UIKit search bars, set isLookToDictateEnabled to true.The best way to handle all of these changesis the same way you always have: use availability checks.Make sure that a framework is supportedbefore calling into it.Many frameworks even have those functions built infor your convenience.Don't forget to do the same thingwhen accessing configurations that rely on the presenceof specific hardware.For example, the headset has many more camerasthan just the front and back cameras on iOS devices,but not all of those are available for apps to use.Verify that a camera is present and supported before you use it.These practices make your app more robust on every device,not just this one.That's only a sampling of the framework evolutionon this platform.Some frameworks have grown a lotand have videos specifically dedicated to this device,like SwiftUI, ARKit, and RealityKit.Most of the remaining frameworks work as they always havewith a few tweaks to how you adopt them.Detailed information about all of the modified frameworksis available in the developer documentation.Now that you have a sense of what code changesare necessary for your app, you're ready for action.When the xrOS SDK is installed,Xcode automatically adds xrOS Device (Designed for iPad)to the Supported Destinationsfor projects that use the iOS SDK.If your scheme sets a different platform or auto for the SDK,you can add the Designed for iPad target manually.Once that's set up,a run destination with the matching namewill appear in the destination picker.Select that target, build, and run.That's all there is to it!iPad and iPhone apps provide a fantastic experienceon this device.Most apps don't need any changes at all,thanks to extensive system support.Whether you want to stick with building your appagainst the iOS SDK or rebuild against the xrOS SDKdepends on your goals.Like I discussed earlier,there are differences in which frameworksare available for each SDK, as well as differencesin supported features within each framework.There are two big things I want to call outthat are only available in the iOS SDK:SpriteKit and storyboards.If either of these technologies is integral to your app,you need to stick with designing for iPad.iPad and iPhone apps are displayed in windowsthat feel just like iPad in their light mode style.Here's what Maps looks likewhen zoomed into the Sydney Opera House.Notice how the content fills all the wayto the edges of the window but doesn't extend past it,and all of the colors match the same light mode stylethat Maps uses on iPad and iPhone.Apps designed for xrOS unlock another levelof immersive, spatial experiences.Several frameworks, like ARKit and RealityKit,have evolved functionality that's only availablein apps designed for this platform.Refer to the other videos or the documentationto learn about all the new experiencesthat are possible thanks to these updates.In addition to windows,apps designed for this device also support volumesto display 3D objects in containersthat grow to fit their contents,as well as Immersive Spaces for immersive experiences.Here's what the Keynote rehearsal space looks likein headset.By hiding passthrough and other apps,Keynote keeps you fully immersed and focusedon your presentation.In both the headset and the simulator,apps designed for this platform use the system look and feel.Their backgrounds are a glass materialthat grounds people in their surroundingsand dynamically adjusts color balance and contrastto promote legibility.They can also take advantage of the new Ornament API.Like the tab bar on the left and buttons at the bottom of Photos,ornaments anchor to the sides of a windowto enhance its functionality.And they leave the app more room to draw within the window.Most frequently, ornaments are used for navigation or toolbars.Designing for xrOS is perfect for apps that want to createimmersive experiences, adopt new framework functionality,or match the system look and feel.If you would rather preserve your app's existing experience,designing for iPad is the road for you.This platform shares a common foundation with iOS and iPadOS,so no matter which SDK you choose,the work you do for those platformswill continue to benefit your experience on this one.If you decide that designing for this new platformis the best fit for your app,the "Meet SwiftUI for spatial computing"and "Meet UIKit for spatial computing" videosare great places to start.Your next step is to try your appon this exciting new platform!The vast majority of apps work without any code changes at all.Pay special attention to the compatibility areas I covered:ensure your Info.plist keys are up to date,opt into new platform experiencesyou're interested in,and verify that your framework dependenciesare available before you use them.Once you've done all that, watch"Enhance your iPad and iPhone apps for the Shared Space"to learn how to make your iOS appfeel right at home on this device.Thanks for watching,and I look forward to trying your app on this new platform.♪
