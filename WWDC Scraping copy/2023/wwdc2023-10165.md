Xcode 15.Ryan: Xcode is the center of your development experience.In Xcode, we pull together all aspectsof your development workflow into one place,making it easy and fun to build appswhile keeping you focused in a single tool.Today we will touch on many of the improvementsthis year with Xcode 15, starting with editing,navigating, and sharing, through to testing,debugging, and distributing your app.Shilpa: Before showing you what's new in Xcode,we need to download it.And the best way to get the released versions of Xcodeis from the Mac App Store.This guarantees you will always use the newest versionof the tools and can take advantageof the latest features.Last year, we made it easier to get startedby making the watch and TV simulator optional downloads.This year, we're going even furtherby making all simulators downloadable,including iOS and Apple's new spatial computing platform,allowing you to configure Xcode to match your needs.Now, when you get Xcode, it will be smaller,making it easier to write codeeven before you get all the simulators.Alternatively, if you need to download Xcodefrom the Developer website, such as the latest beta,you can choose up front which simulators to include.Now that we've got Xcode, let's jump right inand see what's new in the source editor.Code completion helps you get to the code you wantfaster and with fewer mistakes.In Xcode 15, it gets a whole lot smarter.Let's take a look.Completions take advantage of new sources of information.Here I have Backyard Birds.I'll start by creating a new fileand name it PlantSummaryRow.I'll add the required import statements.Now when I create a new struct, completion suggestsPlantSummaryRow for the type name,and that's because that's the name of the file I created.Let me finish implementing this file.I'm done with the implementation.The way some completions are presented has improved too.When you're calling a function that has default arguments,it can be challenging to get exactly the parameters you want.You can see all possible permutationsof default arguments to help you pick the one you want.I'll add a frame modifier to this VStackand press the right arrow on the keyboard.I'll select the one I need, in this case width.And completions now have more context awareness,giving you even better suggestionsfor the code you're writing.Coming back to the VStack,when I type a dot to add a modifier,padding is the top suggestion because Xcode knowsit's one of the most frequently used modifiers for this view.But when I add a modifier to a Text,I get font as the top suggestion.These editor suggestions also consider the surrounding code.I already changed the font on this text.When I want to add another modifier,the top suggestion is bold,as I wouldn't want to use the same modifier twicewhen working on text.Here's another example.In this file, I'm using CLLocation to findwhere my birds are.As I already typed in latitude, now it will suggest longitude,as these two properies are commonly paired together.All this means you'll have better top suggestions,leading you to type safer code faster.Hey Ryan, I heard that we're bringing the power completionsto asset catalogs too.Can you tell me some more?Ryan: Sure, Shilpa.Color and image assets are now backed by Swift symbols.This means that they can now be code completed.In my asset catalog, I have some custom colors and images.Xcode 15 automatically generates symbols for each of them,and I can reference these in my codeinstead of using string names.If I change the name of this image to MultipleCloudsand build my project,I get an issue in another file where we use this asset.And I can correct it using CodeComplete.These symbols give me type safety,so I don't have to worry about mysteriously missing colorsor images at runtime.And Xcode 15 brings the power and flexibility of catalogsto your localization experience too.String catalogs pull together your localizationsinto a single place,giving you a centralized way to review and update them.To get started, you can convert a project to use string catalogsby selecting Edit > Convert to string catalog.This brings up a sheet showing all of the storyboards,.strings, and .stringsdict filesthat can be migrated.And once migrated, all of your translationsare organized into a single editor.In the sidebar on the left,you can review the translation progressfor each of the languages that you support.And keeping up to date is easy.All of the strings are pulled directly from sourceeach time you build.When new strings are added or removed,the editor annotates the affected languagesand badges the relevant strings.Get started migrating todayby heading over to the session "Discover String Catalogs."Shilpa, what's new in Xcode for documentation this year?Shilpa: A lot.Clear, concise code is made even better with documentation.Whether you're explaining something to your future selfor one of the consumers of your API,writing great documentation is key.And great documentation deserves great presentation.Xcode 15 has beautiful new styling and spacing,making documentation easier to read.But the biggest improvement is a new assistantthat shows a real-time preview of your documentation.While crafting documentation, I can display the assistantby choosing Editor > Assistant >and then Documentation Preview in the jump bar.As I type in the source editor,the preview is updated in real time.This will show me exactly how my docs will lookin a fully built documentation archive.I'll add a code example to showhow it could be used in practice.I'll begin by writing "Use this initializerto display an image of a given bird."Then I'll paste in my code example.Since this example involves UI, I'll add a screenshotof what the resulting view would look like.I can reference the image named BirdIconbecause I included it in my documentation catalog.The new documentation preview is a huge helpto make sure your docs are presented exactly how you want.If you're passionate about writing documentation,like I am, watch the session"Create rich documentation with Swift-DocC" to learn more.Just as important as documentationis that your code should be concise and understandable.New in Swift this year is a powerful new language feature,Swift macros.Macros makes for more expressive APIsand helps eliminate repeated code.And Xcode's integration gives you complete visibilityinto macros, allowing you to treat macro-generated codelike all other code in your app.Macros are part of the Swift packages in the SDK.Now we're utilizing the power of macrosin a number of Apple's own frameworks,like Swift standard library, foundation,and the new Swift data framework.I can also create my own macro package to share with others.To create a package, I'm going to use quick actions,a new feature that lets me accessall of Xcode's menu options just by pressing Command-Shift-A.The new macro package will come with great examplesto get me started.I've already created a macro package, EnumHelper.Inside EnumHelper, I implemented CaseDetection as a macro.The beauty of macros is that they generate normal Swift code.It wraps up and neatly tucks away the code they provide.But when you want to see what a macro is doingor when you want to debug in macro-generated code,you can expand the macro right in linewith the help from quick actions.You can even set a breakpoint on the code inside a macroif you need to debug it.Watch the session "Expand on Swift macros"to gain a deeper technical understanding of Swift macros.Equipped with this new knowledge,you can code along to write a few macros from scratchin the session "Write Swift macros."Let's explore another area of Xcodethat's taking advantage of macros, previews.With the help of macros, the new Previews APIis simple and easy to remember.I'll add a preview by typing #Preview.I want to preview the account screen.App detail column has various states,which I can show by creating another preview.I'm able to see both of these scenarios.But now I have two previews in UI.To tell them apart, I'll add a title, "Placeholder View".But wait, there are more improvements.We're bringing previews to UIKit and AppKit.So even in my older Food Truck app,I can add a preview for my UIViewControllerand iterate as quickly as I have in SwiftUI.Now let's look at developing widgets with previews.The API also introduces new workflowsfor building time-based widgets.The canvas has a new area that shows all of the entries.And as I navigate through them,I can see how the widget's transitions animate.Check out the session"Build programmatic UI with Xcode Previews"to learn how to adopt the new and excitingpreview features in your project.I'll hand it back to Ryan to talk aboutthe improvements in navigation.Ryan: Thanks, Shilpa.As your project grows, it becomes more complex,making it difficult to keep track of landmarksthat you want to reference during a task.To help, Xcode 15 introduces the bookmarks navigator.I'll open it by clicking right next tothe source control navigator.I've been adding bookmarks to places in my codethat I need to add documentation.I want to add another one in this file, and it's easy to do.I'll just right-click on this location and select Bookmark.The bookmark shows up in the navigatorwith a preview of its location,but I can change this display if I want by clicking itand entering a different description.Xcode annotates a line of code with my description,making it easy to see and remember what I want it to do.My list of bookmarks is starting to grow,but I can manage them by sorting and grouping themhowever I like.I want to group all of mydocumentation-related bookmarks together.I'll select the ones I'm interested in,and with a secondary click, open the context menuto select New Group From Selection.This creates a new group that I'll callPlaces to Add Documentation.Bookmarks are great reminders in my code,but they can also be used as to-do lists.I can mark one as complete by clicking to its left.Or I can delete it altogether by selectingDelete Bookmark in the context menu.This removes the bookmark annotation in the editor.Lines of code aren't the only thing I can bookmark, though.Bookmarks are also a great way to keep track of Find queries.Before Xcode 15, I've added to-dos in my code,but they are hard to find,so I've already bookmarked a query to find all of them.But I can bookmark any Find query.I want to keep a handy list of all the view modifiersin my code.I'll use the new Conforming Types queryto find all conformances to the viewModifier protocol.Then, I can bookmark this query by right-clicking in the resultsand selecting Bookmark Find "viewModifier".My query is available in the bookmark navigator.If the results of my query ever change,I can refresh the list with just one click on the refresh buttonnext to the bookmark.Xcode 15's new bookmark navigator keeps trackof your work so you don't have to,keeping your focus on the task at hand.Another important part of developmentis sharing your work.Bringing your changes together,especially when crafting a committo share with your colleagues,can be as important as the changes themselves.Xcode 15 introduces a new changes navigatorand commit editor,which together are a great way to review all of your changes.I've been working on adding documentation to my project.I can review these changes in the source control navigator.The first thing you'll notice is an improvedreporting and presentation of each file's status.My stage modifications show upas an icon next to the file name.I want to start reviewing these changes,so I'll click on the uncommitted changes itemto bring up the commit editor.I can now review all of my modificationsin a single scrolling view.Each section shows just enough contextto understand the surrounding code.And If I want to see more,I can use the drag handle to expose more of the file.Each change is also presented in a source editor,giving me access to the annotations and controlsthat I'm used to.During my review, I notice that there's an issuein the BirdsNavigationStack file.It looks like I made a typo in my documentation,but I can fix this without leaving the view.Xcode processes my change and removes the issue.My edit is also immediately indicated as unstagedin the changes bar.The status indicator highlights that the BirdsNavigationStacknow has both staged and unstaged changes.I want to include my fix in the next commit,so I'll stage it by clicking the changes bar next to the fixand selecting Stage Change.I also notice I've accidentally staged a log statementthat I was using for debugging.I'll use the changes bar again to unstage this change.These staging controls are easy to useand they're integrated throughout Xcode.I'm ready to check in my changes.I'll start by adding a descriptionin the commit message box,and then clicking the Commit button.Xcode creates my commit and opens it immediatelyin the commit viewer, summarizing what was included.And lastly, I can share my commit with my teammates.I'll click on the status indicator next to my commit,select Push, and follow the prompts.These source control features are a great improvementto keep you focused in Xcode 15.But hey, Shilpa, I think we have some new featuresthat help with testing too.Can you tell us about those?Shilpa: Sure, Ryan, testing is an important part of shippinga high-quality app.It allows you to catch regressions quicklyand maintain your app's quality as it grows in complexity.Testing gets some big improvements this year,starting with an updated test navigator,rewritten from the ground up in Swift to be more efficient.When running or reporting your test results in real time,Xcode is now 45 percent faster.The test navigator is organized around your test plan,making it easier to find the test you care about.You can also use filters to find tests based on any result type,such as expected failure.Once you run your test in Xcode or Xcode Cloud,the test reports help you explore the results,showing you where to focus next.It starts with a high-level summary of the entire test run.This includes Insights,a pattern-based analysis of the results.Within the Test section,you can understand how the test performed.It's easy to figure out how many tests passed and failedacross different devices and configurations.Insights analyze test results to identifypotentially related failures that might have been difficultto see before.It also alerts us to test runs that may cause the entire suiteto take longer to return results.The second insight sticks out to me.The test failed while attempting to tap the Account button.I want to investigate this further.From the overview, I can navigate to the test list,which shows all of the test runs,with filters for result type, run destination,and test plan configuration.I see the test failed to tap the Account buttonacross multiple languages with the same error message.To learn more, I can look at the individual classor navigate to a new dedicated Test Details viewfor individual test methods.The Test Details view contains tabs for different waysof exploring the results data, including a breakdownof all runs and a dedicated performance metrics tab.Debugging UI test failures is more fun than everwith the new automation explorer.The explorer is interactive,so you can watch your test playbackor can scrub through the timeline.Touch or mouse events are overlaid on the video.At the point of failure,like when my test failed to tap the Account button,I can inspect the UI hierarchy of my app.This will make fixing UI test failures a whole lot easier.For an in-depth study, watch the session"Fix failures faster with Xcode test reports"to learn more.Now back to Ryan so we can talk about debugging.Ryan: Testing and debugging go hand in hand.They are both about crafting a high-quality app.And debugging also gets some great improvements this year,starting with OSLog integration into Xcode.OSLog is a great tool for capturing runtime information.It provides a structured and customizable logging mechanismthat keeps your log output organized.And Xcode 15's consoleintroduces full support for OSLog,including the ability to perform complex filtering on log data,like subsystem category and severity.The presentation of the logs is cleaner than ever.The focus is on your log content,with extra data neatly hidden away.The background color of each log entry indicates its severity,making it easy to scan long streams of log outputfor critical messages.And while the metadata fields are hidden by default,they're just a couple of clicks away.You can choose just the fields you want to see.And when you're looking for something specific,the filter field lets you narrow your search.You can filter on the metadata or on the full text of the log.And a feature that I really like,you can jump from a log entrydirectly back to the line of code that created it.We do a deep dive into these logging features in the session"Debug with structured logging".Lastly, let's talk about distribution.Distribution is about getting your app out into the world,to your teammates, to your beta testers,and to your users.And Xcode 15 has some improvementsto make this process easier and safer.Let's start with Xcode Cloud.Xcode Cloud is a great way to distribute your app.It manages things like build versioning, app signing,and the distribution profile for you automatically.This year, Xcode Cloud handles two more details for you.First, TestFlight test details.Xcode Cloud adds support for including test notesright alongside your source code.These will be automatically attachedto the TestFlight build for distribution,and so the notes will appear to your testersright alongside your app.And secondly, Xcode Cloud now supportsnotarization for your Mac apps.All you need to do is add the notarization post actionin your workflow, and Xcode Cloud will do the rest.When your build is complete,your app will be automatically notarized and stapled,and be ready to download.Notarizing your app is vital for your users.It lets them know that your app hasn't been tampered with.But it's just as important that you can trust the integrityof the SDKs and frameworks that you depend on.To provide this assurance, Xcode introducessignature verification for XCFrameworks.Authors can digitally sign the contents of their frameworks,and you can verify these signatures right in Xcode.The framework inspector has a new signature slice.It tells you exactly who produced and signedthe framework.And Xcode will remember this identity.So if it ever changes when updating the framework,you get a clear warning about the problem,but there's more to it than that.Authors can now include a privacy manifestin their framework.This manifest details exactly how the frameworkuses and protects sensitive data.Since the privacy manifest is bundled with the framework,it is also part of the signed package,and you can trust that its contentscame directly from the author.I can use Xcode to summarize all of the manifestsinto a complete privacy report for my app.Here's a report that I've generated.This report is designed to make it easyto fill in the privacy nutrition label in App Store Connect,making sure I provide accurate information to my users.And Apple is working with privacy-impacting SDKsto ensure that all of your critical dependenciesprovide this valuable information.We cover these topics in a lot more depth in the sessions"Verify app dependencies with digital signatures"and "Get started with privacy manifests".Privacy manifests are a great toolwhen distributing your app to your users.When you're working on a bug fix or a new feature branch,you want to distribute your app to your teammatesand only your teammates.So Xcode 15 now supportsthe TestFlight internal testing distribution option.TestFlight internal builds are available to your team only,so you can never accidentally release them to customers.They're easy to create.Just select the "TestFlight internal testing" optionwhen distributing your app through App Store Connect.But it's actually even easier than this.Xcode now bundles a set of the most common distribution methodsand recommended settings.Step one, select any of these new options,including TestFlight internal only.Step two, click Distribute and you're done.There is no step three.And if you're distributing through App Store Connect,you will also now get desktop notificationsabout your build status.So when your app is ready to test,you'll be notified right away.These updates make it easy to iterateand distribute your app quickly,which makes working closely with your teammates,testers, and users smooth and fast.Start exploring these features by having a look at the session"Simplify distribution with Xcode and Xcode Cloud".Well, that was a quick overview of what's new in Xcode 15.It is easier to get, faster to use,and has a ton of improvementsto make your development more focused, smooth, and fun.Shilpa: Go download Xcode 15so you can start trying out these cool new features.Thanks for watching.♪

Then, I can bookmark this query by right-clicking in the resultsand selecting Bookmark Find "viewModifier".My query is available in the bookmark navigator.If the results of my query ever change,I can refresh the list with just one click on the refresh buttonnext to the bookmark.Xcode 15's new bookmark navigator keeps trackof your work so you don't have to,keeping your focus on the task at hand.Another important part of developmentis sharing your work.Bringing your changes together,especially when crafting a committo share with your colleagues,can be as important as the changes themselves.Xcode 15 introduces a new changes navigatorand commit editor,which together are a great way to review all of your changes.I've been working on adding documentation to my project.I can review these changes in the source control navigator.The first thing you'll notice is an improvedreporting and presentation of each file's status.My stage modifications show upas an icon next to the file name.I want to start reviewing these changes,so I'll click on the uncommitted changes itemto bring up the commit editor.I can now review all of my modificationsin a single scrolling view.Each section shows just enough contextto understand the surrounding code.And If I want to see more,I can use the drag handle to expose more of the file.Each change is also presented in a source editor,giving me access to the annotations and controlsthat I'm used to.During my review, I notice that there's an issuein the BirdsNavigationStack file.It looks like I made a typo in my documentation,but I can fix this without leaving the view.Xcode processes my change and removes the issue.My edit is also immediately indicated as unstagedin the changes bar.The status indicator highlights that the BirdsNavigationStacknow has both staged and unstaged changes.I want to include my fix in the next commit,so I'll stage it by clicking the changes bar next to the fixand selecting Stage Change.I also notice I've accidentally staged a log statementthat I was using for debugging.I'll use the changes bar again to unstage this change.These staging controls are easy to useand they're integrated throughout Xcode.I'm ready to check in my changes.I'll start by adding a descriptionin the commit message box,and then clicking the Commit button.Xcode creates my commit and opens it immediatelyin the commit viewer, summarizing what was included.And lastly, I can share my commit with my teammates.I'll click on the status indicator next to my commit,select Push, and follow the prompts.These source control features are a great improvementto keep you focused in Xcode 15.But hey, Shilpa, I think we have some new featuresthat help with testing too.Can you tell us about those?Shilpa: Sure, Ryan, testing is an important part of shippinga high-quality app.It allows you to catch regressions quicklyand maintain your app's quality as it grows in complexity.Testing gets some big improvements this year,starting with an updated test navigator,rewritten from the ground up in Swift to be more efficient.When running or reporting your test results in real time,Xcode is now 45 percent faster.The test navigator is organized around your test plan,making it easier to find the test you care about.You can also use filters to find tests based on any result type,such as expected failure.Once you run your test in Xcode or Xcode Cloud,the test reports help you explore the results,showing you where to focus next.It starts with a high-level summary of the entire test run.This includes Insights,a pattern-based analysis of the results.Within the Test section,you can understand how the test performed.It's easy to figure out how many tests passed and failedacross different devices and configurations.Insights analyze test results to identifypotentially related failures that might have been difficultto see before.It also alerts us to test runs that may cause the entire suiteto take longer to return results.

The second insight sticks out to me.The test failed while attempting to tap the Account button.I want to investigate this further.From the overview, I can navigate to the test list,which shows all of the test runs,with filters for result type, run destination,and test plan configuration.I see the test failed to tap the Account buttonacross multiple languages with the same error message.To learn more, I can look at the individual classor navigate to a new dedicated Test Details viewfor individual test methods.The Test Details view contains tabs for different waysof exploring the results data, including a breakdownof all runs and a dedicated performance metrics tab.Debugging UI test failures is more fun than everwith the new automation explorer.The explorer is interactive,so you can watch your test playbackor can scrub through the timeline.Touch or mouse events are overlaid on the video.At the point of failure,like when my test failed to tap the Account button,I can inspect the UI hierarchy of my app.This will make fixing UI test failures a whole lot easier.For an in-depth study, watch the session"Fix failures faster with Xcode test reports"to learn more.Now back to Ryan so we can talk about debugging.Ryan: Testing and debugging go hand in hand.They are both about crafting a high-quality app.And debugging also gets some great improvements this year,starting with OSLog integration into Xcode.OSLog is a great tool for capturing runtime information.It provides a structured and customizable logging mechanismthat keeps your log output organized.And Xcode 15's consoleintroduces full support for OSLog,including the ability to perform complex filtering on log data,like subsystem category and severity.The presentation of the logs is cleaner than ever.The focus is on your log content,with extra data neatly hidden away.The background color of each log entry indicates its severity,making it easy to scan long streams of log outputfor critical messages.And while the metadata fields are hidden by default,they're just a couple of clicks away.You can choose just the fields you want to see.And when you're looking for something specific,the filter field lets you narrow your search.You can filter on the metadata or on the full text of the log.And a feature that I really like,you can jump from a log entrydirectly back to the line of code that created it.We do a deep dive into these logging features in the session"Debug with structured logging".Lastly, let's talk about distribution.Distribution is about getting your app out into the world,to your teammates, to your beta testers,and to your users.And Xcode 15 has some improvementsto make this process easier and safer.Let's start with Xcode Cloud.Xcode Cloud is a great way to distribute your app.It manages things like build versioning, app signing,and the distribution profile for you automatically.This year, Xcode Cloud handles two more details for you.First, TestFlight test details.Xcode Cloud adds support for including test notesright alongside your source code.These will be automatically attachedto the TestFlight build for distribution,and so the notes will appear to your testersright alongside your app.And secondly, Xcode Cloud now supportsnotarization for your Mac apps.All you need to do is add the notarization post actionin your workflow, and Xcode Cloud will do the rest.When your build is complete,your app will be automatically notarized and stapled,and be ready to download.Notarizing your app is vital for your users.It lets them know that your app hasn't been tampered with.But it's just as important that you can trust the integrityof the SDKs and frameworks that you depend on.To provide this assurance, Xcode introducessignature verification for XCFrameworks.Authors can digitally sign the contents of their frameworks,and you can verify these signatures right in Xcode.The framework inspector has a new signature slice.It tells you exactly who produced and signedthe framework.And Xcode will remember this identity.So if it ever changes when updating the framework,you get a clear warning about the problem,but there's more to it than that.Authors can now include a privacy manifestin their framework.This manifest details exactly how the frameworkuses and protects sensitive data.Since the privacy manifest is bundled with the framework,it is also part of the signed package,and you can trust that its contentscame directly from the author.I can use Xcode to summarize all of the manifestsinto a complete privacy report for my app.Here's a report that I've generated.This report is designed to make it easyto fill in the privacy nutrition label in App Store Connect,making sure I provide accurate information to my users.And Apple is working with privacy-impacting SDKsto ensure that all of your critical dependenciesprovide this valuable information.We cover these topics in a lot more depth in the sessions"Verify app dependencies with digital signatures"and "Get started with privacy manifests".Privacy manifests are a great toolwhen distributing your app to your users.When you're working on a bug fix or a new feature branch,you want to distribute your app to your teammatesand only your teammates.So Xcode 15 now supportsthe TestFlight internal testing distribution option.TestFlight internal builds are available to your team only,so you can never accidentally release them to customers.They're easy to create.Just select the "TestFlight internal testing" optionwhen distributing your app through App Store Connect.

But it's actually even easier than this.Xcode now bundles a set of the most common distribution methodsand recommended settings.Step one, select any of these new options,including TestFlight internal only.Step two, click Distribute and you're done.There is no step three.And if you're distributing through App Store Connect,you will also now get desktop notificationsabout your build status.So when your app is ready to test,you'll be notified right away.These updates make it easy to iterateand distribute your app quickly,which makes working closely with your teammates,testers, and users smooth and fast.Start exploring these features by having a look at the session"Simplify distribution with Xcode and Xcode Cloud".Well, that was a quick overview of what's new in Xcode 15.It is easier to get, faster to use,and has a ton of improvementsto make your development more focused, smooth, and fun.Shilpa: Go download Xcode 15so you can start trying out these cool new features.Thanks for watching.♪
