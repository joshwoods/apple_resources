ecosystem on our platforms.3D is an amazing form of media, and it's even more importantwith the introduction of xrOS, where the third dimensionwill allow for even more immersive experiences.It's become far more accessible for everyone to get startedwith creating amazing visuals on Apple computersthey have at home or even the ones in your hands like an iPad.To enable this wave of creative content,we've been building on the foundation based onthe key technologies that power the creative industry worldwide.The first of these technologies is Universal Scene Description,or USD for short.It allows for a standard form of representing 3D contentto share between applications.And we're now also introducing support for MaterialX on xrOSto portably represent the visual appearance of objects.USD is an open source project, created by Pixar,recently renamed to OpenUSD.It is production proven and scales from creatorsmaking single assets to large studiosworking on AAA games and films.USD allows for expressingcomplex and flexible relationshipsbetween asset data via composition.Apple was an early adopter of USD,adding it to our platforms in 2017 and growing support since.Today, USD is at the heart of 3D Content on xrOS.MaterialX is also an open source project,created at Industrial Light & Magicfor their work on Star Wars,now developed in conjunction with others like Autodeskand adopted by the Academy Software Foundation.It allows artists to combine shader logic into a node graphwithin their 3D applications,all without needing to know how to code.This graph can also be embedded inside USD,so it travels with your scene data.We're supporting MaterialX first on xrOS with RealityKit,Apple's real-time 3D rendering frameworkfor building immersive spatial experiences.We have four areas to cover as we discoverhow these 3D content technologies can be used.To start, we'll go over how our applicationsare enabling new uses for 3D content.Next, we dive deeper into how we support MaterialXas well as color management in RealityKit.Finally, we'll return to USD and go over the changesthat you should be aware of since last year.Let's begin by looking at the new ways you can use 3Din our applications,before we get into the technologies that power them.Building on the success of Quick Lookfor USDZ files on iOS,we're now bringing Quick Look to xrOS.It's so simple to just open up a USDZ fileand see it beautifully and spatially represented,walking around it and connecting itto your surroundings.We have a great talk as well on how to easily author contentthat will look great on this new platform.Last year, we introduced Freeform,a powerful and easy-to-use brainstorming app.Freeform now gives you the ability to embed USDZ content,so you can now collaborate on your 3D assetsjust like you would for other content types,across all supported platforms like macOS, iOS, iPadOS,and now xrOS.Safari also introduces new support for 3D Contentwith the Model element.The Model element is available on all Apple platformswith Safari and can be enabled under the Developer menuon macOS or Settings on other platforms.Just as easy to use as the audio,video, and image elements, the Model elementlets you embed a USDZ file into your web pagewith an interactive view,with the ability to rotate around objects.This allows creation of more interactive websites,providing your users incredible experiencesno matter which of the supported devices they're on.We're working with the W3C Immersive Web Working Groupon standardization.We also have Reality Composer Pro,a new macOS application joining our suite of toolsfor creators and developers.Using USD's composition features,it lets multiple people work in parallel,enabling each person to tackle a different aspect of the sceneand see them combined together as each asset updates.Assets can be authored to USDin your own content creation applications,and Reality Composer Pro lets you prepare themfor use in xrOS apps and experiences.Check out our Reality Composer Pro sessionsto learn more.As important as the 3D models you makeis the shaders and materials that give themthe individual visual aesthetic.MaterialX gives you the power to have bespoke visualsthat can be transported inside your USD scenesinto RealityKit applications on xrOS.Reality Composer Pro introduces a Shader Graphthat authors MaterialX nodes embedded inside of USD files.This enables the creation of shadersusing an interactive node graph to compose the shader logic.MaterialX shader graphs are how creatorswill be constructing custom shaders for xrOS content.In addition to many of the standard MaterialX nodes,Reality Composer Pro also has a few custom MaterialX nodesthat enable a range of xrOS-specific platform features.Some of these shader nodes are: RealityKit PBR,our physically based rendering shaderwhich enables realistic-looking 3D content;RealityKit Unlit, an unlit shaderthat lets you do more stylized shading;Geometry Modifiers that allow us to modifysurface deformations;as well as several custom utility nodes.We have a great developer sessionon how to use the Shader Graph to get you up and runningwith creating custom looks for your assets.Support for MaterialX with USD growsacross established third-party 3D applications,like SideFX's Houdiniand LookdevX in Autodesk's Maya, shown here.Reality Composer Pro then lets you preview your shadersto see how they'll look before deploying to your device.As I mentioned, MaterialX is an open source projectwhich enables creators and developers to make use of itin their own workflows and applications directly.The MaterialX project includes supportfor generating shader code from your MaterialX node graphs.Apple has added support to the projectfor creating Metal shader code to make the most useof our powerful GPUs.This is now available in the MaterialX 1.38.7 release.For developers who use USD, this also enables the future useof MaterialX within USD on macOS.Having confidence in how your shaders behave is important,but so is having confidence in what your colors look like.So we've expanded our handling of color space managementfor RealityKit,so you can make accurate-looking 3D contentcapable of using our wide gamut color range.But first, a quick recap of why color spaces are important.Color spaces are how graphics programs understandhow to represent colors from digital values,including the range of colors available.This allows multiple applicationsto reliably display and edit the same colors.Apple displays primarily use Display P3 as their color space,whereas many other platforms may use the more commonplace sRGB.DisplayP3 marries the wider primary range of digital cinemawith the sRGB gamma curves used by computer displays.In fact, it's capable of displayingup to 25 percent more colors than traditional sRGB,shown here as the black linewithin the greater Display P3 color space.This allows for representing more of the colors we seein the real world,such as the vibrant feathers of a parrot,or the deep colors of your favorite clothes.Most color and image workflows tend to use sRGB,which represents a standard range of colorsused by many monitors for decades.These are still capable of creating good-looking content,but can't take full advantage of the beautiful,wider-range displays that Apple products ship with.If you instead make use of the Display P3 color profile,you're now able to use the wider color rangethat RealityKit can provide on these displays.Textures authored with Display P3 in mind,and appropriately tagged, are able to expressa much larger range of colors,with deeper and more saturated tones.This effect may be subtle, but allows for the creationof more vibrant and authentic-looking assets.Notice the richer reds and the lush greens.Most importantly, color space taggingmeans your colors are accurate to what you sawwhen you made your content,avoiding accidental color shifts.MaterialX and Color Management are great new additionsto our USD ecosystem.We also have more to share about what's new in USDfor our platforms and the greater ecosystem.All our first party applications,such as Motion and Quick Look,now benefit from an updated and more efficient USD version.USD supports a wide range of object types,also known as schemas.This update also allows the Storm renderer in Previewon macOS to support renderingeven more USD schemas and features.We also continue to update our documentationto highlight features and schemas that are newly supportedon our renderers and which platforms support them.Additionally, we make note of other changes in behaviors,so we recommend that you periodically refresh yourselfon the documentation linked in the video description.USD also allows for custom schema types.And this year, RealityKit is introducingnew Component schemas for its Entity Component System,or ECS for short, on xrOS.RealityKit's ECS splits the systems that process datafrom the Component data itself,allowing it to live alongside your 3D content.Thanks to these custom schemas,you can now use RealityKitComponentfor built-in Components, and RealityKitCustomComponentfor your own Swift custom components.Your Swift components structs and dictionaries can berepresented by the equivalent RealityKit USD schemas.RealityKit also builds upon USD's spatialAudiowith RealityKit's Audio File, Audio File Group, and MixGroupto create even more immersive audio.Let's take a look at a USD file that representssome custom component data, as a USD prim,which is what USD calls objects in its hierarchy.This allows your custom component datato live alongside your other prims such as geometry.Since this is all in USD, you can use any appthat lets you author USD prims directly to create themalongside the rest of your scene.This aligns with your corresponding Swift Componentthat can then be used to read these valuesfrom your USD components, such as herewhere different objects in your app may havespecific Engagement Points associated with them.Please check out our talks on building applicationswith Reality Composer Pro to learn more.We continue to contribute to growing these technologiesin the industry, as a growing ecosystemmakes content creation easier for everyone.So we've worked with Pixar and the communityto list many of the software packagesthat now support USD on the OpenUSD webpage.This allows creators to see how easily they can createUSD-based content with their own existing workflows on a Mac.We've also been working on making it easyto build USD for our portable platforms like iOS,so that as developers, you, too, can integrate USDinto your own applications.This enables you to create applications that can authorimmersive USD content.Additionally, we're collaboratingto reduce dependencies in the USD libraryso that it's easier to get up and running with USDacross all platforms, with minimal work.USD includes a technology called Hydra,an abstraction framework for renderers,and Storm, a real-time renderer that makes use of Hydra.Apple has worked with Pixar to add Metal support to Storm,making use of our modern graphics APIthat enables developers to create high-performance,GPU-based applications on our platforms.Let's take a look at one scenariowhere this performance helps.The Animal Logic ALab scene is representativeof many feature film-level assets.When set to full resolution, this scene can takeover 26GB of graphics memory,previously requiring desktop workstation GPUs.Now, with Metal in Hydra Storm,and unified memory on Apple silicon,a MacBook Pro lets you work on the go,even on demanding scenes like this,while retaining interactive performance.This high-performance rendering in Storm also enablesBlackmagic Design to add fast viewport rendering of USDto Fusion in DaVinci Resolve.Building on the collaboration from previous years,we continue to work with Autodeskon their open source Maya USD plugin.We've made several contributions to the project,including enhancements to the export of geometryand materials for your assets.We also have improvements to animation import.All

render.Final renders can make use of your GPU to completein up to half the time when compared to CPU based renders,and the viewport can now render up to 4 times faster than OpenGLin certain scenes.That wraps up this overview of what's new in the USD Ecosystem.xrOS adds a whole new, exciting dimension to appsand experiences, built on a foundationof technologies like USD.I recommend
