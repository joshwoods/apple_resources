Apple.Today, I'm excited to tell you about some recent developmentsin Safari extensions, highlighting improvementsto the user experience and new features.First, we want to thank you for creatingand sharing the over 2000 Safari extensionsavailable on the App Store today.Demand for Safari extensions on iOShas been especially impressive.They're often among the top categories on the App Storesince their introduction at WWDC21.Your extensions empower users to customizetheir browsing experience across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.There are four ways to build Safari extensions:content blockers, share extensions,app extensions, and web extensions.Safari 17 continues to support all of these types,but the future of browser customizationlies in web extensions.Apple is dedicated to standardizing web extensionsalongside the other major browser vendors.This collaboration aims to improve compatibility,streamline development,and ensure a familiar experience across all browsers.We're working togetherin the W3C WebExtensions Community Group,where Apple proudly serves as a cochair.By connecting with other browser and extension developersto drive this standardization effort,we're building a stronger and more unifiedweb extension ecosystem.Before jumping into today's topics,I'd like to share two key detailsabout Safari web extensions.First, Safari 17 will continue to support both Manifest v2and v3 web extensions.We'll continue to add new features to Manifest v3,so update when it makes sense for your extension.Second, web extensions are the best wayto build extensions for Safari across platforms.With a single shared codebase, web extensions allow youto customize the capabilities of Safari on iOS,iPadOS, macOS, and now xrOS.That's right, web extension available on iOS and iPadOSwill also be available on xrOS.Web extensions on xrOS work just like you'd expectand have the same capabilities as extensions on iOS,including the ability to inject scripts,run background content, and display popovers.We're excited to see how your extensionsenhance the browsing experience on xrOS.To learn more about Safari on xrOS,check out "Meet Safari for xrOS."With those announcements out of the way,here's what we'll cover in the rest of today's session.First, we'll delve into some new and updated extension APIsand how they enhance the capabilitiesof Safari extensions.Then we'll cover per-site permissionsfor Safari app extensions, offering users more controlover their browsing experience.And finally, we'll take a look at how to ensure compatibilitywith both Safari Profiles and Private Browsing.Up first, new extension APIs.Content blockers are a great way to clean up web pages,remove annoyances, and block loading of scripts.Content blockers use rules defined in JSON to block or hidecontent without needing access to any informationabout what websites are visited.Declaratively hiding content on web pages can be tricky.That's why content blockers now support :has() selectors.:has() selectors are great because they allowyour content blocker to precisely target parent elementsbased on their children.In this rule example, we're hiding any elementswith the class .post that also have a child elementwith the class .paid-promo.Extensions that hide webpage content,or block network requests,are some of the most popular types of extensions.That's why Safari continues to support youin creating innovative and effective extensionsthat offer a secure and private browsing experiencefor your users.If you're looking to block or modify network requestswith a web extension,you should check out these updatesto Declarative Net Request.Declarative Net Request is a powerful APIthat provides a way for your web extensionto block and modify network requests.Like content blockers, your extension provides rulesin a JSON format and Safari handles the rest.This means enhanced power efficiency,especially on battery-powered devices.Since these rules are declarative,your extension doesn't need accessto webpages the user visits,increasing their privacy and security.One big update to Declarative Net Requestin Safari 16.4 is that your extensioncan now modify request headers.In this example, I've defined an actionthat sets a custom User-Agent headerfor all requests made to example.com.Beyond setting headers, this action type can modify headersby adding new values, removing existing values,or even removing headers entirelyfrom HTTP requests.Modifying network requests is a powerful tool,and there are some key points to keep in mind.First, you must declarethe declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess permissionin the manifest.In Safari 16.4, this permission is now also requiredfor redirect actions.Your extension must also be granted per-site permissionsfor any modify headers or redirect actions to be applied.This ensures that the user has control over their dataon a site-by-site basis.By keeping these considerations in mind,you can create powerful and privacy-friendlycontent-blocking extensionsthat provide a tailored experience for your users.If you're building an extensionthat uses Declarative Net Request,you may want to let your users knowjust how many requests it has blocked.Using the newdeclarativeNetRequest.setExtensionActionOptions API,you can configure the badge text to display action counts,such as the number of blocked loads.In this example, we set thedisplayActionCountAsBadgeText option to true,which is currently the only option for this API.Your extension badge will update automaticallybased on the actions taken.This allows your users to easily monitorthe extension's activity and effectiveness,all while keeping their browsing history private.Now I'll cover an update to the scripting APIthat gives you more control over the behavior of your extension.With the registerContentScript set of APIs,you can create content scripts that can be registered,updated, or removed programmatically.This means that you can target specific pages or conditionsto apply to content scripts.In this example, I'm registering a scriptto be injected onto pages that match webkit.org.This script registration will also persist across sessions.This new API complements the static content scriptsdefined in the extension manifest,giving you greater flexibility in managing content scriptsand enabling you to create more advanced featuresfor your extensions.Safari 16.4 also brings a new storage areato web extensions: the session storage area.Storing and retrieving data from session storageuses the same familiar functions as other storage areas.This API allows you to store data in memoryfor the duration of your browser session,providing a fast and efficient way to access databetween nonpersistent background page loads.Unlike local storage,session storage is not persisted to diskand it's cleared when Safari quits.This makes session storage particularly usefulfor storing sensitive or security-related data,such as decryption keys or authentication tokens,that should not be stored in local storage.Finally, we know that making sure your extensionhas all the right icon sizes for different UI elementsis a chore.That's why starting in Safari 16.4,you can now create a single SVG iconthat looks beautiful at any size.Safari will take care of scaling your extension's icon sharply,letting you focus on everything else.Those API updates are just some of the improvementsto Safari extensions this year.Now let's talk about Safari app extensionsand per-site permissions.If you're already familiar with per-site permissionsfrom web extensions,they work the same way for app extensions.Users are able to grant extensions accessto websites as they browse,providing for better privacy and control.When an extension is first turned on,it won't have access to any sites that the user visits.The first time an extension tries to access the page,Safari will badge the extension's toolbar itemalerting the user that the extension wants accessto the current page.When the user clicks on that toolbar item,they'll be shown information about what accessthe extension will have, and be given the optionto Allow for One Day, or Always Allow.When granted permission, the extension's toolbar itemwill be tinted to show that the extensionhas access to the current page.Anyone that upgrades to Safari 17and already has Safari app extensions turned onwill have all permissions migrated for those extensions.They'll also be shown a banner giving them the optionto increase their privacy.If Ask for Each Website is chosen,all Safari app extension permissions will be reset,and your users will be able to grant your extension accessto each site as they visit.There are no new APIs to adopt to support this changein Safari 17; however,take some time to review your extension's assumptionsand test how your extensions behave in Safari 17.Your users will have full control over the websitesevery Safari app extension can access.Your extension will automatically have accessto sites when permission is granted by the user.However, permissions can be granted or revoked at any time.Toolbar items are now shown by default for all extensions.Take a look at how your extension icon appears in Safariand supply a PDF vector iconthat can be tinted appropriately.Finally, let's talk about updates to how extensions workin both Profiles and Private Browsing.In Safari 17, users will be able to control which extensionshave access to their Private Browsing windows and tabswithout needing to turn off the extensionin other browsing contexts.Extensions that inject scripts,or can read information about the pages a user visits,are turned off by default.However, extensions that don't access content,like content blockers,are automatically allowed in Private Browsingbecause there aren't any additional privacy concerns.Here's the updated Extensions pane in Safari settings on macOSand there are similar updates on iOS.There's a new option to allow this extensionin Private Browsing.For extensions that are turned on,it's one click in Safari settingsto allow that extension access to Private Browsing as well.Profiles are new in Safari this year.They're a way to keep browsing data separated.Profiles contain separate history, cookies,and website data.Users can also choose which extensionsthey want to turn on per profile.This includes new tab page extensions.And of course, all these settings syncacross all of a user's iPhone, iPad, and Macs through iCloud.The Extensions pane in Safari settingshas also been updated to list the profileswhere an extension is active.Here you can see that the Sea Creator extensionis active in both Work and School profiles.When an extension is turned on in a profile,it is an entirely new instance of that extension.This means each instance will have a different UUID,background page, and storage.However, per-site permissions are shared across profiles.That means your users only needto grant your extension access once.When running in a profile,an extension only has access to the windows, tabs,and other data related to that profile.If your extension communicates with a native host app,make sure that your app expects to receive messagesfrom multiple profilesand respects the separation of data across those profiles.When your app receives a call to beginRequest(with context:),decode the userInfo dictionary.If your extension is active in a profile,there will be a profileIdentifier valuefor the key SFExtensionProfileKey.Since extensions have unique instances per profile,it's possible to inspect their background content separately.From the Develop menu in Safari 17,you can dive intothe Web Extension Background Content menu itemand see the background pages and service workersgrouped by extension.Each extension will list its inspectable content per profile.To learn more about the improvementsto Safari developer features this year,check out "What's new in Web Inspector"and "Rediscover Safari developer features."In summary, Safari is committed to standardizing web extensionsand providing you with new APIs to create innovativeand effective extensions.We'd love for you to join in the discussionand help shape the future of web extensionsby participating in the WECG.With per-site permissions for app extensionsand support for new features like :has() selectors,you can create extensions that offer a secureand private browsing experience for your users.Don't forget to update your extensionsto take advantage of these new capabilitiesand ensure they work well with both Profilesand Private Browsing.And finally, provide feedback through Feedback Assistantas you test your extensions in Safari 17.Thank you for listening, and have a great rest of WWDC.♪

♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop ♪♪David Johnson: Hello, everyone.

Welcome to "What's New in Safari Extensions."My name is David Johnson,and I'm a Safari extensions engineer here at Apple.

Today, I'm excited to tell you about some recent developmentsin Safari extensions, highlighting improvementsto the user experience and new features.

First, we want to thank you for creatingand sharing the over 2000 Safari extensionsavailable on the App Store today.

Demand for Safari extensions on iOShas been especially impressive.

They're often among the top categories on the App Storesince their introduction at WWDC21.

Your extensions empower users to customizetheir browsing experience across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.

There are four ways to build Safari extensions:content blockers, share extensions,app extensions, and web extensions.

Safari 17 continues to support all of these types,but the future of browser customizationlies in web extensions.

Apple is dedicated to standardizing web extensionsalongside the other major browser vendors.

This collaboration aims to improve compatibility,streamline development,and ensure a familiar experience across all browsers.

We're working togetherin the W3C WebExtensions Community Group,where Apple proudly serves as a cochair.

By connecting with other browser and extension developersto drive this standardization effort,we're building a stronger and more unifiedweb extension ecosystem.

Before jumping into today's topics,I'd like to share two key detailsabout Safari web extensions.

First, Safari 17 will continue to support both Manifest v2and v3 web extensions.

We'll continue to add new features to Manifest v3,so update when it makes sense for your extension.

Second, web extensions are the best wayto build extensions for Safari across platforms.

With a single shared codebase, web extensions allow youto customize the capabilities of Safari on iOS,iPadOS, macOS, and now xrOS.
