advantage of this rich, powerful new framework.First, I'll examine how to configure persistence in an application.Next, I'll talk about how to use the ModelContextto track and persist changes.Finally, I'll examine how to get the most out of SwiftDatawhen working with objects in your code.I'd like to note that this session builds on the concepts and APIs introducedin "Meet Swift Data" and "Model your Schema with SwiftData".I highly recommend reviewing those sessionsbefore continuing with this one.In this talk, I'll be referencing a new sample application, SampleTrips,that we built this year to demonstratehow easy it is to build applications with SwiftData.SampleTrips makes it easy to organize my ideasabout where and when I want to travel.SwiftData also makes it easy to implement standard platform practiceslike undo and automatically saving when a user switches applications.SwiftData is a new way of persisting data in applications that use Swift.It's designed to work with the types you're already using in your codelike Classes and Structs.At the core of this concept is the Model, described by a new macro, @Model,which tells SwiftData about the types you want to persist.This is the Trip class from the SampleTrips application.It has a few properties to capture information about a tripand some references to other objects used in SampleTrips.We designed SwiftData to provide a minimal distancebetween the code you would normally write without persistence, as I have here,and the code you have to write with persistence.With just a few changes, I've told SwiftDatathis Trip is a Model I want to persistand described how its relationships to the BucketListItemand LivingAccommodations should behave.Where possible, SwiftData automatically infers the structure you want to usefrom the code you write.But SwiftData also offers a powerful set of customizationsto help you describe exactly how you want your data to be stored.You can learn all about the power of Model in "Model your Schema with SwiftData".These annotations to the Trip class enable itto play two important roles in SwiftData.The first is to describe the object graph of the application, called the Schema,and the second is that the Trip class will be an interfacethat I can write code against.This duality, the ability to play both parts,makes classes annotated with the @Model macrothe central point of contact in applications that use SwiftData,and there is an aligned API concept to support each of these roles.The Schema is applied to a class called the ModelContainerto describe how data should be persisted.The ModelContainer consumes the Schemato generate a database that can hold instances of the Model classes.When working with instances of a Model class in code,those instances are linked to a ModelContextwhich tracks and manages their state in memory.This duality is at the core of SwiftDataand in this section, I'll take a detailed look at the first role of the model,to describe the structure of persistenceand how that works with the ModelContainer.The ModelContainer is where you describe how data is stored,or persisted, on a device.We can think of the ModelContainer as the bridgebetween the Schema and its persistence.It's where descriptions about how objects are stored,like whether they're in memory, or on disk,meet the operational and evolutionary semantics of that storagelike versioning, migration, and graph separation.Instantiating a container with a Schema is easy.I can provide just the type I want to work withand SwiftData will figure out the rest of the Schema for me.For example, because the Trip class is related to other model types,ModelContainer actually infers this Schema,even though I only passed it a single type.ModelContainer has a number of other powerful initializersthat are designed to grow with your codeto enable increasingly complex configurationsusing a class called the ModelConfiguration.The ModelConfiguration describes the persistence of a Schema.It controls where data is stored, like in memory for transient dataor on disk for persistent data.ModelConfiguration can use a specific file URL chosen by you,or it can generate one automatically using the entitlements of your applicationlike the group container entitlement.The configuration can also describethat a persistence file should be loaded in a read only mode,preventing writes to sensitive or template data.And finally, applications that use more than one CloudKit containercan specify it as part of the ModelConfiguration for a Schema.Let's imagine I want to add some contact information to SampleTripsusing new Person and Address classes.First, the total Schema is declared containing all of the types I want to use.Next, a Configuration is declared for the SampleTrips datacontaining the Trip, BucketListItem, and LivingAccommodations models.It declares a URL for the file I want to useto store this specific object graph's data,and a container identifier for the CloudKit container I want to usewhen syncing the SampleTrips data to CloudKit.Then, the models for the new Schema with Person and Address are declaredin their own configuration with a unique file URL and CloudKit container identifierto keep this data separate from the Trips graph.Finally, the Schema and configurations are combined to form the ModelContainer.With the power of ModelConfiguration,it's easy to describe the persistence requirements of your application,no matter how complicated they may be.In addition to instantiating a container by hand,SwiftUI applications can use the new modelContainer modifiersto create the container they want to work with.The modelContainer modifier can be added to any View or Scene in an applicationand it supports ModelContainers from simple to powerfuland everything in between.In this section, I examined how to combine the Schema with persistenceusing ModelContainer.It grows with your applicationas you build ever more powerful features and object graphs.And I demonstrated how you can use ModelConfigurationto unlock powerful persistence capabilities.As we learned in "Meet SwiftData", the Model and ModelContextare two of the most frequently used concepts when writing user interfacesor operating on model objects.In this section, I'll take a deep dive into how the ModelContext tracks changesand persists edits through the ModelContainer.When we use the modelContainer modifier in view or scene code,it prepares the application's environment in a specific way.The modifier binds the new modelContext key in the environmentto the container's mainContext.The main context is a special MainActor-aligned model contextintended for working with ModelObjects in scenes and views.By using the model context from the environment,view code has easy access to the context used by the Query hereso that it can perform actions like delete here.So model contexts are easy to use and accessbut what do they actually do?We can think of the ModelContext as a view over the data an application manages.Data we want to work with is fetched into a model context as its used.In SampleTrips, when the upcoming trips view loads the data for the list,each trip object is fetched into the main context.If a trip is edited, that change is recordedby the model context as a snapshot.As other changes are made, like inserting a new Tripor deleting an existing one,the context tracks and maintains state about these changesuntil you call "context.save()".This means that even though the deleted trip is no longer visible in the list,it still exists in the ModelContext until that delete is persisted by calling save.Once save is called, the context persists changes to the ModelContainerand clears its state.If you're still referencing the objects in the context,like displaying them in a list,they will exist in the context until you're finished with them.At which point they will be freed and the context emptied out.The ModelContext works in coordination with the ModelContainer it is bound to.It tracks the objects you fetch in your viewsand then propagates any changes when save executes.ModelContext also supports features like rollback or resetfor clearing its cached state when needed.This makes it the ideal place to support platform features like undo and autosave.In SwiftUI applications, the modelContainer modifier hasthis isUndoEnabled argument,which binds the window's undo manager to the container's mainContext.That means that as changes are made in the main context,system gestures like three finger swipe and shake can be usedto undo or redo changes with no additional code.ModelContext automatically registers undo and redo actionsas changes are made to model objects.The modelContainer modifier uses the environment's undoManagerwhich is usually provided by the system as part of the window or window group.and because of this, system gestures like three finger swipe and shakewill automatically work in your applications.Another standard system feature supported by the ModelContext is Autosave.When autosave is enabled the model context will save in response to system eventslike an application entering the foreground or background.The main context will also periodically save as an application is used.Autosave is enabled by default in applicationsand can be disabled if desiredusing the modelContainer modifier's isAutosaveEnabled argument.Autosave is disabled for model contexts created by hand.In "Meet SwiftData", we learned a lot abouthow to work with ModelContext in an applicationand how well it pairs with SwiftUI.But user interfaces aren't the only placesthat applications need to work with model objects.In this section, I'll examine how SwiftData makeswriting powerful, scalable code easier and safer than ever.Tasks like working with data on a background queue,syncing with a remote server or other persistence mechanism,and batch processing all work with model objects, frequently in sets or graphs.Many of these tasks will begin by fetching a set of objects to work withvia the fetch method on a ModelContext.In this example, the FetchDescriptor for the Trip model tells Swift thatthe trips array will be a collection of Trip objects.There's no casting or complicated result tuples to worry about.FetchDescriptor makes it easy to craft complicated queriesusing the new Predicate macro.For example, what are all the trips that involve staying at a specific hotel?Or what trips still have some activities that I need to make reservations for?In SwiftData, complicated queries that support subqueries and joinscan all be written in pure swift.Predicate uses the Models you createand SwiftData uses the Schema generated from those modelsto translate these predicates into database queries.FetchDescriptor combines the power of the new Foundation Predicate macrowith the Schema to bring compiler validated queries to persistenceon Apple platforms for the first time.FetchDescriptor and related classes, like SortDescriptor,use generics to form the result typeand tell the compiler about the properties of the model you can use.There are a number of tuning options you've come to know and love,like offset and limit,as well as parameters for faulting and prefetching.All of this power combines in the new enumerate function on ModelContext.It's designed to help make the foiblesome pattern of batch traversal and enumerationimplicitly efficient by encapsulatingthe platform best practices at a single call site.Enumerate works great with FetchDescriptorsregardless of their complexity,from simple to powerful and everything in between.Enumerate automatically implements platform best practices for traversalslike batching and mutation guards.These are customizable to meet the needs of your specific use case.For example, the batch size that enumerate uses defaults to 5,000 objects.But I could change it to 10,000 to reduce I/O operations during the traversalat the expense of memory growth.Heavier object graphs, like those that include images, movies,or other large data blobs,may choose to use a smaller batch size.Decreasing the batch size reduces memory growthbut increases I/O during the enumeration.Enumerate also includes mutation guard by default.One of the most frequent causes of performance issues with large traversalsis mutations that are trapped in the context during the enumeration.allowEscapingMutations tells enumerate that this is intentional,when not set, enumerate will throwif it discovers that the ModelContext performing the enumeration is dirty,preventing it from freeing objects that were already traversed.In this session, we learned how to create powerful persistence configurationswith Schema and ModelConfiguration.We also learned how easy it is to adopt standard system practiceslike undo and redo with the ModelContainer and ModelContext.And you can use SwiftData today to write safe, performant code in your projectlike never before with FetchDescriptor, predicate, and enumerate.I can't wait to see how you push the limits of what's possiblewith this new framework in the months and years ahead.Thanks for watching and happy coding.
