Principles of spatial design

Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop ♪♪Miquel Estany Rodriguez: Hi, I'm Miquel Estany Rodriguez.Lorena Pazmino: And I'm Lorena Pazmino,and we're from the Apple Design team.Today, we're going to talk about how to designspatial user interfaces.To help you get started on this platform,we've built a visual language that maintains consistencyand familiarity with our existing platforms,while also evolving certain elements to adaptto immersive and spatial experiences.Miquel: We'll start by talking about the UI foundationsand design principles to considerwhen creating app icons and interfacesthat are legible and usable in an environment.Then we'll go over key concepts and best practicesto create layouts that are both ergonomic and easy to target.And finally, we'll conclude by showing how this platformcan bring your app from a screen to spatial,walking you through all our system components,most of which you are already familiar withand some that are completely new.Let's dive deep into UI foundation.These are the core design principleswe will cover on this section.Let's start talking about app icons.We wanted to keep home view familiarand we've gone one step further,making app icons three-dimensionaland realistic in your space.When people look at them, they expand.And the system enhance this visual effectby adding specular highlights and shadowsto reinforce the subtle depth between layers.So how can you design a great icon?First of all, use multiple layers.Other platform use layers to create a parallax effect.Here, just by using flat layers,the system can create this truly 3D effect.All app icons can have up to three layers,a background layer and up to two foreground layers on top.Each layer is a square image,and their size is 1024 by 1024 pixels.Both foreground layers should have a transparent background.Design your background layer as an edge to edge square image.Then all layers will get cropped by a circular mask.And finally, when layers match together,a glass layer is applied automatically, adding depth,specular highlights, and shadows to them.Try to keep graphics centered.If they are too close to the edge,they could look off-center when expanded.Avoid using large regions of semitransparent pixels.Layers with reduced opacity will blend with the shadowcast behind it.And that's how you can easily createthree-dimensional app icons.Next, let's talk about materials.When people tap your app icon, apps will launchin many different places like this one,a broad daylight room, or in a small spacelike an airplane, or at nighttime.Apps need to adapt to the lighting conditionsin your surroundings.They should be easy to place in the space around you,easy to use at any distance, and easy to viewwith any lighting conditions.And that's why we've designed a new visual language,the glass material.This system-defined beautiful glass windowfeels part of your physical world.And its unique properties allow lightfrom people's surroundings and virtual content to show through.In addition, specular highlights and shadowsreinforce its scale and position in your space.And it works as a canvas for your contained UI,making it feel lighterand adding a sense of physicality to it.This lightweight material also gives people a sense ofwhat might be behind a window, like other apps or people.To deliver great spatial experiences,it's important to be aware of your surroundings.Avoid using solid colors on windows.Too many opaque windows can feel constrictingand make the interface feel heavy.Glass responds dynamically to lighting,adjusting the contrast and color balanceto feel part of your space,like in this transition from day to night.Unlike iOS and macOS, this platform does not havea distinct light or dark appearance.Instead, glass and UI naturally adaptwhen placed in front of light and dark backgrounds.System-defined vibrant materials take great advantageof this feature, ensuring your app looks greatacross different scenarios and lighting conditions,Let's take a look at them.First, we start with a glass window.If you want to separate sections of your app,like a sidebar, use a darker material.Or a lighter material to bring attentionto interactive elements, like buttons.Or you might even consider using darker materialsto increase contrast for standard components,like input fields.Here is how Music app looks with all the UI elements.As you can see, text defaults to white.So, imagine that you want to design a lock-up like this one,and you want to add a lighter button.It is great to place it on top of the glass material.Or if you want to get more contrast,use a darker cell behind it.Try to not stack lighter materials on top of each other,as it impacts legibility and reduces contrast.Now, I'll show you how typographyhas been precisely adapted to this platform.To keep things familiar, all font stylesuse semantic names that work on all platforms.They have been tuned on our point-based unit system,ensuring they are legible at any distance.To learn more, check out the session"Principles of spatial design."We've also modified some of the font weightsto improve legibility.Let's take a closer look.To improve the contrast of text against vibrant materials,font weight has been modified to be slightly heavier.For example, on iOS, we use regular weightfor the body text style.On this platform, we use medium.And for titles, instead of semibold,we use bold, keeping text clear all the time.Consequently, the tracking has been slightly increasedto help with legibility.In addition to the well-known font styleswe share across platforms,we've added two brand-new font styles that take advantageof the wide, editorial-style layouts you can use.Here is an example of the Extra Large Title 1 on Arcade.Cool, right?Even though windows can scale up to incredible large sizes,custom smaller or lightweight fontscan still be difficult to read.To improve that, consider increasing the weightor using a typeface designed for optimized legibility,like system fonts.Next, let's talk about vibrancy.This is one of the most important detailsto maintain legibility across the system.Vibrancy brightens foreground contentthat displays on top of a material and worksby pulling light and color forward from what's behind it.On this platform, since the backgroundcan be constantly changing, vibrancy updates in real timeto make sure your text is always legible.To show what I mean, let's look at an example.Vibrancy works on top of the glass material,enhancing legibility and making system materialsfeel richer and sophisticated.Make sure to use the system components when possible.By default, they take advantage of this vibrancy effect.Let's pause for a second and turn vibrancy off.As we just saw, vibrancy improves legibilityand how materials look.Let me turn it on and off to show you the difference.Now let's see how you can take advantage of it.Use vibrancy to indicate hierarchy for text,symbols, and fills.There are three modes: primary, secondary, and tertiary.Use primary for standard text.Or use secondary for description text, footnotes, and subtitles.You've seen the glass material can be many different colors,since it shows the color of what's behind it.Colorful elements on top of the glass may be hard to seeif the color of the glass is similar.Most of the time, consider using white text or symbolsso they are always clearly visible.If you need to use color, use it in a background layeror an entire button so people can see it.When possible, use system color instead of custom color,as they have been calibrated for legibilityand dynamically adapt to maintain hue and contraston the glass.So those are the design principles and the updateswe've made to the core components,like materials, typography, and vibrancy,to make sure your app gets elevated on this platform.Now I'm going to hand it off to Lorena who will show youhow to create ergonomic layouts that are easy to targetas you take your app from screen to spatial.Lorena: Thanks, Miquel.Let's start by exploring some of the best waysto position content so that it feels comfortable.Then show you how to properly size contentso that it's easy to target.And lastly, show you how to create layouts that workwith our new and beautiful eye focus feedback.Because people primarily interactwith their eyes and hands on this platform,it's important to create experiencesthat prioritize people's physical comfort and safety.More than ever, you need to considerthe ergonomics of your design,ensuring that the placement of content is intentionaland doesn't cause eye or neck fatigue.For example, because of the neck's range of motion,it's easier for most people to turn their headfarther to the right and to the left rather than up and down.So keep your UI in people's field of view and be carefulabout placing anything too high up or too far down.If you need a large canvas for your app,go with a wider aspect ratio than taller.For example, in Freeform,the canvas extends horizontally and not vertically.Prioritize having the most important informationcentered in your app so people can comfortablyview your content.Now that we've covered best practices for content placement,let's talk about content size.Each person is unique and our eyes have slight variationsfrom one person to another, which is whyelements should use sizes that are easy to target.Let's get into the details.Interactive elements must have a tap target areawith at least 60 points of space,so they can be easily selected.This means that your UI element can be visually smaller,like the standard button, which is 44 points,as long as you add enough space around it.So for this button, it always needsto have at least eight points of empty space around itso it meets the minimumof having a target area of 60 points.As an easy thing to remember, if you need to haveseveral buttons in a stack, use standard system buttonswith at least 16 points of spacing in between them.Now, let's say you needed to use a visually smaller element,like a disclosure control.You can use a mini button, which is 28 points,in an area like the section header.Even though this button might look small,because it has 60 points of space around it,it's easy to select.Let's look at another example.Here, this button still has enough spacebecause the text next to it, it's not interactive.Similarly, using large and extra large buttonsrequires less spacing around them.So, always remember to give all interactive elementsat least 60 points of space.Now that we've talked about how to size elementsin your layouts, let's talk about focus feedback.Focus feedback is a powerful toolbuilt into every interactive element in this platform.When people look at system-provided components,they automatically display a subtle visual brighteningor hover effect.This hover effect allows people to understandwhich parts of an interface are interactivejust by looking at them.When an item becomes inactive, like the Share button,it no longer gives focus feedback.This gives people confidence that they are focusedon the intended element,which means that they can tap their fingers to select it.As you go creating layouts,it's important to take the hover effect into account.For example, if you're creating a list or a menu,you need to account for a small amount of paddingin between each item to avoid having the hover effect overlap.Four points is recommended.As you're designing a lock-up, include a shapethat will allow the system to display the hover effectas people focus on it.Here, we have some images with text below them.Each lock-up is a single interactive element.You need to define a custom regionso it can brighten as people look at it.This helps them understand the entire areais a single element that can be selected.And remember to keep that small spacein between each containing shape.Another thing to keep in mind is to ensure nested elementshave relative corner radii and paddingthat keeps them concentric with each other.To help you figure out how to size your corners,you can use this simple formula.Corner radius of the nested element,plus the padding in between it and the outer container,gets you the outer corner radius.And remember, in order to keep your corners smooth,be sure to set them to be continuous corners.Throughout the system, every element is concentricto one another, starting from the relationshipof the window to the elements in the corners.So remember to keep nested elementsconcentric with each other,as this will help them feel like they belong together.Now that we've covered best practices to create layouts,let's take a closer look at the componentsthat you'll be using.In this section, we'll show youhow to take your knowledge from existing platformsand apply it to spatial computing.We'll start with a brief overview of our input model,then dive deep into how to set up the core structureof an app with a window, tab bar, and sidebar.Then we'll talk about a new way of presenting content.And last, we'll explore modalities.Let's get started with inputs.As we've mentioned earlier, people interact with a devicewith their eyes, hands, and voice.They do this by looking at elementsand tapping their fingers, primarily from a distance.However, people can also select an element directlyby touching it.Additionally, people can also connect a keyboardor a trackpad, allowing them to interactwith the system with a wide array of inputs.Interacting with the system feels magical,but it means elements have to providethe appropriate feedback for each of those models.All of our system components have been builtto support each input. So, use system components.They help you create interfaces quickly so you can spend timefinding what makes your app unique in this new medium.To learn more about inputs, be sure to check outthe session "Design for spatial input."Now, let's walk through some examples.If you're familiar with iOS, many of the componentsin this platform will look familiar to you.Let's begin with a window, tab bar, and sidebar.Let's start with the core structure of an iOS app.You need a window, which has an opaque materialand provides the canvas for all elements to sit on top.As Miquel said, the window is made of the glass materialwith a window bar below that allows peopleto move your app fluidly in their space.Similarly, on top of it, you'll have your content.On iPhone at the bottom of the window,laid out horizontally, you have a tab bar controllerfor your main navigation, giving people quick accessto the top-level sections of your appwith just a single tap.Here, the tab bar is vertical, floating in a fixed positionon the left side of the window.Designed to be out of the way and easy to access,it's there where you need it, allowing people to seewhere they are in your app without taking awayfrom your main content.In general, you want to keep those feeling light,so avoid having more than six items.When people look at the tab bar, they can quickly select an item.And if they look at it for a little longer,It automatically expands, showing labels for each section.When people look away, it automatically closes again,allowing people to focus on the content.If you need to provide sub navigation,like with an album in this example,sidebars live in the window alongside the tab bar.This gives people a clear sense of where they are in that tab.Now that we've covered the core structure of an app,let's get into a new presentation stylewe've added, ornaments.In the Photos app, we have a floating accessory elementat the top center to navigate between years, months, and days.On this platform, since we're not bounded by a screen,that accessory is placed as an ornament at the bottom,slightly in front of the window.This gives people additional persistent controlsthat are easy to access using depth to create hierarchy.Ornaments are a great way to present toolbars.They allow people to perform quick actionsrelated to the content in a convenient location.And they add a bit of depth to your app.Since ornaments are usually a collection of buttonsand sit on their own glass container,this is a perfect place to use borderless buttons.In this case, it's clear that these are interactive elements,and they'll still get the hover effect as people look at them.Here's another great use of an ornament in the Music app.The Now Playing controls are presented as an ornamentthat persists no matter where you are in the app.This allows people to search for their next songwhile being able to control their music.When ornaments sit at the bottom edge of the window,place them so they overlap the bottom edge by 20 points.This helps ornaments to feel like they're integratedwith the main window without blocking too much content.And they look really nice, pulling colors from the contentthrough the glass as you scroll.Ornaments can appear and disappear entirely.However, it is only recommendedwhile focusing on a single piece of content.For example, looking at a photo or watching a movie.Like in this example, with just a tap,we give people quick access to important controlswithout distracting them from the main experience.Additionally, ornaments can expand,presenting additional content,or even have their own navigation hierarchy.So find where ornaments fit in your app.They are flexible and give your app depthwithout occluding content.Now that we've covered ornaments,let's get into menus, popovers, and sheets.On iPad, menus alignto the leading edge of the invoking button,and the button dims as the menu opens.Popovers point to the invoking elementand the navbar becomes inactive.On this platform, menus and popoverscan expand outside the window.They appear centered by default,ensuring that the content always appearsright where the user is looking.One thing to always keep in mindis to change the button that invokes themto its selected state.On this platform, we always use black labelson a white background to show buttons are selected.This helps people have clear feedbackof which button invoked the popoverwithout the need of arrows.As a general rule on this platform,avoid using buttons with white backgroundsunless they are selected.Finally, let's talk about sheets.On this system, sheets are presented as modal views,and they appear at the center of the app.Modals contain the same Z position as the parent window.The parent window pushes back and dims.This helps focus the experience and prevents peoplefrom interacting with the parent viewuntil the sheet is dismissed.If you need to present another sheet, a secondary modalcan appear in front with an additional layerof dimming pushing everything back.So let's look at it again from the side.Because we're stacking all these elements in Z,consider using push navigation for nested views.Here's a quick example of push navigation in a modal.The secondary view will present a back button instead of close.Also, notice how the close and back buttonsare in the top-left corner.As a system pattern, always place close buttonson the top-left corner.Miquel: Now that you understand the fundamentalsof building an app and using system components,think about what makes your app specialand how to take advantage of the space outside windowsto create rich spatial moments.For example, in Photos,we kept the browsing experience familiarand focused on creating new ways to experience your images,like Spatial Captures, which give you an immersive wayto relive your moments and experience contentin a unique and special way.We've covered how to design and develop accessible,familiar, and intuitive apps,using materials that blend with your surrounding.Interfaces that take advantage of different layers of depthand endless components that are not only visually appealing,but also familiar and easy to use in this new platform.All our system components have been designed to supportour wide array of inputs, while maintaining consistencywith the rest of the Apple ecosystem so you,as a designer or developer, can focus on generatinggroundbreaking immersive and spatial experiences.Thanks for watching.Both: Ciao!♪

On iPhone at the bottom of the window,laid out horizontally, you have a tab bar controllerfor your main navigation, giving people quick accessto the top-level sections of your appwith just a single tap.Here, the tab bar is vertical, floating in a fixed positionon the left side of the window.Designed to be out of the way and easy to access,it's there where you need it, allowing people to seewhere they are in your app without taking awayfrom your main content.In general, you want to keep those feeling light,so avoid having more than six items.When people look at the tab bar, they can quickly select an item.And if they look at it for a little longer,It automatically expands, showing labels for each section.When people look away, it automatically closes again,allowing people to focus on the content.If you need to provide sub navigation,like with an album in this example,sidebars live in the window alongside the tab bar.This gives people a clear sense of where they are in that tab.Now that we've covered the core structure of an app,let's get into a new presentation stylewe've added, ornaments.In the Photos app, we have a floating accessory elementat the top center to navigate between years, months, and days.On this platform, since we're not bounded by a screen,that accessory is placed as an ornament at the bottom,slightly in front of the window.This gives people additional persistent controlsthat are easy to access using depth to create hierarchy.Ornaments are a great way to present toolbars.They allow people to perform quick actionsrelated to the content in a convenient location.And they add a bit of depth to your app.Since ornaments are usually a collection of buttonsand sit on their own glass container,this is a perfect place to use borderless buttons.In this case, it's clear that these are interactive elements,and they'll still get the hover effect as people look at them.Here's another great use of an ornament in the Music app.The Now Playing controls are presented as an ornamentthat persists no matter where you are in the app.This allows people to search for their next songwhile being able to control their music.When ornaments sit at the bottom edge of the window,place them so they overlap the bottom edge by 20 points.This helps ornaments to feel like they're integratedwith the main window without blocking too much content.And they look really nice, pulling colors from the contentthrough the glass as you scroll.

Ornaments can appear and disappear entirely.However, it is only recommendedwhile focusing on a single piece of content.For example, looking at a photo or watching a movie.Like in this example, with just a tap,we give people quick access to important controlswithout distracting them from the main experience.Additionally, ornaments can expand,presenting additional content,or even have their own navigation hierarchy.So find where ornaments fit in your app.They are flexible and give your app depthwithout occluding content.Now that we've covered ornaments,let's get into menus, popovers, and sheets.On iPad, menus alignto the leading edge of the invoking button,and the button dims as the menu opens.Popovers point to the invoking elementand the navbar becomes inactive.On this platform, menus and popoverscan expand outside the window.They appear centered by default,ensuring that the content always appearsright where the user is looking.One thing to always keep in mindis to change the button that invokes themto its selected state.On this platform, we always use black labelson a white background to show buttons are selected.This helps people have clear feedbackof which button invoked the popoverwithout the need of arrows.As a general rule on this platform,avoid using buttons with white backgroundsunless they are selected.Finally, let's talk about sheets.On this system, sheets are presented as modal views,and they appear at the center of the app.Modals contain the same Z position as the parent window.The parent window pushes back and dims.This helps focus the experience and prevents peoplefrom interacting with the parent viewuntil the sheet is dismissed.If you need to present another sheet, a secondary modalcan appear in front with an additional layerof dimming pushing everything back.So let's look at it again from the side.Because we're stacking all these elements in Z,consider using push navigation for nested views.Here's a quick example of push navigation in a modal.The secondary view will present a back button instead of close.Also, notice how the close and back buttonsare in the top-left corner.As a system pattern, always place close buttonson the top-left corner.Miquel: Now that you understand the fundamentalsof building an app and using system components,think about what makes your app specialand how to take advantage of the space outside windowsto create rich spatial moments.For example, in Photos,we kept the browsing experience familiarand focused on creating new ways to experience your images,like Spatial Captures, which give you an immersive wayto relive your moments and experience contentin a unique and special way.We've covered how to design and develop accessible,familiar, and intuitive apps,using materials that blend with your surrounding.Interfaces that take advantage of different layers of depthand endless components that are not only visually appealing,but also familiar and easy to use in this new platform.All our system components have been designed to supportour wide array of inputs, while maintaining consistencywith the rest of the Apple ecosystem so you,as a designer or developer, can focus on generatinggroundbreaking immersive and spatial experiences.Thanks for watching.Both: Ciao!♪
