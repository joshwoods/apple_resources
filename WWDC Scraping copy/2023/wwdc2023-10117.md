Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop ♪♪Hi, and welcome to "What's new in App Store Connect."I'm Laurel McAndrews from App Store Connect Engineering.Today, I'll walk through the developer lifecyclein App Store Connect, and I'll call outsome enhancements we're making this year.I'll begin with some ways to think about monetizing your app,implementing in-app purchases,and how to set prices internationally.Then, I'll review how to manage testersand some of the improvements we've madeto managing builds and testers.I'll cover getting ready for going live on the App Store,and ways to build excitement for your app.Last, I'll walk through ways to use the App Store Connect APIto speed up your release cycle and customize workflows.First, let's talk about monetizing your app.As you're working on your app, you'll considerwhether to include in-app purchases and how to set prices.Whether you're a solo developer doing everything yourself,or a large company with a dedicated pricing team,there are features this year to help you run your businesson the App Store.For example, StoreKit for SwiftUI is a new capabilitythat allows you to quickly and easily offer in-app purchasesand subscriptions in your app.After you set up products in App Store Connect,you can go into Xcode and add a few lines of codeto generate views in your app to offer in-app purchases.These pages are fully accessibleand localize your project stringsinto all App Store languages.You can choose the simplest implementationof StoreKit for SwiftUI.Or you can customize elements like backgrounds, buttons,and styles to achieve a design that is seamless with your app.If you promote your in-app purchases on the App Store,you even have the option to use the App Store promotion imagein the product view in your app.This icon will appear alongside the in-app purchase in your app.If you offer in-app purchases or if you choose to offera paid app, you will need to consider how to set pricesand how they will translate to international markets.This spring, we upgraded our pricing capabilities,making it easier to manage the prices of apps,in-app purchases, and subscriptions.This update allows you to choose from 900 price pointsto give you flexibility on the pricing of your app;set a base region, which is the ability to chooseone region to automatically generate pricesacross other regions and currencies;manage international pricing, which allows the App Storeto adjust your prices as currencies or taxes changeor manage them manually on your own;and set the availability of in-app purchasesand subscriptions by region.To begin implementing StoreKit for SwiftUI,visit "Meet StoreKit for SwiftUI."To go in-depth on this year's pricing changesas well as the new pricing endpointsin the App Store Connect API,visit "What's new in App Store pricing."Next up, let's talk about ways to manage testers for your app.Once you have an idea of how to monetize your app,you'll start thinking about who your testers will beand how you'll test changes before releasing.TestFlight makes it easy to test your prerelease buildson iOS, watchOS, tvOS, macOS, and now xrOS.This year, we're making it easier to manage testers,builds, and test different use cases in your app.We want to help you get the right buildsto the right testers and ensure you can test scenariosthat users will encounter when you release on the App Store.TestFlight provides data about your testersto help you understand how engaged they are.This data includes a status, which tells whether a testerhas been invited, if they've accepted,or if they've installed a build,the number of sessions the tester has had,the number of crashes,and amount of TestFlight feedback they have provided.We're adding an additional column for deviceswhich will show the most recent device and OSon which the beta app was installed.We're also adding the ability to filter by tester datain order to view and manage segments of testers.You will be able to bulk select groups of testersin order to resend invitations, add to a group,or remove testers altogether.And all of this data will be availablethrough the App Store Connect API.Once you're able to easily manage your testers,you may want to put release controls in place to make sureyou're sending the right builds to the right people.When distributing a build from Xcode,you may have a build like a prototypethat you never want to go outside of your internal team.For this, we're adding a TestFlight Internal Onlyselection to the new distribution workflow in Xcode.When you make this selection, it will ensure that these buildscan't be released for External TestFlightand can't be submitted for App Store review.In App Store Connect, these builds will be clearly markedso you can easily see which builds can be distributed where.If you have a good group of testersand the right builds going to the right places,you also need to tell testers what you want them to check outin your app.Xcode Cloud will make this process even easierwith the ability to uploadTestFlight What to Test information alongside a build.To do this, you have a few options.You can add a plain text file to a TestFlight folderlocated in the same folder as your Xcode project or workspace.This file will itemize the thingsyou want testers to check out.Or you pull from commit messages with a custom build script.This information will be passed to App Store Connectand will be distributed to your testerswhen you're ready to start testing your build.Now that you've optimized your build and tester managementin TestFlight, let's talk aboutsome new features in sandbox testing.Family Sharing allows your customers to shareyour subscriptions and in-app purchaseswith their Family Group.To enable you to test this feature before you release,we are adding the ability to combine sandbox test accountsinto a Family Group.Just like Family Sharing in the App Store,you can group up to six test accounts into a family.You will be able to configure these accountsin App Store Connect.This year, we're adding the following sandboxon-device enhancements on iOS.View Family Group members and select to stop sharingan autorenewable subscription or nonconsumable with a family.Modify the renewal rate of a subscription.Test interrupted purchases, and clear purchase historyright on the test device.To expand on these testing topics,discover the new streamlined distribution in Xcode as well asnew support for notarization in Xcode Cloud in the session"Simplify distribution in Xcode and Xcode Cloud."Explore how to use StoreKit testing in Xcode,sandbox testing, and TestFlight in the session"Explore testing in-app purchases."After you have your app tested, you'll think abouthow to represent your app on the App Store.Let's cover some ways to build your store presence.Your product page is where you tell customersabout the features in your app.App Store Connect helps you configure your product page,get customers excited, and acquire customers.App Store privacy nutrition labelssummarize your data practices in a simple, easy-to-read labelso that customers can make an informed decisionwhen downloading your app.When answering app privacy questions in App Store Connect,you need to indicate in the data collection sectionthe types of data you collect from customers.With the introduction of xrOS,we are adding a few new data types.You should select Environment Scanningif you collect data on a user's surroundings,Hands if collect hand structure or movements,or Head if you collect head movement.For example, if your app teaches users how to play pianoand collects data on the movement of their handsin order to instruct them, you should selectthe Hands data type for data collection.These new data types will be especially relevantfor xrOS apps, but could apply on other platforms.For example, these would apply to youif you use ARKit on iOS and collect these types of data.These new data types will appear on the xrOS App Storeand all other platforms where your app is released.After you've inputted your answers to privacy questions,you can start thinking of when you'll release your appand how you'll present yourself to customers.Now let's talk about pre-orders.Releasing your app for pre-order can be a powerful wayto build awareness and excitementfor your upcoming app release.This year, we're giving you the flexibilityto use pre-orders on a regional basis.This means you can start by launching your appto a limited set of regions,often referred to as a soft launch,and also offer your app for pre-order in other regions.We're making this possible with a redesigned availability page,where you can manage your app's state across regions.You'll be able to launch your app and tune your designand functionality before using pre-order in new markets.Whether your app is available for pre-order or download,you might want to think about which metadata is rightto display on your product page.For this you can use product page optimization.Product page optimization gives you insightinto which product pages your users like best.This year, we're making a change so that testswill continue to run until you choose to stop them,and won't be affected by new versions.You will be able to view and monitor a currently running testwhile pushing updates to your app as needed.Keep in mind that a test is meant to compare treatmentsagainst your control, so any changes to a product pagewith a new version could impact the results of a running test.To continue building your store presence,here are some other sessions.To get your app ready for xrOSoutside of our new data collection options,visit "Explore App Store Connect for spatial computing."To go deeper on privacy, including our new featuresfor third party SDKs, visit "What's new in privacy."To better understand pre-order by region,including our redesigned availability tab,visit "What's new in App pre-order."Once you have your app in the hands of customers,you can explore how to automate with the App Store Connect API.The App Store Connect APIprovides options for customizing workflows,staying in sync with your internal systems,and automating processes to save time.Our API collections allow youto automate many areas of the App Store.This year, we launched in-app purchases and subscriptions,customer reviews and responses,and the ability to manage sandbox testers.We have some great releases coming this year,including support for Game Center.These APIs will make it easier and fasterto set up Game Center features and build consistent experiencesacross all platforms of your game.Let's go into detail about what these APIs entail.You can create, configure, and even archive leaderboardsand achievements just as you would in App Store Connect.Archiving is a new featureto remove leaderboards and achievements from your game.Submit scores and achievement unlock eventsvia a server-to-server API.This is great if you are a cross-platform gamethat manages data across many platforms.Remove scores and players from your leaderboardsto automate management of fraudulent activity.Last, match players using custom ruleslike skill level or region,an upgrade to our matchmaking capabilities.In addition to bringing Game Center to the API,we also have some updates to API authentication.This year, you can generatemarketing and customer service API keysif you'd like to limit keys to manage your marketing metadataor respond to App Store reviews.You can also create a user-based key,which is an API key that has the same permissions as you do,regardless of what role you have.You'll be able to do this from your user profilein App Store Connect.We covered a lot in this session,and these new features are just a subset of the developer toolsfor the App Store.Whether you're building an app for the first time,you're an experienced developer,you're building by yourself, or you're part of a team,App Store Connect can help you put the best version of your appon the App Store.To wrap up, I encourage you to try outsome of these new capabilities and tell us what you think.If you run into issues, you
