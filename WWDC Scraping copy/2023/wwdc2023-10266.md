"Does my app need to adopt environment constraints?"I want to emphasize that environment constraints are completely optional,but they can reduce the attack surface of any app.We’ll discuss some more specific example use cases later in this talk.I’ll note, though, that environment constraintsmay be particularly useful if your app has multiple processesor loads code signed by different developer teams.There are a few different types of environment constraints,so let’s talk about launch constraints first.Launch constraints are embedded into a specific binaryand define either properties of that process,properties of the processes that can be its parent,or properties of the processes that can be responsible for it.We’ll refer to these properties as "self constraints","parent process constraints", and "responsible process constraints".You can apply all three to your binary or pick the ones that make the most sense.A process with an embedded launch constraint will not runif any of the required properties are not satisfied.Now let's walk through some process relationshipsand talk about how you can use launch constraints to secure them.First assume that MyDemo.app is your app.You can set a self constraint on my MyDemo.appto require that it launch as an application from Launch Services.When your app requests a connection to your XPC service,launchd spawns the XPC service and is the parent of that XPC servicebut your app is "responsible" for that XPC service.You could set a responsible process constraint on MyXPCDemo.xpcto indicate that only MyDemo.app should be responsible for it.If your app later uses NSTask or posix_spawn to launch a helper,then it is both the parent of and responsible for that helper.You could set a parent process constraint on MyFirstHelperto require that only MyDemo.app can be its parent.Then if the first helper posix_spawns a second helper,the first helper is the parent of the second helper,but the app is responsible for the second helper.For MySecondHelper, you could set a parent process constraintto require that it only be launched by MyFirstHelperand you could set a responsible process constraintto require that only MyDemo.app be responsible for it.You can also specify an environment constraintin your launchd plists for launch agents and launch daemons.When you register your plist using the SMAppService API,the OS will enforce that only a process that meets the constraintwill be launched on behalf of your plist.This feature is useful to ensure that malicious codedoesn’t gain persistent execution based on user approvalof your app’s background activities.Finally, you can use library load constraintsto specifically control the code that can load in your address space.Before library load constraints,you could either adopt library validation or not.Library validation allows your process to load code that you signedor code that is signed by Apple.With library load constraints, you can describea less restrictive set of code than library validation would allowwhile preventing arbitrary code from being loaded into your process.Note, though, that you cannot exclude Apple-signed codefrom loading in your process and you need to specifyone or more properties to allow your own code.Now that you know what environment constraints areand how they can be used, let's discuss how they are defined.Environment constraints describe a set of conditions that code must meet.They are encoded as a dictionary where keys represent eitherfacts that must be true about the code or operators that indicatea required relationship between facts or predicates.At the top level, implicitly, the result of each key-value pairis ANDed together to decide whether the constraint is satisfied.Note that because these are dictionaries,each key can only appear once per dictionary level.Let's take a look at some facts you might want to use.On the left are the relevant environment constraint keysand on the right is output from the codesign command.The signing-identifier key allows you to specify a stringthat should be unique to a given piece of code,but which stays the same across versions of that code.The signing-identifier key refers to the identifier field in codesign output.The cdhash key allows you to specify a unique hashfor the code that should be allowed,and the team-identifier key allows you to specify codesigned by a specific development team.While facts indicate specific properties of code,operators can be used to logically combine sets of factsor to define sets of acceptable values for facts.As you might expect, the $and and $or operatorsallow you to specify dictionaries of predicatesthat will be logically combined after they are decided.The $and-array and $or-array operators exist to limit dictionary nestingin cases where you may want to AND multiple $or predicatesor OR multiple $and predicates.And finally, the $in operator allows you to specify an arrayof values that will satisfy a fact.Let's walk through this example constraint.On the left, we have a plist representation of the constraint.On the right is pseudo-code showing what the XML means.At the top level of the plist, there is one key, $or-array.The value is an array of three tuples.Each tuple contains an operator and a dictionaryto which that operator will be applied,so that means that this constraint allows all code signed by your team identifieror library B signed by the second team identifieror library C signed by the third team identifier.For the first tuple, since it is a single element,we could also have used the $or operator.Now that we can define constraints,let's look at how you can adopt them in your project.For the purpose of this discussion,consider a main app that contains a launch agent,a helper tool, a framework that includes an XPC service,and a library signed by another development team.Now let's consider some potential problems that environment constraints can mitigate.Perhaps you have assigned some privilege to a helper tool,like access to your keychain data or access to your iCloud container.You may want to ensure that the helper toolcan only be launched by your app and not anything else.You can ensure that only your app can launch your helper toolby setting a parent process constraint on the helper tool.To do this, create a code requirement plist filethat requires your team identifier and the signing identifier of your main app.Then add the constraint to your helper tool’s signing configurationin the "Launch Constraint Parent Process Plist" setting.Let’s take a closer look.Here I have a demo project in Xcode with the properties I mentioned.MyDemo.app is the Main app target and demohelper is a helper tool.Let’s launch the app.When I press this button, the app spawns the helper tool,then the helper tool does some work and provides a response to the app.Let's look at the signature of demohelper in Terminal.We can see that it has no launch constraints setand we can run demohelper.But look at that.If we run demohelper with the --cloud argument,then demohelper can access the app’s iCloud data.We don't want an arbitrary process to be able to run demohelperand alter our iCloud data.Let’s go back to Xcode and set a parent constraint on demohelper.Here I have a constraint plist file already populatedto identify the main app MyDemo.Let's add the constraint to our signing configuration.Now let’s rebuild the app.We can launch the app again...And the main app can still spawn the helper.But when we go back to Terminal...We can see that now demohelper has a launch constraint...and it can no longer be run from Terminal.When a launch is blocked because of a launch constraint violation,a crash report is generated showing that the constraint was violated.Now let's talk about a few more problems that environment constraints can mitigate.We encourage you to use XPC services to separate privilegesbetween different processes.But when you build XPC services, it is possible to extract those servicesfrom your bundle and call them from other code.If you have assigned some privilege to your XPC service,you need to ensure thatonly expected processes can gain access to that privilege.One way to ensure that only your code can access that XPC serviceis to set a responsible process launch constraint.Here we show a launch constraint plist that allows code signedby your team with a list of signing identifiers for each of the processesin the bundle that should be able to access the XPC service.You can add the constraint to your signing configurationin the "Launch Constraint Responsible Process Plist" setting.Another problem to consider.Starting in macOS Ventura, users are asked to approve background tasksinstalled on behalf of your app.This means that users expect that work to happen only on behalf of your app.If an attacker can replace the code that your plist expects to run,the attacker may gain persistent background executionon behalf of your app.To ensure that your registered plist can only be used to run the code you expect,you can set a launchd plist constraint using the SpawnConstraint key.Here you can see a complete launchd plist with a SpawnConstraint key.This constraint identifies our team and the DemoMenuBar agent.Finally, let's talk about library loading.If you are obligated to link a library from another development teamwithout modification, then to get your app notarizedwith hardened runtime, you'll have to adoptthe disable-library-validation entitlement.Unfortunately, that means your app can now load code signed by anyone,not just the trusted developer you got the library from.To address this problem, you can adopt a library load constraint.Here we show a constraint that will allow you to load any codesigned by your team or the trusted library supplier.You could also constrain this further to a specific libraryor set of libraries using one or more signing-identifier facts.As with launch constraints,library load constraints get signed in to your processwhen you set the "Library Load Constraint Plist" settingin your Xcode signing configuration.So where are environment constraints available?Library load constraints and launchd plist constraintscan be included in apps targeting any macOS version.They are enforced starting in macOS Sonoma.Launch constraints can be added to apps targeting macOS 13.3 or laterand they are enforced starting in macOS 13.3.Note the supported set of keys and values that can be usedin environment constraints may change across macOS versions.Refer to the documentation for complete availability information.Take a look at the process relationships, launchd plists, and libraries in your appto see if you can use environment constraints to make your app more secure.Thanks for watching.♪ ♪
