being on a FaceTime callwith their friends, watching a show,or listening to music together.In fact, these are the most popular typesof SharePlay experiences today.Many video streaming and music listening appssupport SharePlay, including Apple's own.Just press play,and you're in the activity together.But really, it's much more than that.SharePlay is all about any activity with any group.It can help bring groups to activities in appswithout needing to worry about accounts or servers.SharePlay can also be added to enhance shared experiencesalready offered by your apps today.With a small amount of work to adopt,you can bring an instant startwith the group that's already there.And we believe privacy to be a fundamental human right.The powerful data channeloptimized and secured for FaceTime powers SharePlay too.This means GroupActivities providesa fully end-to-end encrypted channelfor your app's data to pass through,and Apple cannot see any app data sent over SharePlay.Virtually every app offers opportunities for SharePlay.Any activity is better when you can share it with friends,and there, SharePlay can help.And with GroupActivities, the framework to adoptfor SharePlay, app teams small and largecan leverage everything they needto get the group together to the activityand to facilitate fast data transferbetween participants once in the activity.At its core, you bring the activity,and we'll bring the group.In this session, we'll cover some of the new products,technologies, and features coming to SharePlay.We'll tell you a bit about how they unlock new use cases,walk you through the benefitsof adopting SharePlay for your app,and offer advice on best practicesto get the most from SharePlay.Groups are often already togetherwhen they use SharePlay.And the activity started may not be the experiencethey stick with throughout their time together.One of the beauties of SharePlay is that it enables your appsto take advantage of the group that's already present.SharePlay has been especially impactful for me with my familyliving on the east coast of the United States.SharePlay helps me maintain a close connectionto my brother and parents.At first, we looked to connect those far awaythrough meaningful and fun experiences in your apps.This is why, when we first created SharePlay,we focused the experience of SharePlay in FaceTime calls.From there, we expanded SharePlayso that it could be used with or without a callwith SharePlay via Messages.But beyond far away, often the group is right therenext to you, in the same room.We're thrilled to bring SharePlay over AirDropin iOS 17, where bringing your devices togetherstarts a SharePlay, just like that.One of my favorite parts of AirDrop is how easy it isto find who you're trying to share with,since they're in the same room.Imagine even when you're next to somebody,jamming out on the subway with your friends,laughing at the funniest new memes,or finding your dream home with your partnerwithout having to look over one person's shoulder.No need to ask for their username or email to share.Just AirDrop and you're there, together.AirDrop joins FaceTime and Messagesas existing group contexts you can bring to SharePlay.And as the group moves, so does the SharePlay.If you start it nearby and move apart,you can keep the chat going in Messages.And hopping into a FaceTime call is just a tap away.And in tvOS 17, you can start your FaceTime callon the big screen.From there, getting the SharePlay goingis just an app away.As you'll hear a bit later in the talk,this is a great example of why we encourage youto bring SharePlay to your apps across the ecosystem,so that when the group movesthe experience can keep going without a hitch.Now, when defining your GroupActivity type,you provide metadata to inform the systemon how to best represent your activity.For this order together here,we specify an activity type of generic.This type, among other things,tells the system HUD which icon to use:Watching together,listening together,playing together through Game Center,or generic to indicate any other formof SharePlay experience you can imagine.In iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, and tvOS 17,we're adding some additional typesto help best classify activities:Workout, Shop, Read, Learn, and Create Together.We're excited to see how this helps illustrateyour exciting types of experiences,both now and to come.WWDC23 has some fantastic contentabout how to use SharePlay in new ways.To learn more about them,check out "Build spatial SharePlay experiences."Some apps may want to take advantage of SharePlay,but with content that not everyone has access tobefore the activity begins.For this, try the new SharePlay file transfer APIs,which you can learn about more in "Share files with SharePlay."By nature, SharePlay can mean something differentfrom app to app,depending on the experiences enabled.Let's dive into some cool use casesthat can be enhanced with SharePlay.Adding SharePlay to an education appcan help elevate static diagrams and text into interactive viewsthat stay in sync so students can engage together,no matter if they're far away or in the same classroom.Prep your meals for the weekto maximize your macros with your partnerand eat healthier together.Browse the latest feed to find the funniest new content.And if you combine everyone's interests,there will be something in there for everyone.Go shopping together.Figure out what furniture suits both your stylesbefore you move in with your new roommates.Coordinate a rideshare with friends.Browse the menu from your favorite takeout place togetherand easily order family style.Take a moment to pause and think about the potentialof SharePlay in your app.What group experiences have you thought aboutor are already offered in your app today?Phew!Lots of exciting use cases there.All this thinking's got me hungry.Priya Shah: Oh, hi, Justin, are you ordering lunch?Justin: Oh, hey, yeah, perfect timing!I was just about to order some tacosfrom that food truck down the street --they just adopted SharePlay.Priya: I love their tacos! Want to do a group order?Justin: Yeah, let's do it.Priya: Awesome! Could you add Gavin and Timirah tooso they can join our group order?Justin: Oh, yeah. Sure.Priya: I think I'm going to get the spicy tofu taco.Justin: I think I'm going to go with the chicken tinga taco.Priya: That sounds really good.Oh, Timirah just added some chips and guac.Justin: I can't wait.Priya: I'm so excited.Justin: I'll see you in a minute.Priya: See ya.Starting a group order with Justin who was right next to me,and our friends who are on their way,was quick and seamless with SharePlay.And now I know I have some tacos to look forward to.SharePlay is a powerful featurethat can take any activity in your appand make it available for people to enjoy in groupsfor a more engaging and interactive experience.By enabling real-time shared experiences like these,you can connect people in new waysand provide them with a more socialand collaborative experience.Adopting SharePlay brings a group directly into your app,either to a shared experience you've already createdor to elevate an experience by making it possibleto now share with groups.If your app is currently fullof rich experiences for individuals,adopting SharePlay is a quick way to allow peopleto experience your app with their friends and family.And if your app already supports group experiences,SharePlay can help make sharing seamlessby leveraging existing groups far and nearfrom FaceTime, Messages, and now, even AirDrop.SharePlay helps bring the group of friendsto your shared activity.Looks like Timirah just kicked off this week's social hourwith her favorite playlist.Anyone else in the group is also able to change the playlist.Once a group is in a SharePlay session,there is no need to reshare when switching activities.People can also completely change the activity typewithout having to reconfigure the group.So a viral hit might remind Justin of an activityin your app!And if your app supports SharePlay,he can seamlessly bring the entire group with himto check it out.And if anyone in the group doesn't already have your app,they are taken to the App Store to download itif they'd like to join the group.Once you've added the group activity capability to your app,new this year in iOS 17,tapping the Share button from an active FaceTime callpresents a new, redesigned menu cardshowcasing apps that support SharePlayand collaboration experiencesto make it even easier for peopleto step into your activity with friends.Adopting GroupActivities also provides your appwith all the necessary group-management UI elementslike a people picker, notifications,and state changes,so you can focus on building an engaging activity.Additionally, by adopting SharePlay,you also get the real-time, low-latency,and fully encrypted data channel for syncing your app's activity.In order to leverage all of these benefits,let's take a look at adopting SharePlay.First, we will import the GroupActivities frameworkand create an activitywhich follows the GroupActivity protocol.We will then define the activitywith an activity identifier unique to this app.Then we will add the activity metadatawhich specifies parts of the shared experiencethat are user facing --the title, the preview image, and the type.These details will show up in the UIso everyone knows exactly which activity they are joining.You might have multiple activities in the same app.So it's important to make sure the title and iconare not generic.The title is the name of the activity the group started,not the name of the app.And the optional subtitle lets you provideeven more detail about the activity.In this example, we've added the name of the taco truckthe order together activity is associated with.And the preview image is not the app's icon,but specific to the activity of ordering tacos together.Check out the SharePlay documentationon developer.apple.com to implement starting, joining,and ending SharePlay experiences for your app.And to learn how to use SharePlayto adapt to your use case with GroupSessionMessenger,check out the session"Build Custom Experiences with Group Activities."Once you have the basic adoption of SharePlay complete,let's consider some best practicesto make your app's SharePlay experience magical and seamless.To build a great experience,it is important to design for your specific use case.Think about the experience you are creatingas if you and your friends are sharing it togetherwithout any devices.How might you talk about a show together,order food together, or shop together?Take note of the parts of these experiencesthat make you feel connected to the peopleyou're sharing them with.Add elements to your app's designthat might help preserve that feeling of togetherness.We dive deep into this topic in the session"Make a Great SharePlay Experience."When getting your app set up for SharePlay,it's also important to consider the different platformsthat your app supports.SharePlay is now available on iOS, iPadOS, macOS,and tvOS to ensure that anyone on any devicecan join the experience you're building.With the addition of SharePlay through AirDrop,make sure to think about both types of SharePlay experiences,when people are apart and when they're close by.In order to make group activities in your appeven more discoverable,support the ability to SharePlay directly in your app's UIwith a SharePlay button.Additionally, don't forget to adopt NSItemProviderfor your group activity.This will allow people to start a session with their friendsfrom the ShareSheetand with friends nearby using AirDrop.Make sure that your metadata and state changesare descriptive and understandablein the context of someone using your app with their friends.This ensure everyone knows what's going onwith the activity.And finally, don't forget to test your experience.You will need two or more physical devicesfor testing the SharePlay functionality effectivelyto make sure everyone enjoying your activityhas the same incredible experience you had intended.Every app has an opportunity for SharePlaySharePlay gives you access to existing groups from FaceTime,Messages, and now, even AirDrop.It provides a performant and private data channelfor syncing your app's data,and takes care of group management UIlike people pickers, notifications,and state management.When creating your own SharePlay experience,keep best practices in mind.We cannot wait to seeall the incredible SharePlay experiences you build.Thank you for watching our session.♪
