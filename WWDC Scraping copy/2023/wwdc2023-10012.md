engineer on the TestFlight team.Justin: Together, we will show you how xrOS opens the doorfor you to create amazing spatial experiences.And with a new App Store on xrOS,users can discover and download your incredible apps.In this session, I'll start by walking throughall the different ways you can make your apps availableon xrOS.Then, Maciej will show you everything you need to knowabout beta testing on xrOS.Finally, I'll help you make sure that your app is readyto be published on the App Store.All right, so let's dive in with setting up your app.In App Store Connect, you have three options to choose fromwhen setting up your app.You can create a new app with the xrOS platform.This is the option to select if you're introducing a new appto the App Store for the first time,or if you want to configure your xrOS appto have a different price or availabilitythan your other apps.You can also add the xrOS platform to an existing appto create a universal purchase.This allows your users to enjoy your app and in-app purchasesacross all platforms.Your app will have the same name and URL across all platforms,making it easier for users to find it.Your app will automatically installfor users across their devices when they haveautomatic downloads enabled.And finally, you can choose to make your compatible iPadand iPhone apps available on xrOSwithout making any code changes or submitting a new build.This is a great option if you're still working on your xrOS app,but you want users on xrOS devices to enjoy your appas soon as possible.OK, let's look at each of these options in App Store Connect,starting with creating a new app.Let's say I'm a developer on the Nature Lab team,and I'm excited to create a fully immersive appfor my customers.I'm planning to introduce Backyard Birds to the App Store.Since Backyard Birds is a new app,I'll first need to create a new app record.I can do this by clicking the plus (+) buttonin the upper-left area of the Apps page,and then selecting New App from the drop-down menu.From the New App dialog,I'll select xrOS under Platforms,and then fill in the remaining fieldslike Name, Bundle ID, and SKU.That's it!I'll just need to click Create to complete the new app recordfor Backyard Birds, then I can begin uploading builds.Next, let's look at adding xrOS to an existing app.I'm back on the Apps page for my Nature Lab team.My customers love trackingtheir favorite mountain climbing routeswith Mountain Climber on iOS,so I decided to introduce a new experience on xrOS.To add the xrOS platform, I'll select my Mountain Climber app.And from here, I'll click Add Platformfrom the left sidebar.On the Add Platform dialog, I'll just need to select xrOS,then click Add.Once the platform is added,I can then begin uploading builds for Mountain Climber.And finally, all compatible iPad and iPhone appsare automatically made available on the App Store on xrOS.If there's any reason why you think your appdoesn't make sense on the platform,you can manage its availability on xrOS.Let's take a look.On the Apps page, click the ellipsis (…) buttonin the upper-left area,then select "iOS Apps on xrOS Availability"from the drop-down menu.From here, you have full control over managing which appsare made available on xrOS.If your compatible iPad and iPhone app is made availableby using this option and you later add the xrOS platform,releasing it will replace the iOS app versionon the App Store.For the Nature Lab team, I wanted to make surethat all of our compatible apps are made available,so I'll keep the default settings here.You can also manage an individual app's availabilityfrom the Pricing and Availability page.Under the iPhone and iPad Apps on xrOS section,you have the option to “Make this app available”.You can also verify if your currentand upcoming app versions are compatible with xrOS.To learn more about compatible iPad and iPhone appsand how to make sure your apps run properly,check out the sessions"Run your iPad and iPhone apps in the Shared Space" and"Enhance your iPad and iPhone apps for the Shared Space".So we just covered all the ways for setting up an xrOS appin App Store Connect.Next, you'll want to test your xrOS and compatible iPadand iPhone apps to ensure a solid user experience.And with that, I'll pass it over to Maciejto talk to you about TestFlight.Maciej: Thank you, Justin!TestFlight is an essential tool to help you distributeand install beta versions of your apps.You can create your teams of testers,define distribution rules, and incorporate feedbackto create best-in-class applications for the App Store.To manage your beta testing,go to the App Store Connect website.Check the TestFlight tab, where you can create groups,add testers, and distribute builds.You can also manage testers and groupsusing App Store Connect on iOS or the App Store Connect API.To get a general overview about how to run your beta program,check out our Tech Talk on how to get started with TestFlight.For more information on how to automate distributing buildsin continuous integration services,watch our previous session "Explore Xcode Cloud workflows."TestFlight is available for all existing operating systemsand provides a consistent experiencefor installing beta apps.Additionally, testers can send screenshots and crash feedbackon iOS and macOS.And today we are introducing support for xrOS.TestFlight on xrOS will help you test your immersive appsto make sure they offer the best possible experienceon the device and are ready for the App Store.It also lets you install and run iPad and iPhone appsto verify they are fully compatibleand work great on xrOS.In this section, I will walk you through the major use casesof TestFlight to help you distribute builds,install apps, and collect feedback.Let's start with distributing builds.Creating groups and inviting testersis a feature available for all platforms.It's no different for xrOS.You have an option to use internal or external groupsand invite testers by email or public link.In this example, the xrOS platform has been addedto an existing app record.You can create a new group of testersand start uploading builds there.You can also distribute xrOS buildsthrough any existing group.In this scenario, testers will have access to buildsfor multiple platforms.TestFlight gives you full control over which groupcan install iOS apps on xrOS.Each group has an option to enable or disablethe ability to install iPhone and iPad appsby testers from this group on the headset.This option can help you expand the team of testerswhile you progress with testing the compatibilityof your iOS apps.Now that you know how to distribute your builds,let me walk you through the processof installing and running beta apps on xrOS as a tester.After launching TestFlight,I can browse all the apps developers invited me to test.My list in the sidebar includes both xrOS and iOS appsthat can be installed and tested on my device.Applications not compatible to installare listed in a separate category of iOS-only apps.When a developer invites me to testboth the xrOS and iOS version,TestFlight allows me to switch between each type of the app.Toggle at the top of the app page allows me to choosewhich version I would like to install and test.From this page, I can check the details of each app,review the description,confirm whether the app is compatible with my device.Additionally, I can scroll down the list to App Settingsand customize notifications or opt in for automatic updates,in which case all new versions of the app are downloadedand installed automatically by TestFlight on my device.Once the beta app is installed,I can launch it directly from TestFlightor from the Home Screen.All beta apps are distinguished by a yellow dotdisplayed next to the app name, like on other platforms.Compatible iPad and iPhone appsare grouped together in a dedicated folder,where the yellow dot is also presented for beta versions.When I launch the updated app,TestFlight displays information provided by the developerto describe changes in the latest build.This is a good opportunity for the developer to recommendwhich areas I should focus on while testing the app.Now, let's talk about how you can get feedback from testersabout their experience with your apps on xrOS.Testers can send feedback when they notice issueswithin your app or if they want to suggest some improvements.As a tester, If I want to share feedback with the developerabout my experience on xrOS,I can quickly press the Digital Crownand top buttons together to capture screenshots.Next, I open TestFlight, select the app,and touch the Send Feedback button to initiate the process.I start with describing the problem.I attach all the screenshots I have capturedto support the feedback.I can crop or annotate images to focus the feedbackon the relevant part of the screenshotor to hide any sensitive information.Another situation where I can provide feedbackis when the beta app crashes.In this case, TestFlight asks meif I want to send more informationto help debug the issue.I can describe what steps caused the crash,and the information will be submittedalong with the crash log captured on the device.So far, I have presented how testers can leverage TestFlighton xrOS to install, run beta apps,and share feedback.Now let's take a look how App Store Connect and Xcodecan help you analyze the data and track tester engagement.You can review all submitted feedback in App Store Connectand Xcode Organizer,with filters to view by platform or a build.You can check the details of each feedback,review screenshots, download crash logs,or open the feedback directly in Xcode Organizer.App Store Connect web and mobile also provide informationabout how many testers installed and launcheda specific version of your app,or how many of them submitted crash or screenshot feedback.This is an excellent tool to track tester engagement.You can analyze the statistics for a specific buildor look over a specific groupto see the engagement of each tester.So that's a quick look at how TestFlight can help you buildhigh-quality apps and offer a great user experienceon the xrOS device.Now I will hand back to Justin to tell you moreabout getting your apps ready for the App Store.Justin: Thanks, Maciej.With beta testing wrapped up,let's jump back to App Store Connectand put the finishing touches on your app.You're able to manage your xrOS apps using the featuresyou've come to expect from App Store Connect,from in-app purchases, to screenshots, to app analytics.Let's take a closer look at a feature we've updatedfor spatial computing, Privacy Nutrition Labels.With the release of xrOS,we added a few new data types that your app may collect.These new data types are relevant for xrOS apps,but they can also be applied to other platforms.In the App Privacy section, check “Environment Scanning”if your app collects data about the user's surroundings,such as mesh, planes, scene classification,or image detection of the user's surrounding.Under the “Body” section,check “Hands” if your app collects dataabout the user's hand structure and hand movements,and “Head” if your app collects dataabout the user's head movement.Once your app is published on the App Store,customers can learn from your app's product pageabout the data types that your app collectsand how they are used.We covered a lot today, from setting up,to beta testing, to updating your app's privacy details.Before I let you go, let me give you a quick wrap-upfor what you'll need to do next.First, decide how you want to get your app on xrOS.Are you going to create a new app,add the xrOS platform to an existing app,or choose to make your
