Apple.Creating experiences in three dimensions makes useof unique modalities such as depth and full field of view.We will introduce you to how a person may experiencethis new level of immersion through visual cuesand motion information from 3D content,and where human limitations may interferewith comfort of people experiencing your apps.Manda: Our guidelines are to help you create experiencesthat are comfortable and enjoyable.We'll talk through visual depth cues,content parameters,eye effort,motion of virtual objects,head-locked content,motion in windows,and oscillating motion.To begin, it's important that your contentprovides correct visual depth cues to the viewer.This matters because well-designed 3D contentenables the brain to perceive depth.First, a bit of science.We have multiple sensory systemswith which we experience the realand virtual world.At the very high level, the visual system is responsiblefor taking in light from the content you createand interpreting it into what is perceived.That is to say, your design decisionshave a significant impact on vision comfort for your viewers.Agreement between the depth intended by youand the depth perceived by the vieweris necessary for vision comfort.As an image moves in depth,the brain enlists the eye muscles to convergethe line of sight and fixate the eyes at the image depth.This enables a single image to be perceived.To converge the eyes correctly,the brain needs correct visual depth cues.Vision comfort might be affected when depth cues are missing,conflicting, or misleading.The viewer might experience discomfortssuch as double vision or eye fatigue.Let's see how we can use image cues to maintain vision comfort.When working with scenes that are very sparse,as in this image of a citrus, many visual cues are missingthat might have conveyed depth information.The brain might be unable to reconcile what depthto converge the eyes to, hence causing discomfort.Seeing the color of the citrus enables the familiar size cue.If the slice looks green, the brain uses the prior knowledgeof the size of a lime to inform what depththis slice might be floating atand converges the eyes at that correct depth.Using blur is another way to convey depth information.Relative size can also be usedto add depth cues to a sparse image.The larger of the two slices from the limeis perceived to be closer to the viewer.Gentle motion can also provide a referencefor what depth the line of sight should point to.My colleague Herman, will elaborate on the nuancesof using motion in your content.For now, let's add just a few more cues to direct the eyes.An added background, light and shadow, occlusion,and texture density are some more methodsto add in the missing visual depth cues.Conflicting cues are also troublesome.As mentioned, the bottom slice appears closersince it looks larger.We expect it to be in frontand occlude the smaller looking slice.However here, relative size cue conflicts with occlusion cue,telling the brain the opposite of what we expect.The conflict between the depth cuesmight lead to vision discomfort.Conflicting cues are not unique to sparse scenes.The more conflict there is,the more challenging for vision comfort.So, ensure all of the depth cues from your contentgive the brain correct informationso to align the viewer's eyes to the depth you intended.One more thought about depth is correcting the visual cuesthat are misleading, such as repeating patterns.Here, both eyes are pointed to the same objectin the repeating pattern.That's great!However here, each eye locks onto a different objectfrom the repeating patternand when the brain tries to combine the imagesfrom each eye into one,it's perceived at a different depththan the repeating pattern is intended to be.To mitigate this conflict and to avoid double vision,use smaller portions of the patternor break up the pattern with another design.A final note about depth perception.The 3D content, along with your visual depth cueswill automatically be rendered on each displayper eye appropriately to enable someone to seethe depth you intended.If you choose to manually render stereo contentfor stereo video, for example,it is extremely important to not only have correct depth cuesbut also have correct disparity for each eyeso to avoid extremely conflicting visual cueswhich could lead to severe vision discomfort.All right!Let's move on to content parameterssuch as size and contrast.Visually comfortable content have parameters suitedfor each specific visual experience.Choose parameters that reduce visual effort.Here are some scenarios.Content requiring fixating the eyes for an extended time,such as for reading, is most visually comfortablewhen placed farther than arm's-length distance.In addition, enable a person to adjust content depthso they may choose a depth that's most comfortable for themin the experience.Reserve content closest to the viewerfor experiences demanding only momentary visual effortor for experiences inviting direct interactionwhich occurs when someone's hand actually intersects an itemin 3D space.Otherwise, you may use visual cues,such as transparency or blur, to redirect eyesto a farther depth to increase visual comfort.Similar to depth, content size and contrastshould match the particular visual experienceyou are designing to allow for vision comfort.For example, utilize higher contrast for reading textand lower contrast, transparency, or blurto redirect visual attention elsewhere.Choose text size and window size and depthfor extended reading such that text is legiblewith comfortable eye scanning,without the need to rotate the head or body.One more parameter to be mindful of is content brightness.When a large portion of the field of view is darkas in this image, slow down the transitionto a bright scene to give time to the eyefor brightness adaptation and ensure vision comfort.One last thing to be mindful of for vision comfortis the effort required from the eyes.For a more comfortable visual experience,minimize eye effort demanded from your viewers.Here is how.When choosing content location, keep in mindit's most comfortable for people to turn their eyes downwardsor left and right.So choose those positions for your content when possible.Upward and diagonal eye rotation requires most eye-muscle effort.Holding the eyes at those positions can be fatiguing.Content requiring extended readingor elongated target fixations should be placedtowards the center and slightly below line of sightto provide a comfortable visual experience.If extreme eye-rotation angles are necessaryfor your experience, design for brief interactions,or else move them to the center of field of viewto reduce eye-rotation effort.It is also important to consider that a person might preferto take a break to rest their eyes.To enable this,design for natural break points in your experienceto allow for the person's eyes to rest.That's it for vision comfort!Next, my colleague Herman will walk you throughhow to design apps for motion comfort.Herman: Thanks, Manda!Next, we are going to have a lookat how the motion information from contentin your immersive apps can affect a person's experienceand where human limitations may interfere with comfort.Let's start with digging a little further into the science.We, human beings, use multiple sensory systemsto experience the real and virtual world.We already saw that the visual system is responsiblefor taking in light and interpreting what is perceived.Part of that perception is your own motion.The vestibular system in your inner earalso measures your own movements.Normally, the visual motion informationand the motion that you perceive with your vestibular systemare always in agreement.But when the visual motion information is missingor conflicting with the vestibular information,you can experience motion discomfort,such as dizziness or an upset stomach.Well-designed content enables the brainto perceive the world as stationary.This provides a sense of stabilityand is necessary for motion comfort.Let's go over some scenarios with motionand see how we can maintain motion comfort.The first scenario deals with motion of virtual objects.When one or more virtual objects,like these blue polyhedrons here,cover a large part of the field of viewand move,the viewer's brain might interpret the visual motionof the objects as if the viewer themself is moving.This upsets the sense of stabilityand can cause motion discomfort.As a designer, you can mitigate thisby making objects semitransparent when they move,so the passthrough content is clearly visibleduring the motion.Whenever possible, avoid using head-locked content.That is content that is anchored to the user's head.Head-locked content will be, always, in the same positionin the field of view.If head-locked views are necessary,use a smaller window sizeplaced near the center of the line of sightand farther away from the viewer.Whenever possible, use world-locked viewsto prevent content from feeling stuck.Another alternative is to use a lazy-follow animation.This moves content slowly towards a destination over time.You also want to be mindful of the motion of the contentthat will be visible in a virtual window.When the content in a window, such as this virtual landscape,moves......the viewer's brain might interpret the visual motionas if the viewer themself is moving.To provide optimal motion comfort,you want to be mindful about camera motions.For starters, keep the horizon of the content in the windowaligned with the real horizon.The point where all the pixels appear to be coming fromis called the focus of expansion.That's where you're going,and people have a natural tendency to look at that point.You want to move the camera in such a waythat the motion of the focus of expansionis slow and predictable,and you want to keep the focus of expansionwithin the field of view.That means that you want to avoid fast turnsor pure rotational motion.The focus of expansion shiftsout of the field of view in those cases.As an alternative to fast rotations,you can use instantaneous directional changesduring a quick fade-out.To optimize for motion comfort, you also want to avoidthat large objects shoot by at close range,as seen here on the right.Best keep objects small and at a larger distance,as on the left.And if possible, use plain textureswith low luminance contrast,which makes the motion less perceivable by your eyes.The last type of motion scenario to be mindful ofdeals with sustained oscillations of objectsand animations.To ensure a comfortable experience,try to avoid oscillations in general,and in particular those with frequencies around 0.2 Hz.That is one oscillation per 5 seconds.And if you really cannot avoid showing oscillating motions,try to keep the amplitude of the motion lowand make the content semitransparent.This makes the motion much less perceivable by your eyes,as seen on the left.And it's always a good ideato provide an oscillation-free alternativethrough the Reduce Motion accessibility setting.To wrap it up, here's a summary of the things to keep in mindwhen designing for motion comfort.Try to provide a sense of stability,avoid head-locked content,be gentle with camera motion,and avoid oscillations if you can.To learn more about principles of spatial designand see many of our vision and motion guidelines in action,I can recommend visiting the sessions listed here.Manda: That's it for us.We can't wait to see what amazing experiencesyou will create!Herman: Thank you for watching!♪
