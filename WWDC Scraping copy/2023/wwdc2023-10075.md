Jay Moon: And I'm Jay.Carnaven: We're from Apple's Design team.We are excited to talk to you about how you can designgreat SharePlay experiences for spatial computing.In a SharePlay session,Spatial Personas let you feel present with othersin a way technology has never enabled before.You can look your friends in the eye,express yourself naturally with movement and body language,and best of all, enjoy a shared activity togetherusing your app.These shared activities are a key partof what makes this an exciting new computing platformand people will expect your app to fully supportthe features I'm going to talk about today.Shared activities in FaceTimebuild on the existing foundation of SharePlay,which is already a great way for groups of peopleto enjoy content together while apart.This includes simple UI patternsfor understanding what everyone is doing,shared control of the content, and independent controlfor how the experience appears on your own device.Shared context,available in SharePlay sessions with Spatial Personas,allows for an even more immersive SharePlay experience.Picture yourself sitting in a living roomin front of a TV with friends.If someone is to your right, you are to their left.Everyone is free to move around the room,and anyone can control the TV.It's always clear who is controlling the TVbecause everyone is seeing the same thing as everyone else.This is what we mean by shared context.Shared context also allows us to communicate effortlessly.For example, you can see Jayis not paying attention to the movie.He's clearly distracted by his phone.He can point at thingsor use gestures to better communicate.He can communicate his emotions, thoughts, and intentions,using his facial expressions.You can even tell by his body language and actionswhether he's calm and relaxed or stressed and anxious.Maintaining a shared context in FaceTime with Spatial Personasallows us to communicatemore the way we have become accustomed to in the real world.In this presentation, we're going to coverhow to set up the shared scene for your activity,key considerations when startingSharePlay experiences with Spatial Personas,how to pick the seating arrangementthat suits your shared activity,interactions in shared context and the role of UI,and how to present shared contentwhen your app is in a Full Space.Setting up a SharePlay activity with Spatial Personasstarts with understanding the type of experienceyou are trying to recreate.Each type of experience requires its own considerationsfor content placement and interactivity.Enjoying media together might look different fromcollaborating on a presentation together,which might be different, again,from an engaging game that deepens social connections.Your app can share up to one windowand one immersive space at a time through SharePlay.Once you choose the type of contentyour shared activity will be built around,you need to think about how to organize and present itin the most socially desirable way.Consider the followingwhen deciding what form your experience will take.If you are presenting your content in a window,you can think of your window as being like a communal deviceor tool like a TV, a speaker, a whiteboard, or a table.People can interact with your windowed appin their surroundingsor even pull up environments like the Moon.When creating SharePlay activities in a Full Space,you can create a more immersive experience,but people won't be able to interact with their other appsat the same time.You can think of these experienceslike a dedicated room --this degree of control and focusis useful for content like games and media experiences.And keep in mind, on this platform,people can easily have many windows open.In SharePlay, every window is marked clearly by the systemwith "shared" or "not shared."Putting your activity in a windowis a great way to support multitasking and collaborationand doesn't require people to leave their surroundings.Using a windowed shared activity enables workflowslike dragging and dropping items into your activity.You could even have more than one window from your own app,enabling for example, dragging and dropping songsfrom a private music library to a public player window.Next, let's talk about how someonewould join your shared activity.As on other platforms,you can include entry points to SharePlay within your UI.For example, in the TV app,any Play button can be used to start a shared activity.The platform makes it easy to start or stop a shared activityfrom the top of any window.People can share any window with no additional effortfrom your app, similar to macOS.But for richer, more volumetric visuals or group interactivity,you will want to adopt SharePlay.When possible, don't launch any extra windowsunrelated to the shared activity.If your app requires an account,consider making shared activities work without them.Minimize the amount of setup involved in joining.If your shared activity does need additional stepsto get started, start the activityfor people who have the right permissionsand present a placeholder window to those who don't.This signals what the rest of the group is doing.The window should allow the person to open anything neededto resolve any issues.As soon as the person has metthe minimal requirements to participate,close any extra windowsand reveal the activity to the participant,exactly where the placeholder was the whole time.When someone begins a shared activity in FaceTime,everyone already on the call automatically joins,which adjusts where everyone is seatedand makes your app visible for everyone.Where your app is positioned, where people sit around it,and where a new person shows up when they joinare all defined by one of three seating arrangementsthat the platform offers and your app can choose from.We call these Spatial Persona Templates.For scenarios where it's important for everyoneto have a good view of your app's content,choose a side-by-side templatewhere people sit shoulder to shoulder.For an activity that resembles a tabletop experience,choose the Surround template, where your app's contentis placed in the middle of a circle of people.People can converse over your app while looking at its contentfrom their own unique perspective.And for scenarios where your app is ambientor doing something in the backgroundand conversation is front and center,choose a Conversational template.Not everyone gets a good angle of your app's content,so make sure if you choose this,your activity doesn't rely on everyonegetting to interact with it.Your app can create a SharePlay experiencethat supports up to four other Spatial Personas.Your app is responsible for scaling what it presentsto any number of participants ranging from two to five.For example, if you choose a Surround template,you should design your content around the factthat there might be up to five seats around the table.And of course, life isn't just about workor content consumption.You can just hang out in a relaxing placewith friends and family and enjoy quality time together.You should also choose the surround templatewhen there's nothing to present in the middle of the group.Next, my colleague Jay will take you throughhow your content and user interface should adaptwhen you bring people into a SharePlay experience.Jay: Thanks, Carnaven.Conveniently for you, the platformtakes on the responsibility of making your app,your participants, and their spacesshare a common coordinate system and frame of referencethat we call "shared context."This means you don't need to managethe synchronization of the size, position,and orientation of your scenes.While we maintain the illusionthat everyone is looking at the same app,your app is actually running separately on multiple devices,and each instance could display audio,visuals, and UI differently.Your app manages the interactions, feedback,and choice of content displayed on each deviceto make everyone feel likethey're looking at the same thing.Your app needs to synchronize everyone's view of content,showing animations and any state changes in lockstep.This is key to making gestures like pointingmake sense to everyone on the call.It's possible that your shared activity might workboth as a window and as a more immersive experience.You should encourage everyone to be in the same modeby having everyone follow the first person to transition.Spatial Audio is a great tool for addingmore shared spatial context to your app.When everyone is in the same environment,everyone shares the same audio contextso the group can hear the gentle lapping of a lakecoming from the same direction.A shared music player window will sound as if it's a speakerpositioned in the space with you.In your app, you, too, can make sound come from your app windowor as part of a more immersive soundstagethat everyone can navigate together.Once you've established shared context,we can actually get away with less UI.If you're used to SharePlay on iOS,you might be familiar with how the system communicateswhen someone has done somethingthat affects everyone's experience.We do this to simulate a sense of presence while apartand to understand why something might have changedwithout your intervention.Remember that we can perceive more of each other's actionsnaturally in FaceTime on this platform,especially when they involve large physical motion,and we have the ability to verbally resolvesmall moments of confusion.You can lean on in-person communicationto close any knowledge gaps, so you don't need much UI,if any, to communicate why something has changed.SharePlay activitiesfeel most like their real-life counterparts when peoplefeel free to interact with everything they see.Avoid the temptation to create complicated permissions systemsor turn-taking mechanismsif they aren't a natural part of your experience.Consider instead being very permissive with interactions,and impose a consistent and predictable wayto resolve conflicts.You can lean on the group settling on normsthat arise from bumping up against these rules.While it's important to share as much contextacross devices as possible,look for opportunities for softwareto improve on the physical limitationsof real-world social experiences,especially when it comes to comfort and accessibility.For example, some people have different volume preferences,or different abilities to parse language.So in TV, I can set my own volume levelwithout affecting someone else's.And people who have trouble hearing dialoguecan still enjoy a show at the same timeas someone who'd rather not see subtitles.Throughout these personalizations,the same content will still be played back at the same time,so no one is missing context.Collaborative work can take on a different form on this device.By necessity, we're all used to sitting at different deviceseven when we're working on the same thing.We look at our own view of contentand edit one area of a document while a coworker edits another,often leaving notes along the way to call out changes.On this platform,collaboration experiences can be more livelywith a shared view that everyone works on.This also allows you to guide the group's attentionwith gestures.In real life, we can use different toolsat the same time.So while people may be looking at what feels likethe same app window, it's important to allow peopleto be in different editing modes.This means the tool each person has activeshould also be personalized,so just because you're marking in reddoesn't mean someone else is stuck doing the same.As always, keep the main viewport --the shared context -- the same for all participants.If individuals want to separately dive inon another part of the document,you could always allow each personto open a personal window,as if they brought their own iPad to the meeting.Opening multiple windows can allow individualsto focus on their own edits while still keepingthe shared context open for everyone else.Finally, we'll discuss when it's appropriatefor a participant to leave a shared contextand enter a Full Space on their own.There's a ton of content designed for this mediumwhere there's only one ideal viewing position.In these cases, it may be appropriateto separate people into different contexts.For example, the magical spatial capturesyou can photograph in Head Set can be shared as a windowside by side with everyone else's Spatial Personas.But to get the full effect of the capture,you can enter a Full Space.This Full Space view is best seen head-on,so we don't allow side-by-side viewingand hide other people's Spatial Personas.Think of these moments as if each personhas temporarily entered their own room.Similarly, panoramas, 180-, and 360-degree videosare designed to curve around a single point of view,so Spatial Personas should also not be visiblewhen you enter this mode.You should make sure context remains sharedby continuing to synchronize everyone's positionin the video.Another good reason to leave a shared contextis for individual safety.Someone may want to step out of an immersive experiencetemporarily.People can always press the Digital Crownto return to passthrough.When this happens, find a way to continuerepresenting the shared context in a windowand make it easy for the participantto rejoin shared context once they're done.When done right, even when someone has to dip out,they should never feel lostabout where the rest of the group is.In summary, design how your activity begins for everyone.While the system provides a stable coordinate systemfor all participants, your app is also responsiblefor sharing as much context as possible.Depending on how complex your app interactions are,personalized control can be necessaryfor comfort and accessibility.In-person nonverbal cuescan take the place of state-change notificationsin your UI.And designing a great shared spatial experienceoften comes down to knowingwhen and how to diverge from shared context.Apps on this platform really shinewhen they can be enjoyed with others.We encourage you to build your appwith these social experiences in mind.Carnaven: Thanks for watching.♪
