you about all of the capabilitiesof Quick Look on xrOS and how you can use itto unlock new experiences for your apps and websiteson the platform.Before we get into all of that,let's first go over what Quick Look is.Quick Look is a system framework that allows youto easily preview and edit files on iOS, macOS, and now xrOS.Quick Look comes with powerful editing featureslike trimming for videos and Markupfor PDFs and images right out of the box.It also handles the secure and safe access of files,so you don't have to worry about opening upuntrusted files in your app.Quick Look shows up in many places across Apple's platforms.On iOS, you see it whenever you open an attachmentfrom a message thread.On macOS, you enter Quick Look whenever you hit the Space baron a selected file from Finder or desktop.Quick Look is the system viewer for file-backed content on xrOS.And just like on iOS and macOS, xrOS apps can leverageQuick Look to easily gain feature-rich file viewingand editing.Let's see what that looks like.Recently, I've been working on remodeling an apartment,and I've been using an app to track the progressof that project and collaborate with my team.One of the interior designers I'm working withjust sent me a folder with some ideas he has for the house.I have that folder opened up hereso let's see what he came up with.It looks like there's a USDZ modelof the proposed living room.Let's open it up.To do this, I'll pinch and drag the file outand drop it outside of any application.Dropping the USDZ file presents a 3D Quick Look previewright where I dropped it.And I can immediately start to interact with it.Using a pinch and drag gesture, I can rotate the modelto get a better look at the beautiful exposed brick facade.To take a closer look at the living room,I'll just zoom into the model to scale it up.It looks like my designer also sent a pictureof the neighborhood surrounding the home.Finally, it looks like there's a document herewith a list of the features planned for the home.A lot of these look great but I'm not sureabout this last one,so let me leave a note to get back to it later.I'll open up the menu at the top of the windowand select Markup,which brings up the Markup palette.Let me quickly circle the item I want to get back to.We were able to drag a file from an applicationand preview it outside of that app.We did this with multiple files and viewed them allalongside the source application.This new way to present files in Quick Lookis called Windowed Quick Look.In this session, we'll learn moreabout this presentation styleand how apps and websites can adopt it.Then we'll go over how to present Quick Look previewsdirectly within an application.But first, let's take a deeper dive into Windowed Quick Look.Windowed Quick Look allows you to present Quick Look previewsoutside of your application.This is perfect for nonblocking experienceswhere you want to be able to view your file contentalongside your app.Since windowed Quick Look previewsare hosted in a separate app, you can close your applicationwhile still having those previews persist.Windowed Quick Look also offers a much richer viewing experiencefor 3D models backed by USDZ and Reality files.You can scale and place 3D content independentof your application.You can also scale the 3D modelwhich will dim the environment and hide all other scenes,allowing you to focus on just the 3D content.Certain file types presented in Quick Look windowsoffer SharePlay experiencesso you can share a file and view it over FaceTime.When sharing 3D content over SharePlay,Quick Look will sync the 3D model's orientation,scale, and animations.When sharing images over SharePlay,you'll be able to mark up that image together with others.SharePlaying files with Quick Look offers youan easy and simple way to collaborate on fileswith a group.Both applications and websites can present contentin Quick Look windows and take advantage of the many benefitsit has to offer.First, let's take a look at how appscan present Windowed Quick Look.Apps can present files in Quick Look windowsby providing a drag source containing some URL.During a drag-and-drop interaction,when a drop target is outside of any app,the system will copy and present your provided URLin a Quick Look window.If your provided URL is pointing to a filehosted in a remote destination, like iCloud,the system will download it first.Keep in mind, that because a copyof your provided file is presented,any edits such as markups on an image made to the presented filewill not be written back to the URL you provide.To see this in action, let's go to Xcode.Before we add drag support to our app,let me quickly give you an overview of the app.The app lets you see the progress of the projectand view a list of the files shared by other team members.Here we have a list view which displays FileViews.Since we want to be able to drag out each file,we'll need to turn each FileView into a drag source.To do this, I'll add the onDrag modifier onto the FileView.The onDrag modifier expects an NSItemProvider,so I'll return an item provider containing the URLfor the file being displayed in that FileView.Building and running the app in the simulator,I can now drag out from the file viewand present that file in a new Quick Look window.I can also close out my appand still have that file's preview displayed.By adding just a few lines of code,I've enabled drag and drop within my appand allowed content to be viewed in a separate windowletting me still use my app freely.Now let's see how we can do this for websites.Since iOS 12, websites have been able to link to and view3D content in AR Quick Look on iPhone and iPadby marking up links with the AR attribute.When you open a link to marked-up 3D content on xrOS,Safari will present the 3D contentin a new Quick Look window.Websites already supporting AR content linking on iOSand iPadOS will have this behavior carry overto xrOS with no additional work needed.xrOS will also respect customization optionssuch as disabling content scaling.For more information on those customization options,see the "Advances in AR Quick Look" sessionfrom WWDC19.If you haven't setup your websiteto present 3D content from Safari,all you have to do is mark up your links like this.By adding rel="ar" to your link or anchor element,Safari won't navigate on tap.Instead, it will present that 3D filein a Quick Look window alongside the website.Let's go over to Safari and check this out.We have the AR Quick Look gallery pageopen in Safari here.There are a bunch of 3D models linked to from this pageso let's open some of them up.Tapping on a link to this teapot,downloads and presents that 3D model in a Quick Look window.Once it downloads, the model will appear.Tapping on the link to this mug presents it near the teapotand Safari.This is really great for e-commerce siteswhere you might want to view and place productsin shared space to get a sense if it's right for you.We just went over presenting filesin a Quick Look window to preview it outside your app.There are some use cases where you may want to preview filesdirectly inside of your app.Displaying in-app Quick Look content is as simpleas passing in some URLs to the quickLookPreview functionin SwiftUI.When presented using quickLookPreview,the preview will display as a sheeton top of your view's content.If you want more customization optionsover your presented previews, you can usea QLPreviewController here instead.If you're bringing your iOS app to xrOS,existing uses of quickLookPreviewor QLPreviewController API will carry over for free.Let's hop over to the simulator and seewhere we could take advantage of this in our Project Tracker app.I have a view where I can review some new designs my team hasbefore sending them off to the homeowner for approval.I can currently see a list of files,but I can't actually preview any of the files.Let's go to Xcode and see if we can fix this.This is my view right now.To preview the files directly in my application,first I'll import QuickLook.Then I'll add the SwiftUI quickLookPreview functionpassing all of the files I want to previewand the specific file I want initially selected.Let's run this and see what we get.Going back to our app, now when I select this view,I can see a sheet with our previewsappear directly within our app.I can cycle through the files using the navigation controlsin the toolbar and make sure everything is finebefore sending them over to the homeowner.Presenting file previews directly within our appwas as easy as passing in some URLsto the quickLookPreview function.Now that we've covered both flavors of Quick Lookon the platform,let's touch on the file types with supported previews.Quick Look supports the most common file typesincluding images, videos, PDFs, and USDZ files.Spatial images and videos shown in Quick Lookwill look just as stunning as they do in Photos.And that's a quick look at Quick Look on xrOS.Now let's recap all we went over today.We talked about the rich preview and editing featuresthat Quick Look can provide apps.We then discussed Windowed Quick Look,a new way for apps to preview content using Quick Look,and the capabilities that Windowed Quick Lookhas to offer, such as multipreview supportso you can view content alongside your application,volumetric immersive 3D content viewing,and SharePlay support.We then went over how applications can streamlinetheir workflows and take advantage of Quick Look windowsby adding support for drag and drop,and how websites can leverage Quick Look windowsto present 3D content alongside Safari as well.We also saw how simple it was for apps to presentQuick Look content within their own scenes in SwiftUI.If you're bringing an app that already uses Quick Look,you'll have to do little to no workto get a great Quick Look experience on this platform.Similarly, websites already linking to AR contentwill have that behavior carry over for free as well.Quick Look can provide apps with simple, powerful,and secure file-viewing experiences,and we can't wait to see what you build using Quick Lookon xrOS.♪
