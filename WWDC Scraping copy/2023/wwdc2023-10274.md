experiences.Before we get into that,let's first go over what Quick Look isand how you can use it to present 3D contenton our new platform.In another session,"Discover Quick Look for spatial computing,"we have shown you this lovely 3D model of a roomthat we have created using our new Room Plan API.We brought this model into Quick Lookby just dragging a USDZ file out from our application window,which opens up a Quick Look previewright where we dropped it.From here, you can start to interact with Quick Lookand my content by using familiar gestures.Before we dive deeper into the story behind this model,let's talk a bit more about how the system presents 3D contentin Quick Look.On this platform, Quick Look displays a 3D modelin a volume window.Volume windows have defined boundsto allow sharing them alongside with other apps.People can reposition volumes in spaceand they can view it from different angles.3D models are always placed at the center of the volume.When the model first appears,Quick Look will orient the volume windowso that the content is directly facing you.From here, you can use the volume window barbelow the 3D model to reposition content freely in your space.Quick Look will automatically adjust the size of the volumebased on how people scale the modelwhen they are in a preview session.It's important to notethat if your content is using animations,we suggest keeping all animationsto be inside the defined bounds of the Quick Look volume.We just covered the basicsof how Quick Look presents your 3D content.There are additional considerationswhen it comes to how Quick Look is using model size and scale.Let's take a look.When loading the 3D model,Quick Look will respect the metersPerUnitdefined in the USDZ's metadatato determine the scale unit with respect to the real world.In order to help people visualizethe scale of the assets,Quick Look will try to present the model initiallyat a 100 percent scaleif it is authored to be within a certain size range.Let's see an example.Quick Look imposes a minimum scaleto ensure that you can enjoy all content,even when it came at a tiny scale,such as this tin car.Quick Look is also using an upper bound limitin case you are viewing very large objectsto ensure they are not occupying too much spacealongside your other apps.For any objects with a size in between, such as this teapot,Quick Look will use a model's real-world sizewhen initially launched in space.Remember, you can always view models at their real-world sizeby tapping on the button below your volume window.Now that we know how Quick Look handles the size of your model,let's look at two more things that Quick Look addswhen it presents your content: ground plane and shadows.Quick Look will automatically show a ground plane and shadowbelow your model to give you a better understandingof the model's size and its position relative to the ground.Because Quick Look is doing this work for you,we suggest that you do not add your own ground planeand shadows for your model.So far, we covered the basics of how Quick Lookwill show your 3D content.Let's walk you through the agendafor the remainder of this session.First, we will look into a few ways to create 3D models.Next, we will talk about how you can inspectthe visual quality of your contentand make adjustments as needed.Lastly, we will cover how to make sureyour 3D content can render and run with great performance.Let's get started with preparing your 3D content.Quick Look accepts USDZ as its primary formatto handle 3D models.USDZ is at the heart of 3D content for Apple platformsand designed to be lightweight and optimized for shade.Let's take a look at how you can create USDZ files.There are many ways to create a USDZ file.First, if you have previously created a USDZ file for iOS,you can use the same file for Quick Lookon this new platform.In case you want to create a new USDZ file from scratch,you can use professional digital content creation toolsto create 3D content and then export out as a USDZ file.You can also scan 3D modelsand create a USDZ file of real-world objectsby using our RealityKit Object Capture API.Object Capture provides you with an end-to-endphotogrammetry solution along with sample appsto help you create 3D models at different detail levels.Object Capture is supported on both iOS and macOS devices.Finally, if you're looking for a way to createa 2D or 3D floor plan over your house,we have you covered with our RoomPlan API.Remember how I mentionedthere is a backstory to the 3D room modelI showed you earlier?Let's dive into the workflow that our 3D designer, Jerry,has used to create this 3D model.First, Jerry starts to scan his roomby using RoomPlan sample application.After only a short time,he can preview the 3D layout of his room,or export and drop a USDZ file right to his Mac.Next, Jerry imports the 3D model into a 3D content creation toolto bring his design concepts to life.Here is the result of that work.This model looks great.You can see some materials and textures got added to walls,floor, and some other room elements.Now, the room model that Jerry createdis almost ready to preview in Quick Look.Luckily, there is a new tool called Reality Composer Prothat makes this next step really easy.Previewing your 3D models for Quick Lookis a really important step in your content creation workflowto inspect the real-world quality of your modeland make adjustments as needed.Let's take a closer look.Here is the Reality Composer Prowith our 3D model loaded in the main view.By simply clicking on this buttonlocated at the top-right corner in Reality Composer Pro,you can easily preview your 3D model in Quick Lookright on your device.And here is the same 3D model running in Quick Look.One thing we can notice nowis that the initial model orientation does not look right.As previously discussed, it is important to ensurethat the most interesting part of the 3D model is presentedfacing towards you to create an engaging experience.Let's see how we can fix this.Quick Look is using a right-hand coordinate system.Knowing this, we can easily fix the orientation of our 3D modelin our content creation tool,or right here in Reality Composer Pro.In our case, we need to rotate the model on the vertical axisso that the living room in our model comes into view.You can fix this by putting 90 degrees around y-axis here,just like this.Let's again use device preview from Reality Composer Proto check out the changes to our model.Now the orientation is fixed,and we have a much better view on this great looking model.OK, let's explore this asset even further,and get a different perspective and see a few more details here.To do so, you can use a pinch and drag gestureto rotate the 3D model and view it from different sides.This gives me a really good viewon the different parts of our room.You can also use a two-hand pinch gestureto scale the model and see more details.Now that we have seen how to inspect your 3D modelin Quick Look on device,let's talk about a few considerationsfor enhancing the visual quality of your content.When multiple objects are rendered in same location,they can overlap and appear as a single flickering object.To reduce this problem,you can use 3D creation tools to optimize the mesh geometryeither by removing the overlapor increasing the distance between the flickering objects.Try to avoid using high-frequency normal maps,since they remain results in aliasing issuesthat can create unwanted visual artifacts,especially in situations where you are in motionor up close to the 3D model.When rendering a small or thin object such as leaves,the system may not be consistently sampled over timeunder variable rasterization rates,which may cause flickering in the periphery.To minimize this issue, you can try storingthe fine geometry details into an opacity textureand then render it by using a geometrywith a larger triangle grid instead.To learn more about variable rasterization ratescheck out our session,"Explore rendering for spatial computing."Next, let's turn our attention to performance.Here, we will look into the anatomy of Quick Look 3D contentand what you can do to ensure a smooth and seamlessQuickLook spatial experience.Let's get started.There are many factors that determine the 3D performanceof your content that gets rendered in Quick Look.Things like what's the file size of your 3D model,or the count and resolution of textures,or even the complexity of materialsthat you are using for your model.In order to know where to start optimizing your 3D modelfor performance,you need to first identify potential limitationsthat might exist with your asset.To help simplify this task, we have introducedsome helpful new tools this year,which can significantly improve your workflow.Let's take a look.Here, we are back in Reality Composer Proto show you the Statistics panel.This panel provides you with a lot of helpful informationabout your 3D model characteristics,such as the number of trianglesand the amount of texture memory being used with your content.Another great tool at your disposal is RealityKit Trace.This tool allows for even more advanced runtime profiling.RealityKit Trace provides insightsinto specific rendering pipeline.It allows you to get more informationinto the individual rendering frames with your 3D content.By analyzing several captured frames,RealityKit Trace can be used to identify and diagnosepotential performance issues or limitations,and give you recommendations.RealityKit Trace keeps building with Xcode.To use it for profiling your content in Quick Look,you need to attach it to the Quick Look process.For more details on Reality Composer Proand RealityKit Trace, please check out the sessions below.Now that we have looked at some of the toolsto help you do profilingfor potential performance limitations,let's go over some of the best practicesto help you optimize 3D content for performance.Earlier, I mentioned the different factorsthat determines the performance of Quick Look's 3D content.Now, let's look at those one by one from the perspectiveof what you can do to optimize content accordingly.First up is optimizing your model for file size.Smaller file size usually results in quicker downloadsand faster loading time,as you don't want the user to wait a long timebefore interacting with your content.The trick here is try to find an optimized balancebetween asset quality and file size.For instance, you could use less detailed texturesor lower-quality audio sources.Sometimes, assets are developed over several iteration cycles.Oftentimes, this includes changes to underlying audio,animations, and textures linked to your assets.To keep file size to a minimum,make sure to only include what's really usedin the final package that gets distributed.For example, older versions of audio filesthat are no longer being used for your sceneshould be removed from final assets before distribution.Lastly, to ensure a better sharing experience,we recommend you keep your file sizeless than 25 megabytes.Next, let's look into how to optimizeyour 3D content geometry for performance.Again, the trick is to find the right balancebetween showing great level of detailsand achieving great performance.In case your model is using parts that are hiddenor fully covered by another geometry,meaning they are never shown on the screen,it's OK to remove them to save on your performance budget.Also, consider merging small meshesinto a single larger one to reduce system loads.For a single model, we recommend that you keep itunder 200 mesh parts and fewer than 100k vertices.Always keep in mind to balance your mesh detailwith another asset in the scene.Next, let's look at textures.Texture can contribute to a lot of memory usage.Automized textures consume less memory,which allows more assets to be loaded at the same timeand helps complex scenes run smoothly.One way to save on texture budgetis by using grayscale for your noncolor inputs.In some cases, you can even pack your grayscale imagesinto individual channels over a color texture,allowing you to store multiple grayscale mapsinto a single texture.When possible, use constant values in your materialsinstead of loading them from texture.If your model is only using a single PBR material,we recommend a maximum texture size of 2K by 2Kand using 8-bit instead of 16-bit per channel textures.Finally, be sure to always spend your texture budgetin areas that add most value and realism for your 3D model.Next up is materials.Materials define the surface properties of a 3D model.They specify how the system renders the model,including its color and whether your object appearswith a shiny or reflective look.When it comes to optimizing your materials for 3D models,you can reduce your loading time by combining mesh partsto share with the same material.The reason this helps is because when your 3D modelhas custom materials, the system has to compile themwhen it loads for the first time.Be sure to balance your material's complexityagainst the screen size.For example, if you just need a tiny part of the screento be transparent or have clear coat,it's more efficient to use a separate materialjust for that small area.You always need to be mindful of overlapping transparency.Rendering transparent objects in real timetypically requires more calculationscompared to the opaque ones,so only have overlapping transparencywhen you really need it.Also, if you have baked lighting or some parts of your meshdo not even need lighting,we recommend using MaterialX Unlit surfaceto save real-time lighting computation.Next, let's look into physics.Physics simulation sometimes can be computationally expensive,especially in cases where the physics systemperforms collision detection and simulates realistic effects,like gravity and springs.To maximize your content performance by using physics,you can try to reduce the total number of colliders being used.Sometimes you want your content to participatein physics simulation, but then your contentincludes entities that are not supposed to moveor be affected by another object --for example, a wall that will make a virtual ball bounce off.In this case, we recommend using static collidersto reduce physics computations.Next, let's talk about animation.Adding animations to your 3D modelsis a great way to bring your content to life.Sometimes, all you need is just an idle animation.In this case,limit the number of weight per vertex for your animationto help create efficient and realistic animations.When you are trying to optimize geometryof your deformations or skinned animations,remember to follow the same geometry guidelinesI provided previously.Next up is using particle systems with your content.This is one of the most powerful toolsfor building sophisticated visual effectssuch such as realistic fire with smokeor exhaust from a rocket.If used incorrectly, particles can be a bottleneckin your Quick Look 3D experience.For this reason, we suggest you limit your usageof particle emitters and keep the number of onscreen particlesto a minimum.Often, you can create similar visual effectswith fewer particles.Experiment with simpler or smaller shapes and stylesto achieve a similar effect,which will help reduce overdraw on the system.That was quite a number of things we just went through.Let's summarize those recommendations for you.There are many factors that count into performanceof your Quicklook 3D content.This new platform has been designedto let people engage with multiple appsand pieces of content that are running alongside each other.This means that the performance of your contentmay even be impacted by other apps or scenesthat people are doing.For this reason, it's good practiceto test your 3D model across different scenarios.As I have shared in this session,there are a number of tools available at your disposal,whether you want to check the visual quality of your contentor find limitations that could impact your 3D performance.The sweet spot here is to find the right balancebetween having greater visualsand ensuring a smooth Quick Look viewing experienceat the same time.To learn more about Quick Look and how to make your 3D contentavailable for viewing from apps and websites,please check out our other talk,"Discover Quick Look for spatial computing."Thanks for watching!♪
