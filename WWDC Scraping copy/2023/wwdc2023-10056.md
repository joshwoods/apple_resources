Uniform Type Identifiers — a reintroduction

Search this video…♪ ♪Michael: Hello and welcome.I'm Michael Ochs and in this video I'm going to talk abouthow to build better document-centric apps.Document-centric apps are a big part of productivity tools,especially on the iPad.There are three types of document-centric apps.Those that allow browsing documents, such as the Files app;those that allow viewing content, for example Quick Look;and those that also allow editing or creating content,like Pages, Keynote, or Numbers.This video focuses on improvements to viewer and editor apps,but some of the content discussed also applies to browser apps.iPadOS 17 introduces a new view controller that automatically enablesa large number of features in your app.It works nicely together with the desktop-class iPad APIsintroduced in iPadOS 16,and the existing document-centric APIs.This new view controller is built in a modular way.You get great system defaults, but can customize any individual behavior.To catch up on desktop-class iPad APIs,check out 'Meet desktop-class iPad'and 'Build a desktop-class iPad app' from WWDC22.For SwiftUI development, DocumentGroup now has supportfor all these features with no additional code.To learn more about the SwiftUI side of this,check out 'Build document-based apps in SwiftUI' from WWDC20and 'SwiftUI on iPad: Add toolbars, titles, and more' from WWDC22.In UIKit the functionality is opt-in.UIDocumentViewController is a new base class for content view controllers.It works together with UIDocumentto automatically configure the navigation bar.This enables features like sharing, dragging the document,undo and redo support, and more.It also supports automatic renaming.In this video, you will learn how to use UIDocumentand how to present documents with UIDocumentViewController.I'll then explain which features are built-in,and how to customize them further.At the end I explore some best practices to migrate your existing appsto take advantage of UIDocument.First up, creating a document.The core of every document based app is UIDocument.It's an abstract base class that is meant to be subclassedfor each file-type that your app supports.All UIDocuments are backed by a URL.Files on disk are the most common,but you can also save and load your documents using a databaseand a custom URL scheme.UIDocument's load and save operations are asynchronous,which allows for lengthy read and write operations, if necessary.For this reason, UIDocument is thread safeand takes care of coordinating access through locks and queues.When implementing a UIDocument subclass,there are two main responsibilities to take care of:loading and saving of the document,and providing access to the content of the document.Loading and saving is very similar across all documents.Accessing the content is more specific to the type of documentand how it is used in your app.For example, a document model for a markdown editormight only have a single text property;or it could expose a more complex interfacethat allows updating individual parts of the document.Before we talk more about accessing the content,let's talk about loading and saving.For simple, file based documents,there are two convenience methods you can override.When a document gets opened, 'loadFromContents:ofType:'will be called with the contents of the file.When the document is being saved,'contentsForType:' is called to get the current content of the document.The content of the document is a Data object for regular files,or a FileWrapper for everything else.To learn more about file types and how they work,check out the Tech Talk'Uniform Type Identifiers -- a reintroduction'.For example here, the document deals with regular markdown files,so we expect a data object.Now, if you want total control, overriding 'saveToURL:forSaveOperation:'and 'readFromURL:' instead gives you full access to the URLand leaves all reading and writing to you.This is great if you want to store your documents in a databaseor have special requirements for reading and writing your document.Note that while the save operation is asynchronous,reading is expected to complete by the time the method returns.And this is all there is to loading and saving a document.Now let's make sure we have a way to access the content of the document.An easy way to provide access to the document's contentis by adding properties for that content.In this example, I add a single text propertythat contains the full markdown string.This property will be set when loading the document initially,as discussed on the previous slides.The app can then update this textwhenever the user edits the document.For UIDocument to know when it requires saving,call 'updateChangeCount:' every time a property updates.Calling 'updateChangeCount:' allows UIDocument to mark the documentas needs-saving and automatically save at appropriate times.Next, presenting a document with the new UIDocumentViewController.Similar to UIDocument,UIDocumentViewController also is an abstract base classthat is meant to be subclassed.It manages opening, saving, and closing the documentand populates its navigation item with information from its associated document.This includes the title, the navigation item's title menu,its UIDocumentProperties object, and the rename delegate.UIDocumentViewController also provides key-commands for common actionslike undo and redo.Let's check out how to implement a UIDocumentViewController subclass.There are two methods that are designed to be overridden by your subclass.When the document associated with the view controller gets opened,or when an already opened document gets assigned to the view controller,'documentDidOpen' is called.Populate the view controller's views to display the content of the documentin this method.Note that there's no timing guaranteebetween when 'documentDidOpen' is calledand when the view controller's view gets loaded.A good approach to write robust code is to move the view configurationin its own method and call it from both,'documentDidOpen' as well as 'viewDidLoad'.Check if the view is loaded and the document is opened,before configuring your views.The second method to override is 'navigationItemDidUpdate'.Whenever UIDocumentViewController makes changes to the navigation item,it will call this method.Add your navigation item customization in there.'UIDocumentViewController' will make a best effortto keep changes to a minimum to persist your changes as best as possible.UIDocumentViewController also offers a 'undoRedoItemGroup'.Put this group in the navigation bar if you want undo and redo buttons to appear,and make sure that your document has an undo manager assigned to it.UIDocumentViewController will change the 'hidden' property of this groupdepending on the availability of an undo managerand enable or disable the buttons inside the group as necessary.UIDocumentViewController automatically opens and closes the document.However if you need access to the document from outside the view controller,call 'openDocumentWithCompletionHandler'.UIDocumentViewController will make all the necessary callbacks,such as calling 'documentDidOpen'and call your completion handler when ready.Last but not least, UIDocumentViewControllerprovides a document property.This property always refers to the document associatedwith the view controller.While you can provide a document during initialization,it is entirely optional.When there is no document associated with the view controller,it will automatically show an empty state.To learn more about configuring empty states,check out "What's new in UIKit".Furthermore, UIDocumentViewController can be used as your app’s root view controller.If there is no browser view controller in the hierarchy,UIDocumentViewController puts a document button in the navigation barthat opens a document picker.This requires declaring the key 'UIDocumentClass'for the relevant file type in your app's info.plistand setting it to the UIDocument subclass matching that file type.In iPadOS 17, UIDocument conforms to 'UINavigationItemRenameDelegate'and will handle the underlying file changes by itselfwhen the user invokes renaming from the title menu.If you are using UIDocumentViewController,it will automatically configure renaming for you,otherwise you can set the documentas the navigation item's rename delegate manually.These are all the pieces you need to create a great document-centric appin iPadOS 17.Next, how to migrate your existing apps.Migrating your app to make use of the new UIDocumentViewController is easyand only requires three steps.First, update the base class of your content view controller.Second, move existing code to the new callbacks.And third, delete code that is no longer necessary.Let's check out how to convert the markdown editor examplewe use in the desktop-class iPad app videos.If you are not familiar with it, don't worry.I'll walk you through the relevant parts of the existing code first.So here we have the definition of the view controller at the top,the document property it defines,and an init method that sets the initial documentand then adds a callback to our document.First we change the base class to UIDocumentViewController.Now that this class inherits from UIDocumentViewController,we will get a compiler error because the property 'document'already exists in the superclass with a different type.We change the name of that property to a more specific one,like 'markdownDocument'.Then we make it a computed property that casts the generic document propertyto the specific document class used in this view controller.The last bit in this code to take care of is the initializer.The only code in there that we still need is assigning a callback to our document.Since the document can change during the lifetime of this view controller,we move this to execute every time the document changes.An easy way to do this is to override the document propertyand add a didSet callback.Great, now that the base class is up to date,we need to take care of the new callbacks.In 'viewDidLoad' we add buttons to our navigation barand configure it to allow toolbar customization.For UIDocumentViewControllerwe move this to the new callback 'navigationItemDidUpdate'.Next, our class already has a method 'didOpenDocument'.This is almost what UIDocumentViewController has as well.We just need to rename the method,and adjust for the fact that the document is now optional.All right, next the part that we all enjoy most:deleting code.Editor view controller conforms to 'UINavigationItemRenameDelegate',but we no longer need that.UIDocument does all renaming for us automatically.So we remove the delegate definition,the delegate method with all its code,and also the 'renameDelegate' assignment.Next we can remove a few more navigationItem customizations.Both 'style' and 'backAction' are configuredby the document view controller automatically,so we can get rid of this completely.There is also a 'updateDocumentProperties' methodthat is used to create a UIDocumentProperties object.This method is called from various places.However, we don't need it anymore.UIDocumentViewController is doing all of this for us,so we can remove it and all its call sites.And that's all there is to do.The editor view controller is now only taking care of the featuresthat are unique to the app.It no longer has to manage basic tasks of document managementor default configuration of the navigation bar.Instead you can focus on the pieces that are unique, key elements of your app.This is all you need to know to take your document-centric appsto the next level and provide your users with a great experience.Convert your data models to use UIDocument.Then convert your content view controllerto use the new UIDocumentViewController base class.After that, go through your view controllerand remove all the code that's no longer needed.Thanks for watching.♪
