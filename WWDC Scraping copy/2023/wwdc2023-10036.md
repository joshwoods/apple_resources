Loading photos view.Allison: We can post the announcement in the action for the toolbar button.To create the announcement, we can use AccessibilityNotification.Announcementwith "Loading Photos View" as the string parameter.In the app, I also want to create three announcementswhen the camera navigation bar button is pressed.The first announcement, "Opening Camera,"and third announcement, "Camera Active," are the most important.Let's look at VoiceOver's current speech pattern for the announcements.Notice how the second announcement, "Camera Loading,"interrupts "Opening Camera".VoiceOver: Camera, button.Done. Open--camera--camera active.Allison: Now, in SwiftUI and UIKit,you can also set an announcement's priority,which lets you set the importance of an announcement queued to be spokenby assistive technologies.This gives you more control over which announcements people need to hear,versus announcements that can be ignored if not spoken in time.You can specify the importance of this informationusing one of three announcement priorities:high, default, and low.High priority announcements can interrupt other speechand cannot be interrupted once started.Default priority announcements can interrupt existing speechbut are interruptible if a new speech utterance is started.Low priority announcements are queued and spokenwhen other speech utterances have completed,if no new announcements have started.In the photos app, we can use announcement priorityto fix the interrupting strings.We have three announcements made from attributed strings.In SwiftUI, we will set the priority on theaccessibilitySpeechAnnouncementPriority string property.Our second announcement, "Camera Loading,"is the least important, so we give it a low priority.The last announcement, "Camera Active," is the most important,so we want it to have a high priority.Next, we will pass the attributed strings to the AccessibilityNotification.First, we will dispatch the default priority announcement,then the low priority, then the high priority.Now note how the low priority announcement does not interruptthe default priority announcement, while the high priority announcementdoes interrupt the default and low announcements.VoiceOver: Camera, button.Done. Opening camera--camera active.Allison: We can achieve the same announcement order in UIKit.We set the announcement priorities as NSAttributedString key value pairs.We use the keyUIAccessibilitySpeechAttribute AnnouncementPriorityand set the value to the proper UIAccessibilityPriority.Then we pass the attributes to the attributed string initializer.Back in the app, there is an image viewthat people can physically touch or pinch to zoom in and out.With an assistive technology turned on,this physical touch or pinch gesture can be hard to accomplish.Now, with the accessibility zoom action, people can zoom in and outon UI elements when assistive technologies are enabled.We will add the zoom action on the image.The image is in the body of the ZoomingImageView struct.We first add the accessibilityZoomAction modifier.Then, based on the direction of the zoom action,we will zoom the content in or outand post an accessibility notification announcement.Now let's explore VoiceOver's zoom capabilities with these changes.VoiceOver: Zooming image view, image.Zoom.2x zoom. 3x zoom.4x zoom. 3x zoom.Allison: We can also add the zoom trait and action in UIKit.We will first create a zoom view which will contain the image view.Next, we will add the supportsZoom traitto the zoom view alongside the image trait.We then implement accessibilityZoomInAtPointand accessibilityZoomOutAtPoint, each of which return a booleanto indicate zooming success or failure.In each of these methods, we update the zoom scaleand post an announcement to indicate the zoom change.In our image filter app, we can also create a short soundto add to the image by playing the small piano keys.People can create custom tones for the image using the keys.Let's examine the current VoiceOver experience with these soundsas I try to create a tone.VoiceOver speaks the key label and plays the VoiceOver activation soundevery time the element is touched,which makes it difficult to quickly press the keys in succession.Typically, VoiceOver provides a safe exploration experience,but sometimes, people need to directly interact with your appto use it properly.For our app, it would be much betterif people could directly touch the piano keyswithout extra speech and sounds.This is a great time to adopt the direct touch trait,named allowsDirectInteraction, on our view.Accessibility direct touch areas will let you specifya region of the screen where VoiceOver gestures passdirectly through to the app.In the default state, VoiceOver both speaksand activates the content of the direct touch element.For our app, though, it would be great if VoiceOver would be silentwhen someone touches a piano key so they can immediately hear the tonewithout having to activate the piano key element first.In addition to the allowsDirectInteraction trait,there are now two new direct touch options that will be supported.First, you can specify silentOnTouch to ensure VoiceOver is silentwhen touching the direct touch area,so that your app can make its own audio feedback.Second, you can specify requiresActivationto make the direct touch area require VoiceOverto activate the element before touch passthrough happens.This is the code snippet for the KeyboardKeyView.Each key is a rectangle that plays a specified sound.To fix the issue with VoiceOver speaking over the tone every time,we have set the direct touch option for the button to silent on touch.Now, the correct tone plays once VoiceOver reaches the key buttonwithout interference from VoiceOver's speech.We can also add the new direct touch options in UIKit.We can create the key button as a UIButton.Next, we will add the allowsDirectInteractionaccessibility trait.This trait is required when settingaccessibility direct touch options in UIKit.Finally, we will add the silentOnTouch optionfor accessibilityDirectTouchOptions.With the accessibility toggle trait, announcement priority, zoom trait,and direct touch options, you have more controlover the ways assistive technologies interact with your SwiftUI and UIKit apps.Next, let's talk about the accessibility content Shape kind in SwiftUI.This kind sets an accessibility element's pathand controls the appearance of accessibility elements on the screen.Previously, the interaction content shape kindchanged the accessibility shape and hit testing shape.Now there is an accessibility content shape kindwhich will not impact the hit testing shapeand only impact the shape of accessibility content.When an element needs a custom shape, such as a circle,the computed accessibility cursor visuals may obstruct other items on the screen.In this example, the accessibility path is a square,which does not match the red circular content.When the Accessibility Content Shape kind is applied to a view,it will update the underlying accessibility geometryfor the element with the shape provided by the modifier.This lets you quickly update an element's pathwith an existing SwiftUI Shape.I have created the circle button using a circle image.We can set the frame and the accessibility labelto match the color, red.Finally, we can add the content shape modifier to my viewwith the accessibility type and Circle as the shape.Now the accessibility path correctly matchesthe circular shape of the red color button.Finally, let's discuss an addition coming to UIKit accessibility,block based attribute setters.In the photo editing app, I want the accessibility valuefor the image view to represent whether the photo is filtered or not filtered.Now there is an easy wayto keep the underlying accessibility attributesfor my views always in line with the presented UI.I can do this with accessibility block based setters.The new accessibility block API lets you provide a closure that is evaluatedwhenever the attribute is needed rather than storing the value directly.The closure is re-evaluated every time a view is referencedor accessed by an assistive technology.We can simplify things with a closure,created in the viewDidLoad method for my view controller.We set the accessibilityValueBlock property on the zoomViewto keep the value updated based on whether or not the image is filtered.The closure must return the correct type for this attribute,which is an optional String.Notice that we are using a weak reference to selfto avoid a retain cycle.Blocks are great to add at the beginning of a class life cycle,to start up a class with the proper accessibility attribute information.Now accessibility attributes are much easier to maintain.Every time someone moves the VoiceOver cursor to a new element,VoiceOver first looks for attributes set with a closureand re-evaluates the closure.When you are building custom UI,consider integrating accessibility traits like toggleand features like direct touch interaction to increase usability for everyone.Second, think about your views with custom shapes in SwiftUI.If the accessibility shapes do not match the UI,consider introducing a custom accessibility shape.And finally, I encourage you to evaluatehow you are setting your accessibility attributesand identify if block based setters make more sense in your app.At Apple, we believe accessibility is a human right.With your help, we can create technologythat enhances and empowers everyone's lives.These new API additions are a great way to increase the usability of your appfor people who rely on assistive technologies,and I encourage you to use all of them to build amazing, accessible apps.Thanks for watching.
