SwiftUI, it focuses entirely on code with no external file formatsand uses Swift's new macro system to create a seamless API experience.SwiftData relies on the expressivity provided by the new Swift language macrosin order to create a seamless API experience.And it is naturally integrated with SwiftUIand works with other platform features, like CloudKit and Widgets.In this session, we'll look at the new @Model macro and its powerto model your data directly from Swift code,I'll introduce you to fetching and modifying your data with SwiftData,then I'll finish up by providing you with an overview of someof the other platform frameworks that work seamlessly with SwiftData.Now we'll look more into @Model.@Model is a new Swift macro that helps to define your model's schemafrom your Swift code.SwiftData schemas are normal Swift code, but when needed,you can annotate your properties with additional metadata.Using this schema, SwiftData adds powerful functionality to your model objects.It’s as simple as decorating your class with @Model,and the schema is generated.Models in SwiftData are the source of truthfor your application's schema and drive the persistence experience.Part of this experience will transform the class' stored propertiesand turns them into persisted properties.Adding @Model to your model opens up a world of possibilities.SwiftData natively adapts your value type properties to be usedas attributes right away.These properties include basic value types, like string, int, and float.They can also include more complex value types,such as structs, enums, and codable types too,including collections.SwiftData models reference types as relationships.You can create links between your model typeswith relationships and collections of model types.@Model will modify all the stored properties on your type.You can influence how SwiftData builds your schema using metadataon your properties.With @Attribute, you can add uniqueness constraints.You can use @Relationship to control the choice of inversesand specify delete propagation rules.These change the behaviors of links between models.You can tell SwiftData not to include specific propertieswith the Transient macro.Here is our previous Trip example.I'll adjust SwiftData's schema generationby adding metadata to our stored properties.I can add @Attribute to name and specify that it should be unique.I can also decorate our bucket list relationshipwith @Relationship and instruct Swift Datato delete all the related bucket list items whenever this trip is deleted.To learn more about SwiftData modeling,check out the "Model your schema with SwiftData" session.Now I'll cover how you can work with your model typesand the two key objects you'll use to drive your operations:SwiftData's ModelContainer and ModelContext.The model container provides the persistent backend for your model types.You can use the default settings just by specifying your schema,or you can customize it with configurations and migration options.You can create a model container just by specifying the listof model types you want stored.If you want to customize your container further,you can use a configuration to change your URL,CloudKit and group container identifiers, and migration optionsWith your container set up, you're ready to fetch and save datawith model contexts.You can also use SwiftUI's view and scene modifiersto set up container and have it automatically establishedin the view's environment.Model contexts observe all the changes to your models and provide manyof the actions to operate on them.They are your interface to tracking updates,fetching data, saving changes, and even undoing those changes.In SwiftUI, you'll generally get the modelContextfrom your view's environment after you create your model container.Outside the view hierarchy, you can ask the model containerto give you a shared main actor bound context,or you can simply instantiate new contexts for a given model container.Once you have a context, you're ready to fetch data.SwiftData benefits from new Swift native types like predicate and fetch descriptor,as well as significant improvements to Swift's native sort descriptor.New in iOS 17, predicate works with native Swift typesand uses Swift macros for strongly typed construction.It's a fully type checked modern replacement for NSPredicate.Implementing your predicates is easy, too, with Xcode support, like autocomplete.Here are a few examples of building predicates for our Sample Trip app.First, I can specify all the trips whose destination is New York.I can narrow our query down to just trips about birthdays,and I can specify we're only interested in trips plannedfor the future, as opposed to any of our past adventures.Once we've decided which trips we're interested in fetching,we can use the new FetchDescriptor typeand instruct our ModelContext to fetch those trips.Working together with FetchDescriptor,Swift SortDescriptor is getting some updatesto support native Swift types and keypaths,and we can use SortDescriptor to specify the order in whichwe'd like our fetched Trips to be organized.FetchDescriptor offers many other ways to tailor your SwiftData queries.In addition to predicates and sorting,you can specify related objects to prefetch, limiting the result count,excluding unsaved changes from the results, and much more.SwiftData also makes it easy to create, delete, and change your databy using the ModelContext to drive these operations.After creating your model objects like any other Swift classes,you can insert them into the context and begin using SwiftData features,like change tracking and persistence.Deleting persistent objects is as easy as telling the ModelContextto mark them for deletion,and you can save these and other pending changesby asking the ModelContext to save them and commit themto the persistent container.Changing property values on your model objects is as simpleas using the property setters as you normally would.The Model macro modifies your stored propertiesto help the ModelContext track your changes automaticallyand include them in your next save operation.To learn more about SwiftData containers and contexts and driving its operations,check out the "Dive Deeper into SwiftData" session.SwiftData was built with SwiftUI in mind,and using them together couldn't be easier.SwiftUI is the easiest way to get started using SwiftData.Whether its setting up your SwiftData container,fetching data, or driving your view

SwiftData is a powerful framework for data modeling and managementand enhances your modern Swift app.Like SwiftUI, it focuses entirely on code with no external file formatsand uses Swift's new macro system to create a seamless API experience.

SwiftData relies on the expressivity provided by the new Swift language macrosin order to create a seamless API experience.And it is naturally integrated with SwiftUIand works with other platform features, like CloudKit and Widgets.In this session, we'll look at the new @Model macro and its powerto model your data directly from Swift code,I'll introduce you to fetching and modifying your data with SwiftData,then I'll finish up by providing you with an overview of someof the other platform frameworks that work seamlessly with SwiftData.
