WEBVTT

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.830
Thanks, Amy.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.490
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.220
It's going to take me a couple of
minutes to get used to my voice

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.050
over the speakers and also being
in front of so many people with so

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.880
much light going on in front of me.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.840
The session is relatively
packed with stuff.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.730
I was just talking to Amy about
being able to fit it in the amount

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.060
of time that we have in here.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.320
I hope that we can do that in time.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.960
The session talks about QuickTime Pro.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.790
I'd like to know, first of all,
who has not purchased QuickTime Pro?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.970
Who has not purchased QuickTime Pro?

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.260
Nobody.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.780
One person over there, kind of like, shy,
going, no.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.740
OK, so everybody,
or most of you guys have

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.740
purchased QuickTime Pro.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.050
Have you guys actually been working
with QuickTime Pro in terms of

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.470
doing maybe minor editing to your
movies and that kind of thing?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.520
Well,
that's definitely some of the things

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.400
that we're going to talk in this session.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.980
Another thing that I want
to talk in this session is--

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.460
Using QuickTime Pro in
a professional workflow.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.010
Now last year I made a presentation
at QuickTime Live similar to this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.280
one where the motto was going free
or going really cheap and trying to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.600
produce media with just the 30 bucks
that you put into QuickTime Pro.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.560
And this year the motto
is quite different.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.580
This year is you've got QuickTime Pro,
you've got Final Code Pro,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.020
you've got Live Stage Pro,
you've got all of the Pro apps,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.180
you've got DVD Studio Pro,
and I guess that some of it is is talking

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.340
about my experience with QuickTime Pro.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.210
I often tend to gravitate to
QuickTime Pro to do minor things instead

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.350
of having to boot up Final Code Pro,
wait for the whole thing

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.530
to bounce on my power book.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.000
I just do it in QuickTime Pro, go off,
go off really quickly.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.800
So that's kind of like
the idea of this session.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.560
I'm still going to talk about the typical
minor editing features of QuickTime Pro.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.870
And another thing that I do want to
cover today is the deployment side.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.500
Where you can use
QuickTime Pro to compress stuff.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.580
I'm going to talk about it briefly.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.220
But some of the other relatively
obscure sections of exporting,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.500
which some of them have
to do with QuickTime VR.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.970
I don't know if anybody
has used QuickTime VR or

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.680
exported any QuickTime VR.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.560
Has anybody actually exported
QuickTime VR for QuickTime Pro?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.740
Okay, a few of you.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.430
So hopefully it will be
a surprise for others.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.480
There's also a section
that I want to talk about.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.560
A DVD Studio Pro situation.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.160
Anybody using DVD Studio Pro?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.800
A bunch of you.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.190
That's great.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.880
Perfect.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.760
And I'm sure that you have seen this.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.790
So this is what you guys
will be learning in,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.070
hopefully, in today's presentation.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.140
The model was also produced, developed,
and delivered.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.100
That's also been for QuickTime Live.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.890
And that's kind of like the
structure that I have here.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.910
Now, QuickTime is, as you guys know,
people think of QuickTime as

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.710
video and sound.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.750
But it's a bunch of other things.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.600
There's QuickTime VR, there's Flash,
there's graphics in QuickTime,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.420
extensibility via third party
components like Axle or which

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.100
other one I can think of.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.040
Flash, for example,
is a component of QuickTime.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.680
It's part of the MacÂ OS, which is really,
really important.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.000
And to tell you the truth,
I don't know why I put this thing

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.560
at the very bottom of the slide.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.680
It should be at the very top,
but it is cross-platform.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.770
And that's one of the major,
major things about QuickTime in

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.160
relationship to other platforms
like Windows Media and Rio.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.730
Even though the other
guys are cross-platform,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.920
they certainly do not compete
in the cross-platform ability

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.700
when it comes to QuickTime.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.570
QuickTime is almost
identical on both platforms.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.550
So QuickTime is at the core of the OS,
and this is a slide that was released

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.960
when Apple presented for the first time
the beta or the announcement of OS X.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.080
And the reason why I'm using this
slide is because at the bottom

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.730
of the screen it has QuickTime,
which is pretty much at the OS level.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.410
Now this is very important.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.280
On one side is one of the most
important things about QuickTime,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.880
and on the other side is one of the most
difficult things to deal with QuickTime.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.560
The important thing is
being in the OS level.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.960
That means that the developers
can write an application without

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.370
actually having to deal with codecs
or deal much with codecs and actually

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.890
dealing with so many media types.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.270
On the other hand,
the thing that is sometimes negative is

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.720
that the user must have QuickTime install
to be able to watch your content.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.000
Now the next one is,
what is QuickTime Pro?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.490
And I'm certain that most of
you know that QuickTime Pro,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.360
pretty much when you buy the $30 license,
you unlock the pro features of QuickTime,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.430
which for the most part,
unlock the editing capabilities

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.700
and a bunch of other capabilities
in the QuickTime player.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.970
Now, how many of you knew that when you
buy the license of QuickTime Pro,

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.900
you actually unlock
capabilities of preview?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.820
Anybody knew that?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.340
Nobody knew that?

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.890
Yes, you knew that.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.340
And I think it also unlocks the
capabilities of the Windows application

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.750
called Picture Viewer,
I think.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.900
It's the name.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.030
And QuickTime, as most other people think
of QuickTime as a player,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.810
like, not you guys,
but your clients or your customers.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.590
And it's not a QuickTime player.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.010
It is the QuickTime player.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.270
It is the plug-in.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.940
It's a huge architecture under
the hood at the OS level.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.500
And surprisingly enough,
preview is part of QuickTime Pro.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.830
I like that one because
not many people know that.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.420
So the Pro features of when you
buy the license of QuickTime Pro,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.560
it unlocks these
capabilities of the player.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.320
And it allows you to,
the first thing that it allows you to do

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.920
is to import media into QuickTime Pro,
modify it, and export it.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.170
So it has support for
over 200 media types.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.820
There's a few of those on the screen.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.590
You guys know that.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.420
I'm going to flip over here relatively
quickly because I have so much to cover.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.360
So if I can get the PowerBook, please.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.220
The first thing that I'm
going to do is a very,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.960
very, very simple example.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.500
And you guys saw this page
yesterday on Apple's site.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.400
And I don't know if anybody is like me.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.580
I'm a total geek,
so I tend to deconstruct things.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.470
And the first thing that
I deconstruct is like,

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.510
oh, is that a QuickTime movie
or what the hell is that?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.500
Well, it's actually an image.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.670
It's a GIF or GIF image,
depending on which part of

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.450
the world you come from.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.070
But check out what I'm going to do.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.180
I'm sure that some of you have done this.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.360
I'm going to open it in a new window.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.040
I'm going to copy the URL of the image.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.760
And I'm going to go to
the QuickTime player.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.160
Sorry, I may be doing this too fast.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.120
So, whoa, whoa, whoa, wrong application.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.260
I'm on the QuickTime player,
and you can get file

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.740
open URL in a new player,
and I'm just gonna paste the URL,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.390
which I had done earlier.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.400
And as you can see, it's a GIF or a GIF,
whatever you call them.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.110
You click OK, and the QuickTime player
will open up the image.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.240
Now, it doesn't play over here.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.420
That's basically because
I'm not playing it.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.400
But if I play it, you get to see the,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.940
The reason why this thing is really
cool is because you can reuse media

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.940
that was deployed somewhere else.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.240
For example, in this case,
I wouldn't do this because

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.110
of the whole copyright issue,
but I could take that image

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.460
and put it around my computer.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:21.500
[Transcript missing]

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.850
Now another typical thing that
a number of you guys have done,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.700
and a number of people want to
do when they get to QuickTime,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.530
is make a slideshow or turn a
bunch of images into a linear

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.400
video or into a linear movie.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.110
And in this case,
what I have here is a bunch of

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.090
pictures that I took of stop
animation outside of my window.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.720
And it's, I don't know,
I think something like two minutes in

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.140
between the pictures or 45 seconds.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.240
I don't remember.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.640
But in this case,
I have 75 pictures in the stop

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.600
animation or in the stop capture.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.540
And what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to import

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.890
them into one linear movie,
which is just going file.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.940
There's this thing called
open image sequence.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.960
And QuickTime Pro tends
to be quite smart.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.220
By selecting just the first picture,
as long as they're sequentially named,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.770
you can open up a sequence.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.790
So in this case,
it asks you at what frame rate

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.250
you want to open up the image.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.980
So if you render, for example,
3D out of 3D Max or

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.620
whatever 3D application,
and you just got a series of images

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.570
at 30 frames per second or 29,
97 frames per second or whatever,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.200
you can just choose the
frame rate from here.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.600
Surprisingly enough,
there's no other field.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.470
But anyway,
most of the frame rates are there.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.360
In this particular case,
I'm going to use 10 frames per second

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.760
because the duration of the slides.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.040
Otherwise, it would just fly over.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.260
And we'll be able to
see the image sequence.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.780
Another thing that I should warn
you at this point is that I'm

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.640
going to be opening a bunch of
images and a bunch of documents.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.670
I'm going to keep them on
the window or on the desktop,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.400
and I'm going to come back to them,
refer to them.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.880
So hopefully I won't be
messing with your mind so much.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.440
And so here's the animation.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.320
The images are, in this particular case,
640 by 480,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.400
which is what I got from my camera.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.760
And when you play them,
it's actually playing the stop animation.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.600
So that's how the clouds
move that particular day.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.390
You're going to see a boat going by.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.050
Yeah, that was a sunny day in Vancouver,
so you got to take pictures on that day.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.430
Otherwise it goes away and then it
rains and it rains and it rains.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.880
Okay, so I'm going to leave
that one over there.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.130
Actually, I'm going to hide it.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.880
The next example is opening Flash media.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.930
And this is kind of an important thing,
because again, coming back to the idea of

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.430
working with professional tools,
not just the free tools.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.350
How many of you guys are
actually working with Flash media

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.060
and deploying Flash video,
for example,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.860
with MX or a few of you guys?

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.360
Well, in this particular case,
what I have here is a very

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.100
basic Flash controller.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.500
I'm not going to bother to
open up the FLA document.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.800
I'm actually going to open up the Swift.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.680
And the way I'm going to do it is just by
dragging the Swift into QuickTime Player.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.540
Now, this particular Swift is
a Flash 5 version.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.670
And this is a very, very important thing.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.940
QuickTime is one version behind Flash.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.800
So QuickTime 6 has support for Flash 5.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.130
So if you have a Flash MX document
and has MX-only features,

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.500
it will not open in QuickTime 6.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.520
Hopefully the Apple guys will
be able to catch up with that.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.390
But for the time being,
that's not the case.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.030
And what I have here is
just a controller that,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:52.200
as you can imagine,
kind of like the Julia Childs thing.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.480
It's already pre-cooked to match
the same duration as my slideshow.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.900
And when you click on the play button,
it plays when you pause and rewind.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.040
And that's just the action scripting
being in the Flash document.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.450
As you can imagine,
what I'm going to do later is I'm going

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.210
to marry this thing to the slideshow.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.370
But I'm going to leave it there.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.980
Right now, what I want to point out is
the fact that I'm opening.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.340
The Flash document with its
different states and its

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.430
timeline in the QuickTime player.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.480
Now, another thing is opening
text in QuickTime,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.710
which is yet another one of those 200
media types that QuickTime supports.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.300
And if you drag a text document
into the QuickTime player,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.900
the QuickTime player doesn't like it.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.120
I don't know if you guys can
see at the bottom of the screen,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.970
but the QuickTime player
is not highlighting.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.540
But if this is an OS X thing,
it's not a QuickTime thing,

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.990
it's an OS X thing.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.790
If you drag and press on
the Option and Apple key,

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.830
that means force open.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.620
So if I drag and open,
you can see the QuickTime player,

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.080
the tiny QuickTime player,
I see some of you kind

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.860
of going like this.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.740
It's highlighting, so when I let go,
it's actually going to force open the

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.720
text document in the QuickTime player.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.690
I could have just gone file, open,
select the document,

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.680
and navigate through my nightmare
of hierarchy to get the document.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.710
Just drag and drop, or Option, Apple,
drag and drop, would actually force

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.590
opening the document.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.990
And in this particular case,
it's just a text document in Spanish,

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.480
so I'm going to just
go ahead and do that.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.450
One of the things is that if you
take a look at the document itself,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.080
each one of the lines will be a sample,
and that sample will have

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.480
a duration of two seconds.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.480
So that's how QuickTime interprets text.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.800
And I need to close that one.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.660
Now if I could go over to the slides,
please.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.320
I'm going to keep on
going with the slides.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.660
And as you can see, we've done a few--

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.650
Importing into QuickTime Pro.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.990
So this is the part that I called

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.980
What was the motto again?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.800
The first word?

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.700
Develop.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.100
Develop.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.950
So this is where the
developing part comes in.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.120
So if I can just switch over
to the PowerPoint slides,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.780
please, or to the keynote slides, rather,
on the screen.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.500
Thank you very much.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.490
And as you can see,
these are the ways that I went

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.600
over to drag and open media
in the QuickTime Player.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.530
There's a bunch of ways
that you can do that.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.630
And of course,
QuickTime will support the 200

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.720
and so documents and media types.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.370
Now another thing that I wanted to talk
about is the movie properties window.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.680
This movie properties window
is a very powerful window.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.160
It has a really, to tell you the truth,
obscure interface, I believe,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.080
but the way I use it is to learn,
and to learn from somebody else.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.720
So if I could switch over
back to the PowerBook,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.610
please.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.510
This is a real life example.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.200
It's a real life that I'm going to have
to do as soon as I get back to Vancouver.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.120
I compressed these movies
for a non-profit organization

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:12.280
Which, they're making this really neat,
really neat conspiracy thing.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.260
But I compressed them in
December of last year.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.620
And just before I flew over here,
they sent me an email if I could

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:25.920
compress the movies for their final edit,
or for their new version.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.330
And what happened is that
I lost my cleaner settings.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.940
This thing was compressed in Cleaner 6,
and I lost the settings

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.660
that I used back then.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.040
So now I need to grab my settings.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.740
Instead of trying to fiddle
around with my settings again,

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.860
I can actually use what the
engineers call the GINFO window.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.460
In the old days,
it used to be the info window.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.150
Now it's called the
movie properties window,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.060
which is Apple J.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.500
And with the properties window,
you can learn a ton about your movie.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.940
In this particular case,
I'm interested in

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.000
learning what codec I use,
what settings I use, frame rate,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.460
data rate, window size, everything.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.280
So I can replicate those settings again.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.430
And if you could look at the movies here.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.340
This is a world full of laughter.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.260
It's just a few seconds.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:13.940
It looks quite nice.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.130
This is the 288 kilobit
per second version.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.340
And I don't remember my settings.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:21.850
And it's true.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.860
I really don't.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.480
I think it's in the general section?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:28.980
No.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.340
General section will tell you
the data rate and the file size.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.840
Now I've got the video track selected.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.400
So now I can see that the data rate of
this movie is 31.1 kilobytes per second.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.240
Now, Cleaner doesn't like kilobytes.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.400
Well, the default setting in Cleaner
is kilobits per second.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.530
So to figure out what I used in Cleaner,
I'm just going to multiply

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:56.360
that 31.1 times 8 so I can get
it into kilobits per second.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.870
And as you can see,
the video has a data rate of roughly 248,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.760
250 maybe kilobits per second.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.330
Now, what about the audio?

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.360
The audio is 4.8.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.070
So I just need to do the same deal,
4.8 times 8.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.990
And that'll be around 38.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.670
I guess my settings were
around 40 kilobits per second.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.550
So now I can make a note of that,
go into Cleaner,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.260
and enter those settings without
having to fiddle around with

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.340
the settings that I forgot.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.050
In the video side of things,
or in the video,

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.040
if I go back to the video,
there's also format.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.800
So as you can see,
I used Sorenson Video 3.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.280
So that was the codec I used.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.680
I did not use MPEG-4.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.380
I used Sorenson Video 3.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.480
Size, 320 by 240.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.290
So pretty much I've gathered my settings
for my video to go into Cleaner.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.480
And most of the times you
wouldn't be using your own movies.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.850
The way I recommend you
guys doing is people ask,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.590
how the hell do you get really
great quality video like the

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.260
one on the QuickTime trailer?

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.720
Well, open up the movie,
figure it out yourself.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.500
It's not that difficult.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.460
And one of the things that you're going
to notice in those movies is that the

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.020
frame rate is 24 frames per second.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.340
Watch out for that,
because their source is film.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.090
This case, the source is video.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.180
So when you see 24 frames per second,
that doesn't necessarily mean that you

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.480
have to encode at 24 frames per second.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.220
For that, I recommend you go to Ben's
sessions for the preprocessing or

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.040
for the other encoding sessions.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.780
They'll talk about frame rates.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.340
Over here,
I won't talk about frame rates.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.040
So this is a real-life example
of how I use the info window.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.770
And by the way, the same thing on the
audio side of things.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.910
If I go to the audio track, I go format,
and you can see in this particular case,

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.930
also the sample rate
channels and sample size,

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.880
16-bit cue design.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.880
Those are the settings that I should
enter in Cleaner 5 or Cleaner 6 for the

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.210
next time I encode the upcoming content.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.290
Now, who's going to do that?

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.280
Who uses Live Stage Pro?

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.450
Guillaume, you're the only one.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.050
I'm really surprised.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.700
You guys got to check LiveStage Pro.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.460
There's this thing in Live Stage Pro.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.780
You guys know about Live Stage Pro.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.130
It's the authoring tool to
make interactive QuickTimes.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.680
Well, I've got a very dumbed down example
here of an interactive QuickTime.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.330
And it's a very dumbed down
example just for this particular

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.730
section of the presentation.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.320
It's a movie that has two sprites.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.870
That when you click on the year,
it's actually just going to send

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.240
what is called a debug stream of the
year that the computer sends out.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.600
And also the QuickTime version.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.850
Now, for those of you that are authoring,
or for those of you,

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.600
or actually you guys that should
be authoring with LiveStage Pro,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.110
when you're doing your testing,
you should be doing your

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.410
testing on the user's machine
or on the playback environment.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.850
You should not be using just
the LiveStage Pro preview

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.250
to see what you get.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.540
In this particular case,
I'm going to get the preview

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.700
to show you what it does.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.540
If I open up the debugger window,
this is the debugger window.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.500
This is my preview.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.810
And when I click on the year,
you're going to see the

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.070
year appears over here.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.360
And when I click on
the QuickTime version,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.970
LiveStage Pro, or rather QuickTime,
returns the version of

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.900
QuickTime that I'm using,
which you can use to actually make a

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:22.540
decision of maybe showing a different
video or go this way or whatever.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.310
But it's really cool to try
it in LiveStage Pro where

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.860
it has a debugger window.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.920
But what about if you want to play
it out in your user's environment?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.340
Let's say that your movie should
be playing on the QuickTime player.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.160
Well, there's this other thing.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.290
Actually, I need to quit out of here.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.390
This is the same movie,
already exported as a QuickTime movie.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.910
And if you click on it, nothing happens,
because the text is supposed to be sent

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.140
to the debugger window in Live Stage Pro.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:54.700
Over here, there is no debugger,
or so you think.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.200
If I go to the GINFO window--

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.790
Check this out.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.730
If I go to my Sprite track,
there's this other thing

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:06.240
called debug messages,
which is just a window that will

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.320
actually show you the last debug
string that you sent in Live Stage Pro.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.000
So if I click on the year,

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.140
If I click on the year, there we go,
the year gets sent over there.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.620
So you can actually use this debugger
window in the QuickTime player

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.750
to test your movie out and to
send yourself messages to see

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.940
how your movie is performing.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.990
And for anybody that
gets into the authoring,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.350
this is super valuable.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.120
Most definitely.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.240
OK, if I can go back to the slides,
please.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.060
So in this case,
we've seen how you can use the

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:52.900
G info window-- I love that name--
to get some information and actually

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:58.180
to learn from somebody else's
work and also to debug your work.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.140
And these are some of the things that
you can learn from the GINFO window,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.050
and some of the information
that we got right now.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.400
Now, produce content.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.100
You guys know that you can edit media,
that you can mix multiple

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.160
media types in QuickTime.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:17.000
Composite media,
this is a really neat one.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.570
where you can actually do
compositing in real time,

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.050
and main attack media.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.520
You can use the keyboard to
navigate in the QuickTime timeline,

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.860
in the play in the QuickTime.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.640
You can locate the playback
here to whatever you want,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.540
make selections, and get time stamps,
all from the keyboard.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:45.610
These are the typical editing shortcuts
that you would use to make selections,

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.980
to copy things, to paste them around.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.300
I'm not going to show you all of them,
basically, because I'm going to get

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.840
more into the pro stuff.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.700
And let me show you a
typical example here.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.810
If I can go back to the PowerBook.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.770
Thank you very much.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.180
Has anybody used Squeeze version 2?

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:06.690
No.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.200
OK.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.850
Squeeze-- and I'm saying
Squeeze version 2,

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.450
because I'm not sure if
it was fixed in version 3.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.180
But in Squeeze 2,
when you compress your movies into

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.140
QuickTime or MPEG-4 into whatever,
Squeeze sometimes would drop

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.900
the last frame or the last
two frames of your video.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.460
So if you have something really
important on your last frame,

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.330
you're actually going to lose that frame,
or you were actually going to

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.410
lose that frame in Squeeze 2.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.660
So just to show you the really
simple editing features,

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.860
this is just a QuickTime movie,
a DV file, that let's say needs to be

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.610
compressed with Squeeze 2.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.540
And you want to just grab the last frame.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.620
What I'm going to do is I'm just
going to go to the last frame.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.310
I always get confused
between these key commands.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.360
There we go.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.840
So that's the last frame.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.230
That's us flying.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:00.860
And pressing on the Shift key and
the arrow keys on the keyboard,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.800
you can make a selection.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.720
And check this out.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.660
For those of you that use OS X,
see that little selection there?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.670
I just made a selection of one frame,
which I want to just duplicate.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.820
So I got that frame selected.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.760
Copy.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.180
And I'm just going to paste it.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.240
Boom, boom.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.810
You can see here on the-- this is
the actual info window now-- how the

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.800
actual time of video is changing.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.680
That's because I'm
adding frames over there.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.140
So now I've added a bunch
of frames to the end.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:42.100
I can save my movie with dependencies,
take it into Squeeze, and who cares if he

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.640
drops those last frames?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.140
I already put them there.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.680
So the interesting thing in here
is the actual editing capabilities.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:57.060
Now if I could go back to the slides,
please.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.130
What did I do with the clicker?

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.320
Has anybody used add and add scale?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.640
Or rather,
has anybody not used add or add

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.410
scale in the QuickTime player?

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.560
I see a few hands here and there.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.320
OK, this is a very interesting feature,
where you can actually-- in this case,

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.750
what I did is I copied and pasted.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.390
Which in QuickTime terms,
when you paste media, it actually,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.390
whenever you have the
timeline or the playback head,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.720
it will splice the current media
and it will insert whatever

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.690
you have in the clipboard.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.090
In this particular case,
I was at the very end,

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.030
so nothing was pushed further down.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.180
But there are cases where
you actually don't want that.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.710
You actually want the
media to appear on top,

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.620
or rather,
at the same time as the current media.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.210
You don't want to push
anything in the timeline.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.530
So that's what add and add scale does.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.500
In the QuickTime player,
I'll show it to you in a sec,

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.160
if you go edit add,
it's just going to add the

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.900
media to wherever the location
of the playback head is,

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:00.990
without changing the length of the new,
of the pasted, or of the added media.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.700
Add scale on the other side is actually,
what I have in this

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.690
particular example is,
imagine that you're copying a track,

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.020
which is the green one,
which has an X duration.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.980
And you want to fit it into that blue,
light blue section, which is shorter.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.640
So what you would do is you would
actually select that blue section

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:26.280
in the movie that you're adding
the new one and select add scale.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.350
In that case,
it's actually going to shrink

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.220
the duration of the one you're
adding to fit that selection,

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.740
which is really cool.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.020
Now, in this particular case,
be aware that the

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.400
sample rate will change.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.270
So if you have a video track and the
video track or an audio track and then

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.650
you add scale to something smaller,
it's going to accelerate and it's

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.840
going to sound like the Chipmunks.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.370
Because it's the same media
in less amount of time.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.460
Or if you extend it,
it's actually going to sound like this.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.880
So be aware of that.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.700
I think that was the second picture,
or the second slide.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.760
So if I can go back to the, to the,
to the, yeah, you got me.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.100
Okay.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.130
Now what I have here is I've got,
I already prepared this one.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.950
I don't need this movie right here.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.470
But ad track.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.880
I've got the Marina movie
already compressed.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.620
I'll go over the compression later.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.380
But it comes from the one
that I opened earlier.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.820
And it has the same
duration as my flash track.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.640
Now,
I think I have the flash track over here.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.860
And in this particular case,
they both match perfectly.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.940
So for the flash track,
I'm going to select Edit.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.200
Or rather, select All first.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.040
I'm going to select the whole sample.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.860
Copy.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.200
I've got it in the clipboard.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:02.110
And if I go to my new movie,
now I can just go-- see,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.270
there's the Add and Add Scale.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.690
If I go Add Scale right now,
because I don't have anything

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.060
selected except just the frame
where the playback head is,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.650
it would just add the flash
track to that single frame.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.920
Now, I actually didn't.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.300
Oops.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.850
I just learned something new.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.860
Anyway, I was expecting it to just
appear on the first frame,

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.350
but in this case, it actually appeared
on the whole timeline,

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.540
which is exactly what I wanted.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.760
As you can see, it matches perfectly from
the beginning to the end.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:39.040
So this is the example of an ad track.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.000
So now if I play-- remember,
this flash had ActionScript to

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.230
actually play the timeline.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.260
Pause a timeline, rewind a timeline.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.910
So the flash track is actually
controlling the whole QuickTime player,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.070
which is really neat.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.380
and I'll talk about
the compositing later,

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.100
but you can see right now I have
the flash on top of the video,

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.100
which is not exactly what I want.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.640
But I'll come back to that
in a few minutes when we get

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.010
into the compositing section.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.830
So if I could go back to the slides,
please.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.200
There's another situation,
typical situation,

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.090
where you have video captured
from an analog source,

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.060
or even from a DV source,
and you have noise on

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.090
the edges of the screen,
black lines or video noise.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.680
In analog video,
you would get terrible noise

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.800
at the bottom of the screen.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.030
And when you compress your video,
you don't want those

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.220
black lines in there.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.500
You don't want that noise,
because you're wasting bandwidth,

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.730
and you're actually distracting
your audience from that added noise.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.740
Well, if you have cleaner,
if you have squeeze,

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.130
you can actually crop those things.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.190
But there are cases where you may want
to just crop those things in a movie

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.110
that has already been compressed,
or even compress the movie

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.390
in the QuickTime player,
if you so like.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.200
For example,
if you want to use the MPEG-4 codec.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.520
Now for that particular example,
if I could just jump

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.020
back to the PowerBook,
please.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.010
What I have is I have the same DV movie.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.730
Which, I don't know if you noticed,
but it does have

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.100
terrible noise around it.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.300
This black lines.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.290
And when she exits the plane,
this black lines,

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.290
they just get really nasty.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.470
So I'm going to remove those black lines.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.660
So if I can go back to the slide so
I can explain first what I'm going to do.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:30.450
Thank you very much.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.180
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to generate a black image,

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.430
or actually in this case
I already generated a black

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.120
image which is slightly smaller.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.440
Actually, it's not smaller.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.260
It's the exact same size of the document,
and it's not only black.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.610
It's black and white.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:53.200
The white areas are the ones that
are going to be removed or cropped.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.910
And the black areas of this mask image
are the ones that are going to be kept.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.490
So this, I've done that in Photoshop.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.270
The way I did it is I took a
screenshot of my QuickTime movie,

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.660
took it into Photoshop, and that's where
I measure the black area.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.750
So if you see this document in Photoshop,
it's a black and white document that

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:17.300
has the black area covering the area
that I do want to keep in the video.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:22.580
And I'm going to go and set the
mask in the QuickTime player.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.100
And this is what it's going to look like.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.300
So if I can go back to the PowerBook,
I'm going to show you how to do that.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.230
So I've got my noisy movie here.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.440
I've got my mask that was opened up,
but it was made in Photoshop.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.240
And you're going to see that I've
got the white area over here and

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.320
the black area in the center.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.280
This has been already measured to--

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.740
To remove the black lines.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.470
And in this particular case,
it's a PIC document.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.460
So here's how you do it.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.960
Again,
back in the movie properties window,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.310
so-called GINFO window.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.130
I'm going to affect the video track.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:09.310
And there's this thing called mask,
one of the properties of the video track.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.340
Right now,
the whole thing is set to black,

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.720
which means show the whole screen.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.100
But in this case, I actually want to just
show a smaller section of--

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.140
The video,
which was defined by my black areas.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.760
You can see the movie behind.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.200
It actually changed size,
and the black noise is all gone.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:36.800
So now I can compress this video
without getting that noise.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.740
You can do that same thing.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.660
You can do the cropping
in your encoding tool,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:48.110
like Cleaner, or Squeeze, or HipFlix,
or whatever other tool you use.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.500
So that's a very simple
example of masking.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.640
I'm going to leave that movie over there.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.120
And I need to go back to the slides,
I think.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.700
If I could go back to
the keynote presentation,

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.670
please.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.510
Thank you very much.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.800
Now there's this other thing where you
can actually use graphic modes to control

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:12.100
what gets displayed on the screen.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.940
And I'm going to go
back to the PowerBook,

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:20.750
please.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:24.190
And in this particular case,
what I've got is--

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.800
The Flash and the video.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.480
Now, if you select,
you can see I've got the video

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.260
track and the flash track.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.400
Now, Flash,
this is a great feature of Flash that

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.850
most people maybe don't know about,
but it has the ability,

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.400
or rather by default,
it has an alpha channel

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.950
that removes the background.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.940
And QuickTime Player gives you
access to the graphics mode,

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.790
what is called the graphics mode,
as to how the flash track

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.380
is going to be rendered.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.490
And I'm just going to
use the straight alpha.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.940
And as you can see,
the background of the flash

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.740
track disappears quite nicely.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.430
Now I should remind you that this
is quite CPU intensive because

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.670
of the real time compositing
that QuickTime Player is doing.

00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:15.680
Now,
something a little bit more interesting.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.900
Maybe you guys know about this,
and you have done that.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:23.460
But what about this?

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.420
Got a QuickTime VR here.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.140
It's got a bunch of nodes.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.280
You can see the nodes over there.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.160
Oh, I miss Mexico.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:39.590
And I also have this other
document in Photoshop.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.900
You see that little logo?

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.440
It has transparency.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:48.240
It's actually saved as a PNG document,
as a PNG.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.050
So I have it over here
saved as a PNG document.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.480
I'm going to open it in
the QuickTime Player.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.740
For some reason, I don't know why the
QuickTime Player does that.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.360
It looks awful,
but that's not the way it's going to

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.360
look like after I apply the transparency.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:06.560
I'm going to select all, copy,
or edit copy, go over here.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.520
Now if I try to paste
into the QuickTime VR,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.620
you can't.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.380
It's grayed out.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.150
But this is how you do it.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.140
QuickTime VR works really interesting.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.580
You can actually do some
important modifications.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.020
If you change the controller of a
movie to the regular movie controller--

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.390
And now, if I move the timeline,
nothing changes in the timeline.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.620
Check this out.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.060
I've got that available now.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.390
So I can select all my timeline,
which doesn't do anything, and add scale.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.720
which would actually show the
ping image throughout the video,

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.090
or throughout the VR.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.800
Now I can go back into the video
track seven was the last one added.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.500
This is my logo.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.190
Let me actually change the name first.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.000
Logo.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.500
And graphics mode,
I can apply the transparency,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.290
or the alpha channel, sorry,
of the ping document.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.920
And now I just made a
really beautiful watermark.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.030
Now, if I try to play this QuickTime VR,
it's not showing as a

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.400
QuickTime VR because of the controller.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.450
So I got to go back and set
the controller for the whole

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:21.230
movie to be QuickTime VR.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.420
This is the part you go, ooh.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.660
Oh, that is so cool.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:32.540
We have one VR that
actually has a target.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.740
So it appears in the center,
and you can actually figure out

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.460
the center of the screen and take
advantage of that alpha channel to

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.280
actually blend it into the background.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.450
And you can also drag from over here,
as you can see.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.940
It's just applying a
really beautiful logo.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.620
OK, if I can go back to the slides,
please.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.640
Another very simple-- well,
not very simple, very simple process,

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.100
but very powerful process is
adding multilingual capabilities

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:02.220
to your players and to your movies.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.960
And this is something that is more
and more important now these days.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.360
Particularly, for example,
this presentation in the morning

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.100
where they're talking about
Japan and all these really beautiful

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.580
things that you can do in Japan.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.640
And we're getting the
translation to Japanese.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.060
Thank you very much for everybody
over there in the cabin.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:23.000
So multilingual content is becoming
way more important now these days.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.170
And what I'm going to do is,
I already have two text tracks,

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:29.070
one in English and one in Spanish,
for this particular VR that I had done.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.160
Let me show you how you do it.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.900
So if I can go back to the PowerBook,
please.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:40.070
I've got my English and
Spanish text documents.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.500
I'm going to force open them
on the QuickTime player,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.310
both of them.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.720
I'm going to attach them to the video,
or to the QuickTime VR.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.010
So it's pretty much the same
text in English and in Spanish.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.860
And it's just one sample.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.960
It's just one single text.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.120
And what I want is I want the
text to appear to the right of the

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.850
movie and stay there all the time.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.620
So I'm going to grab the English track,
select all, copy, go back to the VR.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.580
I cannot do anything over here,
so go back in the Genfo window.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.600
Change the controller
to the movie controller.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.360
Add scale.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.320
Oops.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.030
Select all.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.800
Add scale.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.510
So I added a text track.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.430
I need to move it around.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.280
Text track.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.540
And generally I'm going to
change the name to English.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.280
Yeah, that's English.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.500
Change the size and the location.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.170
I hope I'm not going too fast.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.670
I know I'm going fast.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.090
And I'm just going to change the size to,
let's say, 220.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:39:11.500
[Transcript missing]

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:28.900
[Transcript missing]

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.350
This is a drag,
doing it with just the drag and drop.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.290
But QuickTime is actually going to
select the Spanish and the English track.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.680
Right now I haven't
defined which one is which.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.640
Right now, if you go to the alternate
section for the particular track,

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:46.390
both of them appear to be English.

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:48.950
So actually the Spanish is
overlapping the English.

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:54.240
But you could say the English,
it's definitely English,

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.800
but it should be an alternate
for the Spanish track.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:05.600
And on the other hand,
the Spanish track should be in Spanish.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.720
And it is an alternate
for the English track.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.530
So now if you have a machine,

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.470
Or if you have a NOES that
is set to Spanish,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.520
the Spanish version will come up.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.010
And if you have a machine in English,
the English version will come up.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:25.210
I need to change back the
controller to QuickTime VR.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.560
And I'm not going to change
the settings of my OS,

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.330
but in the preferences pane,
if you drag and drop

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.340
the languages in there,
it will change the language of the OS,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.300
which is amazing, especially for testing.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.540
But you can also change the
language in the QuickTime player.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.980
So right now,
I have the default language,

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.140
which is English.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.520
And as you can see,
the English text track appears on top,

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:58.580
even though the Spanish version
should be physically on top.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.380
But if you change the
language to Spanish,

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.620
Then the Spanish version gets deployed.

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.260
So if I was to deploy
this movie right now,

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.640
and somebody had a Spanish OS,
they would get that.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.110
No questions asked, no flickering,
no nothing.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:17.030
If they had an English OS or another OS,
they would get the English version.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.700
That is cool.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.990
Really cool.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.300
And I don't know if you noticed,
but there's an accent over there.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.880
So it sort of handles,
and particularly with QuickTime 6.3,

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.800
it handles text much better.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:34.580
OK, now that I'm over here,
another important thing that

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.890
you can do in the info window,
which I will mostly recommend,

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.120
is annotations.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.550
Has anybody used annotations?

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.410
A few of you guys.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.660
You guys should use annotations.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.660
When you use annotations,
pretty much what you're doing is

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.250
you're tagging your movie to be
whatever information you want in there.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.420
And you can add a ton of things.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.300
And the important thing
is that certain databases,

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.130
and more databases now a day,
are supporting this metadata.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.110
So the databases can
actually retrieve that data,

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.010
and depending on the searching criteria,
display the movies

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.940
that fit that criteria.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.500
So you can see, these are all the things
that you can add in there.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:19.550
But there's this particular one,
movie name.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:20.260
It's really cool.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.920
See the name at the top of the window,
which is x.miguel.mov?

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.410
That's the actual file name.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:26.700
You don't want that all the time.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.720
Sometimes you want something different.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.200
I don't want the .mov there.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:33.870
Miguel.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.390
So when you actually apply a full
name property in the annotations,

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.800
That is the name of the
object that appears over here,

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.730
and it also changes the name at the top.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.000
So you can actually use that
somewhat to your branding,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.470
and also of course for the
searching criteria in your database.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:57.860
So I'm gonna hold that movie over there,
and I'm gonna go back to the slides.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.240
Thank you very much.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.260
So that was the language thing.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:06.800
That was the annotations where definitely
as more and more content becomes digital,

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.860
you definitely want to annotate
it so it could be found much,

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.030
much, much easier.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.180
Now this is the one that
I was going to get to.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.380
I love this example.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:19.580
The other day I had a student at
school where he has a DVD project.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.870
He has a still menu,
has a transition that goes

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:24.690
to another still menu.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.200
And for those of you that
have used DVD Studio Pro,

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.200
it actually has a color shift.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.410
It makes a color shift.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:36.680
So if I can go back to the PowerBook,
please.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.940
Let me show you what I mean.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.120
And I'm going to hide
the QuickTime player.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.390
Here we go.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.710
And this is the typical
DVD Studio Pro project,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.500
where you have a still image.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.720
This is my menu.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:58.850
It has three buttons.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.640
It's a still image.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.760
It has no video.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.640
You see there's no timeline.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.340
And when you click on
the marmalade button,

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.140
I should get a transition.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:12.400
This is a video transition in MPEG-2
that goes to the last marmalade menu,

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.380
which is also still menu.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.680
And this is what it looks like.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:22.130
If you actually open
it on the DVD player,

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.860
Oh, I opened up the wrong application.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.850
Sorry about that.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.220
Here's a DVD player.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.990
If you play this thing on the player,
you're going to notice that

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:38.110
the first menu has a gamma that
tends to be relatively dark.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.290
Let me go full screen.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.060
and play.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.140
So that's the gamma.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.340
And when I click on the mermelade,
you're going to notice how

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.990
the color is going to shift,
transition is going to happen,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.470
and then it's going to flicker again.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.210
It's going to change the color again.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.200
So it becomes brighter and then darker.

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:57.800
That's not cool.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.180
That's definitely not professional.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:04.700
And the reason for that is because the
way DVD Studio Pro is actually handling

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.570
the compression of the steel frames.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.160
So you can actually work around it.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.720
Let me do it again.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:17.380
Dark, bright, transition, dark.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.630
Really, it's not cool.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.630
So the solution is this.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:31.110
The solution is turn that
still menu into a video menu.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.200
But you don't want motion.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.030
You want a still image.

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.790
Well, QuickTime Pro to the aid.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.680
And we did this in five
minutes over there at school.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:42.860
I'm going to do it a little
bit quicker over here,

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.180
because I already prepared
some of the media.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.560
And this is my transition.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.910
It comes from Final Cut Pro.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.800
I'm going to open it in QuickTime Player.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.280
Instead of going to Final Cut Pro,
editing a frame,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.930
and making it into a video,
and exporting the whole thing, blah,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.180
blah, blah, blah, nah.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.790
QuickTime Player.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:59.100
This is what I've got.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.840
This is my video that
gets turned into MPEG-2.

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.400
Right now it's the DB file.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.140
And if you notice,
there are six frames before

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.240
the actual transition happens,
or five frames or so.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.370
So I'm going to select those.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:15.320
Pressing on the Shift key,
you can see at the bottom.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.940
Okay, that's too much.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:21.900
Over here, have five frames, copy,
make a new document, paste.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.100
So I've got a new video that
is just five frames long.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.770
You can actually see in the GINFO window.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.800
It's five frames long.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.860
And I'm just going to paste a few more.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:33.750
10 frames long.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.420
So I'll copy paste.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:37.050
20.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.090
One second long, select all, copy, paste.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.700
Two seconds, select all, copy, paste,
four.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.680
Six, eight, 10, select all, copy, paste,
20, 30 seconds.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.590
I'm just going to make it 30 seconds
long for the sake of argument here.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.230
So now I've got a 30 second
video of a still frame.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.600
If I was to export
this document as video,

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.080
it would actually be one
frame stretched through time.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.000
But I want to turn that now into MPEG-2,
and this is the part where we're

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.860
going to see the little progress bar.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.010
That's why I'm just
making it 30 seconds long.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.700
And I've got
DVD Studio Pro 1.5 installed.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.830
I don't have Final Cut Pro 4.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.360
But if you had Final Cut Pro 4,
it would be the same deal, pretty much.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.310
And I'm in the DVD color shift.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.980
And I'm gonna save it here as my.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.140
I always don't know
how to spell that one.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.940
I hope that's the correct spelling.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.680
I hear somebody mumbling
that's the wrong spelling.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.070
Okay.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:44.100
Save.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.400
So this is just going to
compress the MPEG-2 video.

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:52.600
And now that I have the MPEG-2 video
compressed with the same compression

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.140
application than the transition video,
there should be no gamma

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.240
differences between the two videos,
which is why it's causing the

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.830
actual flickering of the video.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:06.560
And in this case,
this is how we solve the problem

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.160
of that particular student.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.700
By the way, this is not the project that
particular student was working on.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.720
This is just some pictures that I took
in the kitchen the other day and

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.710
decided to use for my project here.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:25.070
But now when I bring this document
into DVD Studio Pro and attach

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:31.500
this video instead of the actual
still image behind for the menu,

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.240
DVD Studio Pro will not flicker anything,
or the DVD player will

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.620
not flicker anything.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.380
So let me hide the QuickTime player,
go back to DVD Studio Pro.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:51.470
I already made the one at the end,
the video for the last menu.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:54.120
And this is how I'm going to do it.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.960
I'm going to select the image for the
recipe video-- for the recipe menu,

00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.640
sorry.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.760
The picture as of right now,
it's a picked image.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:08.040
I'm not going to change anything except
select the video that I just made.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.310
Yeah, that's the wrong spelling.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.700
I'm going to loop it now.

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:18.500
Go back to my Marimole video,
which is also a picked image,

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:23.780
and apply my MPEG-2 video that
comes from QuickTime Player.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:29.730
"Where is that Mermanade video?

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:29.910
Where is that?

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.360
And you picked, still menu, here we go.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.880
Bad naming.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.520
And if I preview this document, oh,
forgot to loop.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:45.330
And if I preview this thing,
I'm also gonna preview it in the player.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.360
When I go to marmalade,
there is no color shift.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.520
Oh yeah.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.600
For those of you that
have used DVD Studio Pro,

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.540
you should be going, yeah!

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.370
Because it is terrible.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.160
It makes your project not professional.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.820
And if you're wondering
if it really works,

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:14.000
this is what it looks like
once it's on the player.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.060
And you're going to notice
there is no color shift.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:25.380
So for those of you using
DVD Studio Pro and you want to do this,

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:28.060
by all means.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.780
So I go into the marmalade section.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.820
No color shift.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:42.900
[Transcript missing]

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:49.240
Okay, go back to the,
I need to go back to the slides please.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.280
Keep on losing the clicker.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:53.280
It's over here.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:58.830
So in this case,
what I have in the slide is to actually,

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:00.940
instead of just copying
and pasting the slides,

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:05.460
is actually to use a text track and
add scale to change the duration.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.990
I'm going to be really sincere with you.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
I did that on the airport coming here,
and it was not working for me.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.180
It was still shifting colors.

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.630
I have no idea why.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.180
I'm really hoping,
I'm looking forward for the expert

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.250
session to bring that one on.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.080
But in this case,
I just copied and pasted

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.950
the frame or the frames.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.660
So that was a demo that I just did.

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:28.360
Sorry, if I could go back to the slides.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.100
This is an important thing that
most of you should already know,

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.900
but some of you may not know.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:43.390
The difference between save as export
and save as self-contained and save

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.810
as what QuickTime names normally.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.650
And this is a very, very important thing.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.520
If you bring me, that's why I left my
media open on the player.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.190
Some of the media that I have in there,
I want to save,

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.400
but without recompression.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:05.590
For example, the one that has the mask,
I want to compress that one.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.460
I want to make it into smaller video
that would be deployed on the web.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.500
Right now it's a .db file.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.250
On the other hand, the one that has the
Marina stop animation,

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:21.420
that one has the Flash player on top,
which if I recompress,

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.100
the Flash player is going
to be rendered onto video,

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.050
and my interactivity is going to be gone.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.060
I want to keep the
Flash independent from the video.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.850
So that's where you use
the save or the export.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.500
So save as is going to make
a movie self-contained.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:40.670
Actually, Save As, self-contained movie,
is actually going to

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:41.760
make a movie fast start.

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.950
So if for any reason you have
a movie that for some reason

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:46.770
when you deploy it on the web,
it does not fast start,

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.390
it's because something was changed
in the movie when it was saved.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.470
Sometimes Cleaner 5 and I think
Cleaner 6 still has that bug.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.890
You make a movie that's
supposed to be fast start,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.900
and it does not fast start.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.270
You have to download the whole
thing first and then play it.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.690
You can fix that by opening the
movie in the QuickTime Player,

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:07.600
Save As, self-contained.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.810
It will make it fast start by default.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.400
It compresses the movie
header and flattens the file,

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.600
which means that it just makes it
a little tiny smaller and puts the

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.650
header at the front of the document.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.930
That's what makes it fast start.

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.390
It also copies the media to the
new file without recompression.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.750
So in this particular case where
I have the Marina movie and it's

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:30.830
the flash track on top referenced
to another external flash document,

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:34.770
when I go Save As, self-contained,
it's going to copy the flash media

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:38.710
into the movie and will break any
dependencies from any other files,

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:42.040
which is most important,
particularly on the web.

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.930
So how many people have you seen that?

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.270
You open up a QuickTime movie.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:49.460
It opens perfectly fine on your computer,
even though it's coming from the web.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.110
But if you try it on another computer
that has exactly the same settings,

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.590
you open up the movie and it has a
whining message from QuickTime saying

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.610
that the media could not be
found if you want to search it.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.030
Well, that's because the movie was
not saved as self-contained.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.160
Thank you.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.350
Now, Save Normal, it allows you to save
references on the media,

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:10.190
which means does not copy the media.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.980
Think of the example where
I made the image sequence,

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.550
and I have 75 documents in there.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.900
Right now, that movie that I have open
on the QuickTime player,

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.790
it's actually referencing
all 75 documents.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.340
So, if I move that movie somewhere else,
I need to move all 75

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.240
movies somewhere else.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:31.620
Which is really cool,
because if I do it on

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.400
my machine over here,
just by saving with

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:39.100
dependencies as normal,
I can just make a really tiny document

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.530
without actually taking my hard drive,
or taking a lot of

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:43.950
space in my hard drive.

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.300
Having said that,
most of the times you would

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.870
not use that for deployment.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.110
Another thing is when
you just save normal,

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:53.140
it breaks fast start.

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:56.780
So, if you open up a document,
you add a frame, and you just save,

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.000
that will not make it fast start.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.140
You actually have to select File,
Save as Self-contained.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:06.270
Otherwise, it will not be fast start.

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.690
Export.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.200
Export is when you actually
compress the media.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.080
You go file, export.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.150
Well, there's actually one
exception to that rule,

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.000
and it's when you're
dealing with QuickTime VR.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.100
But for the most part,
when you're in video,

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:27.210
and you select file, export,
you will recompress the media.

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:30.510
One typical mistake that
newcomers to QuickTime do is

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.700
they have a Sorenson video movie,
for example.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:37.440
They take it in QuickTime Player,
then they select file, export,

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:42.020
thinking that they're going to make it
smaller by recompressing it further.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.400
Yeah, you will be recompressing it,
which is not what you want in

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.000
an already compressed movie.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.470
You're actually going to lose more
quality than what you already lost.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.040
But a cool thing is, for example,
in the case of the Marina,

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.350
I'm going to export the document,
and I'm going to change the size.

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:01.120
I'm going to apply a filter,
and that's the one that

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.870
I ended up using in the player.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:09.030
So if I could go back to the PowerBook,
please.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.130
That's my DVD Studio Pro project.

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.990
Let me get out of there.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:20.270
Let me get out of DVD Studio Pro.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:22.940
Actually, there's nothing there.

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:26.910
That's because everything should
be in the QuickTime Player.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.970
So I'll show you this one.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.840
Don't need to say that.

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.580
This is an example.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:39.680
I've got my-- actually,
this is not a good example right now.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.710
Sorry about that.

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:52.700
[Transcript missing]

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.560
Okay, give me a second.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.780
I've got to prepare the
image sequence again,

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.440
but it takes no time.

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.490
So I'm going to re-import
the image sequence.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.840
Import image sequence
or open image sequence.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.120
Select my image sequence for the
marina at 10 frames per second.

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.040
And the one that I added
the Flash Player to,

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.950
it was a 256 by 192 video.

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.070
It also had different RGB values.

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.500
I don't know if you noticed
that it had more saturation.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:30.800
It had better, well, I think the colors,
I like the saturated colors.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.260
So in this particular case,
I do want to compress this

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.540
thing to a smaller version.

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:40.520
Right now, it's a referencing movie that
refers to all 75 documents.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.150
Check this out.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.570
See, it refers to all of these documents.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.540
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba, all 75 of them.

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.740
So I want to compress this movie.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:50.620
Because I want to compress,
I go through the export,

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.560
not to the save selection.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.230
And I'm going to compress
to a QuickTime movie.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:59:05.100
[Transcript missing]

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:10.370
So I already modified my hue, saturation,
and lightness as a filter.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.690
And also the size.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.010
I don't want this humongous 640 by 480.

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:17.100
I actually want a 256 by 192 document.

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:21.760
So you click on the Size button,
and you can enter whatever size you want.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.820
And click OK.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.020
Click OK.

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.090
And let me save this document as--

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:34.340
Marina Compressed.

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:38.670
And I'm just gonna wait for
the little bar to go through.

00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:40.100
It's compressing the movie to MPEG-4.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:40.900
It has no audio.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.800
It's just a video.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:48.190
But it's resizing it, applying a filter,
and applying the codec.

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:55.200
[Transcript missing]

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.700
Now I was supposed to save
the QuickTime VR movie

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.920
that had the little logo,
but unfortunately this thing

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:08.120
crashed on me big time,
and I'm not going to stop for that.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.280
So this is what it looks like now.

01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.610
The save as version.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.400
You see the color values are different.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.840
File size, of course, is quite different.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.540
You can also see in the info window,
the file size of the original

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.800
would be around 65 megs.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.090
And the size of this new one, whoops,
that's another one.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.960
The size of this new one
is just 227 kilobytes.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.470
So it has been compressed,
it has been applied filter,

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:42.500
and this is the one which I added
the flash track for controlling.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.400
So let me actually do that.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.020
Let me actually go through that process,
which is adding the flash controller.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.180
Length matches, copy, paste, select all,
add scale.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:00.160
Go into the GINFO window
for the flash track,

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.960
apply the graphics mode.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.440
As you can see,
I've been doing this for a while.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.050
And it's already done.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.100
Get out of here.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:11.510
Now, this document here has
pretty much everything.

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:14.660
But if I go File, Export,
and recompress again,

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:17.000
it's going to render the flash to video,
and that's not.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.680
That's actually going
to lose interactivity.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.140
And right now, if you take a look at
the file section here,

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:26.040
it actually depends on two documents,
which is also not good if

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.760
I deploy this thing on the web.

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.280
I need to save it as a single document.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.430
And at that point,
that's where you would use Save As,

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:35.990
Self-Contained.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.290
By default, it's saved normally.

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:41.220
I don't understand why,
but Save As Self-Contained.

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:46.100
Marina flash

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.320
And you're going to notice
how the Marina Flash does

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:53.360
not depend on anybody else.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.980
Because I saved as self-contained,
it's also fast start.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.380
So if I upload this
thing to the web server,

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.560
it's going to start playing as
soon as it has enough media.

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:06.090
You don't have to wait for the
whole 227 kilobytes to download.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.360
Well, on a 56K motor,
my guess is quite a bit of media.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:18.180
Okay, I said that preview was
part of QuickTime Pro,

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.500
and not many people know about that.

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:23.050
But let me show you how preview works.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:27.760
Has anybody ever heard or
worked with QTIF images?

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:31.180
QuickTime Image Format,
I think is what it's called.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.360
And nobody's raising their hand.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.740
Okay, I'm getting into a territory that
has not been touched by my audience.

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:42.700
OK, QTIF images.

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:45.830
Let me set the perspective for this.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.360
How many of you have seen a
QuickTime movie that tries to

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.060
be played by the Windows media
player on a Windows machine?

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.260
And a few of you say, yeah.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:55.840
Oh, yeah.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.140
Well, the reason for that is, again,
and Frank was talking

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.800
about it in the morning,
like, for God's sake,

01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:04.280
having the three players in one machine.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.570
Well, some people do that.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:06.820
Actually, most people do that.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.090
They have the three players.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:12.380
And depending on which one was the last
one you installed or the user installed,

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.850
that would most of the times take
the extensions of other media files

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.140
and try to play those media files.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.460
So what's happening in that case
is that the Windows Media Player is

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.300
trying to open the .mov document.

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:26.060
And, of course,
having a Sorenson Video or an MPEG-4,

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.390
which is not supported by Windows Media,
Windows Media just says, no,

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.550
your movie was not authored properly.

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:33.240
That's totally misleading.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.400
What's happening, again,
is the Windows Media is

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.800
opening the QuickTime movie.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.180
Apple had made, I don't know since when,
I think it was QuickTime 3,

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.320
that they came up with this thing
called QuickTime Image File Format,

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:48.480
which is images,
whatever images that QuickTime supports,

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:54.240
wrapped around a QuickTime container
and saved as what's called a QTIF.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.300
It's an image file.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.190
The good thing about those
is that Windows Media,

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:04.410
or Rio, or nobody else of today has
appropriated that extension.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:09.390
So you can embed this QTIF image.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.840
And then you will definitely know
that if QuickTime is installed,

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.870
QuickTime will use that image,
or QuickTime will be used to render

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.500
that image in the web browser,
which is really powerful.

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:23.870
And the example is quite simple.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.340
I have a picture taken
from my QuickTime VR,

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.340
which is just a pic.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.130
I'm opening Photoshop.

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.120
And no, it's actually in simple text.

01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:38.720
Anyway,
this is just a pic that I'm going to

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:44.230
use in my web page just to be able to--
as a poster movie that you click on it

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:46.900
and pops up in my QuickTime VR movie.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:48.620
So this is a PICT.

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.600
I'm going to open it up in preview.

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:53.840
And because I do have
QuickTime Pro installed,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.620
or licensed, as you would expect,

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.150
You got an export option.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:03.400
I'm going to be really sincere with you.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.100
That export option is
pretty useless in preview,

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:13.160
because it exports to the typical
file formats that you would know,

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.630
which most of the times you
would actually want to do that in

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.880
Photoshop or in other applications.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.430
But in this particular case,
the QTIF image that I want to create,

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:26.100
Photoshop does not create
QTIF images for some bizarre reason.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.290
But preview does.

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.200
QuickTime image.

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:34.660
So what, what, what,
if I click on the options,

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.190
I can go and change my codec.

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:39.370
So my pic,
I can turn into a JPEG and wrap

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:44.700
it around the QuickTime file
format with a .QTIF extension.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:51.530
Which Windows Media or Rio will
not dare to open because those

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.530
guys don't know what QTIF is.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.840
So click OK, click OK.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:59.360
And I'm going to call this thing--

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.370
Just that sand.qtif.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.660
Save.

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:09.490
And if I open that document,

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:13.500
It's just a JPEG wrapped
around the QuickTime container.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.640
Now I can grab that image,
embed it around HTML,

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:21.620
turn it into a poster movie,
and the Julia Childs thing.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.350
You put it in the oven,
and you just pull it out.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.190
I already wrote my HTML for this.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.040
Well, it wasn't actually me,
it was Pejot,

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.630
which is a freeware application
that I would recommend you guys use

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.190
that writes the HTML code for you.

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.340
Okay, sorry about that.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.340
I should have shown you.

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:48.570
If I go to the applications in here.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:51.950
That's what it's called.

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:55.680
And I think it's Windows too.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.800
It's also OS 9, OS 10, and Windows.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.550
It's made by Brick, I think, in France.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.350
Freeware.

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:07.260
I don't,
but if you go to Version Tracker,

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.080
if you go to just Google and
search for Page Oat and QuickTime,

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.760
it will find that thing.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.260
It's beautiful.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.880
Let me actually show you how it works.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.490
And in this case,
I'm actually going to... Yeah,

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.340
I have a few minutes for this.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:29.140
If you just drag and
force open it in page on,

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:31.760
what it does, it grabs the size,
height and width.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.630
If it was a QuickTime movie,
you could specify if you

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.990
want controller or autoplay.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.600
In this case,
I don't because it's just an image.

01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:40.500
And actually,
I want to make it into a poster

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.480
image where you click on it.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.620
It opens up the QuickTime VR in
the QuickTime player.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:50.370
I think that's in the advanced
section where I can specify an href.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.100
And what I want to open up in the
href is my QuickTime VR movie.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:55.580
Copy.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.440
Paste.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.000
Oops.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.500
Oops.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.900
Oh, oh, oh, wrong place, wrong place.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:13.040
What did I do wrong?

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.440
Okay, I'm changing the name over here.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.470
That's bad.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.450
Sorry about that.

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.620
The href is my QuickTime movie,
and I want to open it

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.910
in the QuickTime player.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.900
So what I'm doing is I'm
making a poster movie that

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.460
will appear on the web browser.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:37.700
You click on that poster movie,
and up comes in the QuickTime player,

01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:42.140
the QuickTime VR with the text
and my little logo at the top.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.260
So I'm entering the URL,
QuickTime player.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.240
And if you take a look over here,
it says show code.

01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:55.840
You don't have to make a typo
for that class ID anymore.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.510
Copy?

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:04.840
Go into BBEdit or into
your favorite HTML editor,

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.320
which mine happens to be BBEdit.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:15.870
And paste the code.

01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:24.000
The change in size over here so
you guys can read from the back.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.640
And as you can see,
it has the name of the source, the href,

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.300
everything.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:37.200
This program is worth its download
15 million times in dollars.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:45.190
And so when you take a
look at the final version,

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.520
This is what the final
version looks like on Safari,

01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:53.690
which I just haven't had the chance
to upgrade to the final version,

01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:54.430
to the 1.0.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.560
But you're going to see I've got my
QTIF displayed by the QuickTime plugin.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.560
And if I click on that,
maybe I should have my

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:05.070
QuickTime VR popping up
in the QuickTime player.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:12.540
So that's what a QTIF image does,
and that's what Preview does.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:17.420
I mean, not many people know all of that,
but Preview is part of QuickTime Pro.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:20.480
And the last thing that
I wanna talk about today,

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.030
I'm actually really
happy with the timing.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.780
I thought that I didn't have enough time.

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:31.490
But this is it.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.770
I have a single node QuickTime VR.

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:42.800
It's just one node.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.380
And let's say that for some
reason it's not fast starting.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.430
Your user has to download
the whole QuickTime VR.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.960
For some reason,
something got broken in the process.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.380
Now you need to make it fast start.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.950
Well, you would say file, save as.

01:10:56.970 --> 01:10:59.000
But in this particular case,
this is the only,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.870
or QuickTime VR is the only
exception where if you go to export.

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:06.450
For the single VR,
there's an option over here that says,

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:10.710
movie to fast start QuickTime VR movie,
which will actually

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.580
flatten the QuickTime VR.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.990
And if you want, you can actually add--

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.690
You can add a preview image.

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:22.700
So you could have a preview
image that is either,

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.240
people,
what most people do is they have a

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.080
low res version of the QuickTime VR.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.300
But you can have something else,
maybe like your logo or

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.540
like some other image.

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.920
Doesn't have to be
necessarily the same one.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.600
And you can import it over here.

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:42.020
In this case, I'm not gonna import,
I'm just gonna use the default,

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.720
which is just grabbing a
smaller version at Blur.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.280
And this thing will,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.980
actually make it fast start.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:58.080
I'm removing the spaces
for web compatibility,

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.080
fast.

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.600
And off it goes.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.660
In this particular case,
the export will not recompress the media.

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:06.960
It will just recompress for the preview,
but not the actual VR.

01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:10.260
So it's not going to
lose any further quality.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.310
Now the reason why I have
two QuickTime VRs in this

01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:17.140
particular folder is because
this is another typical example.

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.810
Most, well not most people,
but a lot of people,

01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:21.600
they make QuickTime VRs,
mostly for CD-ROM, let's say,

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.980
in a multi-node environment.

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.980
So this particular movie,
it's a multi-node movie,

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:27.430
which this is node number one.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.920
If you go down there,
that's node number two.

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:33.230
And if you go over here into
the kitchen and out the door,

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.750
you get node number three.

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:39.360
So this, there are three nodes in here,
making the movie relatively large.

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:44.260
If you take a look at
the G-Info window again,

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:47.850
we can find out what size this thing is.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:56.000
And it's 570K, so let's say that 560K is
too large for your audience,

01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:59.490
and you don't want, maybe they will never
click on the second node,

01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:01.290
and you wasted all that bandwidth.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.440
Well, how many of you guys knew
that you can grab a multi-node

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.590
QuickTime VR in the QuickTime player,
go again into the export window,

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.340
and because it's a QuickTime VR,
a multi-node QuickTime VR,

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.020
the options change in here.

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.160
I cannot make the single
node as it appeared before,

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:24.880
but there's this other one down below,
and I see some people stretching their

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.570
heads to see at the bottom of the screen.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:32.690
It says separate single node movies.

01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:34.920
What this thing's going to do
is going to separate the three

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.560
nodes into independent movies.

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:41.500
Now this is really cool,
because you can also generate some HTML.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.380
Now unfortunately,
I think that HTML is relatively outdated,

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.460
meaning I don't think it
does add the object tag.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.540
But at least it gets you going.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:54.020
So you can control what
appears on the HTML tag.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.500
And it says target equals myself.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:00.250
So it will actually generate the
HTML where it will keep the number

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:06.480
of the nodes and the linking of
the nodes so it targets itself.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.400
And the same thing,
you can go into the flattener,

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.140
and if you want, you can apply a preview,
your own preview or whatever.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.840
Click OK.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.310
Multinode.

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:20.040
Export.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.300
Save.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.900
And take a look at what
QuickTime did for us.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:35.500
It made three movies,
which if I open them individually,

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.490
these are my three nodes.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.880
One node over here-- whoops.

01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:44.270
Anybody working with
QuickTime VR around here?

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.160
Yes, another node, and another node.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.990
And it also made the HTML, well again,
it's not the full HTML,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.060
it's just the embed tag over here,
where you would need to

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:57.880
actually add the object tag.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:09.050
But if I just do something like this,
if I make a new HTML document,

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.050
new HTML document.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.500
Untitled, whatever.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:16.870
And copy and paste one
of these guys in there.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.900
Paste.

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:21.980
In this particular case,
because it's Safari,

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:23.240
I don't need the object tag.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.900
Save as.

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.980
Let me save it in the same
location as my other VRs.

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:33.200
QuickTime VR export.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:49.200
[Transcript missing]

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.740
It links to the three VRs.

01:15:56.770 --> 01:16:02.350
Because it already wrote the code with
the ID numbers of the different nodes.

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:04.980
So if somebody never clicks
on this particular node,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.530
well, they never get to download
that particular movie.

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:10.420
So that's a save on bandwidth.

01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:14.340
And the very last thing that I want
to talk about really briefly is

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.440
Something called QuickTime Media Links.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.940
Has anybody ever heard
of QuickTime Media Links?

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.680
Okay, you guys need to take
the advanced courses.

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:26.480
This, this thing, this,
this QuickTime Media Links are,

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.310
if you take a look at the QuickTime 6
documentation in the geeky side of the,

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.810
of the Apple site, in the developer site,
it talks about what it's

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:35.530
called a pre-flight movie.

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.020
Or a pre-flight,
which can test if your movie

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.080
or if your player complies with
certain playback parameters.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.430
And if it does, it, something happens.

01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:49.500
In this particular case,
in this particular example, let me,

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:56.310
let me go back to, to, hey,
where did my stuff go?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.600
Desktop demo files for the QTIF.

01:17:03.630 --> 01:17:07.500
Let's say that I want this
QuickTime VR movie that I've

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.910
shown a number of times.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.890
Let's say that we wanted
to go full screen.

01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:19.200
But I want to make it go full
screen without actually going into

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.360
Live Stage Pro or into anywhere else
because I've got this thing already done.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.760
Well, you can make what is called a QT,
a QuickTime media link document,

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.240
which ultimately is just a text document.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.670
It's an XML text document that will
force or that will indicate the

01:17:33.670 --> 01:17:36.780
QuickTime player to take certain actions.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:41.190
And the QuickTime player will help
you create that text document.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.300
If you go File, Export,
you see down here at the bottom it says,

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:47.420
whoops, that's not the one.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.540
Here.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.420
Move it to QuickTime Media Link.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.690
Move it to QuickTime Media Link.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.900
And this is the one that will actually
make that document call a preflight.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.480
See the extension changes.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.540
I should actually save it here.

01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:03.880
And now I click on the options.

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:06.840
Now, the URL,
this is the URL that is going to happen

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.360
when this document gets played or open.

01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:16.110
And what I want is I want that URL,
which is the QuickTime VR movie,

01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:22.400
to go-- auto-playing controller-- to
go full screen on the QuickTime player.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.100
So I've got this thing
checked for full screen.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.080
Now, this will not modify
the QuickTime VR movie.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.630
This is actually going to tell the
QuickTime player that the movie

01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:36.620
in that URL should go full screen
without even modifying or touching

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.870
the actual QuickTime VR movie.

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:42.800
So I click OK.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.340
Let me save that as the-- how
do I want to call this thing?

01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:50.080
Media link.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:19:00.000
[Transcript missing]

01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:04.320
If I take a look at the finder,
it makes something that appears

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.180
with a QuickTime movie icon.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:10.350
It is a QTL, which actually,
if you open it in BBEdit,

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.600
it's a text document.

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:19.170
Now if you embed this document,
what I've done in this case,

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.180
I made a similar version
of what I had before,

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.970
where the one I'm embedding is the QTIO.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.280
See that embed?

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.180
It's the QTIF, sorry.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.360
Hold on, what am I doing?

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.240
Well, this is quite advanced.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.200
It's the QTIF.

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:48.780
linking to the QTIL,
which actually triggers the QuickTime VR.

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:50.460
Did that make any sense?

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.880
Okay, it did make sense.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:55.630
So if we take a look at, on the browser,

01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:59.340
If we open this movie on the browser,
let me actually quit

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.290
the player altogether.

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.850
If I open that in the browser.

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:08.060
I have my QuickTime image.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:14.960
And when I click, it will trigger the
QuickTime media link that will,

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:20.200
in effect,
link to the QuickTime VR full screen.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.970
All without changing
the actual QuickTime VR.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.740
So the player starts to bounce.

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.000
Off goes full screen.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.420
And that's it.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:41.540
So that concludes my presentation.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:45.600
I'm just going to flip
over here to the roadmap.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.710
And if you guys want to
flip over to the podium.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.080
Amy.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:56.760
This shows you really quickly the
other sessions that we have going

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.400
on in this room and the room right
on the other side of this wall.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:05.260
This is for the rest of the day,
so you can map out where you want to go.

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:08.160
I don't know if you want
to take some questions.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.080
We don't have much time, though.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.680
Yeah, we actually are out of time.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.080
So what I'd recommend
that you guys do is,

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.540
you know what Francesco looks like now.

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:17.780
I'd recommend that you find
him throughout the conference.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:20.130
He'll be here for, are you here all week,
Francesco?

01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:20.590
Oh, absolutely.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.660
Yes, all right.

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.330
So thank you very much.

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.360
And actually, let me just show you,
we have contact info here.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.940
Francesco and Guillermo Ortiz,
our Apple developer connection

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.200
contact for you guys.

01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:34.050
All right.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.780
There's a bunch of information there,
different URLs, different books,

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:41.700
where you can get some information
and use the QuickTime player.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:45.100
You can also use the help
section in the QuickTime player.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.770
Just go file or help,
and not many people know that.
