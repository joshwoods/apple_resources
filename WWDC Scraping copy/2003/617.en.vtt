WEBVTT

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Good morning.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.250
How's everyone doing?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.660
So you've all got your
coffee and your donuts?

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.460
Any donuts this morning?

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.300
No, not yet?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.820
They'll be coming, I'm sure.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.410
They'll have all the sugar you
need by the end of the day.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.530
So we're here to talk about desktop
and server migration to Mac OS X.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.700
My name is JD Mankovsky.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.740
I'm the consulting engineer for
US Business and Federal for the US.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.780
So what does that mean?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.970
It means that I live in a hotel.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.380
I know a lot of the flight
attendants by their first name.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.420
And so I spent about 60% of
my time in front of customers,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.250
and I know quite a few of you,
basically understanding your

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.820
needs as far as features for,
as an example, for Panther right now,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.250
but for any future releases
of our operating system.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.750
So I spent a lot of time
with enterprise accounts,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.140
understanding what they need from Apple.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.820
And then I spent about 30% to 40% of
my time back in Cupertino with our

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.840
product marketing and engineering
folks and making sure that we

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.280
actually build the products you need.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.280
So that's kind of my role for Apple.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.300
And so, you know,
basically what I'm going to do today

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.880
is kind of give you an overview of some
of the tools and best practices that,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.110
you know, our customers are using
today to migrate to Mac OS X.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.070
And then, you know, with Panther,
there's a lot of new features

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.050
that we think will fit the
needs of the enterprise.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.620
And what I mean by enterprise is,
you know, business, federal, you know,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.760
I consider education enterprise as well.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.050
So if there's education people in here,
when I mention enterprise,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.950
it does include higher ed, of course,
and K-12.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
And so we're going to talk about some
of those tools that are going to be made

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.250
available to you soon by the end of the
year with Panther and Panther Server.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.690
And as you've seen in the past year,
a lot of our developers are as

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.040
well migrating to Mac OS X and
porting their apps to Mac OS X.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.800
And we'll talk about that in a second.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.840
But basically, 2000.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.740
2003 is the year to move from 9 to 10.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.260
So for those of you who
haven't done this yet,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.280
this is really the year to do this.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.040
And we'll try and illustrate and show you
some of the best practices in a second.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.980
So the first thing I wanted to do is,
like we did last year at

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.580
the developer conference,
I just wanted to have fun with Keynote.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.990
That's all.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.980
I like the bouncing feature.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.750
It's kind of cool.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.000
So this is another cool feature keynote.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.270
But basically, last year,
we put Mac OS 9 to rest

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.360
from the developer side,
and this year,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.710
we're putting Mac OS 9 to rest
from the customer perspective.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.060
And again,
classic is still gonna be here,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.530
but as you know,
the G5 and all the new machines

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.680
are not booting Mac OS 9,
and so this is the time,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.180
this is the year to migrate to 10.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.140
So what are you gonna learn?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.990
Well, when I go and meet with customers,
what they ask me quite often is,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.190
give us the ammunition,
give us the reasons why

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.220
we should go to Mac OS X.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.930
And so that'll be my first point,
is try to give you the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.020
top 10 reasons that,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.640
I think and our customers feel
like are good reasons to migrate

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.700
from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X,
as well as migrating

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.870
from Windows to Mac OS X,
because that's another thing

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.860
that we'll talk about today.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.830
And we'll also have a
special guest from Pixar,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.110
who is actually going to
talk about how they migrated

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.170
their Macs from OS 9 to OS X.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.930
And they did some really,
really cool stuff, and Gabe will actually

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.580
show that in a few minutes.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.950
And then we'll talk a little
bit about the Windows side,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.330
because again, you know,
we started with the Switcher

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.920
campaign on the consumer side.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.480
But I feel like with
Panther and Panther Server,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.530
we have a really good shot to actually
go beyond the consumer and beyond the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.910
creative groups and actually replace some
Windows desktops and some Windows servers

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.440
with Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.220
And to do this,
we'll actually show you some really

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.900
cool demos today with Eric Clement,
who will show you actually some

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.400
pretty interesting integration demos.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.080
So what are the top 10
reasons to move to OS X?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.740
And again, this is feedback that I've
got from customers that have

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.030
migrated to Mac OS X already.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.980
So the number one bullet that
I would think of is security,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.780
right?

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.560
Mac OS X's foundation, when we built,
when we designed Mac OS X,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.330
it was built around, you know,
a very robust Core OS,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.850
but security was built in, not bolted on,
like some of the other

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.390
operating systems out there.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.360
So my first point is, you know,
security built in, not bolted on.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.910
And you can see that
this year with Kerberos.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.300
You can see we're pushing
pretty heavily Kerberos.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.480
Some other things that we haven't
talked about is smart card support.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.490
So we have smart card
support in Mac OS X.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.100
And so, you know,
you can also look at that.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.480
That's a pretty interesting roadmap
as far as we have a lot of demand from

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.110
our federal groups on smart cards,
but we think this can apply as

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.600
well to the business and to the
enterprise where they could very

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.180
easily put in a smart card reader,
a USB smart card reader, put it in,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.190
and basically type in
a pin number and get,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.560
instead of having the logging
prompt and having to remember

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.120
their name and password,
they can actually do that with a

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.530
smart card and with a pin number.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.550
Stability.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.520
Mac OS X is a much more
stable OS than Mac OS 9.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.840
And you've all experienced that already.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.400
I mean,
even though an application can quit,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.000
and it does happen,
and I'm sure you've seen that

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.860
today or this week if you've
played with the betas of Panther,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.860
right, or the WWDC build.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.680
So it is much more stable than Mac OS 9,
and the beauty of it is it

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.900
can force quit an application,
and it doesn't bring

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.080
the whole system down.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.710
Directory integration,
that's something that I've

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.840
heard a lot about throughout all
those meetings with accounts,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.140
is they really want us to fit in and
integrate with their back-end directory,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.460
and that means LDAP integration,
it means active directory

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.050
integration as well.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:09:15.200
[Transcript missing]

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.700
Robust Unix-based foundation.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.900
So yes,
Mac OS X is a very robust Unix OS.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:27.760
But what I discovered with our customers
is when we talked to the Mac groups,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.120
now we're also as well
talking to the Unix group.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.310
And we've got those people pretty
much switched over as well,

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.600
right?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:58.440
Those Unix people had a Windows computer
and they had a Unix box,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.540
right?

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.590
They had a Unix computer to
run their email and run the

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.590
productivity suite like Office,
you know, Word, Excel, and so forth.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.590
And now they've basically replaced
their Windows computer and their

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.590
Unix workstation with a Mac OS X box,
right?

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.590
And so...

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.950
You should get,
if you're a Mac IT person,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.960
you should get with your Unix people
and get to know them and actually really

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.020
work together as a group to support the
Macs and to support the Unix stations

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.280
that you have in your environment.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.670
And that's also the fact that the
Mac OS X is Unix also makes it

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.970
easier to find people that can
manage and help support those Macs.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.260
Is anyone with, you know,
a Solaris background or a

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.540
Linux background can actually
now help support the Macs.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.110
It's very, it's much easier for them to
do that than to learn Mac OS 9,

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.070
believe me.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.240
Software developers
have transitioned to X.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.920
Great examples from Adobe,
from Microsoft.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.160
I mean,
they make phenomenal applications.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.480
And so they have transitioned to X.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.370
And that's one more reason to move
to Mac OS X from your perspective.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.660
And then licensing costs.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.320
That's something that I hear a lot about.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.330
A lot of complaints from customers
is that licensing costs for

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.290
Microsoft are pretty expensive.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.760
And we think we have a, you know,
pretty good solution with our maintenance

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.840
agreements that we have in place today.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.640
So let's talk about some
general migration guidelines.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.330
If you haven't migrated to Mac OS X yet,
what are some of the key

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.080
things that you should look at
before starting that migration?

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.420
Well, the first one is plan
your directory strategy,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.180
right?

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.290
What I mean by directory strategy,
I mean picking the right

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.500
backend authentication method.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.500
And we like standards, right?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.120
Mac OS X is all based
around open standards.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.340
And so if you haven't planned,
if you haven't looked at a directory,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.650
a central directory strategy,
we highly recommend you look

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.070
at LDAP-based solutions,
right?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.940
And those could be from Sun,
they can be from Novell.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.290
I mean,
eDirectory is a phenomenal solution

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.340
from a directory perspective.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.040
It could be from IBM.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.510
It can be from Apple,
using our new open LDAP-based

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.800
LDAP replication server.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.200
So, you know,
Active Directory is an interesting,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.980
you know, it's a product from Microsoft.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.700
It's not quite standards-based, right?

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.230
It's kind of a mixture of LDAP, Kerberos,
plus some other things.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.730
So we like standards.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.140
And so if you haven't looked at it,
look at an LDAP-based

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.270
solution if you can.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.910
If you've gone AD,
we understand and we'll fit in.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.350
Plan your desktop management.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.860
So again, using workgroup management,
make sure that you create and

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.960
you set up your OS X servers
with your workgroup management,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.630
and you've defined that and created
your groups and basically done

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.460
all the work in advance before
deploying workgroup management,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.990
and that you've actually tested
that in a small environment.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.320
50 users, 10 to 50 users is a good number
to actually deploy this and test

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.700
that before you go throughout
to your hundreds of Mac users.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.210
Get certified, right?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.080
We have a wonderful
certification program.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.900
That's something that our customers
have been requesting for years,

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.850
and it's really, really important.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.940
I mean,
I've been using Mac OS since 1984.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.640
I know Mac OS 9.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.100
I know every extension,
but Mac OS X is a different beast.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.700
There's a lot of potential, right,
in this operating system,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.740
a lot of potential,
and by getting certified,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.840
we'll give you a lot of that.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:38.100
Those tips and a lot of that
really interesting knowledge

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.260
that the trainers have,
because a lot of them come

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.290
from a Unix background.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.730
And they can really help
you get jump-started,

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.090
and it's really important that you get
certified for X before starting this

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.500
Mac OS X migration and deployment.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.480
So this is the website.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.450
Check it out.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.590
Sign up for AppleCare support.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:03.900
We have a pretty nice
AppleCare server software support.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.700
It's not the $9.99.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.700
The $9.99, that's really for hardware.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.990
It's in the $5,000 range,
and that includes very high-level

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.140
support from Unix people who can
actually help you write scripts and

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.510
do some pretty interesting stuff.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.080
So we have those plans in place to
support enterprise-level customers.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.920
Get familiar with the new Apple tools,
right?

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.320
So today you're familiar
with Carbon Copy Cloner,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.800
phenomenal tool.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.360
Net Restore is another
one that's really cool.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.800
In Panther timeframe,
we have a new version of Disk Utility.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.120
We have a new version of
the Network Image Utility,

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.840
which is basically,
which takes a lot of the

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.580
Carbon Copy Cloner features
and integrates it in this tool.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.000
And then we have, of course,
Apple Remote Desktop,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.790
which is a phenomenal product.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.440
I mean, I go and meet with
customers on the PC side,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.050
and the comparable solutions
are worth thousands of dollars.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.400
And here you can get
Apple Remote Desktop for $1,000

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.780
for unlimited client seats.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.350
And that's just a phenomenal product.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.810
And that's one admin, by the way.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.770
So we got some really good tools
from Apple that can achieve a

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:21.680
lot of that management for a
pretty attractive price point.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.620
And by the way, disk copy,
if you're using disk copy today,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.880
that's actually part of
disk utility in Panther.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.630
So don't look for the disk
copy utility application.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.490
It's now embedded into disk utility.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.070
So those are the three tools
that we just talked about.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:47.160
So we're going to first start
with the 9 to Mac OS X migration.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.460
And so what I wanted to do first is kind
of give you a quick basic implementation.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.700
And what I mean by basic implementation
is basically a three-step process.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:02.630
I've summarized it into a three-step
process to migrate from 9 to Mac OS X.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.480
And by the way,
this applies to Jaguar as well.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.790
So the Mac OS 9 to migration,
the first thing that users can

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.890
do is they can use Sherlock 2,
if you remember Sherlock 2, in Mac OS 9,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.290
and they can find the user's
files on the hard drive.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.700
They find their files
on the local hard drive.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.300
You can do some of the advanced
search capabilities to do that.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.060
Of course,
you can write a little Apple script

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.370
that does that automatically.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.820
The second thing is, again,
if you've planned your directory and

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:37.150
your desktop management properly,
it probably means the user now has... a

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.200
Mac OS X home directory waiting for him,
right?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.440
So over AFP, you can connect to that
user's home directory,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.690
and he would have, you know,
his document folder, his picture folder,

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.780
his movie folder.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.200
And he can then, from his OS 9 desktop,
copy all those files over

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.970
to his virtual Mac OS X home
directory that's waiting for him.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.740
And then the third step is basically,
as an admin,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.910
you've created a custom image, right?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.940
Using the new tools or using Carburetor,
you can copy and clone it.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:13.350
You've created your Jaguar image,
and you've added all your applications

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.260
that you use on a regular basis.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.700
You've built that image,
and you're now ready to

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.760
deploy it on that desktop,
right?

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.750
And so in 10.3,
we have a new feature in Disk Utility.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.090
So again, you could boot from a CD,
go to the Restore tab,

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:32.790
put in the HTTP URL where
that custom image is located,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.540
and basically restore the machine.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.080
And when the user comes in,
you can see that the machine

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.080
is now ready to deploy.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.520
And when the user comes in,
and he's at the login window,

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.760
all he would have to do is put in
his name and password and get to

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.170
those files that he just copied
over when he was still on Mac OS 9.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.440
And you can do that with NetRestore,
again, today,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.580
with one of Mike Bombich's tools to
achieve the same thing if you want

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.320
to migrate from 9 to Jaguar today.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.440
So what I'd like to do now is actually
introduce Gabe Benveniste from Pixar.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.620
And they've done a phenomenal
migration deployment from 9 to 10.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.010
And Gabe is going to
talk to you about that.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:10.450
Thank you.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.150
How's everybody doing today?

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.020
I hope you went and saw
Finding Nemo last night upstairs.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.540
A lot of fun.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.480
So my name is Gabe Benveniste.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.090
I'm an admin at Pixar Animation Studios.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.270
And I'm going to talk to you
today about how we moved 500

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.240
of our Macs from OS 9 to OS X,
about how we were able to utilize the

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.280
Unix foundation that OS X has to easily
integrate with our infrastructure,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.640
and how we were able to take advantage of
how scriptable the operating system is.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.820
So we were able to use tools like
Python and Apple Script to really

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.880
streamline our whole migration process.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.440
The first thing we did is we
created our standard image using

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.730
Carbon Copy Cloner with--our
standard image is called the POX,

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.300
which is short for Pixar's OS X.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.800
POX consists of a latest
version of Mac OS X.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.620
We did a custom install and
left out the localization files.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.800
We installed a standard set of
applications that all of our users get,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.490
things like Office,
LaunchBar as a utility that we found

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.110
the users really responded well to.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.890
We also made specific network
and machine configurations.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.060
We disabled the accounts pref
pane so that we had control

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.060
over the creation of accounts.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.450
We disabled software update so that
we can control what software and

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.810
when gets updated on the machine.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.020
We also modified the user
template home directory.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.980
And this is a really cool tip
because you can go and change what

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.060
new home directories will look
like by going to System Library,

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.970
User Templates, English.lproj.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.000
You can change things like how
the default browser is set up,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.170
where the dock is placed,
what apps are in the dock.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.290
It's really, really great.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.220
So if you change that template,
whenever you make a new user,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.110
it'll have those changes.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.200
The second thing we did is we
made a FileMaker database for

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.450
planning and tracking our migration.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.750
The user goes and they fill out a
web form specifying what apps they

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.860
need outside of the standard base,
what printers they need configured,

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.600
what peripherals they may have set up,
and once that form is submitted,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.950
are scheduled for a migration.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.540
And when that time comes,
the admin goes and grabs their machine,

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.200
takes it to our lab,
and boots it up into OS 9.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.400
They make sure that the data
is in the correct place,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.320
either in the documents
folder or on their desktop.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.420
And the user was told on the migration
page to put their data there.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.640
We then restart the machine
off of a FireWire drive running

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.180
OS 9 and run this really cool
Python script we made called Rollout.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.650
What stage one of Rollout does
is it scans the OS 9 machine for

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.250
data matching a certain criteria.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.920
It copies that data to the
FireWire drive into a folder

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.600
resembling a home directory.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.840
Once that's done,
we take the FireWire drive and we

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.890
boot the new machine off of it,
and we wrote an

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.840
AppleScript Studio program called Epoxy.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.000
That's a front end for
Apple Software Store,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.640
or ASR.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.510
What it does is on launch,
it goes and checks a web

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.120
server to get the path to the
latest version of our pox.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.560
It then poxes the new machine.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.060
The admin can enter their email
address if they want to be notified

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.570
when it's done and can set the
machine to restart automatically.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.180
If the machine is new,
it doesn't have an LDAP record,

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.530
and so we made another
AppleScript Studio application called

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.870
HostMaker to take care of that.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:30.200
It allows the admin to enter the new
machine name and the primary user's name.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.240
It then goes and looks up
the user's name in LDAP,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.390
gets their information, where they sit,
what department they're in,

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.520
checks System Profiler for the
machine's serial number and MAC address,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.160
combines that information,
and creates a new host record.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.090
Once the LDAP information is up to
date and the machine's been poxed,

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.520
the admin runs another program we made in
AppleScript Studio called Configurator.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.060
On launch,
Configurator goes and pulls down

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.840
the machine's IP and the machine
name using the serial number

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.180
it got from System Profiler.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.300
It then automatically sets that
information in the machine,

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.350
and then the admin sets what
backup settings are going

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.120
to be used for the machine.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.850
And once the admin selects that,
the backup team is notified.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.060
The default user information was also
pulled down automatically on launch.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.960
The admin can specify whether or not
the user has administrative privileges,

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.910
can also specify what mailing
list to add the users to.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.380
By default,
when we build out an OS X machine,

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.230
we add the user to an OS X announced
mailing list so that they'll

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.560
get updated automatically if
we need to send out messages.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:44.230
The admin can also download the user's
picture from our intranet and set it

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.850
as their login icon automatically.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.420
If the admin wants to
create additional users,

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.170
all they have to do is
type in another login.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.600
That information is pulled from LDAP.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.790
All they have to do is press "Create."
Once all the users are created,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.800
we run stage two of our
Python script rollout,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.870
which takes the data off of the
FireWire drive and puts it into

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.190
the newly created home directories.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.050
Once a user is created,
the admin logs in as that user and runs

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.900
another AppleScript Studio application
we made called PrefMaker.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.130
What PrefMaker does is it automatically
configures Mail.app for the user based

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:22.340
on their name and login that it gets
from the local net info database.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.480
It also imports their stickies
and bookmarks automatically.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.480
And once that's done,
the machine's ready to be deployed.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.730
Thank you.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.820
The admin takes it to the user's desk,
sets it up, powers it on,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.550
and launches another
AppleScript Studio application

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.500
we made called TGIF.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.560
TGIF copies a shortcut to Welcome to
OS X at Pixar to the user's desktop,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.320
launches a web page,
and leaves it up for them

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.170
when the user comes in.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.090
Cleans up anything like
clears the recent bookmarks,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.130
empties the trash,
just makes the machine really just

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.290
ready for the user when they get in.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.110
It also synchronizes the
LDAP passwords to the local net

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.740
info passwords so that the users
have the right account information.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.530
It also deletes their keychain.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.070
and it also timestamps our migration
record for that machine to complete

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.090
so we can see how long it took to
do each migration so we can look for

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.590
ways to streamline it and kind of
identify bottlenecks that may exist.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.250
As you can see,
because of OS X's Unix Foundation,

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.430
we were really able to integrate
our tools with our infrastructure

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.640
and really leverage that power.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.450
And we were also able to use things
like Python and AppleScript to really

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.700
just streamline the whole process.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.470
And with these tools,
we minimize data entry,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.940
which not only takes a lot of time,
but also helps prevent machines

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.270
from being misconfigured.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.870
And we were also able to really
maximize on time savings.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.550
I mean,
not only was our process extremely fast,

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.430
but now from box to desk on a new user,
we can have a machine ready

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.700
for them in under 15 minutes.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.920
And we can also,
now that we have OS X out

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.850
there on all our machines,
we can build new tools to really assist

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.050
with our daily administrative tasks
and really just make everything a lot

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.500
easier so we can focus on bigger tasks as
opposed to taking care of little things.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.780
So that was our migration process.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.760
Thanks, man.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.990
So now we're going to talk
about migrating Windows clients

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.490
to Mac OS X Panther.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.840
So why migrate from Windows clients?

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.330
This is pretty easy.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.940
Yeah, that's pretty hard, isn't it?

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.460
So the first bullet again is security,
right?

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.850
I've been to some pretty
interesting accounts,

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.920
very large enterprise accounts,
and they're like, "Oh my God,

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.060
we just got the latest
Microsoft patch." And they apply

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.090
the latest Microsoft patch,
and what does it do?

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.400
It opens a whole bunch of
other holes into their network.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.810
And they're not very happy.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.480
And they're like, "Man,
every time you come,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.330
"we have this problem applying "those
Microsoft security patches." Like,

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.470
hmm, isn't that strange?

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.110
Stability.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.310
We know Mac OS X is a very
stable operating system,

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.880
and some would say more
stable than Windows.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.250
I would agree with that.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.850
Ease of use.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.620
Mac OS X is very easy to use.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.820
We've seen a lot of
people move from Windows,

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:30.900
even on the consumer side, to Mac OS X,
and it's been very easy to migrate,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.720
and they've been very
happy as far as using X.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.710
Save money on licensing costs.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.780
That's always interesting.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.190
Less need to apply
security in virus patches.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.380
Very interesting story here.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.180
Very, very, very large account.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:51.360
And when the Code Red virus hit,
you know, of course,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.820
all their servers went down.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.990
And they were actually using
Power Books to find the Windows 2000

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.860
servers that were affected by the virus,
which is pretty funny.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.800
So they were running around with
titaniums to find the servers

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.880
and to shut down the servers.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.310
And that was all done using Power Books.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.530
So that was pretty interesting.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.070
LDAP and Active Directory Connectivity.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.340
Now that we have that,
you'll see in the demo,

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.180
the process is pretty streamlined
to actually move a Windows desktop

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.510
user over to a Macintosh.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.280
And then, by the way,
we also have Office.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.920
And as you saw in Bud Tribble's
presentation on Monday,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.910
we should be getting a very
good exchange client from

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.400
Microsoft in the very near future.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.400
And so, again,
for those of you who have a

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.880
big exchange infrastructure,
you should definitely talk to your

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.880
Microsoft rep to get on the beta and
actually test that in your environment.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.090
There's actually an email
address that got sent for you to

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.480
request to be part of the beta.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.680
Thank you.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.260
And then Java, right?

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.260
I mean,
Java is a phenomenal cross-platform

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.860
development environment to actually
make sure that both your Mac and your

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.980
Windows users can actually use the tools
that you develop as an IT environment.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.250
And we have some phenomenal new
developer tools with Xcode that

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.010
really simplify the whole process.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.320
And as you saw with Gabe, I mean,
they wrote some phenomenal

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.760
AppleScript Studio front-end
applications in a matter of,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.350
you know, days.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.390
And so you should really look at that.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.520
You should really look
at AppleScript Studio.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.600
And if you were at the session yesterday,
the migrating Unix to Mac OS X,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.380
you saw Mike Bombit just
write a few applications very,

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.900
very quickly and putting a very
nice AppleScript Studio front-end.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.980
And so you should
definitely look at that.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.890
Some of the third-party
solutions for migration to

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.180
migrate a Windows desktop over.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:59.930
A really good one from Little Machines
allows you to migrate your Outlook

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.980
email database over to Mail,
over to Entourage.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.360
You can pick one or the other.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.490
I think from a Windows perspective,
it's much easier to migrate a

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.620
Windows user from Outlook to
Entourage than Outlook to Mail.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.550
That's just what I've noticed.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.880
Address book and iCal, of course,
possibly.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:26.390
And then if you want to move
the entire user's home directory

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.150
over from a Mac to a PC,
there's also a pretty good solution

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.140
from Move to Mac from Dettos software.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.850
So this is a very interesting one,
is Windows 2000 migration

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.970
to Panther Server.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.280
And that's something that's been really
dear to my heart because I deal with a

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.810
lot of large accounts and they're like,
man, those cows are just killing us,

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:50.300
right?

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.930
The price, the pricing,
and I met this customer about,

00:29:54.930 --> 00:30:00.760
what is it, about 16 months ago,
and he has 1,000 Windows NT servers

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.050
and Windows 2000 servers.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.410
And they're like...

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.840
We would really like to migrate
those servers over to the Mac.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.980
I mean, he's the CIO of the company,
and he loves Macs, but he says,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.050
I've got to make the right
decision for the company,

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:16.570
right?

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.680
I mean, I'm not going to migrate if it
doesn't fit what we require.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.900
And we've deployed Active Directory,
and it took us two

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.300
years to migrate to AD,
and we're not going to

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.130
any other directory.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.700
You've got to work with us.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.650
And we've done that,
and that's the reason why we've done

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:41.730
such a phenomenal job in Panther and in
Panther Server to actually achieve that,

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.540
and we'll talk about that in a second.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.580
So why migrate from Windows Servers?

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.300
Well, security, right, number one.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.790
It seems like security's
coming back pretty often here.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.840
Ease of administration, again, security.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.990
Our perspective from the IT side
is people should not be spending

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.150
a lot of time troubleshooting
and fixing desktop computers.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.740
They should be spending time thinking
of what's the next big thing,

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.320
right?

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.200
What's the next big thing that can help
my end users get their job done faster

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.200
and really streamline that process?

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.410
And that's what we do inside of Apple.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.040
I mean, our IT group doesn't spend a
lot of time troubleshooting

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.870
desktops on a regular basis.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.710
I mean, they built the point-of-sale
system for the Apple Store,

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.390
right?

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.840
They built the Apple Music Store, right?

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.880
All running on XSERVs
and XSERV RAID storage.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.770
So that's what our IT group
spends their time on,

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:44.640
not fixing desktop computers
and having to manage servers.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.510
I mean, when you put a server in place,
you shouldn't spend a lot of

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.950
time troubleshooting that.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:51.150
It should be install and forget.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.140
Unlimited client access licensing,
that's a big one.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.480
And when we announced the XServe,
we had a lot of calls

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.900
from IT shops saying,
hey, this is a phenomenal product, right?

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.740
I mean, $4,000 with unlimited licensing,
we're very interested in this.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:16.340
And this is a pretty big one,
is when Panther ships and Panther Server,

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.710
we'll be able to host your Windows home
directories on our hardware.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.220
So basically,
we'll show that in a graphic in a second,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:29.280
but basically you can have an XServe,
an XServe RAID host your Windows home

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.000
directories on our hardware.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.060
And that's a fraction of the cost.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.210
And again,
that fits right into the need of

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.730
that customer that I mentioned
who has 1,000 Windows Servers

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.570
and wants to get rid of them,
or actually at least bring them

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:50.030
down to a manageable number
running Mac OS X servers.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.840
Again, if you haven't deployed AD,
I want to emphasize the fact

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.790
that you should be really
looking at LDAP solutions,

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.700
either from Apple or
from third-party vendors.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.900
We have a built-in PDC now with
Mac OS X with Panther Server.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.710
So thanks to Samba and the
work of the Samba team,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.050
we now have Samba 3,
which has built-in PDC support.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.290
Thank you.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:19.240
We have Active Directory Integration,
which we'll show in a second.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.140
And we have a scalable mail server.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:26.890
That's the other thing that people
are looking at is exchange is nice.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.520
But we think we have a pretty
good scalable solution now with

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.740
Cyrus Mail and Postfix and Panther,
and you should really look at that.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:41.630
and again, it's all based on standards,
which is another huge added value.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:46.740
And then we also have JBoss support
built in for your J2E deployments.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:53.810
And over 40% of the enterprise accounts
out there actually deploy using J2E.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.960
Some of the migration solutions
to migrate from Windows NT.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.660
We have DAS technology.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.310
They actually have a tool
to help you migrate from

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.970
Windows NT to Mac OS X Server.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:10.630
And then, again, with Panther Server,
what you will be able to do is with the

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:17.140
Active Directory plugin and Samba 3,
you can now deploy XSERVs and XSERV RAIDs

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:22.170
and basically host your Windows users'
home directories and Windows files on

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.790
our hardware and save a lot of money.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:30.340
And then the last point I wanted to
make is I've seen a lot of people

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:36.380
deploy ActiveX-based web solutions,
and that's not a good thing.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:41.060
This is totally non-standard,
non-W3C compliant.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.920
And so there's some really
interesting solutions from Strion

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.340
that actually helps you migrate off
of ActiveX into a Java world and

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.800
helps you migrate ASP web servers.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.600
and ActiveX websites
to more of a standard.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.360
So what I think is going to hit
a home run in Panther Server with

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.630
people that have deployed
Active Directory is this right here,

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:14.640
where basically you buy an
XServe and an XServe RAID,

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.870
and you have your Macs,
you have your Windows desktops,

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.090
and basically the
Windows user can log in,

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.080
authenticate against
Active Directory because they've

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.980
deployed Active Directory and
they're not going back,

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.610
right?

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.260
But they can still work on the
file server side and save a lot

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.750
of money and not have to deploy
those 1,000 Windows servers,

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.420
really consolidate that
with XServe and XServe RAID.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.460
And so what I'd like to do
is bring up Eric Clements,

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.000
the Open Directory engineer,
to actually illustrate some

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.580
of that today with you.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.520
Eric?

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.860
Thanks, JD.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.340
Before we get started,
let's describe what we've got up here.

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.570
We've got a Windows laptop
running Windows 2000.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.710
We've got a Windows 2000
server that's running AD,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.260
of course.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.170
You can't show AD if you
don't have an AD server.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.060
And also a Mac running Panther.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.680
First,
we'll start at the Windows 2000 client.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.610
Thank you.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.810
Obviously, we're at the login screen.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.940
I'm going to log in as my account here.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.800
Pretty typical environment
you're used to.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.460
Oh,
looks like my virus is out of the data.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.400
I need to update that.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.340
So you can see here, I've signed in,
and actually,

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.120
you can see my network home directory,
because I've got a network

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.280
home directory programmed.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.440
This is running on a Windows 2000 server,
of course.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.140
I've got some files.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.160
I've been working on my desktop.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.890
I don't really save the network,
because I'm not used

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.830
to saving the network.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:42.010
So let me copy these
files up to my network.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:44.810
That was pretty quick there.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.860
So I'm kind of done here.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.020
And it shows the fact that
we signed into Windows 2000.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.280
Let's switch over to
demo machine number two,

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:51.820
please.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.340
Thank you.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.100
So this is the Panther client we're
actually running and actually already

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.290
programmed into Active Directory.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.140
When you have the user list, of course,
it says an Other button.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.380
I recommend changing that as you deploy.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.200
So one thing we did with the
AD plugin is we can actually

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.910
sign in in a familiar form.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.520
You notice I signed in
with a short name there,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.290
but some of you actually sign
in with an email address.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.190
You can do that.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.640
Now this is going to take a little bit.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.060
This is the first time I've
signed in to the computer.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.900
As you've seen on a Windows 1000
client a lot of times,

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.470
when you first sign in the first time,
it's creating your local account,

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.480
doing all your profile settings,
all those kind of things.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.740
We're doing something similar,
creating a local home directory,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.360
caching the user so you're
ready to log in offline.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.940
Here we are on the path to client.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.930
You can see my home directory
is actually mounted on the

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.860
desktop here off that SharePoint.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.720
You can see those demo files that
I copied over a little while ago.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.350
I can copy those off if I wanted to,
leave them on the network,

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.970
work with them on the network directly.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.480
So it's a very familiar environment
that you would have seen on a PC.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.100
One of the things that we want to
highlight here is I've also programmed

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.660
it to look at AD for the address book.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.650
If you go to the address book,
you'll see a directories tab,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.360
and actually directory services.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.460
I know JD's in here somewhere.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:17.950
There he is.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.200
So I can actually drag him
over to my address book,

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.560
click on the address book,
and now I've got his

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.160
complete information,
his phone number, cell phone,

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.400
whatever's been programmed
into the active directory.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.000
So it's a very handy feature.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.240
And, of course,
I can continue to search for other users.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.590
I can search for myself
for the first time.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.100
And if I try to drag that over...

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.270
and actually notice this,
I've already got a V card because

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.210
this is the first time I signed in,
we generate one automatically.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.030
I can just merge that.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.900
So I can go to my V card.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.780
Now I've got a fully populated V card
with my information out of the directory.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.220
So it's very handy as you send out
emails with the mail application.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.780
So let me go to how
this is all configured.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.020
If you go to the local hard drive here,
go to Applications.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.890
Go to Utilities.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.830
You'll see the Structural
Access application.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.910
So this is what your admins
would do the first time.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.380
This does require administrative
access to the computer,

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:11.050
so I will assign it with an admin
account so I can look at this.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.710
You'll see the Active Directory tab.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.820
I can pull that down so I'm actually
bound to the DeForest and the domain.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.570
Now, one thing, for those of you who
are going to try this,

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.100
you do need to use the fully
qualified DNS name of the domain.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.220
You can't use the AD.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.770
Some people have already
tried the plugin,

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.240
I heard, and they couldn't get it to work
because they typed in the short name.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.720
We're completely based on DNS, no RPC,
so we can't locate domains

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.020
automatically based on that.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.440
I'm going to send the advanced options.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.180
You've got the multi-domain
authentication,

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:37.680
caching.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.040
As I said, the caching was turned on,
so it had to do that caching.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.720
To actually authenticate,
I actually did a custom search path here.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.460
This allows me to plug
into multiple directories.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.640
Say I had an LDAP server
and an Active Directory,

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.590
I can actually program both
of those directories in there

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.740
to authenticate against.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.100
So it's a very nice feature.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.160
For the address book,
I actually do the same

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.630
thing on the Contacts tab.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.170
Add Active Directory on the
search path for the contacts.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.750
So that's kind of what it takes to
actually configure for Active Directory.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.670
Now, the other thing we've done is we've
actually got an XServe that actually

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.540
has the plugin already installed.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.760
So let me connect to that XServe also.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.960
Thank you.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.300
and his project for naming a password.

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:23.640
Type in the same name that I used,
same password.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.800
Actually connect to a shared volume.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.150
So this is an AFP server.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.540
had already covered files up.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.550
So I can actually drag files
from my Windows 2000 server

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.170
straight over to an AFP server.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.950
So now I've got all my files
on the AFP server using

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.300
Active Directory in all the cases here,
signing into the next server over

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.110
Apple File Protocol and signing
into the Windows 2000 server.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.880
Give you a little example
of the tools here.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.600
I can actually manage the
users on that server remotely.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.760
We have used-- give you
some tools with the XServe.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.600
One in particular we
call Work Group Manager.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:14.200
So you can see a list of AD users.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.130
And if you look at the top here,
it's the Active Directory AD domain.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.440
So I can click on my user.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.920
I can click on JD, other test users,
et cetera, admin users.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.920
Now what we actually want
to show is something-- the

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.160
actual true integration here.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.000
We've actually got
Remote Desktop on this client.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:35.100
There is a Remote Desktop client for
Windows Terminal Services for the Mac.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.990
So let me go and connect over
to the Windows 2000 server.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.580
I've got the users and
groups computers up.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.080
Now I can actually create a new user.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.560
something you're very familiar
with doing on the Windows side.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.560
And I can actually go over
here and do a refresh.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.520
And you see customer
one already showed up.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.390
So it's completely integrated
with the directory.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.010
I can actually edit some
users if I wanted to,

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.080
but you can probably do most of the
administration from the Windows side.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.980
The other thing I want to highlight
here is we actually got a user,

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.300
JD, happens to be on the workbook.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.170
You'll notice...

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.280
His account is set to change
his password on his next logon.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.260
So that's something we
really want to show.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.130
So let me get out of--

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:56.960
There's a minor bug with
remote desktop on Panther.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.890
So we sign out.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.080
I'm going to try signing with JD.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.340
So you can see my new cached
account is already set up.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.120
In fact, I could log in with that
real quick if I wanted to.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.500
And notice the login will be a lot
faster than it was a minute ago,

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.640
because everything's already been done.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:13.070
Now, it is still verifying
against the network.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.780
So it is still making sure
your password's in sync.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.130
But let me log in as JD.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.370
This open-ass password's expired,
so it wants me to change my password.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:26.420
This is, unfortunately,
a bug in the current seed,

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.000
so even though it
prompts you to change it,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.930
it won't let you change it.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:38.100
[Transcript missing]

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.470
So in summary, what did you see?

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.680
Well, we had a Windows user running
on his Windows computer,

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.740
and we've now moved this
Windows user over to Mac,

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:04.290
and basically all his files that were in
his home directory are now on his Mac.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:56.900
[Transcript missing]

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:01.220
It's not just all about
Panther and Panther Server.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.090
It's about enterprise solutions.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.360
And we have some phenomenal third-party
solutions that are out there,

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.880
phenomenal enterprise solutions.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.860
I mean, Apple runs SAP as an example,
right?

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.690
So we have a phenomenal
SAP Java GUI for the Macintosh,

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.590
but we have a whole bunch of
really phenomenal third-party

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.320
enterprise solutions on the Mac.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:25.260
And as time goes by,
we'll get more and more.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.600
I mean, this is a phenomenal solution,
right?

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.740
The XServe at $4,000 and
the XServe RAID for $11,000.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.680
No one can come close to this, right?

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.830
This is like the airport base station
three years ago when we basically shipped

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:45.810
the first wireless solution for $300,
and everyone else was $1,000.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.610
The storage solution,
no one can come close to what we have.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.110
And when we go and talk to developers,
it really resonates, right?

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.640
They don't want to spend,
they don't want to have to

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:00.100
convince the customer to basically
buy very expensive servers.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.940
They want to sell their
software solution,

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:02.370
right?

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.590
They don't want to
fight for the hardware.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.900
And here, basically,
you've got a $5,000 server that can do

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:15.110
as well as a very expensive server from
other vendors and do the same thing.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.010
And that's why we're getting solutions
like Oracle and Sybase and basically

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:25.540
SAP clients and Tivoli clients and
web methods over to the Macintosh.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.060
Because those developers are
actually seeing that same vision

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.330
that we have around the enterprise.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:36.180
And so what I'd like to do in
summary is basically tell you

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.130
that we've worked really hard,
the engineers have worked really,

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:44.100
really hard to make sure that Panther and
Panther Server are built with your

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.070
enterprise requirements in mind.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.840
And as you saw with the demo,
we think we're coming

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.150
really close to that.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.840
And so we really want
your feedback as well.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.590
I'll have my email
address up there as well.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.320
But the other thing I wanted
to leave you with is pick your

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.500
directory strategy wisely.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:07.100
If you have a large amount of
Macs and a small amount of PCs,

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:11.160
Windows desktops,
you definitely should not move to AD.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.550
You should look at our solution
or third-party LDAP solutions.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.030
If you have a mix and you haven't
deployed a directory solution,

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.150
you should really look at
standard-based solutions.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.200
Meta directories are also
a great thing to look at.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.640
So again,
deploy solutions and deploy technologies

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.820
based around open standards,
around Java.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.030
Don't deploy.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.070
Don't deploy anything around ActiveX and
some of those proprietary solutions.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.040
It's a nightmare to move
off of them afterwards.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.920
Let us know how we can help deploy
more Macs in your enterprise.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.260
Again, that's really very key.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.600
We'd love to help you do this.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.740
And we want your feedback.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.010
So again,
I'll have my email address in a second.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:50.900
We'd love to help you.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.570
As a roadmap...

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.920
Some of the sessions that are
pretty interesting this afternoon,

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.340
deploying XServe.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.980
There's a feedback
forum on the enterprise.

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.100
There's network security best practices.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.810
So again,
we talked a lot about security today,

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.520
but there's a really
good session on Friday.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.280
AppleScript for sysadmins.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:15.060
Again, that relates to what Gabe showed
you today with AppleScript Studio.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.220
Sal Segoian is going
to do a phenomenal job.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.160
He's just a phenomenal presenter.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.400
And then deploying XServe RAID.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.070
Alex Grossman,
the XServe RAID product manager,

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.890
will actually show you how
to actually scale the XServe

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:33.150
RAID from one XServe RAID to 20,
30 terabytes.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.760
And he'll show you
that on Friday at 3.30.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:39.950
Who to contact?

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.780
Myself, very simple email address,
jd.apple.com.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.950
And Skip Levins, slevins.apple.com.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.740
And so for more information,
there's some good documentation.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.870
I mean, again,
the Mac OS X Server documentation,

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:58.700
if you're not familiar with X Server,
you can download the manual for free.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.880
It's right off our website.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:07.670
And the schema modifications and some of
the security APIs are as well up there.
