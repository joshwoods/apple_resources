WEBVTT

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.900
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.220
I would like to introduce
you to session 704,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.880
Introduction to
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
At this time,
I'd like to introduce our speaker,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.940
Victor Alexander,
who will take you through the world

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.990
of real-time streaming with QuickTime.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.760
Victor comes from the software
engineering team at Apple,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.130
and he formerly worked for the
Apple technical training team where he

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.080
wrote a course on QuickTime streaming.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.980
So you will all be in
good hands with Victor.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.980
Take it away.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.380
As Stephen said,
I'd worked previously moving

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.100
to software engineering.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.340
I'd worked on a course
called QuickTime Streaming,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.570
obviously related to this topic.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.070
This is a copy of it.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.490
I'll make it available for your
review after the session's over.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.490
So if you want to take
a quick look at it,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.490
just make sure it ends up back
in my hands after we're all done.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.260
Welcome to Introduction
to QuickTime Streaming.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.490
Hopefully you're in the right section.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.500
If you haven't wandered down
the hall and got disoriented,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.760
you were looking for the MPEG-4
section next door and wandered in here.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
We're going to cover some
real-world steps for QTSS.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.220
So hopefully I'll give you some skills
today that will allow you to go back to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.840
your home office environment and actually
use QTSS and QuickTime Broadcaster

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.260
and have some fun with it.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.190
Whether you realize it or not,
streaming actually is a huge

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.670
portion of the traffic that
actually moves across the internet.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.060
Right now,
we're actually partaking in a stream.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.660
You just don't know it right now.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.960
What will happen is the videotape
that they're actually taking of

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.490
this particular session will be
taken back and captured and actually

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.090
compressed and actually put up on
the developer website at Apple.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.500
They'll also produce a DVD of it.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.440
And those sessions will be streamed
out to participants who participate in

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.090
the developer connection organization.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:03.980
So what we're doing right now
is actually we're actually

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.300
doing a video on demand stream.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.320
It's just not going to
show up for a few weeks.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.100
So quick show of hands,
how many folks have had any

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.600
exposure to QuickTime Streaming
Server in any fashion?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.180
Hands up.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.640
Okay, okay.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.070
How many folks are very
experienced at QuickTime Streaming?

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.570
Good, good, because I was going to send
you to another session.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.060
Excellent.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.040
So what I want you to do,
since this is eventually going to be

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.920
a stream somewhere on the Apple site,
somewhere for some developer session,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.070
someone to watch and review
and get information from,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.510
I want you to say hello to them, because,
of course, you know,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.000
they'll get some joy and
probably a good giggle out of it.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.030
So on the count of three,
I want you to say, Hi, ADC, right,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.060
Apple Developer Connection.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.520
So on the count of three, say, Hi, ADC.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.380
And when they watch this
stream a few weeks later,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.460
they'll get a good kick out of it.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.980
All right, ready?

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.260
One, two, three.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.420
Hi, ADC.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.580
Excellent.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.100
You just participated in
a video-on-demand stream.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.920
Congratulations.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.370
That concludes my session.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.940
Okay, all right, all right, okay.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.280
I'm just kidding.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.400
So let's move on to the
actual real content.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.120
Stephen Tonna,
thank you for introducing me.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.970
Again, my name is Victor Alexander.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.960
My extremely long title,
Mac OS X Server Software Seed Engineer,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.500
is my current position at Apple,
very enjoyable.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.870
I work with the server as a whole,
but I have a particular

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.820
love for QuickTime Streaming
Server and Broadcaster,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.610
as you'll hopefully see in
the next 60-odd minutes.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.790
Here's a high-level introduction
of what we're going to cover.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.950
I'll give you a bit of background
on the topic of real-time

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.400
streaming very briefly,
just to give you a basement

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.220
level of knowledge.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.140
We'll do some setup and configuration
of the actual streaming server,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.180
which I hope you'll find useful.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.640
I'm going to focus on
QuickTime Streaming Server and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.800
QuickTime Broadcaster specifically.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.710
Those aren't the only
tools that are available,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.700
especially for QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.040
So just be aware that I happen
to be demoing these tools,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.970
but the basic concept that
I'm demonstrating actually

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.610
apply to other tools.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.730
For example,
QuickTime Broadcaster is not the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.880
only piece of software in that space,
so I'd encourage you to check

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.680
out what other offerings there
are after this session's over.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.500
I'll cover where possible some new
features of QuickTime Streaming Server 5,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.100
which is actually included
with Panther Server.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.130
And I'll try to provide you with as
many real-world examples as I can.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.140
A little more detail.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.100
So let's see what you'll learn.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.340
Again, we'll do an introduction
to QTSS 5 and QTB.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.700
I'll do the initial setup for
the streaming server and walk

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.430
you through the settings,
especially since there's some

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.900
new tools there to be seen.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.260
I'll show you how to prepare
media specifically for streaming.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.610
We'll work with playlists.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.760
We'll create some playlists.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.060
We'll show you how those function,
how they behave.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.900
We'll do a little bit of live streaming
where you're going to be my talent,

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.900
so to speak.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.570
And we'll talk a little bit about the
QuickTime Streaming server publisher.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.170
Now, we should have enough time
for some question and answer,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.750
where folks can just walk up to the
mic and ask me some questions on

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.880
things I may or may not have covered.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.120
Okay?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120
Sounds good.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.020
Let's go at it.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.220
So what is real-time streaming?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.880
I'm just going to try and give you
a basic run-through of what it is so

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.690
that we can start from ground level.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.080
After all my talking for 60
minutes and everything I'm going

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.960
to say in the next little while,
what I really want you to remember from

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.530
this particular slide is that all we're
doing in real-time streaming is we're

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.220
moving media from the server to the
client over a network in real time.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.030
There's some time sensitivity
that's involved in that process,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.280
but really that's all we're doing.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.280
We're pushing the media files
from the server to the client

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.280
over a network in real time.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.400
We're going to use
some network protocols.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.000
In that process, we're going to use some
industry standards.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.740
We're going to use RTP,
which is Real Time Transport Protocol,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.730
and RTSP.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.410
They're brother and sister
protocols that work together to

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.210
get that video information off of
the server down to your machine,

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.990
where you're watching your favorite rock
concert or your favorite teacher run

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.290
through their session in psychology,
whatever it is,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.890
so you can watch your information.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.290
Those protocols work hand-in-hand
to deliver the information.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.790
I'll reference RTP and RTSP a
couple of times during the session.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.090
So I just wanted to get those acronyms
out there and just say that they're the

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.100
foundational protocols for streaming.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.540
Well,
the nice things in terms of the folks

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.500
who are delivering the information
is that there's no file that's

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.770
actually written to the client's
machine during the streaming process.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.760
Now, that's important.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.450
If you have gone to all the trouble
to film a music video or whatever

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.740
particular piece of event it is,
and you've done all the editing

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.300
and all the compression,
all that work in advance,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.470
and you want to get the
word out to everybody,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.900
but you don't want to necessarily
leave them with a copy of

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.430
those files on their computer.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.120
You want to maintain the
control of that media.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.500
This particular aspect of
real-time streaming is important.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.370
So no file gets left on
the client's machine.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.260
All they're left with
is they get to watch,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.500
say, a concert,
or watch a class or a session,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.780
whatever they're viewing.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.950
And all they're left with is the
good memories from that event.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.000
No files are on their hard drive.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.520
There's three ways to present content
in terms of the streaming server.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.660
I won't talk about in this
session the traditional way or

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.610
the slightly older mechanism or
what's been around for longer,

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.780
the way of delivering QuickTime files
by simply copying them to a web server,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.860
which is what you typically
see on the Apple Trailer site.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.390
Folks have seen the
Apple Trailer site with movies?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.340
Yes, nodding heads, good.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.840
That's just simply copying
a file to a web server.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.220
That's not typically real-time streaming,
although people generically

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.070
call it streaming.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.600
I'm really talking about using
a streaming server and sending

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.280
this information on the fly.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.530
So the three mechanisms that you
can use streaming server for are you

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.530
can use a simple video on demand.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.180
A client asks for a video,
and the server delivers it.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.070
And the person watches the content,
and it stops, and you're done.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.290
In fact,
that's how these sessions will likely

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.200
be delivered once they go online,
is a video on demand or a VOD setup.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.760
The second is a simulated live,
more commonly called playlists.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.380
And what you can liken it to is a
radio broadcast on the internet.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.090
So you've used various different players
likely to listen to music online.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.960
This is a similar approach to that.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.570
It's very similar to what
traditional radio is if you

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.520
turn on your radio in your car.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.420
You just drop in and listen to whatever
portion of the stream is happening.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.430
The third and probably the most
exciting and what typically draws

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.020
people to streaming is live streams.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.400
So you can do a live presentation
where the information is

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.000
routed onto the internet,
and people can watch as it happens.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.540
How many folks have either watched
or been to a keynote from Apple?

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.360
Of course, right?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.600
Lots of you.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.980
So that technique is getting--
getting to be extremely common,

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.180
and not just from Apple.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.080
Other folks are doing them quite
successfully outside of Apple.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.470
So remember the basic model
that I mentioned as the first

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.220
item of the previous slide,
right?

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.860
You've got a server,
you've got a network,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.450
and you've got a client, right?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.210
Anything missing?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.330
We've got our media, right?

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.200
So your media files have to
sit on the server and they

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.120
get delivered to the client.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.260
So that's the basic model
I want you to keep in mind.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.880
Very, very simple.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.040
Now, let's talk a little bit about
the streaming server itself.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.030
I'll give you some background on the
actual product before we demo it.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.080
It's based completely on open standards.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.580
I mentioned RTP and RTSP.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.730
Those standards are ratified by the IETF,
an international organization

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.140
which exactly does that.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.220
It ratifies open standards.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.860
So the streaming server,
wherever possible,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.180
adheres to those standards.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.550
Why do you think they might do that?

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.010
If other tools want to be
developed by other companies that

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.320
interact or interoperate with
the QuickTime Streaming Server,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.440
all they have to do is read those same
standards and develop the application

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.640
adhering to those same standards.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.390
Very, very useful.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.890
A single server can handle
literally thousands of streams.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.490
Thousands of streams.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.440
So it's very, very impressive.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.520
That's one way how we do
streams that are so large.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.490
So we can do tens of thousands of streams
watching a live keynote at Macworld,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.900
for example, or WWDC.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.930
We have several servers working
in unison that can handle these.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:15.900
But each one itself can handle 2,000
or 3,000 streams without a problem.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.540
QuickTime Streaming Server in
its last major revision

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.800
offered support for MPEG-4.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.900
It continues, obviously,
to offer support for MPEG-4.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.410
So if you're creating MPEG-4
files for those folks who do the

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.920
compression authoring side of it,
you can use your MPEG-4 files

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.500
on QTSS without a problem.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.960
We'll actually show that as well today.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.420
The Streaming Server also provides
a nice feature called Instant On.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.850
If you've used streaming
for more than a year or two,

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.590
you're probably used to the
sequence where you go to a web

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.970
page and you click on an event,
and usually the QuickTime player

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.500
or your player launches.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.920
Then you wait a few seconds while
the broadcast actually queues up,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.400
right?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.180
It buffers.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.180
So you wait your six or eight
or 12 seconds while it buffers.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.330
Instant on, for folks who are on
broadband connections,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.390
so DSL, cable, office connections,
high-speed optical connections,

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.260
will actually have that buffering
time reduced to virtually zero.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.230
So it actually feels like,
to the viewers,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.470
that they're playing a file
off their local machine,

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.160
right?

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.960
It's actually not.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.160
It's being streamed,
but it looks and feels that way.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.370
You can scrub through the file,
you can start playing it

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.440
from virtually any point,
and it feels instant.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.630
It really is instant.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.100
The Streaming Server comes with a
remote-based web administration tool.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.600
I'll show that to you as well.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.100
It's really similar in terms
of its design to Apache.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.810
So for folks who have used
Apache in terms of administering it,

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.470
or maybe you develop
components for Apache,

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.090
you'll see that the design methodology
for Apache is very similar to QCSS.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.510
And one bit of clarification to clear up,
how many folks have heard

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.440
of Darwin Streaming Server?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.420
Okay, so enough of you to make
it worth mentioning it.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.850
QuickTime Streaming
Server and Darwin Streaming

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:54.990
Server are twin brothers.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.300
The only difference is the name.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.700
Feature-wise,
they're virtually equivalent

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.520
for the core server features.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.620
The difference is that Darwin Streaming
Server is available for platforms

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.800
other than Mac OS X Server.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.120
So if you see the list at
the bottom of the slide,

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.840
Darwin Streaming Server is
available for Mac OS X.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.030
Linux, Solaris, Windows NT, and 2000.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.270
That's an extensive list.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.400
So you can literally run
Streaming Server on a variety

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.580
of different platforms.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.330
Now,
I always get someone in the very back

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.870
that puts their hands up and says,
you know, I have FreeBSD or some

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.910
other version of Unix,
for example, and I want to run

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.020
Darwin Streaming Server.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.640
Can I do it?

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.790
Of course.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.260
The open source,
the actual programming code is

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.180
available from Apple to download.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.900
And of course,
you can take that code and compile it on

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.770
your particular server class workstation,
compile it,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.170
and you can run Darwin Streaming Server.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.900
It may or may not require
a couple of subtle tweaks,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.580
but you can get it working and
running on your particular platform.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.640
I think we've offered a decent list
of platforms to start with in terms

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.820
of downloads for ready-to-go binaries.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.700
Right?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.960
So essentially, when I say QTSS and
Darwin Streaming Server,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.070
really they're the same product.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.100
There's a differentiation there that
I think I've clarified pretty well.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.770
There's a brand new application that's
bundled with the Panther Server.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.540
It's called Server Admin.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.880
It's brand new in terms of its look and
some of the extra features it includes.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.680
It also includes administration
abilities for QuickTime Streaming Server,

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.810
which is actually new.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.380
So, we'll take a look at Server Admin
and see what you can do.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.620
You can monitor and admin
the server from that tool.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.920
Very, very useful.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.100
You can configure things like IP binding,
if you happen to know what that is.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.200
Some of the relaying
that the server can do.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.600
You can also check the number
of users and the amount of data

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.530
that's going through the server
at any one moment with these very,

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.280
very beautifully rendered graphs.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.880
Also, you can do remote administration.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.520
So, you can have a copy of Server Admin
running on one machine back in your

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.360
office while you're eating your donuts.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.660
And of course,
you can control your streaming server,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.290
which is in the closet, maybe in a rack,
for example, and monitor it,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.190
see what's going on,
and configure it and work with it.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.160
So let's take a look at
the Streaming Server.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.380
We'll do an initial
setup and run-through.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.380
So on computer 2 here,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.170
You'll notice a couple of new
icons on the dock of note is

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.290
the one I've got highlighted,
which is Server Admin.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.910
Of course, you can use it for lots of
different configuration items,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.840
but what we really care about is,
in this session,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.240
is QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.440
I'm connected to the machine that's
actually I'm in front of right now,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.830
so I'm doing local administration.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.540
And the machine's called QTSS Intro.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.990
I simply turn down the
arrow on the left-hand side,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.480
and it denotes all the available
services that I can possibly run.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.650
The services that are actually active,
that are turned on,

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.620
that are ready to receive
calls are actually in bold.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.800
So currently only open
directory is bold or running.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.920
If we click on
QuickTime Streaming on the left,

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.420
we get a 10,000-foot view of
what's going on with the server.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.120
We can see that it's currently stopped.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.880
It's current throughput,
it's number of users connected,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.570
and a little bit of a status here.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.950
It simply takes going to the
Start Service button at the top center

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.960
of the window to turn the server on.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.680
And that's it.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.600
That activates your service, your server,
excuse me,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.070
you get an update at the bottom
of what it was turned on.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.930
Now we can move through the bottom
buttons along the lower area here.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.080
And I'll just step through them one by
one just to clarify what's going on.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.940
We've got the ability on the
server to log what's happening.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.410
So you can see logs and events.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.380
This happens to help greatly
with troubleshooting.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.210
If there's an issue with your server,
you can see what the last few events are.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.560
Not only do you get the
error log as shown here,

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.560
but the access log.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.310
So who has connected to your
server and asked for streams?

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:52.270
You can see I have a few
streams that have been requested

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.470
before the session started.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.470
What you'll take note
of in the access log

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.100
is that roughly about 40 parameters
are recorded when clients connect

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.780
and actually watch a stream.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.660
So a massive amount of data is recorded.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.180
I mean, it's just textual,
but a massive amount of

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.440
useful data is recorded.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.390
If someone watches a stream
and then disconnects,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.070
the access log is actually updated
when the client disconnects.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.820
So keep that in mind for
troubleshooting or for any kind

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.640
of investigation of the log.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.580
If you want to see someone
who's currently connected,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.410
you won't see an entry
here until they disconnect.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.110
They close the window,
and the session ends.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.490
And so 40 parameters.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.860
I'll switch to the connections tab, very,
very useful tab.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.840
If I can remember,
I'll try and jump back here while

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.280
we're actually doing some test streams.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.770
This gives you a list of users that
are connected to your streaming

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.950
server and some stats about their
current stream they're watching.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.690
The type of stream,
it can be an MPEG-4 movie

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.840
stream or an MP3 stream,
since the server supports

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.500
MP3 streaming as well.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.780
Their IP address, their bit rate,
how many bytes they've been sent,

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.380
and most importantly, the percentage of
packets they've received.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.750
So if they didn't get
all of the actual stream,

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.600
you can see how much degradation
in the actual video quality.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.200
You can also check out what they're
connected to in terms of content.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.470
So you can see what actual movie
or stream or et cetera that

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.880
they're actually linked up to.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.250
Here's the beautiful graphs I alluded to.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.390
You get to see,
you can check in this case on

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.440
how many users have connected.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.560
I hope your streaming servers
are a little busier than

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.810
mine in particular is here.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.890
I hope you have more than
two people connected at once,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.010
but we did a quick test to get the
graphs pop up and we got two connected,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.010
but 1.5 or two users
connected on average.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.360
We also get to switch to throughput.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.300
You can see exactly how much data,
information, how much content's

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.660
flowing out of the server.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.860
I typically would monitor this
for myself for a real event during

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.390
peak times for only brief moments.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.320
It's usually just to check in
to make sure my server is not

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.660
struggling with an overloaded amount
of people trying to watch the content.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.330
So I usually want to make sure
that I'm not hitting any limits in

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.440
terms of what the server can do.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.200
So for example,
500 streams running off the server

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.590
and the actual video is fairly skinny,
slim piece of video,

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.440
that's not a problem for
the streaming server.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:23.680
You notice you can slide the duration
so you can see exactly from one hour all

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.590
the way up to seven days of the graph.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.470
You'll notice I did a test about an hour
ago to make sure everything was running.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.130
And finally, I move to the Settings tab.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.170
Notice when I click Settings,
I get a number of buttons up

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.900
across the top of the interface.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.470
This is really the meat and potatoes
of the configuration of the server.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.750
The media directory denotes exactly where
the server is going to look for movies,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.980
files, and content.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.350
So you want to select a folder where
your actual files are going to be,

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.040
right?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.070
The default's not a bad location,
but you may want to move

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.780
this to an alternate drive.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.340
Let's say you have a huge amount
of movies you want to provide

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.560
via your streaming server.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.000
You want to reroute it
to another hard drive.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.840
You can do that via two mechanisms.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.040
It depends which kind of a system
administrator you might be.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.940
The GUI way would be to click the button
to the right and get a column view,

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.640
which you can simply scroll through
and select the correct folder.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.560
You can obviously reroute
it to another hard drive.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.650
If terminal is your best friend,
you can maybe take another

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.450
approach of typing the information
directly into this file path area,

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.330
where you can--

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.300
Where you can do something
like the following,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.780
where you can type in volumes,
which actually starts you at the very,

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:45.280
very top level of the operating
system above the hard drives,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:50.500
then type in the drive name,
then type in the subfolders.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.500
So in that way,
you can actually scale your way over to

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.500
other hard drives that are connected.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.940
I like the default, so I will select
QuickTime Streaming and Movies.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.990
I'll choose that.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.010
Briefly,
the maximum number of connections

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.440
and maximum throughput,
just to note the ceiling the server

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.500
will allow for connected users and
the amount of data that's leaving.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.900
You should set these options that are as
appropriate to your internet connection.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.280
I can't really tell you the perfect
answer for your particular installation,

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.370
but if you have a
corporate installation of,

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.380
say, DSL,
I would probably say that 100 megabits

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.040
isn't probably the right fit if you're
sending movies from the streaming

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.830
server out beyond your office.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.150
You might want to tune that down to
one megabit or two or three megabits as

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.560
appropriate for your internet connection.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.420
If you're streaming inside of
your office or inside of your

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.080
school or inside of your campus,
for example,

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.130
where you've got Ethernet everywhere,
then 100 megabits for the maximum

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.640
throughput is probably a suitable level.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.600
The check mark on the bottom actually
is a feature of Server Admin.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.030
The question was, what's the check mark?

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.370
The check mark on the bottom
actually will allow you to copy

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.330
settings that you've denoted in this
particular option we've selected,

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.240
which is QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:10.010
You can drag them to other
servers you're administering,

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.200
and it will copy those options across.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.200
You can also save them out, I believe,
and apply them to other servers.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.750
I don't want to take any
other sessions thunder away,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.770
but if you want to check that out,
I'm sure there's a streaming server

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.320
overview that will cover that.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.240
Quickly for access,
this is where you can set things

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.790
like an MP3 broadcast password.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.360
So you can actually have a piece of
software that can send MP3 streams

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.520
to your streaming server and actually
send those streams out to the internet.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.470
It's best to set a password for that,
so you can enter that there.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.400
If you want to accept
incoming broadcasts,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:45.880
you can do that here as well.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:45.880
We'll be doing that
later with a live stream.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:55.580
So we'll take a look
at that in more detail.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.590
We can also enable the
web-based administration,

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.590
which actually I'm going
to go ahead and do.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.070
Web-based administration literally
lets us use any web browser that

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:12.520
can see our server to administer
the streaming server machine.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:12.520
So I'll turn this on,
and we'll check back on

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:12.520
that in a moment or two.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.420
I'll skip past the
IP bindings and relays.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.340
It's a little bit more
of an advanced session.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.370
If you want to get insight on more
advanced topics like these two tabs,

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.210
I'll refer to the advanced
session that's coming up,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.380
I believe, tomorrow.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.770
I'll point it out at
the end of the session.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.820
For logging,
I'll point out one more thing with

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.890
respect to logging on this tab.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.040
I highly recommend actually you
turn on logging for both error

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.730
and access logs and have them
roll themselves over periodically.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.230
You only probably learn that
lesson well after 5,000 people

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.900
show up and watch your stream.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.860
So I would recommend
turning those two on,

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.830
have them archive, say,
every seven days or every month,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.670
and just make sure that
they're actually archiving.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.630
It really leaves you a good breadcrumb
trail that you can refer to to see

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.880
what happened with your server in
case there was a problem or anything.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.370
issue.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.740
So a lot of talking, a lot of showing,
but basically I turn the server on.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.410
If I literally just click Start Service,
my server would be running.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.570
So how do I know it's running?

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.340
The server admin says it's running,
but how do I know it's running?

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.650
If I can switch to computer 3,
there's a simple test that

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.160
you can do to make sure your
streaming server is running.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.150
And basically,
when you install QuickTime Streaming

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.300
Server or you install
Mac OS X Server at large,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.640
you get some sample files
included in the movies folder.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.760
You may have seen them for a
moment when I reselected my

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.880
media folder in Server Admin.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.660
There's some sample files that we
provide you that we know work properly.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.220
So you don't have to go and find your
own content and prepare it and work

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.580
on it in order for your streaming
server to actually be testable.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.650
I can simply launch
QuickTime Player on my client machine.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.940
And normally you would get
to a stream via a web page.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.800
That's traditionally how you ultimately
want to announce your streams.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.350
I'm not going to talk about that
at all because there's a great

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.800
session coming up this week called
QuickTime for the Web with Stephen Gould.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.420
You may know the book by the same name.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.540
He's going to extensively
cover that topic.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:20.290
I'm simply going to just use a great
trick for system administrators and

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:20.290
folks wanting to test the server.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.850
to just get directly at the
stream and make sure that

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:27.510
my stream server is working.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.510
So I'm going to select URL in New Player.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.580
This gives me the opportunity
to type in an address to ask

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.980
the server for a test file.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.280
Now, it's not going to be HTTP, right?

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.850
Because remember those protocols we
were talking about the server using?

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.560
We're going to use RTSP.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.380
We're going to use one of the twin
protocols that makes streaming possible.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.980
So I'm going to enter in RTSP,
the address of my server,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.600
in this case an IP address,
and the sample files are literally

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.860
called sample underscore 300kbit.move,
100kbit.move,

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.740
and there's the equivalent MPEG-4 files.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.300
So I can request this
by simply clicking OK,

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.720
and if all goes well,
my stream will appear.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.990
So if I wasn't quite as long-winded,
I could set the server up and

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.380
test it in less than two minutes.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.800
So we've got a running stream.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.790
This is just a loop of the QuickTime.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.480
It will run for about a minute to
make sure your stream is running.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.360
Now I want to point out a couple
things about this particular movie,

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.140
in that it's slightly
different from typical movies

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.500
you play off your hard drive.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.690
I'm going to show movie information and
just point out a couple of details here.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.990
Typically, when you play a movie,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:26:03.660
and Paul Z.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:03.780
Typically when you play a
movie from your hard drive,

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
the source in the information
panel on the right typically says,

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
you know,
the path to the file on your hard drive.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
Well, we're not doing that.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
We're streaming, right?

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
So it makes sense to
provide the RTSP location.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
So if you're never sure where your
stream's coming from or if you're really

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
looking at the correct file or not,
you can refer to the information panel.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
It will tell you exactly
where that file's coming from,

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.780
both server and the actual file name.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:12.590
The other bits of information
in the Info Panel are helpful,

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.590
but I'll point out the
bottom two specifically.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.590
Let me back this file up and replay it.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.160
The bit rate and quality items at the
very bottom of the movie info pane are

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.900
extremely useful for administrators.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.090
Extremely useful for administrators.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.320
The bit rate denotes exactly how
much information is flowing to

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.520
your client at any one moment.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.550
So for example, this particular movie.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.120
is roughly around 500 kilobits.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.500
It's doing some work to actually queue
up more than just a few seconds of it.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.890
It's roughly around 500 kilobits or so.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.060
But notice the quality.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.800
The quality says 100%. That's what
you always want to try and get.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.640
If all your clients can get
100% in that quality setting,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.290
that means that they're not losing
any of the details of the stream.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.480
If the quality is set, for example,
85%, that means that 15% of the

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.230
stream that's coming down to
them is either not arriving,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.550
or it's not being dealt with,
or it's being discarded for some reason,

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.650
and it's being lost.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.470
That results in pieces of
the video being missing,

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.660
or the audio dropping out,
or the audio garbling itself.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:18.130
So if you're running into problems and
you're trying to do some troubleshooting,

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.340
I would investigate the quality
and bit rate panels to see if

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.260
you're getting what you expect,
especially the 100% quality.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:25.470
That's very useful.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.360
But I was able to test the server
without producing any files.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.400
I just simply go and ask
for one of the samples.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.960
Very, very, very easy.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.190
Let's switch back to slides.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.540
So I've turned the server on.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.500
I've checked out the options.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.040
Server admin is kind of cool.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.520
I like it.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.260
I think I'll use it.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.000
We'll check out the web
admin a little bit later.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.100
I got to test my sample file.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.130
But how do I make my own movies?

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.270
How do I do that?

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.550
Well, hopefully you have a crack staff of
videographers and filmographers and

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.080
you go out and shoot everything you
want and then they come back and they

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.880
can compress it for you and prepare
all the media for you and everything.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.180
What I'll really focus on is once you
have files that are already edited in,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.470
say, something like Final Cut,
and they're really in their final state,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.570
what do you do from there to take
them onto the streaming server?

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.650
So if you want to check out on how to
prepare video content and compress it,

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.300
there's a session at 5 o'clock today.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.390
I believe it's called
Pre-Processing Techniques,

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.990
which will take you through
that authoring process.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.140
Previous to this step.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.100
But once you have a file
that's been prepared,

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.480
it's ready to go, it's compressed, it's,
say, a 50 megabyte file,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:34.790
it's a 20-minute promotional video,
there is one step you need to do.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.740
It's called hinting.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.510
It's not very difficult,
but it's a required step you have to do.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.750
QuickTime and MPEG-4
require the hinting process.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.880
Notice I say MP3 does not require it.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.600
So if you're working with
QuickTime or MP4 files,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.340
you have to do this hinting process.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.780
Media must be processed
before real-time delivery.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.770
It absolutely has to be.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.100
The actual step that's
performed is QuickTime movies,

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.260
MPEG-4 movies are made up of tracks.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.510
The hinting process simply adds a
couple more of these tracks called,

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.920
funny enough,
hint tracks that help the server

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.160
understand how it's to cut up the
movie to send it over the network.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.960
It can't just take the entire
movie in one foul swoop and

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.560
send it across as one big blob.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.200
It needs to cut it up.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.760
Those hint tracks give the server a hint,
hence the name,

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.570
of how to cut that media up into smaller
bits so they can send it out broken up,

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.580
and on the other end,
the client can play it back.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:36.650
Again, not difficult,
but it's absolutely required.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.280
The process really involves using
some sort of authoring tool.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.900
The easiest and most inexpensive
one typically is QuickTime Pro.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.300
That's a version of QuickTime.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:55.260
You already have QuickTime typically
installed in your machine if you're

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.860
running any recent versions in
the last few years of the Mac OS.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:58.860
Obviously, Mac OS X comes with either
QuickTime 5 or QuickTime 6.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.000
All you simply have to
do is purchase a key,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.080
a serial number for $29.95.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.960
That turns on a number of key
features in QuickTime Pro,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.190
one of which that we care about
is an export option that appears

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.080
in the Pro version of the player.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.910
That lets you export
media for compression,

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.740
but we also can do hinting.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.710
So it's really just an export
on the files that have already

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.110
been edited in Final Cut Pro,
for example.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.060
Other tools offer this hinting process.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.150
For example, folks have heard of Cleaner,
Media Cleaner, previously named,

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.580
that also does hinting.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.980
A number of other video tools tend to
do hinting as part of their process.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.520
A key thing to remember with
hinting is it should be the

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.570
very last thing that you do.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.320
If you edited all your video and
crunched it down to a small file,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.160
and then you hint it,
and then you make some

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.340
other change to the video,
that's not going to work.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.780
You have to go and re-hint the video.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:56.470
So it should be the very, very,
very last thing you do before you send

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.470
the file up to the streaming server.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.790
Here's an example of the
MPEG-4 pane for exporting.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.840
I'll walk you through that right now.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.520
So I'll switch to computer two.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.040
Hi, I'm a high server admin here.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.720
Let's go take a look
at some of our content.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.600
Let's take a brief look
at this particular video.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.710
It's an MPEG-4 compressed video.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.420
I, of course,
have a crack team of filmographers who

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.720
go out and film Red Hot Chili Peppers
for me and bring it all back and

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.400
edit it and compress it for me.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.160
I've got this video I want to
put on the streaming server.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.520
It's an MPEG-4 file,
totally supported by the server.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.250
It's a fairly large file,
but it's perfectly

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.370
suitable for streaming.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.040
I'll point out one thing before
I do the actual streaming process.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.940
I'll go to Movie Properties.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.640
This is a pane that you get in both
the regular version of QuickTime,

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.610
but you get an enhanced version in the
pro version of QuickTime that's $29.95.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.310
Let's take a look at this
pop-up item right here.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:17.420
This shows us exactly what tracks
are available inside of the movie.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:22.120
Notice there's a soundtrack video track
and then two MPEG-4 tracks at the bottom.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.180
You'll notice in the center
I've got a hinted video track

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.780
and a hinted soundtrack,
right?

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.930
So I've already hinted
this file previously.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.900
I'm going to remove it and just
redo the process to show it to you.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.900
This is what a file looks like
when it's already been hinted.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.180
It's already been hinted.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:41.800
A soundtrack, a video track,
it's got hints for each

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.090
one of those tracks,
and it's got some required

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:43.090
tracks for MPEG-4 compliance.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.760
I'm going to go and delete some tracks.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.470
This is a feature of QuickTime Pro.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.570
I'm going to remove them.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:55.920
I now have what would be a stock
video file that I would work on.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.730
So to hint a movie, it's very,
very simple.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.600
File menu and select Export.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.580
I'm going to select the option
in the bottom left-hand corner

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.210
that says "Movie to MPEG-4."

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.380
I don't want to change
anything about this file.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.070
I don't want to do any
other kind of compression,

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.420
audio, any kind of work at all.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.330
I just want to add those extra tracks.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.680
If I click Options--

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.450
I get a very,
very probably well-known by at least

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.260
some of you MPEG-4 export panel.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.170
If you've done any kind
of MPEG-4 file creation,

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.140
you're probably very
familiar with this panel.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.250
It's got five major elements.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.160
The general-- since I don't want
to actually edit this video or do

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.090
any kind of other changes except
add those required hint tracks,

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.420
I'm going to select pass-through
for the video and audio.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.160
That means just take the data in
the original file and just shift

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.560
it over to the brand new one.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.800
Don't do anything else to it.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.720
Just shuttle it over.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.660
You'll notice if I go to the
video tabs and the audio tabs,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.630
pass-through is selected.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.580
All the regular elements you
might select if you're trying to

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.390
compress a video are grayed out.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.760
The tab we really care
about is the streaming tab.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:05.920
And of course, for hinting type,
I already have streaming basics selected.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.400
If I didn't want to hint this,
I would select none.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.200
But of course, we do want to hint this.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.920
The two options below,
which are maximum packet

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.970
size and maximum duration,
are great options.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.280
If you happen to know what they mean,
great.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.480
But in 99.9% of the cases that
I've run into and I've compressed

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.600
and hinted a lot of media,
I've never ever changed those settings.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.390
So I probably wouldn't tweak
those settings unless you either

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.390
know exactly what they mean,
or you have a case to do so.

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:37.750
Like I said, 99% of the videos I run into
never require this to be modified.

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:44.770
I can click OK, pick a location for
the file to be sent to,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:50.380
and simply clicking Save will
hint the file and export it.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.080
I've been watching a lot of
cooking shows on the Food Network,

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.960
so I like to do things
like the cooking show.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.460
So I've already prepared a number
of videos that are pre-inted.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.890
So let's take a look at some of those.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.560
We've got-- let's go and open
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.750
Just to reiterate,
now we've got-- what will be added

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.710
is an MPEG-4 hinted video track and
an MPEG-4 hinted soundtrack will be

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.460
added during that export process.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.450
We'll end up with six tracks,
in this case, total.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.540
So does it work?

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.030
Let's take a look.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.600
If we want to actually add
media to our streaming server,

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.080
we need to put those files in
the location that we saw earlier.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.520
Remember, library,
QuickTime Streaming movies.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:41.270
So let's copy a file into that
location and give it a try.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.140
So I'm going to switch to column view.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.340
I'll go into library.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.960
QuickTime Streaming and Movies, right?

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.310
There's our samples we saw earlier.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.330
Let's take our--

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
and Chili Pepper will copy over there.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.930
If I could switch to computer three.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.990
Now let's see if my
hinting process worked.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.450
So again,
normally we get this file via web page.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.470
I'm just going to do it the somewhat
manual way of just asking for a URL.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.620
And we'll type in the actual name.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.900
You can type.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.780
My attempt to change the man's name.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.340
Let's take a look and see.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.580
Oh, did I mistype?

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.900
Of course I did.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.060
Yes, thank you.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.660
It worked.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.830
Perfect.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:50.340
Hinting.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.190
Very, very simple.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.140
Oh, do I get a mini applause for that?

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:54.140
Maybe.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.730
The hinting process is very, very simple.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.740
If you're not the one actually
doing any kind of compression

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.490
work or editing on the video,
and your job is simply to actually

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:08.060
add files to the streaming server,
the hinting process is very, very easy.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.740
It's one tab, select the option,
and export it.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.390
The export time for this particular file,
by the way, is roughly about a minute

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.060
to a minute and 20 seconds.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.510
And that's on moderate towers.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.060
That's not even the latest and greatest.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.700
I'll bring up another InfoPanel
to show off another feature here,

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.050
especially since we've got a longer clip.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.720
I'll bring up the movie properties again
that I just showed you the track listing.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.370
You'll notice when a file's being
streamed out to someone's machine,

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.800
they're a viewer watching
it from their computer,

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.160
you notice that the track listing that
I'm showing you is extremely short.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.020
All it says is streaming track.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.980
Well, the video and audio that's sent
down to the viewer actually just

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.140
gets congealed in terms of how they
see it as just one streaming track,

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.780
but there's actually some great
information inside this properties

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.220
panel that can be discovered.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.140
If I select streaming track here
and then go and dig for further

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.820
information in the right-hand pop-up,
I can select information like

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.120
frame rate to see how quickly
the video's playing back.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.690
The original source for this
particular video is 24 frames a second,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.240
so it looks like I'm
getting full speed playback,

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.290
but even better is the bit rate.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.260
So if you select streaming track on the
client machine while the video is playing

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.830
and bitrate from the right-hand pop-up,
we get a great little status.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.860
Have folks seen this?

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.100
Raise your hand if you've seen
this little info bar before.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.180
Okay, not too many.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:35.710
So great.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.290
So this is new for some folks.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.520
So you've got data rate information
about how much information is

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.100
flowing down to the viewer.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.550
More importantly,
you've got some information

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.460
about packet loss,
so data that's not

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.580
making it to the client,
which is definitely a bad thing.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.060
And we've got something at
the bottom called buffer size,

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.610
which I'll briefly explain in a moment.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:57.830
If you're trying to determine
whether your videos are playing

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:02.590
back properly on the other end of
the spectrum on your client machine,

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:07.050
for example, you can get your viewers to
inspect their packet loss window

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.670
just in the same way I did.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.650
Red in the packet loss window will
denote that there's information

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:16.150
that's being thrown away,
and that's definitely bad.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.720
In the case of lost information,
you'll see blocks of gray that just

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.400
simply don't represent any part of the
video at all because the data was lost.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.510
Real-time streaming is
extremely time sensitive,

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.580
so that information is being pushed
down as it's being played back,

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.400
so there's really no time
to resend information.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.680
You just have to keep on moving.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.030
The buffering size at the
bottom of that window,

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:44.470
QuickTime will actually work to try and
ask for more information of the video

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.870
and audio before it has to play it back.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.660
So it will try and pre-download
some of that content in advance.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.250
The nice thing about this is that
will try and help your viewing

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.760
client surf through some of the
unpredictable aspects of the internet.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.220
So if the client machine is able to
queue up about five seconds of content

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:07.970
before it actually has to play it,
if there's a dropout in speed,

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.740
then the video will continue
to play appropriately.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.400
So you might want to get your
clients to inspect their buffer

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.640
size if there is a problem.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.970
Great, my video worked.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.400
Excellent.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.670
Let's go back to slides.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.400
We turned on the server,
we looked at server admin,

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.440
we tested a sample file,
we hinted a file,

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.560
we added it to the server, we played it,
and we watched it.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.480
So we completed really the
video on demand aspect of it.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.800
Remember there's three
ways to present your media.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.080
Video on demand, I'd say we probably have
demonstrated that pretty well.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.580
Next up is the simulated
live or playlists.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.470
A key test that allows you to
create a preset list of media

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.470
to deliver to an audience.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:01.900
Let's say you want,
you have a set of lectures that you want,

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.460
a semester's worth of
lectures from a teacher.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.950
There's ten of them and you want
them to play in a certain order,

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.860
right, from the first portion of the
semester to the last portion.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:15.690
And you just want them to loop
over and over again so that

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:15.690
students on campus can tune into
them and listen to those lectures.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.840
The only way to really do
that is with a playlist.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.600
Video on Demand will just
maybe play one lecture,

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.960
or if you strung them all together,
it will only play the entire

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.010
thing from start to stop.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.600
Let's say you just want to keep
looping over and over again.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:32.200
Or you have a CEO's financial address
to the company or maybe to the public,

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.680
where you just want to keep it
on loop for the first 24 hours.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.900
If you've ever tried to watch
any of the keynotes from Apple,

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.220
after the fact,
they go on this kind of rotating

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.640
schedule the exact same way.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.020
They just play over and over
again for the first couple,

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.550
first few hours,
maybe the first 24 hours.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.140
Then eventually they go to a
Video on Demand kind of setup.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.550
Whenever viewers tune into anything
that's running on a playlist,

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.860
they just jump in wherever
it happens to be playing.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.090
It's literally like turning
on a radio or turning on a TV.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.530
If you turn on a TV at 15
minutes after the hour,

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.820
half the show's already played.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.220
You'll just start watching
it right from that spot.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.220
Playlists are exactly the same thing.

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:12.210
So think of them in
terms of broadcast radio,

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:12.210
broadcast television.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.790
There's two types of playlists.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.800
I'm going to focus on one of them.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.530
There's movie playlists,
which generically means

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.640
QuickTime and MPEG-4 playlists.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.940
And that's what I'm going to focus on.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.220
Let's go back to slides.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:26.440
Great.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.060
Two types of playlists.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.260
I'm going to focus on the movie
and QuickTime MPEG-4 playlist.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.970
You can also create MP3 playlists,
which are actually what are called

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.900
IceCast-compatible playlists.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:41.030
If you've ever gone to
websites like live365.com and

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.030
listened to internet radio,
you're very likely using that

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:49.280
IceCast standard underneath
the covers to listen to audio.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.910
You can do the exact same thing
with the streaming server,

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.170
and you can even send streams to
services like live365.com to actually

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.860
relay your playlists out to the world.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.610
But I won't focus on MP3
for this particular session.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.000
I'll keep it strictly
to QuickTime MPEG-4.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.200
You can configure the playlist,
by the way,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.780
via the web-based interface or something
brand new called QTSS Publisher,

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.700
which I'll talk about at the very end.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.450
So let's switch to computer two,
and I'll show off the

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.700
creation of a playlist.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:27.770
So let's switch back to-- I'll
just hide server admin here.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.100
So I'll skip to the applications folder.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.100
Inside the applications
folder with Panther Server,

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.780
there is a brand new
folder called Server.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:41.760
It includes a lot of server tools
that you'll want to check out.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.240
If we venture inside there,
there will be actually

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.020
a nice little icon,
an application called QTSS Web Admin.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.230
That's the easiest way on the
local server to actually get to

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.410
the web-based administration tool.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.930
It's not the only way,
but it's a simple way to do it.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.300
All it does is simply
takes you to a web page.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.740
So if you're thinking,
do I have to be sitting in

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.080
front of a Mac to do this?

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.740
You don't.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:05.290
You can sit in front of a Windows machine
and administer this server,

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.340
as long as it's a recently downloaded,
recent version of web browsers that can

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.970
adhere to most of the current standards.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.230
So.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.100
Recent version of Internet Explorer,
Safari, of course.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.920
All those things will do for
virtually any machine that can

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.300
see that server on the network.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:26.060
For the folks who love
things like IP addresses,

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.310
port numbers, et cetera,
you'll notice that the web

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.890
admin is using port 1220.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:38.140
That's just one door into
the server to talk to it.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:38.140
And we'll just simply just log in.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.510
The web-based administration tool,
by the way, when you run it,

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.830
if you choose to run the server or
control the server using this mechanism,

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.000
it doesn't just drop
you into the interface.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.150
On the first run,
it actually takes you through

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.990
a kind of setup assistant,
a web-based setup assistant.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:03.310
So you'll notice I'm just going
to step through a few screens here

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:03.310
that look very similar to what we
already saw in the server admin tool.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.400
We've already filled out
some of this information.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.960
That's the MP3 broadcast password.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.800
It's asking you if you want to do
a secure version of administration.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.310
We'll just, in the media folder,

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:26.300
[Transcript missing]

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.760
QTSS web-based administration.

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.900
The main screen,
this is a 10,000 foot view of the server.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.970
This is the whole rundown.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.200
It's kind of a top-level scope of
what's going on with the server.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.940
This is usually what I check if I've
got a busy time period on my server.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.700
I usually will check this
location first to see if

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.870
there's numbers as I anticipate.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:50.130
If I'm expecting 40
people to watch a stream,

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.890
I want to see the connected
users at kind of about 35,

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:53.890
40 maximum.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.740
To create a playlist in the
web-based administration tool,

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.480
very, very simple.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.200
There's a playlist link
on the left-hand side.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.300
I click it.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.560
And again, there's two types of
playlists you can create.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.150
MP3, which I won't do here,
but I encourage you to experiment with.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.510
I'll create a new movie playlist.

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.760
And if you notice, on the left-hand side,
there's two columns in the web page now.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.800
On the left-hand side,
we're looking at the current

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.000
items inside of our media folder.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:25.230
So that's inside Library,
QuickTime Streaming, Movies.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.040
That's what's currently inside of there.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.840
If I want to create a playlist,
it's very, very simple.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.630
I can take one item and simply drag
it over to the right-hand column.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.630
That adds it to the
playlist I'm creating.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.670
Of course,
it wouldn't be good enough unless

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.640
you could select multiples.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:47.020
So I just use the Shift key to select
items two and three in that list.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.760
And I can, of course, drag them over.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.990
And it will say multiple items selected,
if you noticed.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:54.990
While I'm dragging it over, I let go.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:54.990
And those three items are
now added to the playlist.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:54.990
Very simple.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.960
I should give my playlist a name.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.640
I'll call it ever so imaginatively, Test.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.660
This is the name that will appear
from an administration standpoint.

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:07.650
So when you go to work with the playlist,
you'll see the name Test.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:13.060
And we need some way to actually connect
to or attach to or watch the stream,

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.600
at least to make sure it's running.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.460
We'll use this mount point terminology,
which I'll explain in a moment

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.080
when we play the playlist.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.050
I should point out there's three
ways that playlists can run.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.600
The first is sequential,
which means it will play from

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.480
the first item in the list to
the bottom item in the list,

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:31.480
and then will stop.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:37.280
So if you have a broadcast with content
that's already been prepared and it's

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.080
starting at 5 o'clock Eastern time,
you can start the playlist at 5 o'clock.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.650
It will play until it's
complete and it will stop.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:46.200
And that's it.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.450
Sequentially looped will play from
the first item to the last item,

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.700
then it will skip back to the
first item and will just keep

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.540
going in a loop infinitely.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:56.580
And that's what you typically see
with online radio stations or in our

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.940
campus radio station or an announcement
that just runs on the network.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.940
You'll usually see it
be sequentially looped.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:07.210
The coolest option that I think
on a playlist is weighted random.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:10.960
If you notice on the right-hand
column on the right-hand side,

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.200
there's a column that says weight.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.580
Currently, each one is set at five.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:19.420
If you increase or decrease
the weight for each song,

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:24.460
it increases, in this case seven,
or decreases, in this case I've set it

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.200
to two for the second song,
decreases the chances of it

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.740
being the next item to be played.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:34.380
So it's a random playlist that
randomly picks from the media,

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.200
but based on the weightings you set here,
the chances of it being the next

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.480
item to be played are lower.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:07.700
I'll just simply select
sequential as a simple test.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:11.070
All I need to do,
if you want to remove items, by the way,

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.870
you can use the Remove Items option.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.460
But I'm just going to
simply Save Changes.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.560
And I now have a running playlist.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.340
So it's really that simple.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:23.220
I'll go back to main.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.760
Now, if I can switch to computer 3,
let's play that playlist

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.930
and see what it looks like.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:35.040
So I'll open up QuickTime Player.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.730
Again,
I'm just going to go directly to it.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.730
Normally,
you would get to this via a web page.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.790
Does anyone notice anything
different about this URL over the

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.600
previous ones I typed in this box?

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.900
I heard someone say it.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.410
There's no file extension.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.890
So whoever said no file extension,
gold star.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:54.460
There's no file extension.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:50:03.510
The reason is because we're
actually taking that content that's

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.510
prerecorded and we're making it
seem like a live piece of stream.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.500
Any live stream,
it's just simply the name of

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.500
what's called the mount point.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.240
In this case, it was test.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.130
We don't need to enter in the extension,
which in this case, behind the scenes,

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.940
is .sdp.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.940
That's just simply a file behind
the scenes that keeps the details

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.340
of that particular stream in check.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:28.260
All we need to do is enter in test
in this case instead of test.sdp.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:28.720
And if all works well,
we will listen to our--

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:33.260
Oh, we haven't listened to our... Ooh,
I'll check my playlist.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.040
I'll tell you in just a moment what
I didn't do there and why it didn't work.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.800
I realize exactly why.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:01.110
OK, let's try that one more time now
that things are actually running.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.140
This is a running playlist, right?

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.960
Test.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.750
Anyone notice any
differences in terms of...

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.330
Turn the sound just down a touch.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.580
Anyone notice any difference in the
player in terms of the interface

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:25.060
it's offering you over what we played
when we had the chilis running?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.410
There's no thumb bar where you
can skip through the media,

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.240
right?

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.990
It just says live broadcast and
it just kicks right down to pause,

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.980
fast forward, stop, volume controls.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:40.170
So there's no bar where you
can thumb through the media,

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:40.660
right?

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.150
Simulated live.

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:48.370
It's content that we
already have prepared,

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:48.370
but the Stream Server makes
it look like it's live.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.070
Just like radio stations,
they already have A-tracks and

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.930
CD players and all that stuff
all set up in the DJ booth.

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:58.460
They pop it all in and they play
it and it goes over the air.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.880
You don't know the difference.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.540
Your radio just plays it back as is.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.220
Exactly the same experience here.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.830
This is great to use on a campus, school,
company for announcements, updates,

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.590
financial stats,
whatever you want to use it for.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:18.020
You don't have to be streaming
commercially available songs

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.510
in order to make use of this.

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:23.180
You literally can have content
that's appropriate to your particular

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.590
organization and use this technique to
deliver information in a timely fashion.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.550
One of the examples of this use
that I saw was quite ingenious.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.380
I literally did a 20-minute demo
of QuickTime Streaming Server for

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.000
a math teacher at a school.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.120
They had a slightly older server,
perfectly suitable,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.860
where I had QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.500
He sat down in front of iMovie,
of all things, and recorded in his

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.170
math problems each week.

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:52.200
He read off 10 questions that
the fifth graders needed to do.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.520
You go into iMovie and export
those files out of iMovie.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.250
Of course, he hinted them and put it
on his streaming server,

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.980
and he just let the playlist loop.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.640
He created the playlist and let
it loop over and over again.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.380
The students would go to the library or
go to any other computer in the school,

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.370
and they could listen to the math
problems instead of just being able

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:08.990
to read them on the actual paper.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.650
He would state details like
when the assignments were due,

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.560
other details you might
want to check out,

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.990
pages in the math book
that might be appropriate.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.270
So don't just think streaming radio
station with your favorite Liz Phair

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:20.990
song or whatever it happens to be.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.730
There's other applications
that are really appropriate.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.820
Great, let's switch back to computer two.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:32.350
I just want to point out briefly
what it was that I missed.

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:35.920
Let's switch to computer two.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.830
Now, I saved the playlist and I switched
over to computer three in a big rush

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.100
because I'm all pumped up for my demo,
but I forgot to do one thing.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.680
I forgot to actually
press the play button.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.440
Now, it currently says stop.

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:50.970
You need to press the play button
to start the playlist in order for

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.110
your playlist to start running.

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.210
So you'll notice that the
status now says playing.

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:57.040
I simply switched back to here,
turned it on,

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.770
and then we got our playlist running.

00:53:58.770 --> 00:53:59.950
I'll click stop.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:01.720
The playlist has stopped.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.330
No one can listen to it.

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.640
If anyone's currently
listening to the playlist,

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.540
they'll get blank.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.120
Dead air.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.170
Okay.

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:11.040
Let's...

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.200
Sorry, what's that?

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.090
You can still hear it
playing for a while.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.050
Oh, it will play for-- sorry,
the question was,

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.580
it's still playing for a few minutes.

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.080
Well, remember I mentioned the
buffering the client will do?

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.510
It will queue up a few seconds of audio
or video to make sure it can survive

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.250
some of the bumpiness of the internet.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.720
Usually,
it will play for five to eight seconds,

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.870
and it will cut out.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.440
But definitely,
if someone tried to connect

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.330
to the playlist right now,
they will definitely get nothing.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.040
They'll get dead air.

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.490
I'll take questions at the end,
but that's a good one.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:47.720
So the question is,
what's the situation with the media

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.920
you have to add to the playlist?

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:53.720
This is detailed in a very,
very clear form in the documentation

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.540
that comes with the streaming server.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.530
You can access that help, by the way,
that documentation via

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.200
the good old question mark
button in the web interface.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.920
If you were to search through
this particular help guide,

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.940
it will tell you that playlist media
needs to have the exact same parameters.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.560
So if you're playing video,
they all have to be the

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.870
exact same frame size.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.380
They should use the exact
same codecs to compress them,

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.980
and they should be similar in all
other aspects wherever possible.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.780
In terms of MP3 playlists,
just as a side note,

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:27.580
the only real requirement with
those is to make sure that the rate

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.510
at which the audio is originally
recorded is exactly the same.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.960
So typically,
audio is done at 44.1 kilohertz.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:41.930
That's really the only thing for
MP3s that need to be consistent.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:43.400
The bit rate for MP3s
can be wildly different,

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:43.400
and the server will handle it properly.

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:47.000
So check out the help for more details
on exactly what those parameters are,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.050
but video frame size,
the type of compression that

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:55.520
we use should all be the same.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.750
Let's switch back to slides.

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.100
Back to slides.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.740
So we talked about video on demand.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.740
We talked about playlists.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.270
Very easy to do.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.620
Last but not least, live streaming.

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:18.040
The only way to send content
out to the internet as it

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.100
happens is using this technique.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:23.390
How many folks consider that one
of their main interests in terms of

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.220
streaming server and the related pieces?

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.980
Yeah, always about 30% to 40% of the
folks are curious about that.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.620
It just takes one Steve Jobs keynote,
and then you're hooked.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.060
You want to run your own live event.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:37.900
So live streaming,
using a camera and QuickTime broadcaster

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.790
is the only way to really do it.

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:45.290
You can't do it by using a web
server or some other contraption.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.740
You have to have a piece of software
I generically call a live encoder.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.230
There's actually a product
from Apple available for free

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:53.890
called QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:59.080
And you really just connect any
AV equipment that you've got

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:00.340
connectors for on the back of your Mac.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:06.720
In this case, I'm using a camera with
a firewall connector.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:06.890
I'm going to plug it into
the back of the Macintosh,

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.890
turn the camera on, and use that.

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:09.990
One of the best things
about the MPEG-4 format,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.790
as a side note,
is it has a phenomenal codec

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.940
built into it called AAC.

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.990
I'm sure you might be interested
in checking out some of

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:16.270
the other MPEG-4 sessions.

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.000
That's a phenomenal codec for
doing audio-only broadcasts,

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.240
in case you're curious.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.920
We obviously use this technique for all
our keynotes and WWDC major speeches.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:30.080
Let's switch over to... Actually, sorry.

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.880
Here's a diagram of exactly what a
live streaming event can look like.

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.700
Of course,
you may have more or less iMacs

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.950
connected on the right-hand side,
depending on how popular your event is,

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:42.820
but it essentially follows this model.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.670
You've got a camera,
likely connected to a

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:45.860
live encoder machine.

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.920
In this case,
we're using a PowerBook as an example.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.700
And of course,
everyone wants to have an XServe

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:51.700
as their QuickTime streaming
server on the back end,

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.080
so we've got that in our diagram.

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.520
And that streaming server sends
information out to the clients.

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.370
If someone's thinking that you might be
able to use that XServe for both live

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:04.320
encoding and to deliver the streams,
you're right.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:08.570
You can actually use one box for both,
but only for small events.

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:11.640
I wouldn't recommend it for
anything even remotely large.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.900
If you have a small audience,
say 20 or 30 people,

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.770
or short pieces of content
that you want to just do live,

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.800
a five-minute speech, very few people,
you can use one machine.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.800
I have a feeling for our events,
we probably use more than one machine.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.600
So let's do a demo of Broadcaster.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.570
I'll show it to you.

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.980
Hopefully everything works
perfectly well as anticipated.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.680
In the applications
folder in Panther Server,

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.040
you have a great little tool
called QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.000
It's a Cocoa application
written at Apple.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
I'm going to simply turn on my camera.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:50.300
This is a standard video camera.

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.170
It's just a mini DV camera
with a FireWire jack on it.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:55.760
Nothing too magical, nothing too complex.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.070
I'll launch Broadcaster.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.580
It's a little hard to see because
the room's a little on the dark side.

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.950
What we have is--

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.280
We've got a preview screen.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.640
This is Broadcaster in simple mode.

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.520
We've got a preview screen.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.380
We've got some buttons
there to choose from,

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.910
some presets, and that's pretty much it.

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.940
Very, very easy.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.490
Broadcaster is extremely easy to use.

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:25.610
If you had already set things up,
you could pick from these lists

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:27.040
and literally click Broadcast.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.700
If you click Show Details,
we get a little more extensive interface,

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.340
and I'll just quickly step
you through the three.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:35.800
For this particular demo broadcast,
I'm not going to do audio just

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.360
because we've got other speakers going
on and I don't want any feedback,

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.430
so I'll deselect audio.

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:44.240
You can see in the interface down here,
you can select all sorts of options,

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.380
the right codecs,
the right speed selections,

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.250
whatever you want to pick.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:51.080
For video, I'll pick one of the presets.

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:54.000
QuickTime Broadcaster comes
with some nice presets.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.910
If you're not sure exactly
what to set in the interface,

00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.460
you can pick something
that's appropriate.

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.620
If you're doing a modem stream,
select the modem options.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.280
If you have a high-speed connection
that you want to deliver content to,

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.220
live content to, select DSL or LAN,
for example.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.200
I'll pick DSL.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.540
I'll pick DSL Cable High Motion,
for example.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.960
That presets all of these options
below so that I don't have to

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.450
remember every time what to set.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.740
Under Network, again,
there's a preset that you

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.480
can configure if you like.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.580
All it really takes is entering in
the name of the streaming server you

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.040
want to send the live content to.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:34.670
In this case, I'm using the same machine
to stream to itself,

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.400
the one box solution.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.000
I can name the stream.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.480
This is very similar to test,
which is what we did for the playlist.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.480
I require a username and password.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.840
There's an admin password
you need to use in order to

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.880
broadcast to the streaming server.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.400
And of course,
we can set some details that appear in

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.400
the info panel on the QuickTime player.

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:57.640
You literally can click broadcast.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.700
It's going to request a password.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:03.370
I will enter my super secret password.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.560
Clicking Broadcast will literally
start taking content from this camera,

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.100
bring it down the firewall
cable into the computer,

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.060
taking that content, compressing it,
hinting it, and sending it to the server,

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.680
which in this case is the same machine.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.640
So you can imagine that that
live encoding machine that's

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.130
underneath the counter here is
working really hard to do this job.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.510
That's why for larger events,
you often want to have one computer

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:28.580
for a live encoder and one box
doing the streaming server.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.770
So I'm broadcasting.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:33.420
I've got some details about the
current status of my broadcast.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.530
and some details.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:38.470
You might notice that if you wave
in front of the video camera,

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:42.480
you may not see that once I start
showing you the stream on the client.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:47.160
There's roughly between six to
eight seconds delay between the

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.100
live encoding software doing its
job and ending up on the client.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.700
That's to make sure that the streaming
server can average out the streams

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:55.700
and make sure everything is sanitized
before it gets sent out to the world.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.450
You would never normally see that
because typically your clients

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:00.840
aren't sitting in front of the
camera that's pointing at them,

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.210
right?

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.860
In the real world,
they don't know there's

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:03.790
a six-second delay.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.170
Just like in radio,
they have a six-second delay, right?

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:10.430
You would never know unless you stood
inside of a radio broadcast booth.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:16.910
Let's switch over to computer three,
and let's fire up this stream

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.910
and see what it looks like.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.060
So everyone in the front row,
I want you to smile pretty

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.640
and give me a nice pose.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.940
We'll go open a new--

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:28.750
I'll type in RTSP colon slash slash,
the IP address of my

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:32.320
stream server on my stream,
just to get this running.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.490
There we go.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.840
It's that easy.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.230
Thank you.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:48.020
If any folks have done any kind of
live broadcasting previous to this,

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:51.500
you may remember in a shudder that
you may have had to copy files

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.340
up to the server from this live
encoder and it spit out a file and

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.780
I didn't know what the file did,
but I had to get it up to

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.280
this certain directory.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.180
QuickTime Broadcaster uses
a technique called announce.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.740
That means that the
live encoder software,

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.130
QuickTime Broadcaster,
can simply alert the

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:09.800
streaming server that,
hey, I'm going to start a stream.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.380
Here's all the details.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.070
The streaming server will automatically
create those files locally on the

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.190
server in the right directory and
do all the right things as long as

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:22.040
we enter the correct information into
the QuickTime Broadcaster itself.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.840
So that situation where you have
to copy files and I don't have

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:27.570
file sharing turned on and how
do I FTP off the command line,

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.760
you don't have to worry about any
of that using QuickTime Broadcaster

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:32.340
because it uses announce.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.360
So we've got our stream running.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.400
This is a moderate speed stream.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.000
We can see that all the information
that I typed in in the extended

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.440
panel in QuickTime Broadcaster,
right, enter the key TSS,

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.080
all that information ends
up in the info panel,

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:46.680
right?

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.210
The top name obviously populates to
the top of the QuickTime player panel,

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:52.720
and it's working perfectly.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.380
Let's switch back to slides.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.770
"I'm still testing the six second delay.

01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:05.650
If I do this, it's amazing.

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:10.390
There's nothing like a
QuickTime Broadcaster to

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:12.820
make people act goofy.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:13.700
Because when I first turned it on,
I was like, 'Ooh,

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:13.700
I was doing lots of crazy things in
front of it,' and then my boss walked in.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:13.700
So it was not a good scene."

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.500
Unfortunately,
I can't demo this particular app,

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.520
but it is on the way.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.380
How many folks went to the State of
the Union for QuickTime this morning,

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.020
first thing?

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:26.280
So you did probably get a glimpse of it,
if I understand what

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.940
the agenda was for that.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.360
QTSS Publisher,
another Cocoa application.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.710
This runs on Mac OS X server only,
and it connects to

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:35.260
QuickTime Streaming Server only.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:39.040
So this particular discussion does
not apply to Darwin Streaming Server.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.650
This is a Cocoa tool that
helps you manage your media.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.240
Just like we set up playlists,
and just like we hinted content,

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.920
the publisher takes care of that
process for you automatically.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.140
Simply adding content to
the publisher window will

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:53.340
automatically upload your content,
hint it, put it in the right directory,

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.890
you can even make a playlist with
it in less than five seconds.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.820
It's a very, very good tool.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:59.430
It's not quite baked yet.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.140
It will be included with the
QuickTime Stream Server 5 package.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.430
I encourage you to go check it out.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.640
It's impressive.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.800
I've been playing with
the early versions of it,

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.190
and it's very, very good.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.120
The streaming playlist
management is great.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.800
And that's a Cocoa application.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.410
You need to run it from either
Mac OS X or Mac OS X server.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:18.090
You can run it remotely,
just like the web admin,

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.780
except you need to be sitting on a
Mac OS X based workstation to run it.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.850
I believe the publisher
will be Panther only,

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.570
but please read the final release
notes in order to determine

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.860
exactly what the compatibility is.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.180
So wrap up, let's take a look at whether
sessions are happening this week

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.390
that you probably care about.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.450
If you feel energized from this session,
you're totally pumped up and you

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:46.020
want to go into the advanced session,
there is an administering

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.680
QuickTime Streaming Server session.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.600
I believe it's tomorrow.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.830
Please check that out.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.320
That's with the QuickTime Streaming
Server engineering team.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.260
Very, very useful.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.820
Great session for the authoring side,
previous to streaming content.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.390
You can check out session 710,
which is pre-processing principles,

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:03.860
which is always good stuff.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.990
In this room, following this session,
we have a great session coming

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.730
up on QuickTime on the campus,
a case study of how QuickTime is

01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.100
being used on campuses.

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:16.180
We've also got lots of other
great sessions going on.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.160
Of course, QuickTime for the web.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.740
If you're interested on how I would
take that stream and get it onto

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.600
a web page and make it look great,
check out session 712

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.580
with Stephen Gooley.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.150
Excellent session on how to
get your content announced and

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:33.560
out there and out to the world.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.740
Again, more great sessions.

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:38.840
Streaming Server Programming,
if you're more on the programming ilk,

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.850
like I say, Terminal is your best friend.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.320
Xcode is your best friend.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.760
You can check out session 727 if
you want to learn about the guts

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.220
from a programming standpoint
of the streaming server.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.070
Of course,
even more sessions to check out.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.600
Who to contact?

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:59.540
In general, Guillermo Ortiz,
QuickTime technology manager.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.660
Of course,
he's got the infamous email address,

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.400
QuickTimeMan at Apple.com, right?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.420
You can contact him if you have questions
about the topic of streaming in general,

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.180
QuickTime in general.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:12.220
If you have questions specifically about
this session and only this session,

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:13.600
please contact me.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.340
You can email me at the
address on the slides.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.780
I can only answer questions
about this particular session.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:24.600
I think I may rewrite you to Guillermo
if they are outside the scope.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.960
For more information, here's some useful
URLs that I found very,

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.940
very valuable to myself.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:35.160
The QuickTime Streaming, Darwin Streaming
Server Administration's guide,

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.080
I definitely recommend.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.420
It's a PDF you can download.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.300
I believe it's even included on the
CDs you received during the conference.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.770
Please check that guide out.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.260
A lot of folks did hard work on it.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.750
It's a really good stepping stone
to take you beyond this session.

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.290
General information,
you can check out the

01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:51.990
QuickTime portion of the Apple site.

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.230
Developer documentation available there.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.250
You got some reference resources,
of course.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.410
The course that I wrote,
QuickTime Streaming,

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:01.530
is still being taught.

01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:04.960
And it's available to--
it's being run in the US,

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.720
and I believe beyond.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.150
You can check out the URL at
the top there to get more

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.230
information about that course.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:18.790
It's a three-day course
taught in the classroom.

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:18.790
It covers a lot more
than what we did today.

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:18.790
And some excellent books to refer to.

01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:22.760
Knowledge-based articles.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.100
I'll probably bring these back up
on screen after the session's done,

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.470
but there's two or three good,
excellent knowledge-based articles

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.300
available from Apple's website that
I find helpful if I back myself into

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:33.300
the corner with the streaming server.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.280
And of course,
do not miss the QuickTime labs

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.790
that are located downstairs.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.210
There are folks that you will
love to talk to and meet,

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:42.630
engineers, very,
very skilled media authors,

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:45.070
and folks downstairs
that you want to chat.

01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:46.800
It's down in the Sacramento room.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.270
Please check it out.

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:50.280
Have a chat with those folks.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.830
Introduce yourself.

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:54.370
Talk to them about what you're doing.

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:57.790
Bring them your code if
you're doing development.

01:08:57.790 --> 01:08:58.070
Talk to them about your setup.

01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.070
They'll be happy to chat with
you and answer your questions.
