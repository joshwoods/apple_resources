WEBVTT

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.840
Welcome to 3GPP Myth versus Reality.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.500
This is session 717.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.100
My name is Aliza Hutchison.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.960
I'm the QuickTime product manager in
the QuickTime product marketing group.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.460
And I'm joined up here by David Singer,
who is an architect in our

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.460
QuickTime engineering group.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.680
We're both actually going
to do the session today,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.340
so I'm your host and a
speaker along with Dave.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.300
We'd like to take general questions
at the end of the session,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.070
but we're happy to take
some clarifying questions

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.200
throughout the session as we go.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.110
So let's get started.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.580
So hopefully many of you were able
to attend our QuickTime State of the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.990
Union yesterday with Frank Casanova,
the Director of

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.100
QuickTime Product Marketing,
and Tim Schaaf,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
the VP of our Interactive Media Group.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.220
We're going to build upon a lot of
the items they talked about in that

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.090
session if you were able to attend.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.100
If you weren't able to
attend that session,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.050
we would like to introduce
you to mobile multimedia.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.320
We'd like to go into a lot
of detail about the standard,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.890
and then we'd also like to talk
about QuickTime's support for

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.090
the mobile multimedia standard,
which is 3GPP.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.100
But before we actually get into a lot of
detail about mobile multimedia standards,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.430
I'd like to spend a little bit of
time talking about standards in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170
the telecommunications industry.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.080
So if you look at
cellular standards today,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.080
I like to say they're sort of all
over the map for those of us that

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.340
aren't really familiar with them.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.380
And this chart is
intentionally hard to read.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.640
I don't expect you to be able to
pick out each little country and say,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.780
"Ah, I understand what standard they're
using." The radio network standards

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.980
generally fall into two categories.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.470
There's sort of a CDMA family of
technologies for the radio networks,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.720
and then there is a
GSM technology family.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.720
And what you can see here is that
distributed across all geographies,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.900
some countries tend to be towards one.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.480
So Europe has adopted predominantly
the GSM family of technologies.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.180
Then you'll see countries in
Asia that have primarily adopted

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.270
the CDMA family of technologies.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.610
And then you'll see a mixture of both,
and that's what we have

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.350
here in the United States.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.050
But all of these technologies
have evolved over time,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.940
and we talk about them
in terms of generations.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.270
So the first generation technologies
started with both CDMA and GSM,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.200
and then I've also put on
here a column for TDMA,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.170
which was a first generation
technology that was developed

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.950
here in the United States by AT&T.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.560
But as you progress up
to the 2G technologies,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.960
you're actually talking
about not just voice,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.850
but adding a data layer
for the radio networks,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.960
and those have some different acronyms
that you've heard about before,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.900
like GPRS, for example,
and that's where the GSM and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.200
TDMA technologies actually came together
under that GSM family of technologies.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.500
As we go -- oh, and I went the wrong way.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.610
As we progress forward,
you'll see that with the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.550
2.5 and 3G technologies,
there's a whole other set

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.920
of words that people use.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.420
People use to talk about the technology,
so you progress into what's called

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.560
CDMA 2000 with different 1X versions.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.520
Then you also progress into
what's called UMTS technologies

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.860
and a similar technology that's
built on top of that in Japan,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.260
which is called WCDMA.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.680
So we don't want to spend a lot of
time on these particular technologies.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.260
The idea here is there are really two
families of generation technologies

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.810
as you move up in your data speeds,
and they exist in different

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.880
places across the world.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.500
So when you talk about speeds,
you're probably talking in

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.480
the 2G somewhere around 9600
to 14.4 kilobits per second.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.210
As you go to the 2.5 technologies,
you're looking more at like 28.8,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.430
and this varies.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.010
And then as you start with 3G,
the definition of 3G technologies

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.840
is to start with data rates of
about 144 kilobits per second,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.230
progressing all the way up to
forecasted speeds between 1

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.170
and 2 megabytes per second.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.890
What is 3G?

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.900
3G is the foundation that
you hear about all the time.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.900
It's what you think you need
to have for mobile multimedia.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.880
Let's just break it down a little bit
so that we understand some basics.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.740
First of all, to have a 3G technology,
that bandwidth needs to

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.900
be licensed by carriers.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.890
The carriers bought the bandwidth.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.900
Then they had to build the high-speed
packet switch radio networks.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.900
When those things are in place,
then you can have rich multimedia

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.370
services that you can view these
services through these mobile

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.770
media devices that are now,
some of them are now on the market today.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.900
But all of this has been
surrounded by a lot of hype.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.840
We've been hearing about
3G for a long time,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.890
and so of course that's produced a fair,
oh God, I'm so sorry.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.400
Here's the clicker.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.380
Here's the clicker.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400
Which way do I go on the clicker?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400
That one.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.400
Thank you.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.900
This has produced a
fair bit of skepticism.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.500
Just when you've heard about something
you've heard about and heard about,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.900
you don't see it immediately.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.900
There's a lot of people that didn't
really think that this was going to work.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.190
You've read things, I'm sure,
that says the operators that

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.890
purchase these bandwidths,
they're destined for bankruptcy.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.900
Is 3G just another internet disaster?

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.890
Those are some of the myths that
we wanted to talk about today.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.900
And then really talk about the
reality of some of those statements.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.660
So the realities are that all of
these services that can deliver

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.670
mobile multimedia don't actually rely
on complete network build-outs of 3G,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.900
if you will.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.700
So, for instance,
a lot of mobile multimedia

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.820
can be downloaded just fine,
or messaging services are working

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.030
just perfectly on 2G and 2.5G networks
that we even have today with GPRS and

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.900
some of the major cities in the world.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.900
Close the microphone.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.140
United States.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.690
Wow, that's a lot louder.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.600
Okay.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.900
Then the other thing we wanted
to talk about is that not

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.560
every carrier went bankrupt.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.260
So yes, of course,
there were highly publicized auctions

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.400
for some of this bandwidth where
people paid lots and lots of money,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.990
but not all countries paid tons of
money and not all carriers bought their

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.280
competitors to get into this space.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.040
So not everyone went bankrupt.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.690
And finally, we believe and other people
believe that the services will

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.290
lead the network buildouts,
just as it did with

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.800
Internet technologies where we were
all just perfectly satisfied to

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.300
dial up on our modems to view the
Internet and see how that worked.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.470
But because we found really
valuable services to go and

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.470
look at on the Internet,
the public actually created the demand

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.910
for higher speed networks and now we
all have access to things like DSL and

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.500
cable for broader bandwidth connections.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.860
And we believe the same
thing will happen with the 3G

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.390
technologies as they progress.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.780
Some other doses of reality here.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.010
I put a couple quotes up
and a couple statistics.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.310
But there are very positive
industry analysts' reports about

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.750
the rollout of 3G networks and
also the business that there is,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.120
there truly is, in 3G mobile multimedia.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.660
So you see numbers from IDC forecast
of a $30 billion industry by 2006.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.060
So there's a real
forecasted industry here.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.560
And there are real rollouts happening
right now of this service that make

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.010
it a reality for you as developers.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.080
Now I'm going to hand it over to
Dave Singer to talk about how this

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.550
is really relevant for QuickTime.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:15.880
So we talked about those parts of the
network that the operators have produced.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.810
What we're concerned of course about in
multimedia is things like video playback,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.300
video recording,
and being able to get content

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.680
on and off those phones,
being able to send a

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.520
multimedia message to a phone,
or maybe being able to load content

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.400
off a web server onto a phone.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.580
And it's worth noticing that all those
need just a handset and the service.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.060
They don't actually rely on
reliable high-speed bandwidth.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.740
So if you send a message or
you do a download over a 2G

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.440
or 2.5G network instead of 3,
well it's a little slower,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.860
but you still get it.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.930
The only service that actually
needs that full network build out,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.210
and a reliable one at that,
is of course streaming.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.290
So that's one of the reasons
we expect to see streaming

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.920
lagging these other services,
is that the operators have to

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.080
both build out and get confidence
with their network before they

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.270
can deploy the streaming services.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.960
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about where the standards

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.600
come from and what's in them.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.300
There are two major bodies developing
standards for the 3G world.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.600
There's 3GPP and 3GPP2,
imaginatively named pair of bodies.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.290
3GPP stands for
Third Generation Partnership Project.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.720
It's actually a partnership
of quite a lot of standards

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.300
bodies from all over the world.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:28.000
And they're building on the
GSM heritage of cell phone standards.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.400
And then 3GPP2 is building on the CDMA.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.300
the CDMA 2000 heritage of standards.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.570
The 3GPP is designed to provide a really
high-speed network so that you can

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.310
get interesting multimedia content to
devices and do all sorts of fascinating,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.270
high-value, compelling services.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.510
It's being adopted by a whole bunch
of companies all over the world.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.990
So what we've got here is a variety of
companies from handset manufacturers,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.890
operators, infrastructure makers,
and computer people like ourselves.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.350
So there's a lot of support behind
this standard all over the place.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.300
I'm going to go a little into what is
in the multimedia part of the 3G spec.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.810
3GPP standards obviously cover
everything from the radio network

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.710
and how you do modulation all the
way through to the final services

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.340
that you present to the user.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.460
In QuickTime, of course,
though I'm interested,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.470
I'm curious about the radio network,
what we really care about

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.080
is the multimedia services.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.520
So I'm going to focus in on that.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.820
And in there, we'll find that there's a
package including speech codecs,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.120
general audio or music codecs,
video codecs,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.960
there's a container file format
into which you can put those,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.110
and then above that container
file format there are delivery

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.560
frameworks such as Smile 2.0,
the synchronized media

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.460
integration language,
there's MIDI music,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.760
still images and so on that you can place
into messages and into Smile overlays.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.740
In terms of speech codecs,
the primary speech codec used in 3G

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.250
multimedia in the 3GPP world is AMR,
Adaptive Multi Rate Codec.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.880
This is the codec that the
telephone itself uses when

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.300
it's making a phone call.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.080
It's adaptive because a 3G network
can vary its bandwidth and when it's

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.800
being used in a telephony context,
the codec can then adapt to

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.440
the available bandwidth that
it's getting from the network.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.890
This means, of course,
in QuickTime or multimedia terms,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.390
we can treat it as a variable rate codec.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.230
It is a classic 8 kilohertz
sampling rate telephony codec,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.480
it's a kelp-based codec.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.520
So it is optimized for handling speech.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.610
It'll handle all the content,
but like you've tried,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.200
I'm sure you've tried
the PureVoice codec,

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.540
some of you in the QuickTime world,
on general content,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.680
you'll know that speech codecs are
not the best codec for handling music.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.360
It's adaptive in that it
switches between various modes,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.350
and in those modes you'll actually
recognize some historic codecs

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.310
that you already know and love,
such as the GSM full and

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.560
half rate codecs and so on.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.500
In the stable is also
a higher sampling rate,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.260
richer sounding wideband codec
that's optional in the spec.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.660
I haven't seen much of it happening
at the moment in the 3G world,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.770
but there is a codec waiting
in the wings there if you want

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.360
to do higher quality codecs.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.680
So you can do that with any speech.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.930
And those two can be packed
in their own file format.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.760
There's a .amr file
format which you can use,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.800
and a lot of the phones support that
for recording voice notes or parts

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.680
of calls in progress if you have a
phone that will allow you to record.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.100
In general audio terms,
we're really lucky.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.050
We have the world-leading AAC codec.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.300
This is probably the best
music codec out there.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.300
Recently, actually, there was a listening
test on the internet.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.300
I don't know whether you heard.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.880
The one that you've got in
QuickTime actually came out

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.300
tops in the listening test
between the AAC codecs available.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.740
So you not only have
the world-leading codec,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.300
but you have a world-leading
implementation of a world-leading codec.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:49.390
What's in the 3G spec is the same simple
version of MPEG-4 AAC that we're using,

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.840
that's used in iTunes,
and indeed is used in digital

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.300
radio mondial and so on.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.890
So you'll find AAC is getting
deployed quite widely across

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.210
a whole variety of services,
not just 3G.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.310
So this was definitely a forward-looking
codec from the 3G group when

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.050
they adopted it a few years ago.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.300
In video codecs,
there's a couple of choices in the spec.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.300
The basic mandatory codec is H.263.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.300
I'm going to give you profile and level
numbers for those of you who are curious.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.060
I'm not going to explain
the features of the profiles

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.260
because I can never remember.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.300
I always have to look it up myself.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.220
So the basic profile 0,
level 10 is a basic H.263 codec,

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.120
no fancy options and so on.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.290
Level 3 is, profile 3, sorry,
is permissible in the spec,

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.300
but it's not mandated.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.430
And then also available in
the spec is MPEG-4 video,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:37.300
and you'll find some of the cell phones,
but not all, implementing MPEG-4 as well.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.020
Also in the 3G spec,
I didn't show this in the overview slide,

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.240
there's support for timed text.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.340
And actually,
if you look at the specification,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.800
you're going to go, oh,
that's awfully familiar.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.800
That looks like QuickTime timed text,
and that was because I wrote it,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.500
and I'm lazy.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:57.280
The 3G spec, however,
is improved in quite a number of areas.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.480
It's simpler than the
QuickTime specification in

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.900
that we allow only keyframes,
as it were.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.880
There's no difference frames.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.430
And it's modernized compared to
the QuickTime implementation.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.480
So it's based on Unicode instead
of Macintosh character coding,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.880
and it allows vertical writing and so on.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.420
You get full alpha control for both
your foreground and background colors.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.000
So in some senses,
it's more powerful and more complicated,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.500
but in many respects, it's simpler.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.000
This allows you to do a lot
of things in a single time.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.260
So in some senses,
it's more powerful and more complicated,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.490
but in many respects, it's simpler.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.580
do subtitling, credits, karaoke,
hyperlinks, and so on.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.700
And it's currently deployed in
Docker mode service and handsets.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.040
All those that I just talked about,
the speech codec, the video codecs,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.860
the general audio codec,
they can be wrapped in the

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.840
3G multimedia file format,
which in turn was based

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.450
on the MPEG-4 file format,
which we know and love,

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.300
which of course was based on
the QuickTime file format.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.360
So if you were to open
one of these 3G files,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.860
you'd go, I recognize that.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.680
It's got a move atom in it,
and you'd be right.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.840
So also in the 3G files, however,
there is the intrinsic file type atom,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.710
which was introduced by
the JPEG-2000 standards,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.350
and that allows you to
mark a file as saying,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.940
which standards do I think
this file complies to?

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.090
Or in particular,
what readers that implement

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.920
particular standards should
be allowed to play this file?

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.110
So you can say,
I want this file to be playable

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.920
both by an MPEG-4 player and by a
3GPPlayer by carefully marking the

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.030
way you build this atom in the file.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.140
So there's intrinsic typing in the file
as well as extrinsic from its name.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.070
or it's my own type.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.190
The 3GPP2 standard also
uses the same file format,

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.260
which is kind of convenient to you.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.020
But they use, of course,
their own suite of codecs.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.810
So their voice codec is one of them,
they have several,

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.500
is the pure voice codec that's already
in QuickTime that you're familiar with.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.040
They chose Layer 3 audio rather
than AAC for their general

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.180
audio because of its deployment
rather than forward-looking.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.020
But as I say, the same file format.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.020
And it's worth looking just for a moment
at the evolution of the file format.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.720
So way back in the midst of time when
some of us were still sitting in our

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.000
high chairs and eating soft food,
the QuickTime file format was written

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.720
in 1990 actually and published in
1991 with the first ship of QuickTime.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.940
And that was successfully used by
the QuickTime group alone for quite

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.410
a number of years until MPEG-4
finally decided that they really

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.950
ought to have a standard file format.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.820
They never had for MPEG-1 and 2.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.080
And so the MPEG-4 file format was
derived from QuickTime in the late '90s.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.280
Well, that triggered a whole flurry of
activity around the multimedia industry.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.280
The Motion JPEG group and the 3G
group both looked at that and said,

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.260
"You know, we could use that file format
if we just changed the media

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.900
types in there," just in the way
that QuickTime has in the past.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.220
And so we built Motion JPEG-2000
and the 3G spec derived in a

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.940
rather awkward way from the MPEG-4
spec because the MPEG-4 spec said,

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.660
of course,
that you had to use MPEG-4 coding

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.620
standards and these people wanted
to use something different.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.980
Well,
the committee eventually decided that

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.670
this was a mess and that we really
wanted a single file format again.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.700
So they said,
"Why don't you guys get together and

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.710
define a base that's going to be a
base that doesn't talk about any of

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.900
these coding standards that tells us
how to structure a file?" That we're

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.800
calling the ISO media file format.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.080
And that really is the direct
inheritor of the QuickTime one

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.820
because it's an abstract container.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.880
And on top of that,
we can now put MPEG-4 again,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.660
MPEG-4 version 2,
and Motion JPEG version 2 are re-hosted,

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.570
as it were, in the ISO media file format.

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.860
And that, of course,
allows other groups such as

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.900
3GPP and 3GPP2 to do the same.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.990
So this ISO file format, this family,
is really becoming the de

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.260
facto standard for multimedia
containers in the industry.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.160
Everybody's using it.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.060
In fact,
there are other bodies here that I ran

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.780
out of space to put little bubbles,
so I didn't put them on this diagram.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.240
But, for instance,
the SD Video Card Association is also

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.410
using this file format as their standard
for multimedia on SD Video Cards.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.520
So where are these standards?

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.330
How are they doing?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.400
The standards themselves
are mature and published.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.270
So for example,
if you were to look in the 3GPP

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.980
world at the specification with
the wonderfully mnemonic 26.234,

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.280
you would find the specification
for multimedia container file

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.100
and packet switch to streaming
and multimedia and so on.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.400
The formats and the protocols
are specified and published.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.500
And that includes
specifications for messaging,

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:09.530
email-like operation, download,
HTTP web-like operation, streaming,

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.300
and so on.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.130
But today I think you're going to see
more downloading and messaging than

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.400
streaming because the operators need
to build out those high-speed networks,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.240
they need to get confident about them,
and you need to be able to

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.400
afford to pay for the bandwidth.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.740
Which tends to be a little difficult
when they're doing their initial

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.400
deployment because they're charging
a lot of money for bandwidth.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.900
So you'll see streaming coming,
but you're going to see these

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.150
other download formats leading the
streaming standards by a little way.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.910
An interesting one coming up
in the standards committee,

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.930
if you care,
is that they're actually working

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.970
on one-to-many transmissions,
so we can actually do multicast

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.400
streaming at some point in the future,
we hope.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.520
So how do you get data
on and off your phone?

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.580
This is a question that
we get asked quite often.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.280
And what we draw on you here
is a complicated diagram which,

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.240
like Gaul, is in three parts.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.960
At the top of the diagram,
your local area, your office,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.200
your home or whatever.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.380
On your right, the cellular network,
and on the left, the internet.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.360
So one obvious way you can get
content on and off the phone,

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.680
of course, is locally.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.230
You may be able to use Bluetooth,
infrared, a USB cable, a memory card,

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.670
and so on,
to move content from your personal

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.700
computer to and from your phone.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.770
Once you've got content on your phone,
of course, you may be able to send it

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:23.040
as a multimedia message,
like an email, to another person on

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.980
the cellular network,
if your carrier supports it.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.460
So that's the diagram over there.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.520
Also, that same multimedia message,
you may be able to generate one from

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.190
your phone here and send it through
a gateway to an email address to

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.300
somebody out on the internet again.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.390
So there are gateways being
built that will do conversion

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.200
of multimedia messages to email.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.700
Indeed,
they'll do it the other way sometimes,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.200
if you're lucky.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.820
Again, depending on your operator.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.930
You can sometimes generate an
email over on your computer here

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.780
and have it come through the
gateway and end up as a multimedia

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.780
message on somebody's cell phone.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.200
Similarly,
there are web browsers and the ability

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.140
to use HTTP on some of these cell phones,
and they can load content either

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.740
through a gateway or off the operator's
hosted network off a web server.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.690
So you may be able to put content in
some suitable way onto an HTTP server

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.120
and then access it both from your
laptop machine and from your cell phone.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.190
So you actually have quite a way
of working with your cell phone and

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.000
with other people's cell phones.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.370
And as I say,
you're going to have to talk to

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.570
your operator about what is possible
in each of those environments.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.460
So with that,
I'm going to turn it over to Aliza,

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.500
who's going to introduce you
to all the exciting work the

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.720
engineering group did in 6.3.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.160
So the natural progression of
defining a standard hopefully is

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.560
there will be tools that will be made
available based on that standard.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.680
And Apple was very pleased to announce in
early June the release of QuickTime 6.3,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.480
which provides support for
the 3GPP standard with native

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:59.070
support for AAC and AMR,
MPEG-4, H.263 video, 3G text,

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.280
and the 3GP file format.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.680
Where this puts QuickTime is that now
we have the first widely distributed

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.990
3GPP player for the desktop,
we have the first low-cost

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.400
3GPP authoring tool,
and we are the tool of choice for

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.210
the world's first standards-based
3G network service with NTT DOCOMO's

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.990
mobile MP4 iMotion service.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.900
So what does that actually mean?

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.980
Dave talked through some sort of
theoretical examples about how

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.800
data could be moved back and forth.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.350
But what's actually happening now?

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.680
Well, as an example,
we've been working with

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.090
Docomo where their content,
their professional content creators

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.940
are using QuickTime to create content
that then is distributed over their

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.990
network to their mobile phones.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.500
And this, for example,
is one of NTT Docomo's phones for

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.990
iMotion that supports 3GPP playback.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.040
Another example is that users that
have one of these iMotion phones or any

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:03.800
3GPP-capable phone can capture content
on their phone through the video camera.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.050
It can then be distributed through
the network either now to the

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:13.490
desktop using a QuickTime player or,
of course, to another phone.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.260
The evolution of this will be that users
can also just create content on their

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:25.350
desktop that can then be mailed over
the network to a phone for viewing.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.080
So the thing that's very exciting
about this is not only is

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.670
QuickTime the first mainstream
3GPP authoring and playback tool,

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.940
but all of the applications
that QuickTime supports also

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.140
now become instantly available
to create mobile media content.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.880
So you see, of course,
Final Cut Pro 4 on here,

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.860
which now can create 3GPP content,
and a host of other applications

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.740
that are built on our SDK,
in addition to the ones that Apple has,

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.040
like iMovie, for example,
now can all create

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.130
MPEG-4 and 3GPP content.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.710
So what does this mean for you?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.070
Well, hopefully what this means for
you is that we've opened up,

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.020
with this new launch of QuickTime,
a whole new market for

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.420
you to create tools for.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.100
And there are new customers that
we've never talked to before and

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.600
that maybe you've never had a
chance to create products for.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.600
The customers now are operators.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.590
These are mobile operators
that need tools for content,

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.560
for editing, and for management.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.130
We also have new content owners
that want to get content onto

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.600
mobile phones that maybe have not
used QuickTime-based tools before.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.880
And in addition,
we have a whole bunch of end users

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.800
that have lots of content that
they want to simply and easily

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.600
create for mobile phone usage.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.930
And where are the real opportunities?

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.980
Well, we've been talking about Japan,
and often people look to Asia to

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.990
see what's happening in the
telecommunications market.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.170
But there are real strong
predictions for the revenue value

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.180
there with mobile media services.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.100
And we've been talking
about some examples.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.270
NTT DoCoMo and J-Phone both
have 3GPP compliant handsets.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.420
DoCoMo has rolled out a full 3G network,
and J-Phone is moving very quickly

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.150
to roll out their network as well.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.960
When you look at Europe,
they also have a variety of 3GPP

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.940
handsets that are available right now.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.380
This, for example,
is the Sony Ericsson P800,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.120
which comes with a
native 3GPP player on it.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.930
There's also been 3G launches
by Hutchison in the UK,

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:24.980
Sweden, Italy, Austria,
which isn't on there, and Australia,

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.220
which isn't in Europe, but close.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:36.080
Finally, there are opportunities
right here in the US.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.700
You can buy a Nokia 3650 today from
several of these operators up here.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.760
I imagine that they'll soon be
shipping some of these other mobile

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:49.790
multimedia handsets as well with
varying services and coverage as we

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:55.680
progress in the same style as the
Japanese market and the European market.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.520
So an investment in 3G is an investment
in these ongoing greater and greater

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.750
bandwidth telecommunication technologies,
and Dave promises me that

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.350
there's something called 4G.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.780
Well, there are a variety of companies
doing things that they're labeling 4G.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.740
It's not actually terribly
well defined in the industry,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.990
or it may be variously defined
well by various people.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.330
You're seeing a variety of companies
that are deploying high-speed,

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:23.040
more data-oriented networks than
the traditional cell phone networks,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.750
with some, at least,
heritage from the 802.11 family in terms

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.890
of how they do radio network management,
and so, as I say, more data-oriented.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.800
But they're trying to get a reach
much more like cellular networks.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.340
So it's a kind of a hybrid approach.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.610
Obviously, 802.11 airport,
you've seen how many base stations we've

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.050
had to put to cover just this building.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.480
There's no way you're going to build
out a national infrastructure or

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.370
something with a reach of that kind.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.340
They have a very different
cost and deployment model.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.480
So these are very different.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.640
These are not typically the traditional
telephony-operated networks.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.100
They're more traditional
operators or traditional telephony

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.400
cost models and deployment.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.460
As I say,
they're more data-centric than the

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.300
traditional cell phone networks.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.120
In general,
I think this is good news for those

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.470
of us in the multimedia community.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.370
As I say, it doesn't really matter to us
whether you're using licensed

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.900
bandwidth or unlicensed bandwidth,
as long as we can get the

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.240
bits onto the devices.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.380
So my belief is that we're
going to see a whole mishmash of

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.200
services that you'll be able to
get at very high speeds on 802.11,

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.200
at medium speeds maybe on
some of these 4G networks,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.190
if you're lucky and they're
deployed in your area.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.180
And at quite decent network
rates over 3G networks,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.860
again,
if you're lucky and you live in Japan or

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.900
they happen to get deployed in your area.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.530
So you're going to see
these things coming along.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.940
But for the meantime,
the big operators are rolling out

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.940
3G and particularly multimedia
across very large areas,

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.150
obviously entire countries or continents.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.200
So at this point, what I'd like to do is
give you a demonstration of

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.700
using QuickTime multimedia
and a cellular phone.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.810
And I'm going to choose an application
here that's done absolutely nothing

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.710
to warrant being in this presentation,
and that they've done nothing special

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.700
to support QuickTime 3G at all.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.580
The application actually is one that's
worth knowing about in the first place.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.930
It's called iView Media Pro,
and this application is designed for

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.700
cataloging and managing media assets.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.700
It has lots and lots of features.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.660
I'm not going to go into it.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.630
I'm not supposed to be
advertising it here.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.460
It allows you to do
version control and so on.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.900
And here I've taken a seminar
that Frank and his team did and

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.700
split it up into short clips.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.140
And so, for example,
here's a clip where he's talking

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.430
about... ...the world called 3GPP,
Third Generation Social Publishing

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.700
Project.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.970
Oh, the 3G standard.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.720
Well, Frank, thank you.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.950
And if we look through the seminar,
we can find all sorts of clips.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.640
Here's Rhonda and so on,
and Frank introducing Stream.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.940
And you can even just check the clips
right there in the window if you want to.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.560
This program actually uses QuickTime to
help it with its cataloging.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.950
It has a lot of functionality
built in as well,

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:53.780
don't get me wrong.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.430
But they're using QuickTime here
to play back these clips.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.770
And they also, as it happens,
use the QuickTime APIs to the hilt,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.700
and that's why I'm demonstrating them.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.190
So I'm going to choose a couple of those,
the two that I just showed you.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.610
And I'm going to ask it, well,
why don't you convert those movie files?

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.650
And what they do is they scan to see
what QuickTime exporters are available,

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.740
and they offer them.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.480
So this application, I have to say again,
was written and this version shipped

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.530
before we shipped our 3G support.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.870
But, man, it just works.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.800
And this is good application programming.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.690
And I encourage you,
if you're an application developer,

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.460
to do as well as this.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.600
So I'm going to choose export to 3GPP.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.980
And here we can bring up the settings.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:35.580
So here the choices we offer you are
two of the... important 3GPP releases,

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.950
where they allow different services,
and the entity Docomo's own service.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.260
And I'm going to choose release 5.1.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.060
Here, again, as I say,
you can choose H.263 on page 4.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.540
I'm going to pick H.263,
because I'm going to create content

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.380
that I want to be widely applicable
to lots and lots and lots of phones,

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.520
and that's the mandatory codec.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.660
176 by 144, that's a good size.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.970
I don't want it to be
seen smaller than that,

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.230
and let's hope the phones are that big.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.280
And in this case, I'm running a seminar,
so I'm going to let it be speech content.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.780
And in this particular case,
we didn't have a text.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.120
We're going to pick a text track.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.790
Pick the data rates.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.040
You've seen this kind of interaction
with our MPEG-4 export dialog.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.060
We can pick a data rate and
the keyframes and so on.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.400
And in speech, I'm going to let it use
all the bits it can.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.020
It's not as if a speech codec
uses a lot of the channel,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.100
even when you allow it to really crank.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.110
And it's a mono content, and as I say,
there is no text track.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.990
Here we could set up to restrict
distribution if we were going

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.520
to an entity Docomo service,
but we're not here.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.720
And I don't need this
hinted for streaming.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.240
We will hint it for streaming,
but in this case, I don't need to.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.520
So that sets the options.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.210
I'm going to choose a
folder here to put them in.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.440
3GP file sounds like a great folder name.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.300
When I click choose,
it runs the export operation

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.880
on all the files I chose.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.000
So here it is cranking through.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.920
This is actually transcoding
from MPEG-4 to H.263,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.360
so it's taking a little longer than
if I started with base content.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.130
And if we look,
we find we've got a couple

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.640
of 3G files in that folder.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.950
Now, the other cool thing about
this application is that they

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.280
really did their homework.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.930
When they're given a file,
if they don't recognize it themselves,

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.640
they say to QuickTime, hey,
could you do something with this file?

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.580
And if the answer is yes, then they are.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.400
Well,
they allow you to catalog it as well.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.050
So actually,
you can catalog the content that

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.460
came off your phones or that you've
actually coded ready for your phone.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.540
So here again is the same click,
but now coded,

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.460
ready to go out to a phone.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.700
Third generation partnership project.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.580
Yep,
and here we are stumbling on the phone.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.370
So at this point,
what we could do is take those

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.320
and transfer them to a phone.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.000
So here we have the clips.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.920
I'm going to pick one of them.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.500
I have here plugged in.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.040
You can just see it flashing
blue if you've got really,

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.200
really, really good eyesight.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.580
This is a Bluetooth adapter that
I've plugged into the machine.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.620
It's somewhere way down here.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.020
And so we've got
Bluetooth on this machine.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.710
And so if I drag this on top
of the Bluetooth file exchange,

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.400
then it comes up and it says, well,
how about Frank's 3650?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.070
I happen to remember this once.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:47.950
I didn't have to search for it.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.320
I have Frank's 3650 here.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.380
I stole it from him yesterday.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.400
And when we click send,
it's going to say,

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.980
are you sure this phone
likes this kind of file?

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.100
And I'm going to say, yes, I'm sure.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.500
And the phone goes beep and says,
do you want to receive this message?

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.130
And I say, yes.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.980
And you'll see the progress bar goes.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.260
And the phone and the progress bar goes.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.750
And the progress bar.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.970
There's nothing like working in a noisy
radio environment to watch progress bars,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.530
is there?

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.210
Come on.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.880
Here it goes.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.140
and then when it finishes
downloading... Man,

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:26.870
this went like anything before
all you guys came into this room.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.800
This is very cool.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.520
This is using a Bluetooth service,
the standard Bluetooth file

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.590
exchange service,
which both we... So the phone beeps,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.920
I say show, and it comes up,
and... Holy cow,

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.480
it's the real one player.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.130
And yes?

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.320
So here we see wonderful
interoperability.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.540
I can confidently claim we didn't
write the player on this phone.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.900
You saw somebody else's logo.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.140
This is what it's all about.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.740
We're interoperating
on a public standard,

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.760
and as a result, we've got a wonderful
wealth of opportunity.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.040
Somebody else wrote the player
on the Sony Ericsson P800.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.900
Somebody else again wrote it
for the Dockermode phones.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.790
And we're playing on all of them.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.050
This is why you've got a nice
big sandbox to play in now.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:21.550
You've got lots of opportunity to go out
there and create interesting content.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.650
So, having got you all
excited about this stuff,

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.680
where can you go for more information?

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.660
Let me go through some of that.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.580
So, obviously,
the first place you're going to

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.490
go to is QuickTime's own website,
and you're going to find out

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.540
about our MPEG-4 and 3GPP support,
which you can find at

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.440
www.apple.com/mpeg4/3gpp.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.730
Don't try and say that
out loud yourselves.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.080
3GPP specifications.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.760
Good news here: they're public.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.440
Bad news: of course,
3GPP defines specifications for

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.960
everything from radio modulation
through all the numerous

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.440
interfaces in the network,
and you could learn how to build

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.850
your own cell phone network if
you read all those specifications,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.660
which means there's a lot of them.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.340
But they are public.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.860
You can find them at www.3gpp.org,
their website.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.720
There you'll find, for instance,
the AMR codec and file

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.810
form--codec specified.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.240
The file format is actually
specified by the IETF,

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.200
believe it or not.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.580
You shouldn't need to
read about the AMR codec.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.100
We've done that hard work for you.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.470
We've got it implemented.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.880
But the 3G file format and the multimedia
services you might want to look at,

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.560
and as I said before,
you might want to pull down 26.234.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.800
If you're really curious about
the details of what you can do

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.720
in terms of codecs and so on,
I'd suggest you look at release 5

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.000
if you're intending to go there.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.880
MPEG-4 specifications are not public.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:44.280
However, you can buy them publicly
by going to the ISO website,

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.920
www.iso.ch.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.660
"Ch" because they're in Switzerland.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.880
MPEG-4 is the 14496
family of specifications,

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.180
currently up to part 12,
which is the multimedia file format,

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.120
the ISO file format part 12,
and I think they've

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.340
actually hit 14 or 15.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.150
But the part you're curious
about probably is part 1,

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:08.320
systems, and maybe the audio part where
you'll find the specification

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.020
for AAC if you're curious.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.190
ITU specifications you
can get from the ITU,

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.100
believe it or not.

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:18.190
They're an international treaty body,
so they actually have an int domain name.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.910
They're www.itu.int,
and that's where you'll find

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.560
H.263 if you're curious,
though you've had H.263 in

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.130
QuickTime since I can remember.

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:28.620
There are related technologies.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.610
If you're excited about cellular
telephony and what you can do with

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.800
that and your Mac and your Mac OS X,
obviously you should know about iSync.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.660
And I encourage you to learn about it.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.380
There isn't a developer session
this week because it's an end user,

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.860
not a developer technology.

00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:46.040
But this allows you today to sync up your
contacts and your calendar really easily.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.200
It uses Bluetooth and other means
of communication with the phone,

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.490
but Bluetooth is the one
that works beautifully,

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:52.160
of course.

00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:57.640
And Bluetooth allows you, as a developer,
to do all sorts of fun things.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.450
Now I don't know whether
you were here last night,

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.530
but last night the Salin Clicker
actually won Best of Show for

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.320
the Mac OS X Design Awards.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.480
And that's a program that runs
cooperatively between your Mac and

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.060
a cell phone that has Bluetooth that
allows you to control anything at all

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.670
on a Mac OS X that you can Apple Script,
which is very cool.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.640
And he did that because he
knew how to use Bluetooth.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.960
So that was a great piece of software.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.290
You should get up on top of the
Bluetooth technology if you don't know

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.760
about it and you're a software developer.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.190
With that,
I'm going to tell you about the

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.860
other sessions coming up today.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:29.850
Don't stay in this room.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.200
It's going to be dreadfully boring.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.460
They're going to tell you all
about how to administer a server,

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.420
for heaven's sakes.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.820
Instead,
we have lined up for you a Swedish chef

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.210
who's going to tell you how to cook
up content for your own cell phones

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:43.700
back in the room around the other side.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.400
But after that,
you should stay in there and listen

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.590
to advanced QuickTime interactivity
just to have some fun.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.310
The session that was going to be in here,
Wi-Fi and 3G,

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.170
has unfortunately had to be cancelled.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.090
So don't come back here for that
session because it won't be happening.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.740
Tomorrow, however,
there's lots of fascinating

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.880
QuickTime sessions.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:06.130
Come to the QuickTime feedback forum,
of course, at 3:30, and tell us what you

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.880
think about QuickTime,
or what we ought to be doing,

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.340
or what we did wrong,
or what we did-- tell us

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.460
what we did right sometimes,
OK?

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.450
And on Friday,
there's the final QuickTime sessions.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.500
If you have developer questions
about QuickTime technologies,

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.200
then obviously Guillermo is your man,
QuickTimeMan@apple.com.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.180
And if he's not your man,
he's really nice.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.200
He'll forward you to the right person.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.200
So if you've got any
questions after the show,

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200
and that's the only email
address you remember,

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.200
