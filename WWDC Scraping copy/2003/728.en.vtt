WEBVTT

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.560
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.960
Thank you.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.540
You're in the How to Produce a
QuickTime Listening Party session.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.900
And basically,
the concept of an online listening

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.510
party was derived from the idea
that bands and labels would invite

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
a number of folks to create an event
out of the release of an album.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.120
And with the sort of advent
of streaming live on the web,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.100
it's translated off as a marketing
vehicle and a way to sort of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310
have fans listen to records.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.680
We're lucky enough to have
several great speakers today,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.630
some who flew from
Los Angeles from Warner Records,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.820
and some other folks from our
QuickTime team that delivers a lot

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.130
of listening parties for labels,
as well as one of our server

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.450
engineers who's going to give
you a sneak peek into how this is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.620
going to be even easier and better.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.750
We're going to save QA for
the end of the show,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.970
and if you do want to ask a question,
please use the microphone as

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.120
all of the questions need to
be translated into Japanese,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.400
and we'll be happy to answer them.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:38.700
Thank you.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:02:56.600

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.230
Glenn went a little bit of
what a listening party is.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.830
Going back a little further,
the olden days,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.960
they had record release parties.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.840
And it would be an event
basically for industry people,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.960
retailers, media, to get them all around,
to liquor them up and hand them copies

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.190
of the CD or vinyl at that time,
and get a good word

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.960
spread about the release.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.500
The industry doesn't make
quite as much money anymore,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.060
so I think that goes away.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.640
And it's also probably not that effective
a way of marketing your product.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.240
So with the Internet,
getting the actual customers

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.320
to be involved in the record
release is a pretty good thing,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.770
rather than the people that are going
to be getting the CD for free anyways.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.770
So there's two basic types of listening
parties as they've evolved into today.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:05.980
One would be for longer
duration kind of exposure.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.980
And if we could go to...

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.160
The Dev Machine One.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.540
Example of this on our
site is a new artist,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.140
a product by an artist
called Weekend Players,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.320
came out earlier this year,
end of last year.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.040
And it's not going to get any airplay,
MTV is not going to play it,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.450
but it's the type of thing where we
feel if a customer can listen to it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.090
enough time and really get into it,
it's a really good groove.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.260
It's been persistent on the dance
charts and people are really liking it.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.070
But it's not the type of,
it's not a huge event.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.220
It's the kind of thing that we
really want people to be able

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.130
to come whenever they want to,
listen to the album in full,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.720
and really get into it.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.480
And so when you go to this site,
the Listening Party player

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.810
will pop up automatically.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.260
You can listen to it.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.640
That's not good.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.640
It puts you around tracks.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.500
You can hear the entire thing played.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:06:28.700

[Transcript missing]

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.060
Or I guess go to the Apple Store and
buy it for $9.99 probably.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.250
Though, this is hip-hop and you
probably couldn't find it there.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:07.670
The way we produce and
present these things,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.660
the longer term experience,
we do the track by track.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.620
We really want you to be
able to get into the music.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.980
And it's been very successful for
bands like the Flaming Lips was an

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.360
example of Warner Brothers Records,
I think.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.370
And I'm very,
very happy with that online listening

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.600
party where people can come at any time,
listen to the entire album,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.680
track by track,
pick the tracks that they wanted to hear.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:40.000
And it really helped grow the grassroots
of the Flaming Lips release and the

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.330
sales grew and people found out about it.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.960
It was a really good way.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.220
What we generally do on rhino.com
where it's more of a just,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.140
hey, these are songs you
already know probably.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.350
Here it is in a good collection,
listen to it.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.600
We create one stream, one file.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.420
It's not track by track,
it just streams from the

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.130
beginning to the end.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.720
We tell you what the tracks
are in the listening party,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:10.420
but because of,
it might be a six CD box set that

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.020
we're doing a listening party
of and that would be a very,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.510
very large streaming file.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.360
So we'll pick out 10 to 20 tracks
and tell you what those are and

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.260
then you can click on the next one.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.680
And you can click to the product
to see what the full track list.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.160
Another reason why it might not be
a full track list in a listening

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.560
party is the artist doesn't
want you to hear everything.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.830
Or in our case,
there's often licensing issues where one

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:42.280
track is owned by a different company
and they won't allow us to put up that

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.160
track in a listening party without going
through complicated legal maneuvers.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.270
It's just not worth it.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.710
In terms of promotion,
how we get these and in

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.540
general how it's out there,
we've got our own internal email lists,

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.100
genre of the store.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.970
We go to partners or
purchase email lists.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:13.160
And then we also try and integrate
the best we can with other on-site

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:19.130
events or on-site communication,
and then any off-site communication

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.100
that we can to tell people about it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.390
The thing of particular interest
is the lessons that we've learned

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.930
We've been doing these for
the past four years or so,

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.510
five years.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.500
It's very important to
pay attention to ROI,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.800
to return on investment.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:45.270
And there are a bunch of different
ways to look at returns of listening

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.620
parties and all online opportunities.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.600
There's the basic one,
the product exposure,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.230
just letting people know that it exists.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.420
So that the next time they're in
Best Buy or Tower or Walmart and

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.760
they see it on the shelves,
they spot it, they recognize it,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.680
they're interested in it,
they'll go and look at

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.750
it and hopefully buy it.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.640
Of particular interest
to us is brand awareness,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.260
because as Rhino.com,
as the collection of the catalog,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.580
we want people to know about Rhino.com.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.590
almost as much as we want people to
know about the individual product.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.330
We want people to know more
about the store and the

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.480
entire catalog that we've got.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.020
We want people to return to our website,
not just for this promotion,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.470
but for anything else.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.510
We want to gather email addresses.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.710
We want to make this sale.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.900
We want return sales.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:51.710
All of these things
aren't that hard to track,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.220
but they're generally forgotten.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.700
They're generally not considered
when a listening party is created,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.580
and oh my God, we got it out,
and 50,000 people came

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.380
in to listen to it.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.230
Isn't that great and wonderful?

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.760
We did a promotion.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.660
that, due to circumstances,
happened to be promoted by

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.730
Apple for a little longer than
we could have even hoped for.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.850
And we got a ton of traffic in.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.120
We didn't make any sales.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.790
There were other ways that we valued it
so that it was a profitable promotion

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.540
for us in sort of our soft returns.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.430
But these are the important
things to know about because

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.030
production costs and hosting,
streaming costs, you know,

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.530
having a ton of people come listen to
your album ain't necessarily a great

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.340
thing if you're not making any money
off of them or not converting them,

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.720
not converting that stream in
anything that you value at all.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.040
You know, at the end of the month,
this very large hosting bill for

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.350
people that don't remember the album,
will never come back, never buy it,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.730
you know, it might be great to be able to
tell your boss in a marketing

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.140
report that 50,000 people a day
came in and listened to something.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.220
But it's even better to say that--and
that converted into 20,000 email signups

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:23.390
and then 10,000 return visits and
3,000 purchases and so on and so forth.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:30.850
And what we found is very often a much
smaller but far more focused promotion is

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.820
a lot more effective than creating this
big event for the sake of creating a big

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.800
event and telling all these big partners
about it and getting Yahoo and Apple and

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.580
everyone else to get all excited about
it and get in front of millions of

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.820
people that couldn't care less and
just have no reason to be interested

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.860
in what you're trying to promote.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.100
You'd be far better off spending
a little extra time finding the

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.260
people that want this and finding
out what they actually want from it.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.410
And it could be what
we found in some cases,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:09.040
the real hardcore fans of a
particular release that we've got,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.650
they don't need the
entire Listening Party.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.340
They know most of the songs already.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.130
They need other information.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.720
I don't want to stand up here and say
that the Listening Party is a bad idea.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.760
But it's definitely one of the things.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.090
One of the things that we've learned over
the years is just having something up and

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.750
going is not necessarily a good thing.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:36.270
We think the next step in new media,
record label new media marketing

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.910
is to be able to figure out your
returns and what's effective

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.350
and what's not effective.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.310
And so that we stop wasting our
time and do things that are really

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:51.420
worth it and worth it to the fans
and finding out what they want.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.840
And... And that's
what's valuable to them.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.260
So... That's it for me.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.460
And then...

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.800
George Lydecker, part of
Warner Music Group Studio Services.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800
Thanks, man.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.800
Thank you.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800
If I could have the -- oh,
we've got it already.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.800
I think we're good.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800
We're good.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800
We're good.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.830
Hey, that's me.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.200
I'm George Lydecker.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.510
I'm Senior Director of
Studio Services for

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.740
Warner Brother Records,
now Warner Music Group.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.280
And I'm going to give you kind of a
little bit of an overview of what's

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.540
behind the covers on preparing
the content that these people

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.630
need for doing listening parties
and to do all the other content,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.860
audio content.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.910
We're in charge of preparing all of that.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.430
So I'll give you a quick
walkthrough of that,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.140
of our current content creation process.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.240
By the way,
our group also created all the content

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.780
that you're using on the iTunes,
at least from the

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.140
Warner Music Group perspective.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:00.100
Part of what we do is that our audio
ingest process is currently integrated

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.490
with the manufacture of physical product
as well as all of the online product.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:11.880
Everything we do is 100%
QC'd and 100% listened to.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:19.230
We feel that the quality of the audio
is very important and that every encode

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.900
and everything that we ever produce,
if it's not of the best quality,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.600
it's not good for the consumer.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.550
The other part of it that most
people don't think about when they're

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.080
making content is the accuracy of the
metadata and all of the associated

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.460
things that go along with it.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:41.250
And part of what we have to deliver
to anybody in the form of online

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.280
content is all of the graphics,
all of the album art,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.840
all of the metadata, the track listings,
the UPC numbers, the ISRC numbers.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.890
All of those things are very
important that go along with it.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.630
In an earlier session,
we were talking about enhanced CDs,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.840
and there was a complaint
about liner notes.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.740
We're strategically placing ourselves
in a position to have that content

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.900
ready for when people ask for it,
so that if there's liner note data,

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.650
if there's other information,
ancillary information,

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.070
we can get to that.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.100
Oops, hit two of them.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.960
Sound samples are created.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.700
One of the things that's unique to us is
that we actually hand listen or listen

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.480
individually to the sound samples.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.230
We have an operator that actually
selects the hook or selects what he

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:33.730
feels that the listener is going to
identify as the best part of the song,

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:38.860
and we actually drill down to that
and then create the sound sample

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:38.860
for the 30 seconds around that.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.350
Sound sample creation is also integrated
into our supply chain as well.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.800
At the point that we create the
tape masters or the audio masters

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.880
that are going to create our
content is at the point that we

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.310
also create the sound samples.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.430
Because of that,
the sound samples are in addition

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.440
inspected 100% so that we know that
the quality of them are just as good.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.970
I wanted to speak a little bit
about AAC as a quality encode.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:13.070
We are so pleased to have Apple and
to pick MPEG-4 and AAC as the codec

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.500
of choice for a couple of reasons.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.570
One is that we have a lot of legacy
content because we've been using

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.350
AAC and we think it's a great codec.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.630
We've been doing listening tests,
we've done double blind tests with it,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.560
and it's probably the best codec you're
going to get as a near CD experience,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.540
and it just keeps getting better.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.810
So we really like the fact
that they've picked that and

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.860
that they've picked MPEG-4,
which is essentially a standard.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.630
The other thing is that as I say,
it does compare well as we've

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.800
done listening tests with the
waves at the higher bit rates.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.920
We're currently encoding at
128 bit rates for a lot of the

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.790
stuff that we're now delivering.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.940
We've also investigated
newer and newer versions,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.140
and they are getting better and better,
even at the lower bit rates.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:10.160
We've done some extensive testing of
AAC+, and we're now looking at the

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.600
point at which that may be integrated
into our electronic supply chain.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.670
It's performed very well
for a lot of our tests.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.960
Future Development.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.100
We'd like to see more developers
take advantage of using command

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.130
line capabilities of Mac OS X.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.390
That's another great thing,
is that we're really happy

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.790
with Mac OS X with the
BSD Unix shell in there,

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:43.080
so that we can have command line access,
command line executables

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.800
that we can use to do massive
encodes and stuff like that.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.820
It's been really good for us so far.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.530
They will help other content
providers create lots of content.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.330
What we want to see is just a lot
of content out of there that's

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.890
available for people to get to.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.740
We're working on,
and we would like to see,

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.960
the development of tools that
will allow the conversion of

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.000
legacy AAC content to QuickTime.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.490
We have a lot of AAC content that
we've created for other vendors

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.200
like Liquid and others like
Music Match and stuff like that,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.350
where we have AAC content that
we could convert to MPEG-4

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.600
and QuickTime 6 content.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.420
We want to get that out there as well.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.900
This is a couple of quick shots
of our content preparation team.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.000
This is where we do 100% listening
of the audio to check the WAV files.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.980
It's one of our listeners.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.750
They go through and
check off all the WAVs,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.020
and then they also make
sure that the UPCs,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.610
the file name is correct,
and that the metadata is

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.100
correct as well on that.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.040
This is Eric is listening to and
creating the actual sound samples.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.390
He picks the hook and the sound sample,
edits it down to 30 seconds,

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:03.820
put in the fades,
and creates the individual sound samples.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.200
And as you can see with
that nice G3 there,

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.260
we use Mac hardware as long as we can.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.900
And the thing is that
it does have a long,

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:16.100
wonderful life because we can use,
we've used some of our

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.540
older machines forever.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.860
And this is master
preparation in this case.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.410
I think this individual
is using Pro Tools.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.770
Most of our professional
audio tools or Sonic Solution

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.610
Pro Tools are all Mac based.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.540
As well as our video encoding,
we do all the video encoding

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.350
of music videos in our area.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.240
This is one of our video encoders.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.000
This is Julie doing one of
the music videos which goes

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.040
into our asset repository.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.080
It does the video encoding.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.020
We feed it in from our video room,
which is just out of sight

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.460
in the room next door,
through SDI off of a

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.580
DigiBeta into a CineWave,
and then do our subsequent

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.270
QuickTime encodes from there.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.220
And this is our massive encoding engines.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.620
We've got a lot of 1 GHz.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.010
This is only part of it.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.390
1 GHz CPUs.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.410
We're starting to integrate
some Darwin machines into this

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.960
to do encoding for QuickTime,
MPEG-4, and other stuff that

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.200
we can deliver to Ben.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.200
Ben and I are anxiously trying to get
down the road and doing all of this.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.080
Next to that, which is just out of sight,
we have our own Cisco switch,

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.160
which fiber connects to a 35
terabyte server upstairs where

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.140
we load the content onto.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.920
But anyway,
that's just a quick look at the stuff

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.570
that we're doing and the stuff that we're
creating to support listening parties and

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.190
to provide the content that's necessary.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.200
So I'm going to turn this over to Ryan.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.070
He's going to go over some
of the details on actually

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.200
creating the listening parties.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.220
Thank you.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.200
Well,
now that you know that listening parties

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.890
are a great idea and that AAC is awesome,
let's kind of go over what the

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.620
process is to make these happen.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.830
I'm going to talk a little bit about
the encoding process and some of the

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.660
tools involved at all these steps.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.420
The encoding preparation, posting,
and the serving side of things.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.930
So first,
let's talk about encoding and hinting.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.600
So, of course you all know that
the QuickTime player does an

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.930
excellent job of encoding AAC.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.760
Actually, you can even use a little
tool called AppleScript.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.520
And start scripting it and
create your own poor man's

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.750
version or smart man's version,
if Sal corrected me yesterday,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.660
of Cleaner.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.210
So, these things are actually available
on Sal's website to download

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.740
and encode all of your audio.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.070
Of course, Cleaner,
so it's a great version to do if you

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.560
have video especially involved and
do pre-processing and handle quite

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.600
a bit of all your processing needs.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.160
Compressor,
our own little tool that integrates

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.180
very well with Final Cut Pro.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:15.860
and iTunes.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:15.860
So if you're going to do strictly audio,
the encoder for MP3s and

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:15.860
AAC in iTunes is incredible.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:15.860
So it's a really great way,
and especially since it includes

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:15.860
all the metadata on the file names.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:15.860
It's a good thing to do.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.020
And then there's this nifty
little tool called Qt Media.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.020
This is actually included in
the next version of OS X Server.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.970
It goes along with QTSS.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:30.520
It's a command line tool that you can
use to automate all of the hinting,

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:35.250
the fast starting, and annotation data of
any QuickTime media.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.020
So it's a really neat thing to use.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.730
And so you can execute a Perl
script or whatever you need,

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.690
a shell script,
to make this happen if you

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.260
have large batches of data.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.630
And it's interesting to note this.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.480
When you actually create media,
most people have a real problem when

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.000
they try to receive it from a server.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.200
They get a 415 error.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.080
What is this thing?

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.520
Well, you get this error if you
don't actually hint your media.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.660
So Apple Script is a great way to do it.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.260
If you haven't already
done it to your media,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.430
you can use a quick Apple Script from
a sales website to do a

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.660
batch hint of all your files,
or you can use that QT Media,

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.060
which is really neat.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.930
So now let's talk a bit about
once you got these files,

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.160
what do you do with it?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.970
You got to put it on
a server of some kind.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.480
So QGSS or Darwin handles this well.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.500
They're both free,
available with N2QGSS pre-installed

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.600
in Mac OS X server.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.730
And DSS is the Darwin version,
the open source version of our server

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.490
that's available for free on our website.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:39.690
And it's available for, I think,
pre-compiled for NT and Linux and

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.190
all kinds of other fun stuff.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.980
You need some kind of FTP software?

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.900
Pop them up on the server.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.760
And a web browser.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.460
That's all you need.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.790
Once you've got that, you're done.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.570
So that with QuickTime Pro,
and you've got a

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.320
complete encode solution,
and you're ready to go.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.600
So let's talk a bit about the preparation
and the posting of the process.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.910
Once you got these files,
you got to throw them up on the

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.610
server using your FTP software.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.860
You put them in the, on the server,
you put them in your library

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.600
QuickTime Streaming Server directory.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.090
And now what?

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.900
What do you do?

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.000
Well, it's really simple,
just a couple of clicks.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.700
I'm just going to go through it here.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.570
You select the playlist.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.600
You want to start a new one.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.270
It takes you here, you click on the
New Movie Playlist button,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.780
link, and this is the last step.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:31.800
All you do is you give it a name,
you select the play mode,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.900
and there are three play modes.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.200
Sequential,
which steps through your whole list of

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.670
items in your playlist one at a time,
but then stops the

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.040
playlist once it's done.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.780
Or there's sequential, looped,
which does the same thing,

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.080
but it loops it at an infinite
item until you decide,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.070
hey, enough of that.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.720
And then there's the
random weighted version,

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.700
which you can also set the
weight in the playlist.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.700
And that's that little
column on the right there.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.580
You can say, I want to play this 5, 1, 2,
up to 10.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.420
And basically,
that weights it in the list,

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.810
and it plays it randomly
based upon that weight.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.530
So if you have a 10,
it's 10 times more likely than

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.180
a 1 to appear in the playlist.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.320
It's very handy to do if you're going
to actually do this for a long time.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.600
You can even do a radio station that way,
should you so desire.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.210
And with the latest version
of QuickTime Streaming Server,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.080
you can upload and change
the playlists on the fly,

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.920
which is kind of nice.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.410
So you really can get a kind
of a radio way of-- you could

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.600
create your own radio station.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.120
A number of college stations
have actually done this.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.560
It's interesting to note
this mount point thing.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.160
This is actually the
most confusing thing,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.400
perhaps, of the whole process.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.400
This is what you're going to call,
basically, the link to your playlist.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.770
And I'll show you exactly
how that plays out here.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.490
Say you have a server named Dr.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:54.940
Evil.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.710
This would be, if you created an Interpol
playlist and called it

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.840
Interpol.stp as your mount point,
this would be your link to your playlist.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.220
Really pretty straightforward.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.160
You type that into the
QuickTime player in the open URL,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.460
command U,
and you'll be able to receive it,

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.960
no problem, if you've already hit start.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.590
Which, all you have to do is
hit that play button,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.710
and you're done.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.600
You're going.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.830
So it's that simple.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.490
I mean, it's really basic.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.480
And this is basically, it becomes live.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.400
So it's recorded media
that you can serve out,

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.020
and it's streamed so people
can't randomly access the list

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.920
if you don't want them to,
which is quite nice.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.090
So let's talk a little
bit about the delivery,

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.460
what actually happens after this.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.890
You have to prepare it in some way
to make it actually presentable

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.250
to people so they can see it and
have an enjoyable experience,

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.310
especially if you have
an audio only playlist.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.510
You want to have some
kind of visual experience.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.780
So you need a couple of tools.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.740
You need Make Ref Movie,
which prepares - it's a

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.940
free tool on our website,
and it just creates a Ref Movie,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.480
which is a way to put one link
on your web page and based

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:07.120
upon the selection of the user,
they say they have a 300 kilobits

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.740
- they can receive up to ISDN,
say.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.120
So they can - it figures out
which bit rate they should get

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.110
based upon what they've selected.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.360
So if they have that ISDN,
they can get a 100k stream,

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.080
it feeds them a 100k stream.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.640
That simple.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.600
And I'll go a bit into
that in the next slide.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.850
Apple scripts, like I said,
on Sal's site - there's a whole bunch

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.760
that help you with preparation of the
media after you have them on the server,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.520
the Ref Movies and add
annotations and such.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.030
And also the Nkuchi StreamSplicer,
which is another free tool that we

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:44.960
have that allows you in a live stream,
so even if you're using Broadcaster,

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:49.110
if you have a 28k stream and you
want to have a video experience,

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.580
you use this tool and it puts
that onto the stream for you.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.200
And you use that on Ref Movies,
not on the media itself.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.500
So then you create your ref movie.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.660
So I've got three links here.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.560
I have a 56, 100,
and 300K version of the stream.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.470
And you can have an uber ref movie,
a ref movie that figures out,

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.600
that's the one you put on your web page.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.230
It figures out what bit rate you've
got and gives you the stream.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.430
So that points to three other
ref movies in this case that

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.540
points to the SDP files.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.730
So those three ref movies in the
middle have the links that are above.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.980
And the reason I do that is it kind of,
you don't have to ever

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.950
update the uber ref movie.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.860
You can just leave that alone.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.380
You don't have to change your website.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.440
You don't have to change anything.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.430
You just change the files
that are on your server,

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.580
which is kind of handy.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.760
So then you have to put on your website.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.320
Well, there's this nasty,
nasty tag named the object tag that

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.410
allows you to get around the whole
IE not using Netscape style plug-ins.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.160
So don't worry about this.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.320
There's a link later on that tells
you where to get all this information

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.740
and how to put it together yourself.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.650
But this is what you put into your
web page to basically launch the

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:03.880
QuickTime player from your web page
or launch the QuickTime plug-in.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.960
So now there's just a couple
delivery options I want to go over.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.300
See, if you have an audio-only stream,
say you want to add some annotation data,

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.260
and you want to display that alongside.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.440
Well,
you can stream QuickTime-- in QuickTime,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.460
you can stream text tracks as well.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.200
So that's what this radio station,
AV Deck-- they do an indie radio

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.770
out of England-- they give you
some annotation data along with it,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.610
and it changes with every song.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.810
So it's really kind of neat.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.120
Or you can throw in some video tracks,
like I said before.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.830
You can put it in and put it in with
the stream itself so that it changes

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.410
with by song or anything like that.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.300
It's really quite nice.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.000
You get some wonderful video experience.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.600
And then also, you can put on top of this
with QuickTime an href track.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.910
So if somebody were to
actually click on it,

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.530
you have a button on there that says,
hey, click here to buy now,

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:56.440
or click here to see the website or
listen more or whatever you want.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.740
They can click on that,
it launches a web browser

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.140
and puts it right next to it.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400
It's a really neat experience.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.400
We actually have that
in the QuickTime player.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.320
You can--we do it all the time.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.710
If you--when you launch
it the first time,

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.400
it comes up with something
we call the QTPix.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.400
And it'll--you can click on that and
it'll take you usually to the website

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.390
or to the Quick--iTunes music store,
anything like that.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.860
and now I'm going to bring up
John Anderson here to show you what's

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.900
coming next with QuickTime Streaming
Server and some great tools that we have.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.160
So as he said, I'm John Anderson.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.980
I'm an engineer on the
QuickTime Streaming Server team.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.320
And what I'm showing you
today is QTSS Publisher.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.860
And basically,
this is a way to automate a

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.600
lot of the things that Ryan was
just kind of talking about.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.650
So, I mean,
you can go through and you can

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.660
make the ref movie yourself.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.850
You can make sure that
the movie is hinted.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.160
You can go through and
create your web page.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.120
Make the object tags with all the
embed tags inside of them by hand.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.960
And, you know,
I'm sure you'll go home with a smile

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.100
on your face at the end of the day.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.420
But there will be an easier way.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.470
And that's the publisher.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.290
And so I'm going to go
ahead and start this up.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.480
Now,
what this does is you run this on any

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.300
Mac on your network or basically any
Mac that has access to your server.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.200
And you connect to your server.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.820
And then in your library,
this is very similar to iTunes.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.540
So in your library,
you can see a comprehensive list,

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.270
basically, of all of the media that's
been uploaded to your server.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.310
And if you want to upload something new,
then all you do is just

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:38.010
drag it up from the Finder.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.960
And you can pick where you
want it to go on the server.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.860
Now, this is a JPEG,
so I'm not going to bother uploading it.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:50.330
And you can also see your library
both in hierarchical view,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.930
and you can see it in list view as well.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.910
So lots of neat options there.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.690
So I'm going to open up
my notes real quick here,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.880
so I don't get off track.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.450
The next thing that we're going to do is,
I'm just going to go ahead and

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.410
click on one of these files here.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.410
We'll go to Losing Grip for example.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:17.830
We'll go to Settings.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.600
This is actually a video file.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.070
But you can see in your settings here,
you can edit the movie annotations.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.390
Now this is a beta.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.000
There's going to be more annotations
in the final version to match

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.740
basically the annotations that
are in the QuickTime player.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.030
This means that instead of
having to download a movie

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.050
and change the annotations,
or instead of having to use command line

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.180
tools or something like that remotely,
you can just go in right here and

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.210
change the annotations and apply them.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.180
There's also this URL tab.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.060
And what it does is,
basically what you're

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.060
looking at is a repository.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.720
So anything you put in here is not
immediately publicly available.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.410
It's basically there
for you to work with.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.370
So you can go in and once you
check this media is available

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.260
for streaming checkbox,
then you get a URL.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.310
So there's no question about like,
you know, how do I get to this movie?

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.040
What's the RTSP URL for this movie?

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.130
It's right there.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.210
So I mean you can click on it
and test it and see the movie.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.600
I'm evidently not getting audio.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.600
Never mind.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.550
So...

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.800
I think I may be working without notes.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.840
The next step I'm going to
do is I'm going to look into

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.060
some of these playlists here.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.260
You can see there's media playlists,
which you would use for

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.560
MPEG-4 or AAC files.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.680
And of course there's MP3 playlists
if you want to do shoutcast streaming.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.550
But you want to do AAC.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:48.830
I've just determined that for you.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:56.660
So what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to create a new media playlist,

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.270
and I'm just going to
call it Listening Party.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.500
So that's going to pop me over right
away into the settings for the playlist.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.000
And I'm going to go into
this hierarchical view,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.300
just so I can go into
my Liz Phair CD here.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:18.110
And I'm just going to go ahead and select
the whole thing and drag it down there.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.900
And again,
you can set the play mode and everything.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.200
It's got all the features
that the web admin has.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.110
But in addition,
you have this option here,

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.340
which is you can broadcast manually,
which is where you just click

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.030
start at any given time and click
stop when you want it to stop.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.480
And you can also broadcast
at a specific time.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.580
So you can actually make a
listening party available at,

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.330
in this case, a few days ago at noon.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.130
Or you can run it weekly.

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.460
So those are kind of neat options.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.960
And it saves you from having to write
a cron script or something like that.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.320
So...

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.360
So one thing that's important
to note as well is that,

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.400
like I said,
this is all-- unlike when you

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.700
put things in the Movies folder
to add them to Playlists,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.210
these are not available on demand.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.890
So you can actually make it so
that movies are available only

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.290
through this Listening Party.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:23.020
And once the Listening Party stops,
then the movies are no longer available.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.480
So that's a nice feature as well.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.660
And it's the same thing here.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.200
I'm going to go here and
manually start the Playlist.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.860
So, should be broadcasting at this point.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.740
And you'll notice here
I go to the URL tab,

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.930
and if I click on that, then I should...

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.560
So you can hear the playlist.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.250
It's in progress.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.650
It's a live broadcast.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:49.840
So yeah, I mean,
you could take that URL and use it

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.910
to make the ref movie and create all
the tags and everything like that.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.810
But that seems a bit inconvenient.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.150
So what we're going to do here is
we're going to go to the Links tab.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.860
And what you can see here is
basically a list of everything

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.820
that's publicly available.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.820
So every movie that you've
made available for streaming,

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.180
every playlist that you've set
up is going to show up right here

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.210
comprehensively in this links view.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.970
And over here in the display tab,
this basically describes how you're

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.300
going to embed this in the page.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.090
So, for example,
I could go in here and I could say,

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.240
just autoplay it.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.420
As soon as they open
this particular web page,

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.770
start playing the stream.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.280
There's a bandwidth tab that you
can go in here and basically set

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.800
up a multi-bit rate breath movie.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.280
So this is what he was talking about
where you can actually set up different

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.280
streams for different bandwidths.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.780
And then there's an HTML tab.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.900
And so if you have your favorite
HTML editor already set up,

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:52.220
like BBEdit or Dreamweaver or
whatever it is that you use,

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.060
I don't want to offend
any developers out there,

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.240
I'm going to go ahead and open up
BBEdit because I have it on here.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.220
And I'm going to make the
world's simplest web page.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.380
So I'm just going to
say new HTML document.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.380
I'm not even going to title it.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:13.920
Let's take this code and
drag it right into BBEdit.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.000
Unimaginative Name,
and drag it onto Safari.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.500
You see I have a web page with that
content already embedded in it.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.090
So that's pretty cool.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.300
But the next step is to be able to take
that and run it through a template,

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.370
and get an entire web page out of it.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:44.500
And the engine that we use
for this is an Apache engine.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.120
The standard is XSL.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.950
So it's a very powerful standard.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.780
You could even have it make a
web page and a PDF file to go

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.850
along with it if you wanted to.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.190
I mean, there's lots of neat stuff
you can do with that.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.160
And so I'm just going to go ahead
and highlight this listening party.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.710
And I'm going to go back
to the Display tab here,

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.980
and change it to say I want
to open the QuickTime player.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.280
We like it when things open
in the QuickTime player.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.800
And I'm going to take this JPEG here
that just says click here to listen.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.140
Again, not terribly imaginative,
but whatever.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.650
And so we've set it up differently now.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.960
It's going to embed it in the
page a little bit differently.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.170
And so now what I'm going to
do is just click Make Web Page.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.780
And I have a template set
up called Listening Party.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.100
And I'm just going to call it--
I have no imagination here.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.530
I'm going to call this Listening Party.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.180
So that's the name of my page.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.370
I think I'll actually-- yeah.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.050
So what this is doing actually
now is it's running it through

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.580
that Apache XSL engine.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:50.180
It's creating all the ref
movies on the fly right there.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.840
And now we have a page.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:55.050
And so I can click on this,
and it will open the stream

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.170
in the QuickTime player,
hopefully.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.980
Okay, so we're running a beta OS,
so I'm going to go ahead and force

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.340
the QuickTime player to quit,
and give that another try.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.660
And if it doesn't work,
then you get the idea.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.020
Yeah,
apparently I needed more creative names.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:27.180
But I think you can probably use your
imagination and realize that you would

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:35.770
be hearing Liz Phair right now if
you weren't seeing the spinny cursor.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:35.780
So that's...

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.920
That's the publisher.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.200
Kind of a cool tool.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.080
And that's coming out with Panther.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.140
So I hope you all look
forward to seeing it.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.080
And who's up next?

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.600
That's the way it is by the sort
of fifth session that I've hosted.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.560
That's the first crash I've seen,
so you're fine, John.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.050
That's okay.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.260
Anyway, thank you.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.550
That was really good.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:11.690
And clearly, you know,
sort of we use the context of a listening

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:16.470
party with albums and songs and either
the longer display that Ben was talking

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:20.880
about for albums that need exposure or
for the newer albums that are events.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.400
But this is obviously applicable to
the audio and video that makes up a

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:29.120
course at higher education and K through
12 and in learning institutions.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.230
Any sort of series of assets can be
played sequentially or randomly or

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.430
in a weighted random way to do that.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.460
So now what I'd like to
do is I guess invite,

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.480
you know, all of our speakers up and
we'll try and do a Q&A.
