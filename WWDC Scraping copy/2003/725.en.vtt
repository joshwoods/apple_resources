00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.920
A normal audio disc is referred
to as a Redbook standard.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.480
This is the format of most
standard audio CDs and it

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.860
contains up to about 99 tracks.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.110
The Bluebook standard defines
the Enhanced Music CD,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.000
it's also referred to as CD Extra,
and it's a specification for a

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.070
multi-session press disc comprising audio
and data sessions recorded separately.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.530
Essentially,
the audio and data tracks are recorded

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.020
in separate sessions so there's no
overlap between the audio and data and

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.090
also prevents the data tracks from being
played on home Hi-Fi stereo equipment.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.110
In the old days,
before multi-session discs were a

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.020
standard for creating Enhanced CDs,
CD-ROM data was often recorded

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.390
in the same session as the audio,
meaning that audio CD players,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.770
your home CD player or your car
CD player could recognize a data

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.610
track and be able to play it,
which is a terrible user experience.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.980
I've seen several older
Enhanced CDs wear a CD.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.680
The Bluebook standard was a CD player,
the data track was actually track one.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.890
So you buy a CD,
you pop it in your CD player and you

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.660
hear a horrible screeching noise.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.470
Of course,
they usually tell you that on the sleeve,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.100
but it's not exactly an
ideal user experience.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.720
On a Bluebook multi-session disc,
the first session is audio.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.680
It can contain up to 98
tracks and after the session,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.240
the audio has been recorded,
a second session,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.060
the data is burnt onto the disc.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.040
Typically,
the second session is a hybrid session

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.240
that contains both the Mac and PC data.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.080
And there's also an approximate 27
megabyte lead out and lead in gap

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.010
between the audio and data sessions.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.720
The gap is necessary to prevent the
data tracks from being recognized as

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.790
audio tracks on standard CD players.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.010
It also adds a significant
real estate space on the disc.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.900
The Enhanced CDs I create
are often for record labels

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.500
and media related companies,
so I concentrate on packing as much

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.010
media as I can on the second session
after the audio has been finalized.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.230
I usually always need to know precisely
how much audio is going to be included

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.940
on the disc in order to gauge the
real estate space I have left.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.120
And real estate space, I'm just literally
talking about megabytes.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.550
We've got 700 megabytes
at maximum to work with,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.390
so if there's 18 tracks at 72 minutes,
that's not much space left.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.130
We always have to plan for the
contingency that we're going

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.810
to have to leave something
off if we run out of space.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.780
Always, always, always,
always use video in QuickTime format.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.280
I haven't found any format that
works better on Enhanced CDs.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.830
QuickTime is definitely the best.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.960
I usually use Sorenson 3,
compression 320x240 frame size

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.780
and a rate of 1500k per second.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.200
Sometimes we'll push it up to
512x384 frame size and a 2000

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.060
or 2500kb per second rate,
but that increases the file size

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.950
considerably and some machines
have harder times playing it.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.900
So I'll typically offer the user
a choice to decide between the

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.140
two and just leave it up to them.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.160
We've tried encoding at 640x480,
but few machines can

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.760
handle it seamlessly.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.360
So we usually stick to
512x384 and 320x240.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.600
Always include standard
web links on Enhanced CDs,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.880
photo galleries, music,
always in QuickTime format,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.190
and an option to sign up for the project
or artist or label's mailing list.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.060
The mailing list information is
interesting because it can be collected

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.650
straight off the disc by sending the
information directly from the Enhanced

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.560
CD application to a script on the web.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.580
So no browser is necessary.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.650
It's a seamless experience.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.130
You're just watching a video.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.360
You can sign up for an artist
mailing list or do other interactive

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.750
things while you're video content.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:51.300
[Transcript missing]

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.670
When I author Enhanced CDs,
I nearly always use Macromedia Director.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.960
It's a great tool,
and I use it to create the

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.430
main interfaces and the
portal to the actual content.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.170
Director is really easy to use.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.910
I can hide hidden content with a
standalone projector application and

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.240
integrate a lot of different media
components into the director framework.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.560
Just to establish terminology,
I use the term projector

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.280
to refer to the interface.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.220
It's basically just a standalone
application that sits on the disk.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.930
If there's a type of media that
someone wants to use on an Enhanced

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.320
CD and Director doesn't support it,
chances are there's a plug-in,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.160
there's an extra,
or some script written in lingo

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.270
that'll get around it or somehow be
able to import it in there and use it.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.320
The most advantageous reason I've
found to use Director for interactive

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.820
Enhanced CDs is its excellent
ability to channel information

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.740
in and out of the application.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.870
Database interaction allows
us to handle email collection,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.620
push dynamic content
directly into the interface,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.080
and manage user experience.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.630
We can record and track pretty
much anything we want to about

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.640
the user's experience without
disrupting their experience.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.050
It's all handled by
scripts in the back end.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.400
So that's the main reason why I choose
to use Director as a powerful tool

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.320
to author Enhanced CDs that require
a lot of interactivity and tracking.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.340
There are some limitations, though,
and if anyone out there

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.570
is from Macromedia,
I'd like to just spend a few

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.310
minutes on how Director could
be a little bit better.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.290
The biggest problem I have with... Oh,
there we go.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.880
The biggest problem I have with
Director is you have to author

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.340
multiple projectors per project.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.460
I'll typically author three
projectors per project,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.880
one for the PC, one for OS 9,
and then one for OS 10.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.380
Flash handles the authoring of
multiple projectors rather seamlessly,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.530
but Director doesn't.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.670
Director does handle many
standard CD-ROM media formats,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.440
so that's a very good thing.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.060
And QuickTime is one of the formats that
usually works flawlessly in Director.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.080
MP3 audio in Director is
often problematic for me.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.020
There's often occasional
distortion things that happen,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.660
especially in the QC process.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.710
MP3 audio sometimes gets cut off.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.350
And the biggest issue, I think,
with Director is the size issue.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.460
When you author a projector interface
with no graphics or content at all,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.120
it takes up a minimum of
two megabytes of space.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.340
When I'm dealing with a 77-minute
audio disk and I need to author

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.640
a hybrid Mac and PC session,
on the same 80-minute capacity disk,

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.810
that two megabyte space is way
too much for that kind of project.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.280
So it really can mean the
difference of fitting the data on

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.390
the disk or not if I use Director.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.540
At this point I want to show you a few
examples of interesting things that

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.120
we've been able to do with Director.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.760
And the first example is the
James Bond Die Another Day Enhanced CD.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.260
The CD featured an extensive
photo gallery of all Bond movies,

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.260
a dynamic photo gallery
of all the Bond women,

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.780
in addition to two video clips,
one from Madonna,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.560
and email collection of course,
and links to other video

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.130
content on the web.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.200
The next example is the
Fleetwood Mac Best Of.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.740
This Enhanced CD was definitely
a disk space challenge project.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.080
Somehow we were able to
cram a five minute video,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.400
lyrics to all 36 songs
in the compilation,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.470
full discography, email collection,
web links,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.700
and bonus content onto an audio disc
that was already 70 minutes run time.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.390
The last example was an interesting
example of requiring email registration

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.660
to access exclusive content on the web.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.500
It was for the Lord of the Rings,
Fellowship of the Ring Enhanced CD.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.100
It came out about a year and a half ago.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.140
The disc actually featured
practically no content at all.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.830
There wasn't enough time to
put content on the disc itself.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.330
But an exclusive link got you to bonus
web content and access to the content

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.820
was given by required email registration.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.810
The site featured several video trailers,
an Enya e-card, wallpaper, stationery,

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.390
buddy icons, and more.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.240
Email signups are actually still
being collected off of that

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.170
disc even though the Two Towers
has been out for six months.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.070
And I think to date we've
received about 400,000 unique

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.400
registrations from that Enhanced CD.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.620
So that was a really good Enhanced CD.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.420
It worked out really well.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.680
The tremendous response from the first
Enhanced CD was a great lead into

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.340
the planning of the next release,
the Two Towers.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.400
And a special internet
version was actually prepared.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.960
I believe for the next release.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.590
And it was specifically offered to the
consumers who bought the first one.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:40.120
Some of the music projects I work on
are distributed all over the world.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.820
And an interesting byproduct
of that is that some discs,

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.490
many discs,
often need to be re-authored depending on

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.290
chart regulations in foreign countries.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.400
The UK, in particular,
has specific chart regulations.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.420
Only one web link can
be included on a disc,

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.770
which is quite limiting.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.070
Video data is limited to 15 minutes,
no more.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.830
And email collection can't
physically appear on the disc

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.400
itself without impeding the chances
that the CD will have to chart.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.380
Most other worldwide territories don't
have those stringent restrictions,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.050
but there are some new laws
now that require content to

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.850
be approved a little bit more
specifically now than it was before.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.090
Lastly,
I just want to spend a few minutes

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.220
going over the QC process for
Enhanced CDs from an operating system

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.640
perspective and a user perspective.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.820
After all the content has been assembled
and approved by the content owner,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.800
the fun is really just starting for
me and all the wonderful engineers

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.120
who have to sit down and test every
possible user path through every

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.040
single screen of the Enhanced CD.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.790
All the functionality has to be
tested from a detailed standpoint

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.600
for the user and operating systems,
of course.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.910
And typically, they're tested on every
platform imaginable.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.050
And there are always minor
discrepancies between OS platforms

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.590
and sometimes major discrepancies,
sometimes with the media,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.250
a direct or playback error,
an encoding flaw,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.220
or a stupid mistake that I made.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.660
And it's usually the latter.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.520
Just as an example,
it took several days to QC Lincoln Park's

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.640
Meteora CD and get it out the door
due to a Windows 98 and OS 9 issue

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.580
with a plug-in that I was using
to play the Redbook audio off the

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.480
CD inside the director interface.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.450
It took us about four days to get
through that and production death

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.780
threats were made in our directions,
but we finally got a solution.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.090
And typically it usually takes
about one to four days to

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.520
QC an Enhanced CD entirely.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.930
Depending on how much content there
is and depending on how complex the

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.940
back-end components are as well.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.710
Ideally, from a user perspective,
the enhanced CD experience should be

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.900
as seamless as possible and not require
any added effort on the user's part.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.440
Generally,
I like to test and make sure the

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.780
user has all the components needed to
play all the content on an enhanced

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.060
CD before the application launches.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.730
Several checks can be made in the
background without the user being

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.790
aware of anything that's going on.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.490
However, the most often scenario is that
the user doesn't have QuickTime and

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.140
they're forced to download it.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.180
I'd love to establish a method where
the latest version of QuickTime could

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.160
just be automatically installed
without the user having to do anything.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.170
Currently,
I don't place the QuickTime installer

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.460
on the disc itself.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.920
Sometimes CDs are out
in the market for three,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.210
four, or five years.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.060
Putting an installer on the disc
creates a problem that it might

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.760
be outdated during the time span
that the CD is on the market.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.880
Most of the components we can check
for and automatically update in

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.110
the background and Director has a
great way of handling some of those

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.600
things with lingo scripts and things
like that so that the user isn't

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.940
bothered by having to download a flash
component or something that they need.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.030
This time I want to turn things
over to Naveen who will probably

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.840
describe more of the marketing,
tracking, and the benefits that labels

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.040
receive from Enhanced CDs and
the future of Enhanced CDs.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:21.900
[Transcript missing]

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:32.820
John is talking about the premium ECD.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:40.550
The vast majority of ECDs produced
do not come close to Fleetwood Mac,

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.030
Lincoln Park,
or other ECDs that Jon has worked on.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:52.340
First of all,
to introduce the current state of ECDs,

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:58.790
the ECD is the post-purchase new
media connection with the consumer.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:08.340
This person took their time to go out
to a record store or buy it online.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.130
This is the one time you really have to
connect with that consumer post-purchase.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.920
It's the time for both the label and
the artist to make the connection.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.630
You know that they're a real fan
because they actually bought the disc.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:28.610
It's also one of the few parts of
a new media campaign that the label

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:34.260
typically runs that has a quote-unquote
perceived value to the consumer.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.100
I mean, the consumer doesn't really value
the website or value anything

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.820
else that the new media department
will typically do at a label.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.620
But the enhanced disc,
by way of a sticker on the

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.180
front of the disc or whatnot,
supposedly is supposed to have

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.020
some value to the consumer.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.020
And yet, even with these key
aspects of enhanced CDs,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.990
nine times out of ten, they feel rushed.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.490
And they almost never take advantage
of the technology that's currently

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.420
available at the time of purchase.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.660
There are a couple of different
types of Enhanced CDs.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.570
Jon primarily was talking about
quote-unquote standard Enhanced CDs,

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:14.640
which are director-built
multimedia pieces that actually

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.260
sit on the CD and sometimes
connect with the web or whatnot.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.500
There's another type of Enhanced
CD that Jon also briefly mentioned,

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.160
which is more of like a CD being used
as a key to access exclusive content.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.160
For example,
the Lord of the Rings Enhanced

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.410
Disc that Jon produced.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.390
Now, the beauty of the key type Enhanced
CD is that for label catalog sales

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.960
where the label is not going to put an
Enhanced Disc on a Lionel Richie CD,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.940
they can actually use like
GraceNote technology like CDDB or

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.740
whatnot to actually connect
the user via a web interface to

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.080
quote-unquote exclusive content.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:02.310
The problem is that neither of
these methods that are usually

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.920
used in the enhanced CDs ever
fulfill their potential.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.680
Typically,
a typical enhanced CD that's produced

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:16.110
by a major label today will have one
or two mediocre quality video clips.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.100
There really are few exceptions.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.760
Jon mentioned some very exceptional
enhanced CDs that were produced

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.320
and that rarely is the case.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.800
The versatility of the medium is not
really taken advantage of in any way,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.760
shape, or form.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.510
The video potentially on the disc can be
much higher quality and the beauty of it

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:43.390
is there's no waiting for the consumer to
access the rich content because there's

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.360
no need for the internet connection.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.080
The other beauty of Enhanced CDs is
that they can obviously connect directly

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.480
with communities and online-related web
content directly from the disc itself,

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.740
as Jon was mentioning.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.500
Another really key aspect that labels
fail to take advantage of is the ability

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:10.100
to install artist-branded components such
as screensavers and desktops and whatnot,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.720
which really are extremely
powerful long-term mindshare

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.900
branding opportunities they're
really taking advantage of.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:24.300
So how do labels currently
view Enhanced CDs?

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.430
They currently view them as
a pain in the ass to produce.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.340
And as Jon mentioned,
they're a QA nightmare.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.340
And they're often rushed.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.480
I mean, when you're producing a typical
enhanced CD for an artist,

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.380
there's so many cooks in the kitchen.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.190
You have to deal with the art
director and the manager of the

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.960
artist and the artist himself.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.160
And the media department is
running around like chickens

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160
with their head cut off.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.800
It's just insane.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.000
It's absolutely insane.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.580
So there's often late art delivery.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.480
And there's never really time
to really think about the

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.030
next level or think about,
are consumers really going to

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.700
use these different components?

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.110
And as Jon said, he always has to make
allowances to take media off,

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.560
either due to space issues or,
quite honestly,

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.190
the asset may not be ready.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.720
And then the labels often ask,
because very few ECDs

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.800
are tracked currently,
do people even use these things?

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.960
And that's a question that
I get asked personally.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.780
All the time when we approach a
label to produce an enhanced disc

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.780
for a given artist or whatnot.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:31.680
But the funny thing is that the potential
benefits of the Enhanced CD are huge.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.570
Jon was mentioning some of the
quote-unquote anti-piracy capabilities of

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.040
Enhanced discs because it has value and
therefore the consumer is going to say,

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.640
Oh, I'm not going to go download the
music on Napster or Kazaa or whatever.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.450
I'm just going to go buy the disc
because it has a special video clip.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.050
The reality is that that's
obviously not very true.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.690
But there is significant opportunity
to add things like music videos,

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.110
live video, live audio,
collectible extra content

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.060
such as AIM icons,
avatars, screen savers,

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.780
desktop wallpaper,
and cool database-powered active

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.360
desktops that are built in Flash.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.060
In fact,
one thing that we've actually produced,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.170
that was really, really cool,
is we produced the Linkin

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.800
Park Meteora Enhanced Disc with Jon.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.840
And we had this really,
really cool screen saver.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.560
This is actually the screen
that the consumer first sees

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.880
from the Enhanced Disc when they
go to access the screen saver.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.280
And the screen saver was actually
built in Macromedia Flash.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.940
And it was database-connected.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.970
And it allowed the user
to actually download video

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.060
content directly from the net.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.970
And it actually created
almost like an artist.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.440
And it was a branded TV channel.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.440
So it's Linkin Park videos,
24 hours a day.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.440
And then we also had a concept for the
Linkin Park campaign called Newscaster.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.440
Where it was basically Linkin
Park news for the fans,

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:03.440
by the fans.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.440
We actually sent a video crew
out on the road with Linkin Park.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.440
And they shot video.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.770
And we'd pipe it in, you know,
not real time, but we'd pipe it in on the

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.400
Linkin Park official website
and through the screen saver.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.440
So, you know,
Linkin Park is a content producer.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.430
So why not take advantage of the content?

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.440
And that's exactly what we were
able to do with the screen saver.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.440
And the screen saver was
extremely successful.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.560
In the first six weeks
of release of the album,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.320
over 100,000 users downloaded
and installed the screen saver.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.440
The beauty is the
screen saver is tracked.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.040
Another key benefit,
as Jon started to mention,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.060
is the data collection
aspects of Enhanced CDs.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:47.810
Jon mentioned the artist mailing list
capability and the amazing success

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.440
that Warner Brothers Records saw from
the Lord of the Rings soundtrack.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:10.980
There's also the capability for labels
to create genre-segmented mailing lists.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:10.980
Most labels have a "rock list"
or a "pop list" or whatnot,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:10.980
and they'll use those mailing lists
to market new artists that don't

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:10.980
already have established fan bases.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:10.980
That's a huge benefit.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.790
ECD usage statistics are not
typically tracked currently,

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.950
but they're very easy to get because
the ECDs are built in Director,

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.000
and therefore you can connect directly
to a database from the user's machine,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.080
assuming, of course,
that the user's online.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.700
So you can actually track
the usage of the ECD,

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.780
how many people are actually using it,
the content popularity,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.470
what content users are
actually using on the disk.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.450
There's a host of other
tracking capabilities available.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.040
We actually have a tracking
system that's very,

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.840
very powerful.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:47.470
And we actually now have the ability
to tell you what countries people

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.840
are using the Enhanced CD from,
and in some cases,

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.160
even what DMAs people are
using the Enhanced CD from.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.030
Additionally,
we can track the viral aspects

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:02.990
of a promotion and tell you the
send-to-a-friend ratio as far

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.200
as what the response rates are,
how many people are

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.980
doing it week-to-week,
timescale, etc.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.610
directly from the Enhanced
Disk through our reporting technology.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.460
And, of course, you can track much,
much more.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.860
Another really key benefit that labels
really fail to take advantage of

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.060
typically is the cross-sell capability.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.120
I mean, you have a disc that's
in the consumer's hand.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.560
They're actually taking the time to
open the enhanced portion of the disc.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.790
Why not take that time and offer them,
you know,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.200
previous catalog from that artist?

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.110
You know, or offer them, you know,
opportunity to purchase an

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.180
artist's DVD or whatever is coming
out for that particular artist.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.730
And if the Enhanced
CD is database powered,

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.470
then you can kind of update the
offers at any time you please.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.770
There's no reason not to
take advantage of that.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.450
Another key benefit that I was mentioning
a little bit beforehand is the viral

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.620
marketing capability of the Enhanced CD.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.600
On the Meteora CD, for example,
we actually had send Meteora to

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.040
a friend right on the ECD itself.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:18.080
So all the user had to do was enter their
email address and click send and it would

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.370
actually connect to our database system
obviously if they were online and we'd

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.950
send that user an email address saying,
hey,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.600
Johnny wanted you to check out Meteora.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.720
Go check it out.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.260
Obviously,
word of mouth is especially for the jaded

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.760
consumer in that particular demographic.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.780
Word of mouth is really the
best way to market to them.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.970
The response rates as
you saw by the graph,

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.710
that's actually real data, is massive.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.800
Thirty to sixty percent is typically
the response rate that we see from

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.340
typical viral marketing programs.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.380
That includes email to a friend,
IM to a friend, and SMS to a friend.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.030
Another key quote-unquote word of mouth,
well, not really,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.500
is the official website toolkit.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.020
This is something that we
actually included on the

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.800
Meteora Enhanced CD as well,
and it was extremely successful.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.330
Well over 100,000 kids actually
accessed the toolkit in the first

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.300
two to three weeks of album release,
and were using it on their fan sites

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.300
because we had exclusive art on
there that we had not used previously

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.850
on other Linkin Park creations.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.760
We also produced their website,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.400
And therefore,
we were actually able to tell

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.750
whether kids were actually using the
content on the Enhanced CD or not.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.850
This is what the toolkit
actually looks like.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.740
So the toolkit, typically,
when we produce them,

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.540
will contain the official
PR photos of the band,

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.440
official logos, the album artwork.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.340
And then we also include
a host of webmastery.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.510
We include a host of resources
such as how to build a website,

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:54.810
how to program HTML,
where to host a website for

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.060
free or for very low cost,
go GeoCities,

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:02.290
where to get a message board so that
fans can build their own communities

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.060
because fans really like to do that.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.700
So another core benefit
of the Enhanced CD,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.950
and I've mentioned it previously,
is obviously the database

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.040
connectivity ability.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.200
And this has very,
very rarely been put to use.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.280
In fact, I've not really seen an
Enhanced Disc that's really

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.880
well database connected.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.090
But, you know, things like updating the
artist's news and tour schedules,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:32.420
I mean, the reality is most labels that
we've talked to about this say,

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.580
"Well, who's going to update it?" Well,
someone's updating the artist's website,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.350
so why not pipe it into the same
database that powers the website?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.850
And therefore, you know,
you update one and kill

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:41.880
two birds with one stone.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:46.210
So, you know, tour schedules,
buy links directly to Ticketmaster

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.210
when tour dates go on sale,
tour journals directly from the band,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.550
and, you know, of course, much,
much more.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.360
So why don't labels do these things?

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.080
Well, the first item is cost.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:04.300
Obviously record labels are not doing
very well financially right now,

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.460
so they don't like to
spend a lot of money.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:11.510
And the new media gets a good
chunk of change currently,

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:15.320
but they're trying to cut
costs every place they can,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:19.060
and an ECD is an easy thing to cut.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.350
It's an easy thing to skimp on.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.230
It's, oh,
who cares about the Enhanced CD?

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.300
No one ever uses it anyway.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.470
So that's really one of
the first things to go,

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.050
typically,
when a label is trying to cut costs.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.600
Quite honestly,
the high cost of production tools has

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.430
an impact on the cost of ECDs as well.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.420
Macromedia Director, for example,
you actually have to buy a PC license

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:44.040
and a Macintosh license in order
to produce hybrid Enhanced CDs.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.380
So therefore, you're buying two copies of
the same program to produce

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.050
a typical Enhanced Disc,
and Director isn't cheap.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.430
Another some of the concerns
are obviously the production

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.100
timelines and the QA procedure.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.240
Enhanced CDs,
because they have to be mastered

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.780
and obviously duplicated
before they're sold at retail,

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.250
there's very,
very strict delivery times if the

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.770
label's going to meet their on-sale date.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:15.460
Jon is often stuck working
all-nighters to meet crazy,

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.910
ridiculous deadlines.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.340
We are too from the design side
and the development side because

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.500
we really don't have much time.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.380
And because the Enhanced Disc has
to be produced so far in advance

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.550
of the actual album on sale,
as I said before, assets sometimes are

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.620
really hard to come by.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.260
So we may not have the exclusive video
clip that we've been talking about for

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.920
three months when planning a given artist
release with the label New Media Head.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.120
It just might not happen,
whether it's not edited or it's

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.070
not even shot yet or whatever.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.350
It often does not occur.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:54.100
Now I'm going to talk a little bit
about how the typical artists view ECDs.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.630
Now the thing about my company
is that we actually work directly

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.790
with the artists as well.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:04.020
So oftentimes artists will ask us about
the Enhanced Disc or what's going on

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.240
with the new media promotion and whatnot.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.350
So this is kind of how the artists
currently look at Enhanced Disc.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:17.150
First I'm going to start with what should
be the artist's benefits of Enhanced

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.220
Disc and obviously rarely occurs.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.400
Key benefit is fan
relationship management.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.070
And that's very similar to
customer relationship management

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.030
because the person who buys
your disc is your customer.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.430
So things like an official artist
fan club link and potentially

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.510
giving them discounts to the
official artist fan club,

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:41.780
links to the public community so that
fans can interact with other fans,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.720
direct communication links with the
artist by way of up-to-date artist news,

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.160
the tour schedule,
the ability to offer exclusive

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.700
contests and updates through that
suppose a database connection.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.080
Additionally,
you have a great opportunity if

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:01.040
you're an artist to grow your
street team or your E-team.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.660
Now, typically a street team and an
E-team is like a three-month deal.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.960
You know,
it's totally front loaded at the

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.160
beginning of a campaign or it will kind
of go up and down with single cycles.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.890
And, you know, but I genuinely think that
especially for an E-team,

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.640
you know, street team is typically a
fixed size because of cost,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.280
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:18.900
So if you're an artist, you know,
you're going to have to buy

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:19.280
a lot of stuff for that.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.770
So, you know, you're going to have to get
a lot of stuff for that.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.650
And if you're going to be
a fan of your street team,

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.340
you're going to have to buy
a lot of stuff for that.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:33.320
And, you know, you can't just buy a whole
bunch of stuff for the E-team.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.390
You can't just buy a bunch of
stuff for your street team.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.060
You can't just buy a bunch
of stuff for your E-team.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.630
So there's no reason to not buy
a bunch of stuff for your E-team.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:45.020
And there's no reason to not buy
a bunch of stuff for your E-team.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.540
If you're an artist,
you're going to have Very,

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.360
very successful.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.560
This is actually a screen of the
Linkin Park Enhanced CD again.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.000
This is actually the page where
we actually were marketing

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.170
Linkin Park's official fan club,
which is called the LP Underground.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.320
Now the LP Underground has literally
tens of thousands of members

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.450
who are paying to join the club,
and through the Enhanced Disc we

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.620
actually had thousands of sign-ups.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.920
And the Linkin Park Disc came
out in March of this year.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.790
So it's actually been very,
very successful as a kind of

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:20.190
a cross-sell with the consumer
through the Enhanced Disc.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.150
Other benefits, as I mentioned before,
of course,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.320
are the viral marketing capabilities.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.310
They're huge.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.780
There's no reason not to do it.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.040
It's kind of like free marketing.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.920
It's the consumer marketing
on the artist's behalf.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.850
And who else better to market for you?

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:41.920
There's no reason not to do that.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.420
As I said before,
the cross-sell potential for artists

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.580
is even bigger than the labels.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.420
Typically,
labels don't really get into the artist's

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.880
merchandise and all that kind of stuff,
or the fan clubs.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:58.820
Of course, that's changing as the
industry continues to evolve.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.000
The labels are going to have more and
more reason to cross-sell merchandise

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.640
and fan club memberships through an ECD.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.060
The merchandise is huge for an artist
to be able to sell their merchandise or

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.090
offer their merchandise directly from
the Enhanced Disc by way of Weblink,

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:13.690
of course.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.730
In future,
it would be really cool to actually

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:20.590
be able to pipe updates as far
as new merchandise that goes on

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.770
sale or exclusive merchandise to
fans who actually bought the disc,

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:24.940
etc., etc., etc.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.400
I mean,
there's a million things you can do.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.560
Unfortunately, it never gets done.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.150
So what are some of the artists'
concerns with Enhanced Discs?

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:38.790
Well, artists are really concerned about
the poor production by the label.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.100
There have been several instances where
we've actually had to recreate Enhanced

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.680
CDs after the initial shipment because we
found the label found later or the artist

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.030
found after the fact that the Enhanced
CD quite honestly didn't even function.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:57.100
And that's incredibly damaging because

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.680
You damage your fan relations with
a poorly produced enhanced CD.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.780
This is your opportunity
to really communicate with

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.080
your fans on a direct basis.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.880
And if you produce a damaged
ECD that's not at the par of the

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.600
music on the enhanced disc or the
album packaging or everything else

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.810
that everyone at the label and on
the artist side and the management

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.690
company works so hard to produce,
then the consumers

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.160
oftentimes feel screwed.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.190
What's on this enhanced disc?

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.050
Why is there a sticker on this enhanced
CD package that says I have exclusive

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.820
content when I can't even access it?

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.660
And that also reduces perceived
value of the ECD compared to

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.460
similar products in a very,
very crowded marketplace.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.560
So if you're on label X and you're
a rock band and label Y's rock

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.570
band has a better enhanced disc and
obviously things are similar as far

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.120
as radio play and everything else,
and there are all the other

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.840
bazillion variables that go
into a typical artist campaign,

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.870
then having a poor enhanced
disc is kind of like having

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:57.990
a poor package or whatever.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:01.040
It's not a real,
it reduces the perceived value

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.390
directly and it's all subconscious
but it actually has an impact.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.310
and of course potential inability to
grow the mailing list and all that other

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:16.720
stuff that can be caused by rushed or
poor production on behalf of the label.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.980
Now I'm going to discuss briefly
how consumers view Enhanced CDs both

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.810
currently and how they should.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.860
The current view of Enhanced
CDs by consumers is that they

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.900
are very cheaply produced.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.650
The brand of ECD, you know,
every CD that you buy that's

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.340
enhanced has that little ECD logo.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:44.560
At least in my opinion, has been very,
the value of that brand has been

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.960
very sharply produced because
most of the ECDs that are produced

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.970
are quite honestly terrible.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.970
And they meet very low standards.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.480
They lack any real content.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.820
And sometimes they don't even work.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.660
So they're of course of
limited value to the consumer.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:04.110
And therefore consumers at this point,
sometimes they don't even bother putting

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.390
them in because there's no point.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.910
You know,
it's either not going to work or

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:10.850
it's going to be the music video
that I've seen on MTV 5,000 times.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.300
So there's no point.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:20.790
How consumers should view ECDs is
obviously that they offer significant

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.600
additional value without added cost.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:26.430
If you go to Best Buy and you
buy an album for $9.99 and it

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.980
has an enhanced disc portion,
then there should be additional

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.810
value on that enhanced disc.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.380
Access to exclusive collectible
content such as AIM icons that are

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.200
specific for the Enhanced Disc,
desktop wallpaper,

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.920
the screensaver technology kind
of stuff that I showed you,

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.500
active desktops, desk sites,
all those sort of creative

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.080
elements are very,
very exciting to a consumer.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:55.620
And many record labels that have
taken the time to produce high quality

00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:00.220
Enhanced Discs have actually seen
very positive results from those added

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.150
value additions to the Enhanced Disc.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.650
The ability to communicate
with other fans,

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.390
that's what fans really want.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.920
They want to find
like-minded souls online.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:13.450
And the ability to communicate
via direct links to the artist

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:19.140
community or whatnot are incredibly
important for the consumer.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.530
And of course the ability to
stay up to date on how the,

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.740
you know,
what's new in the world of the artist,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.230
you know,
latest news and tours and ticket

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.600
sales and all that kind of cool stuff.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.920
So now what is the
future of Enhanced Discs?

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.760
Well, the future is interesting.

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.350
It really depends on how much
effort labels really want

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.960
to put into Enhanced Discs.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.290
If the current trend continues,
then Enhanced Discs are

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.620
going to fade away as a fad,
you know, part of the multimedia craze of

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.920
producing CD-ROMs and they're really,
quite honestly,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.210
probably going to go away.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.950
But, you know,
it's really a great opportunity,

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.550
as I said, for Enhanced Discs to be,
you know,

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.330
to be of tremendous value to the
artist and the label through,

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.540
you know,
all the things that I've discussed

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.370
and all the things that Jon discussed.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.480
Additionally, there are two new major
audio formats on the horizon.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.660
There's SACD and there's DVD audio.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:21.040
And those two formats are going to
obviously play in as well as far as

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.900
physical shipment of audio is concerned.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.040
So labels should really take the time
now to learn more about their consumers

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.590
and involve them in ways that they really
won't be able to when the digital music

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.220
revolution is really fully complete.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.100
We have things like Apple's
amazing new music store which

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.100
enable consumers to buy music.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.320
And there's no enhanced portion
to buying a protected file.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.160
There's no,
it's just the audio straight and

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.670
it's cheaper than buying a disc.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.520
So eventually you're going
to run out of time where,

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:55.780
you know, eventually, you know,
obviously, you know,

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:55.780
you're going to have to buy a disc.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.420
But consumers will only buy
music through digital channels.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.910
So the time is fast coming where enhanced
discs will probably be obsolete as

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.200
digital music continues to evolve.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.650
So therefore,
now is the time to really take

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.280
advantage of the medium as consumers
are still buying hundreds and hundreds

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.640
of millions of CDs worldwide to really
find out more about the consumer,

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.520
learn more about their buying habits,
and give them access to real

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.980
exclusive content that they
will not be able to access.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.790
When buying a 99 cent
downloadable audio track.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.290
Additionally,
through all the tracking capabilities

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.790
that Enhanced CDs can offer potentially,
you can really turn the media

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.360
promotion into a science.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.960
There's no reason not to do it.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.190
If you can track everything from the
website traffic to the player traffic

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.080
to the enhanced disc traffic and
compare it to SoundScan and compare

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.550
it to DBS and compare it to MediaBase
and do all the correlative cool

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.790
stuff that labels really should be
able to do and aren't really doing,

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.490
Enhanced CDs are a really core facet.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.680
They're a really cool,
really core variable as far as

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.590
the new media campaign as a whole.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.330
So, you know,
it's really a shame that labels

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.890
really aren't taking full
advantage of them currently.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.290
So now I would like to take
questions from the floor and I think

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.110
Glenn is going to say something.

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.900
Nice.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.360
Something nice?

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.010
Yeah.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.190
No, thanks.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.290
Naveen, that was awesome.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.570
Thank you.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:29.570
No problem.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.840
In working with Jon and Naveen
and the labels for quite a while,

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.660
the QuickTime team is really
familiar with Enhanced CDs.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.120
And at first pass,
some of the things up on the screen

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.870
there looked kind of depressing.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.960
But I really feel like this is a
huge opportunity for developers.

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:51.390
Developers on just the delivery
of media through the Enhanced CD,

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.820
and probably more importantly,
the tools for creation as well

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.830
as all the tools for tracking.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.140
There's a lot of incredible success.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.280
You know, you would know better about
the correlation between,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:07.860
let's see, the largest selling CD last
year was Lincoln Park Meteora.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:11.550
So the intelligence behind the
marketing plan and the delivery,

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:12.640
hybrid theory.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.160
Sorry, it should be Meteora.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.460
Hopefully.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.150
It will be.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:17.600
It will be.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.340
That's the new record.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:21.910
So if you'd like to ask any questions,
please use the microphones,

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:25.100
introduce yourself,
and thanks to our speakers again.
