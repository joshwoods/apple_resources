WEBVTT

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.300
Good morning.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.100
I'm glad to see people here this morning.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.100
I realize it's awfully early for folks,
9 o'clock in the morning.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.880
Particularly, I'm sure,
I know I saw a lot of people

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.440
online last night playing with
their iChat cameras and stuff,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.500
and all the new software.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.700
So I bet folks are rather tired.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.220
I appreciate you coming
here this morning.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.440
So what we're going to be talking about
today is-- if I can get this to work.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.840
Hello.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.530
Oh, how cool.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.950
Don't seem to have a remote.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.240
Okay.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.700
What we want to be talking about today is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.100
Thank you for joining us.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.110
I'm going to start off by kind of
changing the scope of what a lot of the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.070
other sessions are within the conference.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.190
Typically, you know,
you spend a lot of time digging down

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.300
into various aspects of the system,
but today we're actually going to

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.620
spend time focusing on the very,
very top stack of the architecture

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.160
diagram and applications.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.870
This is the first time, in fact,
that we've talked about applications

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.300
at the Developer Conference and how
developers can actually get involved

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.800
and participate in the process of
enhancing our application story.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:48.910
Apple has a number of pro
applications that we currently have,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.190
including Final Cut Pro,
which is our video editing suite,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.000
Shake 3, our compositing tool,
which is used for things like

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.520
Lord of the Rings and The Matrix,
eMagic for music creation,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.240
DVD Studio Pro for
DVD production and authoring,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.320
and Final Cut Express,
which is basically Final Cut video

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.120
editing for DV in the prosumer space.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.160
Within those set of applications,
there's actually a number

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.800
of opportunities available
to you as the developer.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.760
One area is in the scope of plug-ins,
the ability to create filters and effects

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.800
and other things for video and for audio.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.820
For each of these applications,
there's a number of

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.730
plug-in opportunities,
and we'll talk more about that

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.800
both a little bit later and
in some of the other sessions.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.340
In the hardware domain,
there's an opportunity for creating

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.890
both video and audio I/O devices,
being able for multi-channel audio,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.800
or for high definition or
standard definition video,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.560
or video cards for dealing with video
acceleration and being able to do

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.170
things like real-time effects and such.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.570
In the content area,
which is a new area for us,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.560
the ability to create audio
loop libraries for Soundtrack,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.100
which is our looping application,
and animated fonts and textures

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.410
and objects and other templates
for our animation tools,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.090
specifically LiveType,
which I'll be talking about in a moment.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.030
We want to spend a moment and talk
a little bit about Final Cut Pro 4.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.780
Final Cut Pro 4 is now, let's see,
a week and a couple of days old.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.300
It just shipped a little bit ago.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.300
And it's actually a
suite of applications.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.260
Final Cut Pro itself,
which is the video editing tool for

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.300
being able to deal with everything
from DV to standard definition,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.230
high definition film,
and a number of other applications

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.290
that are now bundled with the app.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.810
Soundtrack,
which is an audio looping tool,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.820
Live Type for text animation,
Cinema Tools for being

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.140
able to manipulate film,
and Compressor,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.770
which is a transcoding tool.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.440
To get into the application
in even more detail,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.600
I'd like to invite Brian Meaney,
the product designer for Final Cut Pro,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.070
and he'll show you a little
bit about each of the apps.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.200
I'll be back after he's done.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.310
Thanks, Brett.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:14:05.700
[Transcript missing]

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.940
So compositing, as I kind of mentioned,
compositing effects goes

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.820
hand-in-hand inside Final Cut.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.840
It's a lot of things that you
want to be able to do in here.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.180
And as I open up a sequence in here,
I simply have some shots

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.150
that I really want to do some
compositing over and so forth.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.880
So I'm going to just open up some clips,
and very quickly,

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.700
just by using what we call
the superimposed edit,

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.320
I'll edit this particular one over there.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.870
And right now,
it's just showing the full video here.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.170
So if I want to change that,
I don't have to go into some

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.600
special mode or things like that.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.750
I can actually just
select the item in here,

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.460
grab the item,
start shrinking it down and moving it.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.480
And to do the animation,
I can slide it wherever I want,

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.920
simply set up some keyframes.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.560
I'm doing it all right
here in the window,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.200
so I'm actually seeing what I'm doing.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.440
I can get in here with Bezier
controls and so forth as well,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.090
and instantly jump back and
play that back in real time.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.370
It's that real-time performance
that makes all the difference.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.570
So having as many effects as you can
do in real time is vitally important.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.120
So if I do or don't like that,
I can start changing the timing of that,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.720
move that around,
and have it move really slowly

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720
around that one keyframe.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.860
Then move fast over there.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.060
So I can really play with
all those different elements.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.520
Now we can get in here and start
adding all sorts of other elements.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.510
Like maybe I'll add in some text.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.560
I'll do the same sort of thing.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.700
I'll just do a superimposed
edit to add it in here.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.690
Actually, why don't I just swap it
up to the track up here.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.560
So now this text is great, but again,
it's this toolset that

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.440
makes Final Cut unique.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.070
So there's a lot of things that
we can do in here to make it easy.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.580
Maybe I want to have this text
follow along the same path

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.120
as the video I just created.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.920
Well, this is a computer,
so I can simply copy what we

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.210
call paste-adjust and paste the
attributes of that basic motion

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.720
to this item down in here.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.720
And now in real time,
it's all tied to my elements.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.670
Now as you can see,
I'm playing with these things

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.720
and creating these things
and doing it in real time.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.990
It's that real-time feedback that
allows me to be creative to play with

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.740
these different elements in time.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.990
And I can start getting into layering all
sorts of tracks and effects and things

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.740
like that and stacking these things up.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.910
But in the real world,
it's not necessarily about all the

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.740
layers that I'm actually doing.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.670
It's about what I can
actually do with my video.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.720
So in this case, I'm actually going to
drag a Gaussian Blur,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.720
a filter,
and I'm going to drag this into my item.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.720
So you can see it's blurry over
here and then keyframing back in.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.890
So I can do filters and effects,
not just the typical keys and

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:11.720
things like that in real time.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.740
Or maybe what I want to do is actually
get into something else altogether.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.270
And I want to know what my video
tracks item is because it's

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.740
source footage I'm going to buy.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.430
So I can actually come in here and say,
"All right, let's do a timecode print

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.720
filter." And so I can do that.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.100
And so every single frame now
is being updated as it's playing

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:27.740
along there in real time.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.720
So I can get all those
facts going on for me.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.720
So the real-time performance inside
Final Cut 4 is very robust right now,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.720
and it's really nice and
really great for our users.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.110
So beyond all that,
now these effects that I've

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.720
been creating over here,
like the Gaussian Blur,

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.660
these are all created in FXBuilder.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.740
FXBuilder is the language that we
use for creating all of our effects.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.740
Every single one that's created
inside Final Cut is actually open.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.870
You can open them up,
actually see the code that's

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.640
actually been used to create it,
and go in there,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.740
either modify it or create your own.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.610
Use it as a template.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.160
We have the new menu that kind of
shows up in here showing all the

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:00.740
different points and so forth.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.640
And we actually have some developers
that have created their own plug-ins

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.620
and things like that as well.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.720
So this adds the number
of effects that can go on.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.720
And it ties directly into our
real-time effects structure.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.870
So the items or the effects that
can be done in real time just

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.690
show up as real-time as well.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.720
So for our users, again, very,
very powerful solution.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.710
So they're getting that
interactivity all the time,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.690
which is really important.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.010
So, you know,
very key elements as to what's

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.670
kind of going on at that point.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.400
In addition to that,
in addition to our own

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.110
effects that we actually use,
we also work with third-party

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.670
After Effects filters.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.720
So here I have a filter from Stage Tools.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.720
These are the ones from
CineLook and things like that

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720
that you can actually use.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.720
And they show up directly in the
menu as the manufacturer's name,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.720
and you can actually apply
them and use them as well.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.560
So tying in directly to those.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.630
So, again, compositing effects all
inside one application.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.710
Beyond that,
there's a lot of other things

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.700
that have gone inside Final Cut 4.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.720
Customization is a very big one.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.720
One thing that we've added to
keep the layouts and keep yourself

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.720
working very efficiently is a
fully customizable keyboard.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.720
There are over 600
commands inside Final Cut,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:03.720
and a lot of them are
listed in Final Cut.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.720
So you can actually put it in here.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.720
That's why we have to have the whole
search mechanism in here as well,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.610
so you can actually find all the
different ones that are in there.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.720
But very quickly, you can find all the
different items that you want.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.720
Here's all the ones related
to audio and things like that.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.620
And search and create them or
customize them to any of the commands.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.710
And these are not just limited
to just the single keystrokes

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.720
or the command keystrokes.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.720
You can go down to Command Option,
Shift Option, or things like that,

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.590
and just do it as simply as dragging
and dropping to one of the layouts.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.710
And then you have
customized to that item.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.720
Tool tips update to show the new items.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720
And so forth.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:35.630
Very robust.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.720
And you can even go steps further
of actually adding in buttons.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.210
Dragging to the areas in here
and so forth as well will add

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.500
buttons to your user interface.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.720
So again, keeping the user actually very
productive in their entire workflow,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.580
which is a key to what we try and do.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.330
In addition to that,
audio is a very big thing as well.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.410
As I kind of get in here,
certainly I'm going to move to, again,

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.880
a slightly different layout.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.500
All of our layouts are based upon
workflows and things like that.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.240
We have an audio mixing layout.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.580
So in here, I can actually get in here,
do some more customization,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.880
resizing the timeline tracks,
bring those up a little bit,

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.880
and actually just start playing
these items in real time.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.070
And with keyframing turned on,
I can actually start doing keyframing

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.900
and moving my items in real time.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.640
Adding keyframes down here in the
timeline and so forth as well.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.220
So I can do my real-time
mixing inside of here,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.500
working with files of 24-bit.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.700
And in addition to that,
not only real-time mixing

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.920
for audios and levels,
we also work with third-party

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.320
audio unit filters.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.970
So we've rewritten our Apple filters
that we actually had in there for

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.470
Final Cut Pro for audio units,
as well as we can now actually

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.600
work with third-party ones as well.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.040
Sorry there.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.000
So all of our units will now
kind of show up in there.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.800
And in addition to all these
things that are going on,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.960
we've also included another application
that we mentioned before as well,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.340
which is Soundtrack.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.970
I'm just gonna quickly move
over to Soundtrack here.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.160
Soundtrack is our audio looping and
music creation editing application,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.890
which is very powerful.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.510
Right in here, I have a file that's been
exported from Final Cut Pro with

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.940
having markers that show up.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.240
These are called scoring markers
that allow me to line up things very

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.270
quickly between the two applications.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.200
So very quickly,
if I'm looking for items,

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.410
I can just start clicking on items,
even while I'm playing my video,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.060
start getting idea of what it's
actually going to sound like.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.420
That's a little low at the moment.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.290
But you can find all the different items,
search for the different

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.260
ones that I want,
find the loops,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.500
and then just drag them off.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.230
It'll create a track
for me automatically.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.410
I can loop those things out
and just keep kind of going.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.340
There's a very extensive
search mechanism.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.740
I can do the same sort of thing that
I can do in all the applications.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.210
Start searching maybe for a strum guitar,
find the items I want,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.830
and again just drag these in.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.250
And these are all loops that are created.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.100
They're shipped with over 4,000 loops.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.460
But again, there are more items that
can be added to these.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.460
It's a very extensive database
of finding these different items.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.860
So you can see how powerful it really is.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.650
You can get into lots of different items,
lots of different music,

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.850
and add these items in.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.190
You also can work with,
in addition to all these different loops,

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.570
work with audio units
inside this application as

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.020
well for doing your mixing.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.100
So for example,
I can bring up my filters.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.140
These are the ones that are
shipping directly with Apple.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.780
But also here are some from
eMagic that have actually shipped.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.830
And I can actually get in here
and maybe add something like,

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.710
let's see.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.680
Let's do the Fat EQ here.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.680
And I can actually also bring
up the UI for this item as well.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.240
And actually start playing and
animating and automating this from

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.300
the UI from the manufacturer as well.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.220
All this while doing my music editing.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.270
So again, a very powerful little
application for creating my

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.020
music for my video productions.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.480
I'm gonna move back over to
Final Cut Pro quickly as well.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.960
And just one of the last things
in addition to that is all these

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.160
items that we bring up is also
exporting out over to Compressor.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.020
Compressor is basically an application
that does all of my compression.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.820
It does MPEG-2 compression.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.120
Most importantly,
it does 2-pass VBR for going out to DVD,

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.020
combining that with certainly
the music that I'm actually

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.960
doing inside Soundtrack,
bringing all my productions together,

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.850
and then going over to
DVD Studio Pro as well.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.800
So a lot of ties and
files in there as well.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.110
There's a lot of different presets for
going out to pretty much any format that

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.460
you can kind of create inside QuickTime.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.800
So a very robust set of features
inside this application.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.300
And this is just kind of the
beginning of the tool set.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.890
There's Cinema Tools as well,
which allows me to do 24p

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.640
editing as well as film editing.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.790
So I can do the offline or online
editing and so forth as well.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.380
HD editing,
and there's even further interaction

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.310
that some of my colleagues
will get into in just a minute.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.950
But that is the basics
of Final Cut Pro 4.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.760
Some of the few ties-ins and
so forth in there as well.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.900
A lot of the different
ways you can actually start

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.920
getting into the application,
but it's a very open one.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.590
And again, the biggest thing about this
application that makes it unique

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.800
and powerful is the set of tools.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.770
The set of tools are
based upon open standards,

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.460
be it QuickTime or other ones
that we're kind of working on,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.360
keeping it open to bring people in and
create other things out there in the

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.640
community of making a much bigger one
than anyone could do by themselves.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.140
And that's something we
believe very strongly in.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.570
So, with that,
I'm going to turn it back over to Brett,

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.590
kind of move on from there.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.820
Thanks, Brian.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:15.640
Final Cut and the suite of applications
is an incredibly rich suite.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.900
There's no way we can cover the feature
set here in the time we have available.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.830
So we apologize for rushing through.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.720
But the goal here is actually
just to give you enough of an

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.710
overview to help us actually focus
on the really important message,

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.200
which is,
what are the developer opportunities?

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.270
Within Final Cut and within
a number of the professional

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:42.670
applications such as eMagic's Logic,
all of them have various

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.420
plug-in models available to you.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.380
Whether it be for audio units,
as you saw with Soundtrack

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.310
and with Final Cut Pro,
but also within Logic,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.000
all of these applications
support audio units.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.360
And they allow you to have various
audio effects and even be able to

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:09.560
do a number of things to either
improve the quality of your sound

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.030
or actually generate new sound.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.860
So audio units are one very important
feature of these various applications.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.060
And if you happen to be
an audio unit developer,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:25.130
there's an opportunity for you to make
your audio units available to these apps.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.900
FX Script is another
interesting opportunity.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.520
This is a scripting language
within Final Cut for doing special

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.370
effects or effects actions.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.830
In fact,
all of the effects that Final Cut uses

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.410
are built within FX Script.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.520
There are a couple of third-party
developers today who actually make

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.600
FX Script plug-in suites for Final Cut.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.940
It's an interesting opportunity
both for Final Cut Express and for

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.890
Final Cut Pro if you happen to be
a developer with skills in doing

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.480
video manipulation of various types.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.630
An FX Script is one that you can
actually get and start playing

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.600
with even as a user for being able
to do custom effects development.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.600
This still doesn't work.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.580
Okay.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:16.330
After Effects plugins are also
supported within Final Cut.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.900
So there's basically a certain,
fairly minimal level,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.600
but nevertheless a level of
support for After Effects,

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.860
the plug-in model that's
supported within Final Cut Pro.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:35.100
So if you have development you've done
using the After Effects plugins API set,

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.900
they can be brought into
Final Cut to be able to,

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:43.830
again, take advantage of both
generators and effects,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.990
for example, blurs, as you saw,
and a number of other

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.610
things that are available.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.810
So if you're an effects developer and
have experience with After Effects,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.500
this is another place that you
can be bringing in your plug-ins.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.630
And in addition to all of the
stuff that we've talked about,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.910
a whole other area of
opportunity is for Shake.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.740
Shake is Apple's compositing,
very high-end compositing tool,

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:14.260
and they have their own plug-in model
which is available for being able to do

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.900
very sophisticated compositing effects.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.880
And we'll talk more about the
Shake plug-ins later in this week.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:29:07.800
[Transcript missing]

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.130
But all of these are available as
an opportunity for those of you who

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.740
are up and to be content developers.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.590
In the hardware space for
the various applications,

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.500
there's certainly in the PCI card
development area opportunity for

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:28.550
video acquisition hardware for
standard and high-definition video.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:33.700
One of the big challenges is how do
you get all this data into the machine?

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:38.320
And certainly for things like high def,
you need to be able to take

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.900
advantage of PCI and now PCI-X.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:47.900
And if you are a hardware developer,
there's a great opportunity there.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:54.890
Also for Final Cut and for the eMagic,
the Logic product,

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.860
there's a number of opportunities
for multi-channel audio

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.400
acquisition capture boards as well.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.610
In addition to for the PCI card
and the video space accelerated

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.400
hardware real-time effects boards.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.890
So basically there's the concept of I/O,
bringing your data in and out.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.900
Both for audio and video and being able
to do very high-speed effects work.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.530
We do for Final Cut and
the other products,

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:27.170
a lot of things are done in software,
particularly now with the new G5.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.870
There's just an enormous
amount of power that's there,

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.870
but there's still not enough
horsepower to be able to do things

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.900
like high-definition video effects
or things like that in real time.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.910
There's a lot of opportunity to be able
to do some very interesting things.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:46.540
In the FireWire domain, as mentioned,
there's a couple of interesting

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:51.140
products that are coming out,
both audio acquisition units that

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.560
go over FireWire for multi-channel
audio input and output,

00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:01.360
as well as our new I/O framework that
we've made available so that developers

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.780
can actually do that now in addition
to audio for being able to do that with

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.700
standard definition uncompressed video.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.330
A.G.A.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.700
is actually one of the
first developers to do that,

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.810
but we're anticipating quite a number
of other developers jumping in to

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.970
being able to do other FireWire-based
uncompressed SD solutions.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.110
In the USB domain,
there are opportunities for

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.430
multi-channel audio acquisition.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.200
Certainly, we're seeing more and more
multi-channel audio capabilities

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.140
throughout the applications.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.130
I think you saw yesterday the keynote,
one of the sessions they

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:40.620
talked about QuickTimes and
new capabilities for Surround.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.550
There's a lot of activity out there
in terms of extending the support

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:50.990
for multi-channel audio and a lot of
places to provide hardware for it.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.960
For all of these opportunities,
there's a number of sessions this week

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.700
that I've encouraged you to go see.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.500
If you're into content creation,
this afternoon there's a

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.060
Creating Content for Soundtrack
and Live Type session where we'll

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.690
actually get into detail around
how to make the Apple loops,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.640
how to take various motion video
content or animations and make

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.300
them available for live type,
and the tools and other formats

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.500
that are available there.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.440
On Thursday,
there's a session on interfacing

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.290
professional video hardware with
Final Cut Pro where we'll get into

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:33.280
the various issues around both
acquisition and the real-time effects,

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.320
as well as the new I/O Framework
and how you can take advantage of

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.160
some of the new capabilities there.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.030
And on Friday,
we have a session on plug-ins

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.500
that will cover everything from
Shake plug-ins and Audio Unit plug-ins

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.270
and After Effects plug-in capabilities.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.060
And on Friday,
we have a session on plug-ins that will

00:32:53.230 --> 00:33:02.160
cover everything from Shake plug-ins
and After Effects plug-in capabilities.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:07.310
Now, moving on,
the next interesting opportunity in the

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.700
developer domain is in the workflow area.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.530
Although we have a very
rich set of professional

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.980
applications available from Apple,
it's really just a small drop in the

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:25.690
bucket compared to the problem domain in
the professional video and audio world.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.360
There are just so many other things
that people have to do to be able

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.050
to produce a movie or produce a CD,
whether it be script writing and

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:39.490
storyboards to dealing with very
high-end color correction and going

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:44.700
back and forth between film and scoring.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.380
You name it,
there are just a whole number of

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.670
different pieces to the process.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:55.630
The interesting situation is that
the real world isn't the same.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.630
It doesn't revolve around
any one application.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.890
It involves many to be
able to solve the problem.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:06.350
We've spent a lot of time thinking
about that from the perspective

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:10.000
of our pro applications.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I think we have some interesting
things we'll be talking about here

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
in terms of how you can actually
participate in this process.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.520
One of the big problems with workflow
is certainly how do you get information

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.000
back from one application to another?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
How do you get access to the raw
data that's in the application,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
whether it be in the case of Final Cut,
the project,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
all the various things are laid
out in the timelines and such,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.990
to the metadata
surrounding each of those.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
What effects and other things that are
actually applied in transitions and such.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.890
This is just for video,
never mind other aspects of the workflow.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:55.220
Independent of that level of data,
there's the issues of actually

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.360
the various formats that the media
end up bringing into the pie.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.640
Certainly, QuickTime on the
Apple platform makes a big,

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.850
big difference here because we have
one consistent way of being able to

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:11.110
deal with multiple forms of media
through a consistent set of APIs,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.150
and that helps a lot.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.900
But it still is a big challenge in
terms of being able to deal with the

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.660
different formats of media there and
the different formats of project files.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.330
But that's, again,
only kind of one piece of the problem.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.400
Moving data between the
various things is one thing,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.390
but along the way,
you really need to be able to

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.970
modify it and be able to do things,
you know, interesting things with the

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.790
data as it goes from the
different stages of the workflow.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.510
It's more than just reading the files.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.210
So with that, I actually want to pass off
to Bill Hudson from Apple,

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.140
who will talk a little bit more about
what we're doing in this and actually

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.320
talk about some work we've been
doing with some of the other teams.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.610
Bill, what are you doing with
some third parties to help,

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.260
you know, really show the opportunities
in the workflow space?

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.020
Bill.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.900
Thank you, Brett.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.880
Brett mentioned workflow,
and that's a little bit about what

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.160
we're going to talk about here.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.450
And that very much is an
offline to online workflow where

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.930
Final Cut Pro is used for offline
editing and moving project file

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:20.000
data over to a Quantel system,
either an EQ or IQ.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
In Final Cut Pro 4,
we've got XML interchange format,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.500
and this is the industry's
first nonlinear editor to expose

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.450
all project file data via XML.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.440
So for developers,
there's a lot of opportunity

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:44.000
there to create products that
address various workflow issues.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:49.000
Nothing is hidden or proprietary in
this project file data interchange.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.900
You have complete access to all
Final Cut Pro project attributes,

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.960
and it provides a link
to other editing systems,

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.500
asset management databases,
and post-production pipelines.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.950
So we'll touch on one of
those here in just a minute.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:13.000
The first implementation, of course,
is an AAF plug-in by Automatic Duck.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.940
And for those who do not know,
AAF is the Advanced Authoring Format.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:24.060
There are many manufacturers who
are members of the AAF association,

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:30.340
and they are all striving to arrive
at a standard by which information can

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:38.300
be transferred among various disparate
systems in a post-production workflow.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.300
So let's talk first here about what
this process is and what we'll be

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.680
demonstrating here in just a moment.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.800
First, you're gonna have your
offline acquisition.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.960
So let's say you shoot film,
35 millimeter or 16 millimeter,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.640
and you telecine to HD at 24p.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:04.360
Or you maybe shoot HD originally in 1080,
one of these different frame rates.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.730
At that point then,
you're going to capture into a

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:13.210
Final Cut Pro desktop system using
either a Pinnacle CineWave card,

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.130
the Pinnacle CineWave 4,
which they will have

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:21.330
drivers available very soon,
or the AJA Kona HD card.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.880
So these two cards,
their drivers allow for

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.540
different capabilities.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.710
Right now,
the Pinnacle CineWave will allow you

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.950
to capture when they ship this product,
CineWave 4.

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:40.600
Either in Photo JPEG, DV at 25 megabit,
or DVC Pro 50 codecs.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.230
The AJA Kona card HD can
now capture to Photo JPEG.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.420
So this gives you the ability
to have files that are very,

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.690
very small.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:55.920
So basically,
24p HD is about 96 megabytes per second.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.360
So when you capture
these offline formats,

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.460
you're much, much smaller.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.760
You can work mobily on a PowerBook.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.570
So here's your acquisition
into Final Cut Pro.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:13.360
So at that point, you're going to then,
you can edit with real-time effects,

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.950
high quality, again, low data rate,
DV at 24p is about 2.9

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.210
megabytes per second.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.830
And all your frame and time
code information is completely

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.820
accurate in your project file.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:36.860
You can monitor your video out NTSC with
real-time 3.2 insertion over FireWire.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.550
Brett mentioned the AJA I/O box.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.500
All of the ports are
active on that I/O box.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.240
So you can monitor, like I said,
your video, and you can get

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.300
multi-channels of audio out,
which is really a nice thing

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.300
to be able to do while you're
in an editing environment.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.890
You can then export using the
Automatic Duck AAF plug-in and then

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:06.660
transfer that file over a network
directly to a Quantel IQ or EQ.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:13.620
And it's at this point that I'd like
to introduce Tom McDonald from Quantel.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.610
Tom?

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:17.650
Thanks, Bill.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.170
I think my friends at Apple are
being a little bit humble about

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.480
XML technology because it's a
huge step forward and it's a huge

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.710
commitment to not only the professional
video industry and film industry,

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.520
but to developers as well.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:37.580
This is the first time, essentially,
the whole kimono has been opened

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:42.200
up for such a popular application,
and the potential to impact

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:46.580
workflow is huge in Hollywood,
but it is potential at this time.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.940
And what we need to do to
make it successful lies in

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.500
the hands of the developers.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:54.970
So I hope everybody actually has an
opportunity here to get their heads

00:40:54.970 --> 00:41:00.200
around what this means and go forward
and make some great complementary apps

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.550
that can move this whole effort forward.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:10.590
I'm going to talk about quickly
what XML Exchange does for Quantel.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:14.100
Quantel is the makers of very,
very high-end digital film

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.200
editing and graphics systems.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.250
Essentially,
there is a group in Hollywood and

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:21.200
some folks in London,
different production areas, film areas,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.200
that are never happy with
the performance of systems.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.200
You can never have a fast enough system.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.610
Our job, essentially,
is to stay ahead of Moore's

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.200
Law as much as we can,
and we've done this for about 25 years.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:37.870
What's pushing this movement forward
now for us and is very good for us

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:42.370
is the fact that in the film area,
in the film arena,

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:47.590
The technology has now reached a point
where you can scan film rather than

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.500
going back and having to cut film.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.590
And once, as we know,
once media is in a digital environment,

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.500
it's much easier and
interactive to manipulate.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.500
And these files then get
scanned to 2K file sizes,

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.500
and that's about 12 megabytes a frame.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.490
And that's a sustained data rate of just
video of about 300 megabytes a second.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.490
So our systems have special servers,
special structures,

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:14.640
and color correction tools to digitally
assemble these huge files from a

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.490
longer three or four month edit
session and put them out to film.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.320
That's what we're good at.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.500
What we're not good at,
what we don't produce,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:31.070
are very powerful sub-$1,000 long
form editing systems with the tools

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.500
that professional editors need to
be in a three month edit and edit.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.400
And edit at 24 frames
and get a project done.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.500
That's what Apple does well.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.370
So what the XML technology does,
it allows us to bring together the

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:47.500
best of both worlds to create a really,
what is a unique workflow for Hollywood.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.080
And it's something that Hollywood,
not just Hollywood,

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.380
but editing professionals around the
world have demanded for a long time,

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.500
which is flexibility.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.500
I'm here to tell you that there
is a demand for this product,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.420
and there is a demand for
this kind of interoperability.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.500
And we're going to go through this,
see this actually move forward.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.220
What's happening is that the
XML is in turn being turned into an

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:13.490
industry standard format called AAF,
advanced authoring format,

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.470
courtesy of our friends
at Automatic Duck,

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.580
Wes back there,
and Harry from Automatic Duck,

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.080
who are with this plug-in,
are spinning the XML into a

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:26.260
format that we at Quantel can read
and then digitally assemble the

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.180
offline data to the online data.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.270
Editors are really,
really jazzed about this,

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.450
extremely jazzed about this.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.300
I spent last week in LA talking
to a number of editors,

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.300
and when I explained the
workflow and the flexibility,

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.290
they're coming up with
all kinds of ideas,

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.500
and they're asking if certain
developers are getting a hold of this.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.640
We're at a position now where
we're actually one of the first,

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.800
which I don't like.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.280
I'd like to see that there's going
to be a lot of partners around.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:52.100
So again,
please explore this a little bit.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.650
What we're going to do today is
I'm going to bring up Milton,

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.400
one of our product
specialists from Quantel,

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.100
and we're going to go through the
workflow for digital intermediate

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.940
workflow on a Quantel system.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.330
I'll go through this quickly.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.170
These are some of the advantages
of doing it on a Quantel system.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.510
Essentially,
it provides a more interactive,

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:15.130
more real-time environment
for digital assembly of film.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:18.550
It allows the producers, the directors,
the directors of photography,

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.000
the editors to all sit down
and watch a film come together,

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.100
as it will be seen in the film.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.130
theater and there's no substitution
for that it removes errors and with

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:30.280
the budgets of Hollywood films nowadays
this is a good thing so Milton once you

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.630
come up or wait we're gonna start with
Bill and then we'll go to Milton that's

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:38.360
right Bill's actually gonna take and
take a sequence that we captured from a

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.930
high-resolution environment I think in
this case it was HD but it could easily

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:47.200
be 2k and he's gonna do what editors do
they use you know Final Cut on trains

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.760
on planes when they have some spare
time in between other jobs and use the

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.640
portability of Final Cut Pro do this
long edit and then send us the data

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.530
now what we have here from the Quantel
is a substitute our 2k editing systems

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.500
are about this high in this wide and
it didn't make a lot of sense to bring

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.860
in a whole 2k editing system so we
brought our smaller version of this and

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.120
this will actually edit at 16 by 9 in
a smaller resolution but the workflow

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:16.500
is the same our UI is the same our
architecture is all the same that's one

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.420
of the unique benefits of the Quantel.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:17.420
Thank you.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.240
system is all the same code base
across the entire product range and

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.410
then we'll actually do somewhat of
a mirror version of what we were

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.600
doing the high-end 2k system so
Bill why don't you go ahead and do the

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.470
export now we'll have Milton come up

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.650
Okay, so this is a sequence.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.480
We'll play through this for a second.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:43.200
Question I got,
what's your favorite documentary film?

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.850
My favorite documentary?

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.600
- It's gotta be the last walk.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.480
I love Neil Young, so when he sings
"Helpless" with the band,

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.680
and when Joni Mitchell kicks
in from behind the curtain.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.280
♪ I can feel ♪

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.040
I think you get the idea.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:06.850
This is for Silver Docs,
which is a film festival by AFI,

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.800
and it's presented on Discovery Channel.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.410
So this project was shot at 24p in HD.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:23.800
It was captured with the Kona HD card and
then captured to an offline resolution.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.340
This was actually transcoded to
DV in this particular instance.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:35.680
And all I need to do here is go ahead
and do a file export of this sequence.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.500
And I'm gonna go down
to my automatic duck,

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.360
AAF export.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.860
And you can see I've got this file here,
Silver Docs.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:49.330
And I'm going to go
ahead and export that.

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:53.380
And it's exporting it
out over the network.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.700
It's done real quick,
and Milton is getting wired,

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.340
so he'll be here in just a second.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:03.740
So he will be able to,
we've got a hub here.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:09.820
We sent it out over Ethernet,
targeted one of his disks,

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.730
and he's gonna go ahead and
bring that up right away.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.240
Okay, good morning ladies and gents.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:22.560
I'm going to take the file that Phil has
created by going to my input/output menu,

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.680
straight to my conform,
and drag the file across.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.680
For the purposes of this demo,
I've already pre-loaded the material.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.330
However, I'm going to use Build's AAF,
essentially, to create my conform.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.780
So all I'm going to do now
is give my edit a name.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.560
I'm going to call it My Edit.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:45.560
Hit conform, and then go to my Clips bin,
and there it is.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:50.290
That's the edit,
exactly the same as Bill created it.

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.500
I can scroll across that.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:58.540
And then what I can do is I can go into
my QFX and do things like color correct.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.470
So in this case,
I can use the advanced tools

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.900
of my color correction.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.170
So if I just ramp up
the contrast on that.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.930
Possibly bring down the brightness.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:12.070
As you can see,
it's happening in real time.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.800
Ramp up my saturation there.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.960
To before and after, and you can see the
difference straight away.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.800
Go to my settings,
I can save my settings,

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.220
or I can drag other
settings that I've created.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.070
So, might have that particular look,
that look, or that look.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.970
Go further down in the timeline.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.240
Again, very easy.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.000
Drag and drop straight away.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:37.640
Or I could do things like go
in and create all my blurs.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:42.630
All of these are harder
accelerated to my DVEs.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.460
I can move things about very fast.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.560
Keyframe everything so
I can go further down,

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.440
move the position,
and you can see all my graphs are there,

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.000
available.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.430
Everything's happening in real time,
very, very fast.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:59.230
So you can see from this simple
example how we can offline on a

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:04.260
system such as a Final Cut Pro system
and then bring it onto a Quantel.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.890
In this case, it's a QEdit Pro.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.400
It could be an EQ, an IQ,
an EQ which is standard def and HD,

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:16.630
or an IQ which is HD and 2K and can
also load in background 4K plates.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.600
Currently, you can bring in information
such as the clip name,

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.770
your dissolves, your cuts in your video,
your audio, but then as more and more

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:27.380
channels become available in AAF,
you'll be able to bring in information

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.080
such as your color corrections,
your DVEs, and your blurs,

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.480
and all hardware accelerated,
all using proprietary hardware

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.200
where you're sitting with your
director and your producer,

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:40.000
and they want things to
happen very fast in real time,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.910
and that's what you do.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.400
[Transcript missing]

00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:01.440
So, one of the keys that we wanted to
go over in showing some of this

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:05.040
workflow is there's actually a lot of
different pieces that are involved.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.830
You heard audio,
you heard about cards for

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:11.490
different forms of acquisition,
you saw various effects,

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:20.260
you saw the XML pieces and the automatic
duck export to AAF and moving over to a

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.370
totally different system than the Mac.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.800
The key here is there's a lot of
pieces involved in producing films

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.590
and producing professional content.

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:35.590
And there's a lot of different players
along each step of the process,

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:42.640
whether it be the card vendors for being
able to provide the acquisition hardware,

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.400
or whether it be the effects creators,
or whether the content itself.

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:53.310
And there's a lot of opportunities
here for people to participate.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:53:19.100
[Transcript missing]

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:42.260
The other thing we're doing in
addition to providing access to

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:46.440
the full information is also making
sure that there's plug-in extensions

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.100
to Final Cut Pro in particular,
but other applications

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.030
as we move forward.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:55.510
So that you have access to that
XML data through a way that's

00:53:55.510 --> 00:54:00.670
actually integrated into the
workflow of the application itself.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.630
We talked a little bit about AEF.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:08.500
Again, AEF is industry format,
if you will.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:13.000
We call it the Advanced Authoring Format,
which is a consortium or a collection

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.440
of companies that have come together
to try and find a common model for

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.490
being able to exchange information.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:23.140
AEF looks to be very promising
as a way to be able to move data

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.500
around from system to system.

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:28.950
But the challenge with any open format,
such as,

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:33.500
or any design by committee format,
is that it takes a long time to evolve.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.960
And while this, we think,
is certainly the most promising

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:38.390
of the various formats out there,
it still,

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:43.480
much like the other legacy formats,
still is very closed in many ways.

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:46.620
Information that's
exported out of one system,

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:53.500
like an Avid, for example,
or another AEF-producing application,

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.500
may actually contain
a lot of information.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.560
It's a lot of what they call "black
metadata." It's basically metadata

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.500
that's passed around and only
visible to that given manufacturer.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.490
And that's one of the things that we're
trying very desperately to try and avoid

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:10.340
by making things available through XML,
is to actually make sure

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.490
that everything is visible.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:17.500
And with XML being somewhat
of a self-describing format,

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.500
it's actually very easy for
developers to be able to manipulate.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.480
There's a lot of tools, certainly,
in Mac OS X for being able to do that.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.500
Automatic Duck.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.490
We've worked very closely with them
over the past few months to actually

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:34.500
build on top of this XML export model,
this AEF plug-in,

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.500
so that there is an industry
standard interchange opportunity.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.500
And we thank them for the
great work that they've done.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.680
I want to point people off again
to some of the various sessions.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:52.560
There's the content creation session that
I already mentioned later this afternoon.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.690
There's also a session
tomorrow on data interchange.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:56:01.400
We're going to focus on the whole
process of both XML and AF and actually

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.960
what some of the details are behind
the interchange formats and how you

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:08.620
actually can get more involved in
this workflow for going between the

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.700
various professional media applications.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.630
So hopefully we can see a bunch of
you guys there tomorrow morning.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.320
And again,
we have a session on Thursday for

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.700
going over some of the video
hardware opportunities,

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:23.700
other acquisition cards
and acceleration cards,

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:28.700
vendors that might be interested in
being able to support Final Cut Pro 4.

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.700
And on Friday, a session on plug-ins.

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.070
Again,
if you're a plug-in developer interested

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.700
in taking your After Effects plug-in
and making it available to Final Cut,

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:38.700
or you're interested in learning
a little bit more about Shake,

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:44.650
or some of the other plug-in formats,
audio units and things like that,

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.700
please join us on Friday afternoon.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:52.070
With that,
we're going to close this session

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.900
and hopefully we'll see you then.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.410
If you have any questions,
anything like that, make sure you contact

00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:01.070
your industry evangelist,
Jeff Lowe, who represents professional

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:01.780
