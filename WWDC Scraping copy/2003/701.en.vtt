00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.800
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Vice President,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.980
Interactive Media Group, Tim Schaaff.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.950
Hello.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.600
Good morning.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.290
Welcome.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.720
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.200
Today's session

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.900
is a little different from previous
developer conference sessions in that

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.550
we've combined the developer conference,
as always, with

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.890
With QuickTime Live,
this year we've got a large group of

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.880
developers here to learn about the new
APIs and software technologies that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.700
we're introducing in QuickTime we've
been working on over the past year.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.400
And we've also got a whole bunch
of sessions oriented at the content

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.540
creators and content publishers who
typically are the primary attendees

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.530
at QuickTime Live Conference.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.970
So it's kind of an interesting mix.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.940
We've got over 32 sessions.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.240
We've got some hands-on labs
that you can go and attend.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.040
They're running all week long,
and I strongly encourage you to go there.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.210
If you're writing applications and
you've run into bugs or you've run into

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.320
problems and you need some help from
engineers who know what's going on,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.230
there's all week long hands-on labs.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.530
You can take your code and
they'll sit down with you and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.800
help you work through that.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.740
And then there's also hands-on labs
for the content publishers as well.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.760
And you can go there and get advice from
people who know how to use QuickTime.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.820
And they'll help you out with that.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.850
So it should be great.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.260
I want to start today with an
update about where things stand

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.500
with QuickTime in the marketplace.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.880
And to help me do that,
I want to bring Frank Casanova,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.850
Director of Product Marketing,
up to tell us what's going on.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.540
Thanks, Steve.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.800
Hi guys.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.370
So in typical fashion,
marketing and engineering

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.130
count differently.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.620
There's over 45 sessions about QuickTime.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.990
It's all how you count.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.320
Anyway,
we're thrilled with the combination

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.250
of these two conferences.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.890
We had three QuickTime Live that
were standalone conferences,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.260
but to leverage the scale of WWDC,
to be able to take advantage

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.740
of the infrastructure,
all the people to do all the work,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.840
has been absolutely incredible.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.720
So we're thrilled with this,
and we know that it makes our

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.180
QuickTime activities even bigger.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.350
And what I wanted to talk about
today addresses kind of the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.020
diverse nature of this crowd.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.810
We in this crowd are now more
diverse in our backgrounds and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.240
our activities and the centers of
our attention than ever before,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.750
even more so than last year,
because we've done a whole

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.380
bunch of new things with
QuickTime just in the last year.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.950
So we have a bunch of folks in
this crowd that are old-timers,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.780
been around QuickTime longer
than most of us.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.820
There's a whole bunch of people that
are here for the very first time,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.810
working on the new formats
and the new codecs.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.170
There's a bunch of folks that
deliver QuickTime-encoded content

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.900
in a standards fashion out into
different delivery mediums that

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.540
aren't even available to most of us.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.410
We'll talk about all of that.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.110
But to weigh to ensure that we're all
kind of on the same playing field,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.370
let's just zoom back just a
little bit and talk about what

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.970
it was that Apple tried to do.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.890
What is it that we accomplished
with QuickTime back in the day?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.000
What was it that we set out
to do in the very beginning?

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.960
Fundamentally,
we wanted to try to be the first

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.100
personal computer manufacturer
to put together audio and video,

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.720
have them play synchronized
on a personal computer.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.550
And we did that back as we were
doing research in the late 80s,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.300
and we brought that out in the early,
like 1991.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.740
You guys remember some
of the codecs in here?

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.540
Just an eye chart.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.910
You can't read this, but I can.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.220
Road Pizza, some of the old codecs.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.220
And year after year,
we steadily released new,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.550
big releases of QuickTime,
accelerating in the recent years to

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.380
doing basically a major release a
year with a bunch of minor releases,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.740
but all with our eye toward a
couple of really important things.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.440
Quickly and aggressively
evolving the platform,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.310
maintaining backward compatibility
because we didn't want to lock

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.630
people out of the content that
they'd created in QuickTime,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.240
ever.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.900
We still haven't done that.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.580
With QuickTime,
one content still plays in QuickTime 6.3,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.250
and we've held on to that as one of
the core components of what we do,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.060
and we'll do that for
the foreseeable future.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:06:45.400
[Transcript missing]

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.600
And that's all great.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.040
We've got this great architecture
that's evolved over the years.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.020
We've been diligent in evolving
it as quickly as possible.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.970
We use it across all of the
various parts of what Apple does,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.380
but what good would that do if
it was just a little boutique

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.940
format that didn't have any reach?

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.020
Well, reach is not a problem
for us in QuickTime.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.420
As of this morning, QuickTime 6,
and I should probably make that last

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.350
few digits just kind of like roll over.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.880
As of this morning,
we've had over 115 million downloads

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.220
just from our website of QuickTime 6.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.710
And basically, every second of every day,
four people download QuickTime.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.650
We've got incredible distribution
of this architecture,

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.260
and the infrastructure to
deliver this across all the

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.340
different languages we support,
and across all the different

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.300
ways that it can be distributed.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.290
From our website.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.750
And this alone puts us very much,
you know, at the top of the heap with

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.160
respect to distribution.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.760
But this is just one way in which
QuickTime is actually distributed.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.850
It's referred to on upwards of about
20,000 websites every day refer

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.230
people to our site to get QuickTime.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:52.030
All these sites and just tens of
thousands more have QuickTime content.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.260
We look at the logs every once in a while
to see who's aiming their customers,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.920
who's aiming their visitors at us.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.020
So that's all part of
our web distribution.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.140
But tools.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.350
There's hundreds of tools that exist that
use QuickTime and distribute QuickTime.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.160
In addition, titles.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.320
Every day,
about a dozen different titles ship

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.770
that use QuickTime at their core.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.970
Every single day.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.390
And some of these go on to
sell millions of copies each,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.340
and every one of them installs QuickTime.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.560
And this is a very,
very interesting and very large business

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.400
that's run out of my group as well.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.130
So we get to watch that,
how it's growing and what the

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.880
requests are for licensing.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.500
Enhanced music CDs.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.280
A lot of you guys have seen this.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.010
A lot of you guys out here
likely have these discs,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.160
and you may not even know it.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.260
There's no kind of like unified
branding scheme about enhanced discs,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.420
but these are basically music CDs.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.730
You put them in a dashboard of your car,
they play just fine.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.320
When you put them in a computer,
you get a full multimedia experience.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.060
And that is traditionally and almost
exclusively delivered with QuickTime.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.940
And why do the music guys
use QuickTime exclusively?

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.800
Because we're cross-platform.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.280
We talked about distribution earlier.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.310
Ninety-five percent of
all of our distribution.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.170
Is on the PC.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.920
But we've made sure that our
PC player looks and acts and

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.610
feels just like the Mac player.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.470
We don't dumb down the codex.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:12.570
We don't make the experience like a lot
less interesting than on the Macintosh.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.120
And these music guys and the
other folks that are authoring

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.930
the content really respect that
and use QuickTime as a result.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.750
And some of these discs, as you know,
there's hundreds of them in

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.000
distribution at any time.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.520
Thousands of them have been done
since these things have started,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.280
and some of them are done by
some incredibly large stars

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.220
that sell millions of copies.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.670
copies.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.790
And of course, digital cameras.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.300
This is pretty interesting.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.780
We started this just
about a year and a half,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.560
maybe two years ago.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.330
And now there's over 200 different
digital cameras from over 45

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.510
manufacturers around the world
who distribute QuickTime with

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.990
their digital cameras.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.720
You know,
this was the first year when more

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.810
digital cameras sold than film cameras,
and that'll never change.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.280
That will always stay that
way for the rest of time.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.340
You know, digital cameras have taken off,
and we're the only ones who

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.520
are distributed this way.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.270
And what's even more interesting
is half of these cameras,

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.530
100 of these cameras,
actually have a file format license.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.520
We license them to QuickTime file format.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.300
And in that file format,
they can capture, these still cameras

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.840
capture short video clips,
and they record them right in the

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.230
QuickTime file format on the cameras.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.340
When you plug it into your
Mac or you plug it into your PC,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.630
you've got a QuickTime movie.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.750
If you have QuickTime Pro,
you could trim the edges and you

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.700
could combine a couple of them,
and then you could push

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.580
it up to a website.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.560
You could play it.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.320
It's just that easy.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.700
And so we continue to see a lot of
interest in the digital camera area,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.470
you know, as we go forward.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:38.190
So, racing up from the beginning of time
to just the beginning of last year.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.240
Kind of like a where are things,
how are they going, distribution,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.800
support, how it's being used.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.880
But last year was actually,
for me certainly,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.420
probably the most exciting year.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.760
It was the year where Apple kind of put
its foot down on a set of architectural

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.130
and technological directions.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.960
It was last year where we really
put a stake in the sand and said

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.340
we are a company that's interested
in and building on standards.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.740
And it's not just
OS X or FireWire or USB,

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.660
Bluetooth.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.430
I mean, there's standards all
over the Macintosh now.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.100
Something you would never think of,
you know, 10 years ago,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.470
or even 5 years ago,
but now it's standards-based.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.000
QuickTime is no different.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.970
We've had lots of standards-based
codecs over the years,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.760
but now we've totally embraced
the industry standards of MPEG-4.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.530
And with QuickTime 6 that
we launched last July,

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.080
we really started down
this path in earnest.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.090
We jumped in with both feet like
no one else and built QuickTime.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.520
We built QuickTime 6 as an
ISO-compliant MPEG-4 architecture.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.680
You know,
it's important to remember that when

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.720
the International Organization for
Standards were deciding

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.390
how to build MPEG-4,
the MPEG for the Internet.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.420
MPEG-1 came out in the early '90s,
MPEG-2 in the mid-'90s,

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.200
and very targeted applications,
very targeted data rates.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.200
But what about an Internet-based MPEG?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.200
And so they could have gone anywhere,
created one of their own.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.130
Well, they came to us,
and we worked with them.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.190
And MPEG-4 file format ended up being
the most important thing for us.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.360
It's based on the QuickTime file format.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.360
We're incredibly proud of that.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.710
And, of course,
we deliver -- we were the first people

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.320
to deliver a generally available,
widely distributed MPEG-4

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.360
solution with MPEG-4 video,
AAC audio,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.820
support for the MP4 file extension,
which, you know,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.360
kind of marks a file as MPEG-4.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.370
And a bunch of other things
that do quality of streaming,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.050
instant on streaming,
the first people to do that,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.310
skip protection.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.230
And a host of other technologies
came with QuickTime 6.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.360
But again, we're proud of that.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.980
And again, the most important and the
most interesting part is our

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.360
decision to go with standards.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.220
And what that meant was we now,
instead of standing by ourselves

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.440
and just looking at real networks
and looking at Microsoft,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.910
who are looking back at us,
and battling it out based on, you know,

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.780
a bunch of architectures,
trying to figure out -- you know,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.360
every once in a while,
we would all declare victory, right?

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.280
Microsoft, real, Apple,
we'd all put out a press release.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.650
The most downloads,
the most subscriptions,

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.360
the most Northwest in the U.S.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.360
There's some kind of announcement.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.780
There's some kind of announcement that
we would all routinely make pounding

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.350
our chests about what we were doing.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.310
But while we were doing that,
there were some very definite losers.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.610
Content providers who were forced
to encode in multiple formats

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.360
to reach the broadest audience.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.120
And end users who were forced to download
and install and use multiple players

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.360
to get the broadest range of content.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.110
And you all know what happens
when you install two or,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.220
God forbid, three of these media
players on one computer.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360
You know,
they don't exactly coexist peacefully.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.350
But this is typical
of a nascent industry.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.360
This is typical of an industry
that's not really a media player.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.810
This is typical of an industry
that's just getting going and de

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.350
facto standards battle it out.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.310
But like any other industry that matures,
the Internet itself,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.320
any other set of technologies
that have evolved,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.360
standards come in and provide
a level playing field.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.630
Standards come in and
provide a set of repeatable,

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.500
dependable,
and reliable technologies that then the

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.350
industry can embrace and move forward
on and get rid of the various battles.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.240
And we believe MPEG-4 provides that.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.060
A huge organization of
companies that support,

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.360
use MPEG-4.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.490
And what I'd like to do
now is invite Rob Conan,

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.360
who is the president of the M4IF,
the MPEG-4 Industry Forum,

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.410
to come up here and talk for a couple
minutes about what's going on in the

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.310
world of MPEG-4 and where it's all going.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.360
Welcome.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.860
Thank you very much, Frank.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.820
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.880
As Frank has said,
Apple is a great supporter

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.560
of open standards,
and MPEG-4 is one of the promising open

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.700
standards that we have around today.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.590
Yesterday,
I got an email from a very small company.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.680
I'd never heard of them from Norway.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.690
They're called Visiware.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.700
And they said, "Well,
we have this new cool MPEG-4 product.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.170
It's a mobile video conferencing
system." It has a little tiny camera

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.700
and a tiny screen in front of your eyes.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.700
You're wireless,
and you can do video conferencing.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.700
It's mobile, and it's using MPEG-4.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.060
There was another announcement today.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.600
It was made by Microsoft.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.640
Am I allowed to say that word here?

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.700
And JVC.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.610
And they have a new mobile device out,
and it supports MPEG-4.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.770
This illustrates that small
companies and large companies alike

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.600
have to support open standards,
whether they want to or not,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.700
because it makes sense and because
it makes the consumer happy.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.900
The MPEG-4 Industry Forum,
which I represent here and I'm

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.700
proud to represent here today,
is a forum of about 100 companies

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.670
that all create MPEG-4 technology
in various different industries.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.690
And I will say a little bit about
all the different industries.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.260
And they all believe in the value
of open standards to create an

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:37.510
interoperable multimedia ecosystem where
you have the same content representation

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.700
working across all your devices.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.690
So you can move content from
your mobile phone to your PC.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.140
and to your DVD player and it just works.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.300
Of course,
this starts with QuickTime 6 today,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.200
which supports MPEG-4 video,
MPEG-4 audio, advanced audio coding,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.690
the MPEG-4 file format.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.850
We see support for MPEG-4 in phones.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:04.370
The 3G and the 2.5G phones in the world,
around the world, wherever you go,

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.860
support MPEG-4.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.070
We see it in PDAs.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.360
Sony has this really cool Clia PDA,
which supports MPEG-4,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.220
and they've announced their
PS Portable to be released next year,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.460
which also does MPEG-4.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.980
We see it in DVD players.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.970
Some of them use the brand name Devix,
which you may have heard.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.760
Devix is just an MPEG-4
compliant implementation.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.840
We, of course, see the iPods and iTunes,
which use MPEG-4 audio.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.260
We see video cameras
that do digital video,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.300
but also do MPEG-4 if you want
to post stuff to... ...the web.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.860
And we see a host of internet
players that all support MPEG-4.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:45.400
You can get MPEG-4 plugins also for
Windows Media and also for real.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.450
So it looks like our original
vision of MPEG-4 as something that

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:58.300
works across industries and across
networks and devices is coming true.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.100
And the industry
projections are interesting.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.510
They all say, initially there will be
competition with Microsoft,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:13.000
but in the long run the market will
understand the value of an open standard,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.470
and they will choose the open standard.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.380
And also because the open
standard has been created by

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.640
people from all these areas,
and they understand the

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.630
needs from all these areas,
from the mobile industry,

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.270
from the CE industry,
and from the computer industry.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.990
So let's take a look at
where we are tomorrow,

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.710
where we will be.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.860
There's a new MPEG-4
video coder coming up.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.660
It's called Advanced Video Coding.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.060
The experts in the industry already
say it's the best video codec around.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.740
It beats all of the other
proprietary and standard formats.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.970
Advanced Audio Coding,
supported in your iPod

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:51.190
today and in your iTunes,
is already the best audio codec.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.510
And with high-efficiency AAC,
as it's called,

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.960
you can get CD-quality stereo
audio in 48 kilobits per second.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.620
And that's already being used
in like Digital Radio Mondial,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.140
which is a satellite-based radio system,
or XM,

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.240
which is also satellite-based radio.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.150
And we will see, with AVC,
Advanced Video Coding, and with AAC,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.480
Advanced Audio Coding,
we will see MPEG-4 being adopted

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:19.970
in the broadcast industry,
in the packaged media like the DVD,

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.940
in the mobile entertainment industry,
in lots of great and funny devices,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.520
and of course, and finally,
on the internet.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.130
And that brings me back
to QuickTime and to Frank,

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.000
and I want to thank you for
allowing me to say a few words,

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.640
Frank.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.620
Thanks, Rob.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:36.680
Appreciate it.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.690
Rob mentioned a couple of
things that are important.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:48.370
Because of the standard,
we want as many people as possible

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.820
to embrace and use the standard.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.830
We look at Windows Media,
and the guys at Microsoft have

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.750
done an incredible job with the
video codec and the audio codec.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.630
Unfortunately, it's closed,
and it's proprietary,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.130
and it's only Microsoft's.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.180
Real Networks has dabbled in standards.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.630
Real Networks has a plug-in for
their player that supports MPEG-4,

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.650
which is a great start.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.370
And we would invite them,
and I routinely invite Microsoft,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.310
to join us and support MPEG-4,
because with the inclusion of

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.100
MPEG in all of their players,
it just only gets better.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.720
So, I mean,
it's a good point Rob brought out.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.610
He's totally platform agnostic.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.180
I tend to forget about
that every once in a while,

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.180
and kind of stick to QuickTime.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.980
The last thing we did,
the most recent thing we did,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.010
was probably one of the most
exciting things that I had done

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.280
with QuickTime since I took
this job a number of years ago,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.730
is watching us be able to cash
in on some of the dividends

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.340
from our investment standards.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.110
I mean, just, not even a year ago,
we started shipping, you know,

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.490
QuickTime 6 with our MPEG-4 support.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.310
And now, with QuickTime 6.3,
we're delivering the

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.080
next logical extension,
the whole new industry's

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.320
worth of support for 3GPP,
Third Generation Partnership Project.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.040
This is a group of companies.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.760
There's actually 434 companies that
are members of the 3GPP organization.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.980
And they, like the M4AF organization,
are dedicated to the use of,

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.600
the support of,
and the management of a standard,

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.340
but for, not so much for the internet,
as much as for wireless devices,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.320
cell phones,
3G cell phones to be specific.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.180
This support of QuickTime 6.3
introduced a couple of new,

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.300
one new codec,
a couple of new file formats,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.320
basically AAC and AMR audio,
MPEG-4 video in H.263,

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.320
but as a .3GP file.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.300
A new file extension.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.320
So, we're going to talk about that.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.320
And then, we're going to talk about
the extension to QuickTime,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.320
and one that's incredibly
important for this,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.320
the mobile world.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.320
And including 3G text,
support for the 3G file format.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.190
We can play back .AMR files.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.260
And, if you guys have ever seen any of
these absolutely incredible phones,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.320
this one's from NTT DoCoMo.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.320
It has two cameras built into it.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.280
I mean, I'm looking at you guys now.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.290
I'm going to take a picture of you guys.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.320
I just took a picture.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320
This is the screen.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.210
I mean, it's absolutely incredible.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.270
Unfortunately, it doesn't work here.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:11.640
The camera does.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.300
But nothing else really turns on.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.300
But when you land at Narita
and you turn this phone on,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.300
it takes on a whole new meaning.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.280
This thing is just incredible,
what it can do.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.300
And in the back,
they have these SD cards.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.300
And the SDV format is
what these cards read.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.280
And we support those as well.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.300
And we're really excited about this.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.300
We were in Tokyo just two
weeks ago doing the 6.3 launch.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.300
And we had 80 members of the
press show up to our launch.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.280
A gentleman, Natsuno-san,
who is the founder of the NTT DoCoMo,

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.280
is the founder of iMode.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.280
If you know anything about
what's going on over in Japan,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.270
iMode is an incredible service provided
by NTT DoCoMo to provide access

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.280
to information and entertainment.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.280
And they've extended that now to iMotion.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.280
Well, Natsuno-san came to our launch.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:56.280
He spoke on behalf.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.280
This guy's a rock star over in Japan.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.240
He gets like Steve Jobs treatment
when he's there.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.280
It was wild.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.280
And he spoke at our conference,
and it was just incredibly well received.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.280
Because we took prototype versions
of QuickTime 6.3 months ago,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.240
back like December or something.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.260
And we gave them to a number of folks,
including DoCoMo,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.760
who immediately started building out
their iMotion content service with all

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:22.260
of their thousands of content providers
creating content using QuickTime 6.3.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.260
And when the service launched,
they had all the content they needed.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.260
And it just worked based on QuickTime.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.250
The way this works,
there's a couple different ways.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.370
First is professional
content providers with,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.080
you know,
Macs or PCs with QuickTime-based

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.260
tools capture their content,
get it somehow,

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.240
and simply encode as a 3G file.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.240
I'll show you that in a little bit.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.240
Push it out to one of these
mobile service providers,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.020
to their basic cell towers,
and then people with these cell

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.240
phones can just surf around and
find the content and play it back,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.210
save it or whatever.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.050
Equally as important and interesting
is what you can do as a consumer.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.240
You know,
instead of taking a snapshot of you guys,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.240
I could have captured 15 or
30 seconds worth of video,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.240
and then simply go to the address book,
dial up another cell phone,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.240
and email the movie to you,
or dial up an email address

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.220
and send it to a desktop.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.640
So this is where QuickTime, you know,
QuickTime's role is

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.220
important to point out.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.220
QuickTime is not on these phones.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.210
This is the beauty of
working with the standard.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.870
We don't have to port--shut this
off so I don't have to look at

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:27.220
myself-- we don't have to port
QuickTime to every device that wants

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.000
to be a member of this 3G community.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.220
That's the beauty of standards.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.070
We do what we do best,
content creation and playback.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.110
We're not a 3G company,
but we get to play in the 3G industry.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.200
So content creation is what we do best,
and we continue to do that.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.190
And playback on a desktop
is what we do best,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.200
and we continue to do that.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.200
And the standards industry takes
care of everything in between,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.200
from the servers to the cell phones
and all the various technologies

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.170
required to play in this space.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.190
There's lots of other phones, too.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.200
This is the 3650 from Nokia that
actually does a beautiful job,

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.170
and you can actually take pictures
and short videos here and use them.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.160
The set of services aren't available
yet like the Japanese have.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.200
It's very much like stepping into
the future when you go there,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.070
and very depressing to step back
into the past when you come back.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:15.180
It's really amazing if you
ever get a chance to try it.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.180
And there's a whole bunch of companies.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.390
This doesn't even begin to touch
the types of companies that are

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.120
investing in the evolution and
development of the 3G industry.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.160
It's vast.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.180
It's really kind of
Japanese-centric right now,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.260
moving out to the Pacific Rim,
to Europe and the U.S., and

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.180
hopefully not too distant future,
within the next couple of years.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.180
We're meeting with all the
companies that are involved in this,

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.180
all the big infrastructure manufacturers,
all the content providers,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.900
all the handset manufacturers,
to make sure that the standard

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.160
and that QuickTime 6.3 and the
things that we're doing together

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.160
and the tools that you guys create
can all work to create content.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.160
And to talk just a little bit
more about the world of 3G,

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.160
I'd like to invite Roberto Castagna
from Nokia to come up here

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.160
and talk a little bit.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.000
Roberto's a long-time
friend and colleague,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.160
member of the standards community,
to talk a little bit about the 3G world.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.160
Roberto, thank you.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.950
Welcome.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:10.090
Thank you.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.500
Good morning, everybody.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.450
Yeah, actually I have two messages that
I would like to deliver to you today.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.640
One message is a little
bit about the past,

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.500
and the other message is
more about the future.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.770
And the message about the
past is actually a little

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.500
bit where do we come from,
and what did we do together with Apple,

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.500
especially with the
QuickTime team at Apple.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.500
And of course,
Nokia being a telecom company,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.500
we have been always
working with standards,

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.970
because that's the only way
that you can have the devices

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.500
interoperate with each other.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.500
And Nokia is involved in
several standardization bodies,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.500
but of course the 3GPP is now
the standardization body for us.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.180
So that's where we are really
creating the foundations for the

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.500
2.5G and 3G telecommunications.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.610
And it was a couple of years ago
that we were starting to now address,

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.600
in addition to the very
simple application,

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.500
which is voice,
we started to address other applications.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.610
We started to address other multimedia
applications on mobile terminals,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.950
namely the multimedia messaging,
which is what allows you to

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.500
create content on your terminal
and send it to other terminals,

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.330
and of course also mobile streaming.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.500
And it was pretty clear that the 3GPP
needed to address this discussion,

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.500
and I think we did a fantastic
investment a couple of years ago.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:33.500
I have been working with Dave Singer in
the MPEG team for several years,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.490
and he said,
"Why don't you come to the 3GPP?"

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.500
And that was probably one of the
best things that I did in that group,

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.140
because it really helped us bring
together the culture of the open

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.530
standard multimedia that Apple has
had in the PC world for several

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.500
years into the 3GPP community.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:27:02.490
And together with the help of
Dave and other companies there,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.550
we have developed a multimedia
architecture which is entirely

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.440
based on open standards.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.820
We have transport protocols,
we have media formats, we have everything

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.500
based on open standards.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.500
And of course we have a 3GPP file format.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.500
And it has been really great that very
soon after the standard was finalized,

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.500
then Apple released QuickTime 6.3 that
actually supports these 3GPP formats.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.500
Today we have a situation in which you
can really create content across devices.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.410
You can create content on mobile phones,
you can create content

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.290
on personal computers,
and this content can travel

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.490
across a variety of networks.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.400
It's really exciting.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.500
You will see demos today and
also later during the conference.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.500
You can actually create
content on GSM phones,

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.500
transfer to your PC, put titles,
do some editing,

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.500
and then you can send them
via email to a phone in Japan,

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.500
and then it still works.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.380
And all of this is
based on open standards.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500
This is really great.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.020
And in addition to that,
we also have evidence that even industry

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.500
players that were actually working on
proprietary formats are now actually

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.500
being pulled towards open standards.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.500
Since Frank named it,
now I feel allowed to name it myself,

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:19.510
but also real networks actually is now
providing support for 3GPP formats on

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.500
the mobile version of their player.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.350
And this is really exciting
because it really means exactly

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:29.500
what Rob was saying earlier,
that when open standards start to work,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.170
then the whole industry is
clearly attracted because

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.500
it's a win-win situation.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500
So this is really great.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.500
And actually,
as a thank you to Apple for their work,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.700
actually I have here a recyclable
wooden mobile phone that

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.040
I will leave here for Frank,
just to remind you about the

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.500
beauty of open standards.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.630
And then when you get
tired of open standards,

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:53.500
you can also use it to open bottles,
which is maybe more interesting.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.300
So it's here.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.500
But this was the message about the past.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.500
Now the message about the future.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.500
And this is very much about your,
and maybe my being, developers.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.500
This is a developer conference.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:11.190
And typically, let's say until today,
the idea of developers has always

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.500
been a sort of vertical idea.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.500
We are here today in the
Apple Developers Conference.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.440
Of course, we have Nokia developers.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.490
We have Series 60.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.440
Series 60 is the software platform
that Nokia is also licensing

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.500
for mobile phone manufacturers.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.490
And we have Series 60 developers.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.450
The idea of developers
were always vertical.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.500
But now,
especially for the mobile environment,

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.500
now that we have this fantastic
platform of open standards,

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.500
which already guarantees interoperability
across devices and across networks,

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.480
the exciting message today is that
the concept of developer community

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.500
is not anymore a vertical one.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.700
Today, the developers of Apple and
the developers of Nokia and the

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.500
developers of Sony Ericsson and
the developers of Series 60,

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.930
they're actually creating one single,
big developer community which can

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.500
leverage this open standard platform.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.500
And this is a clear case in which
the total is bigger than simply

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.330
the sum of the different parts.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.500
And I think this is really great.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.500
I'm extremely excited
about being part of that.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.500
And I really encourage you to, let's say,
to think different.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.500
I've seen it on a couple of T-shirts.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.470
And really do that.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:25.500
And you have a golden opportunity to
expand the scope of your activity.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.500
As developers to the mobile world,
you have the opportunity of bridging,

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.470
creating the famous bridge between
the Internet and the mobile world.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.480
So I think this is a good day.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.500
I think it's great that
there is this opportunity.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.090
And I strongly encourage you to
take advantage of that in your

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:45.500
work and in your future activity.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500
Good luck and thanks a lot.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.700
Thanks, Roberto.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.700
Appreciate it.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:01.080
Roberto, I think this is the phone you
should have put the real player on.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:11.960
I'll show you in the visualizer later.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:11.970
It's wood.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:11.970
Sorry, I can't help myself.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:11.970
So, I'm

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.640
Last couple of things
I wanted to talk about.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.330
As we evolve QuickTime,
as we move forward, the sea of APIs,

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:27.600
2,400 some odd APIs that make up
the QuickTime library of routines

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.890
and things that you can play with.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.650
One thing we haven't done,
we haven't really radically changed

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:36.300
the way that you can get access to the
codecs that we build into QuickTime.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.010
We've had a lot of people ask us, "Well,
this is great.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.360
You're supporting these new formats.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.970
You're supporting these new technologies.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.360
You're supporting all this new stuff.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.450
How do we get access?

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.820
Do we have to write new tools,
new applications?" No.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.290
Almost every time,
the same applications that you

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.170
use before QuickTime 6.3 came out,
one day you're editing your

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.320
DV file and Final Cut or some other
application and you export it and

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.630
you can save it as an MPEG-4 file.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:06.520
You install QuickTime 6.3 and
the 3GPP codecs just show up.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.430
And what I wanted to
demonstrate--I'll collect all my toys.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.740
Tim, I'll leave the clicker right here.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:19.730
What I wanted to demonstrate
was making a long walk,

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.190
a very long walk.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.180
What I wanted to demonstrate
to you guys is how this looks.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:32.050
Here's Final Cut Pro,
and we have a project in here.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.890
This is Red Hot Chili Peppers.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.400
This DV file is a short little clip.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.870
Remember,
the 3G world is not a long format world.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.700
You don't really watch
hour-long content on your phone.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.110
There's certain battery
issues that come into play.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.890
But it's short form.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.150
As I sat there in the airport,
I'm downloading little

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.540
movie clips and audio clips.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.230
And this is a good example of one.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.480
This file, this DV file is 193 megabytes.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.770
And I'm going to play it,
and you can get a sense for what

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.890
it looks like on the computer.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.480
That's like a classic little
clip that you would get on

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.240
one of the iMotion service.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.240
I mean, I found tons of this kind of
stuff in Japan when I was there.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.170
But now the question is, what do you do?

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.470
How do you go from almost 200
megabytes to something that will

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.680
fit on a cell phone over the
wireless internet that they have?

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.220
Well, with installing QuickTime 6.3,
we just go to Export,

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.300
Using QuickTime Conversion,
and I can click right here.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.910
And in addition to all the
other codecs we support,

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.620
here's 3GPP.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.340
If I select that,
I can go a little further.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.840
Instead of using the default options,
go into the settings.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.040
And the guys in engineering did an
incredibly elegant job of presenting

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.690
all the myriad of options that exist
for you to tailor the 3G file to

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.630
the particular network you're on,
or the particular format you want to use,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.360
whether it's just the general versions,
the profiles of 3GPP,

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.740
video information with sliders,
audio with sliders.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.640
There's no better way to
adjust this stuff than just

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.920
grabbing and dragging a slider.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.270
And text is really important
in the Japanese market,

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:19.280
scrolling text,
support for emoji and other capabilities.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.410
So what I would normally do now is
just dial up the settings I want,

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.540
hit Export, it would happen.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.880
And then what I would get is a 3G file.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.800
The 3G file of this movie
is just over 200 kilobytes,

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.550
from almost 200 megabytes
to 200 kilobytes,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:35.640
using this format.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.590
And when I was in Japan last week,
we actually... We actually did send

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.020
it over the wireless internet and
it downloaded right to my phone.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.820
We can't do that here.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.530
But what I have,
if we can switch over to the visualizer.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.300
There we go.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:01.460
What I have is my,
this is actually my phone,

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.510
and we have that video clip on it.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.400
So what I'll do is I'll just play that,
and you can see what it looks like.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.150
It's accessing the
SD card where it lives.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:18.960
Can you hear that?

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.790
So, 200 kilobit file,
and just transfer it over.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.200
Thanks.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.000
The coolest thing is about this,
when we were in Japan doing

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.140
this press briefing,
we were able to right there in front

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.870
of all the press do these demos live.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.930
I mean,
we were able to capture some content,

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.130
we were able to push the content
up to an iDisc and email the

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.810
URL of that movie to my phone.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.120
I clicked it on my phone,
it progressively downloaded to my phone,

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.370
I watched it as it happened,
we took some video of the

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.540
audience and moved it.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.380
It was really,
it was like doing things over

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.080
the internet but with no wires,
and it really works and it

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.920
represents kind of the center
of the set of activities.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.820
As I promised,
I might close and I can show you,

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:17.810
this is the phone that Roberto handed to
me that I think deserves the real player.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:24.210
So we will continue to
follow the standards.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.420
Both Roberto and Rob were kind
enough to join us here and talk

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.970
about the future as they see it.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.580
The good news is it's the
future as we see it as well.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.860
New codex for audio, new codex for video.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.920
The standards world is not
slowing down at any level.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.070
It's accelerating.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.820
When you go to these big trade
shows like IBC or any of the

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.230
cell phone shows like CTIA,
it's standards everywhere.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.180
And if you want to see
the proprietary formats,

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.880
you get to go to their
booth and look at them.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.150
And we think that that's just great.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.380
We think we backed the right horse,
if you will.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.470
But we put our money in the right place,
and now the dividends are coming back.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.800
And we're thrilled with
the progress we've made.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.730
So with that,
I'd like to turn it back to Tim.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.720
Thanks for your time,
and I'll talk to you guys later.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.570
Thank you, Frank.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:15.660
I think that phone conforms
to the TreeGPP standard.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.660
Sorry.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.190
I had to do that.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:28.440
So, the last 10 months have been a
very important year for QuickTime.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.430
Really a year of building a
foundation of technology on which

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.300
we would build our future products.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.440
And in the last year we
built a complete end-to-end

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:43.560
solution for the MPEG-4 format,
including the live broadcast tool,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.300
the QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.300
We've got the streaming server,
which now supports MPEG-4.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.350
We've got the QuickTime player,
and we've created a whole

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.300
end-to-end solution.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.300
And I think it's been, first of all,
it was an incredible amount of work.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:03.570
But I think as you see the 3G stuff,
you start to get the idea of some

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.300
of the interesting convergence
possibilities that arise.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.340
And I think you can see from the
relatively simple and simplistic

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.300
even interface that we're
providing in the standard players,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.680
that there's a lot of opportunity for
you as a software developer to come in

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:23.690
and build more finely tuned solutions,
and to really orient yourself towards

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.630
some of these new markets where
the PC and the consumer electronics

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.300
industries are starting to come together.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.110
The consumer electronics
industry knows all about building

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.290
things into the small devices.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.380
But they really,
really need your help when it comes

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.230
to building polished solutions that
bring the Internet and the consumer

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.300
electronics world closer together.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.260
And this is what I think is a
great opportunity for all of you.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.300
So, now I'd like to turn attention
to what's coming down the pike.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.010
Things we're working on for
Panther and in the coming few months

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.220
that we'll be able to deliver to you.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.440
The first thing I want to talk
about is QuickTime for Java.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.590
As you know,
QuickTime for Java exists today.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.390
We've had it available
for a couple of years.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.790
It's got a very rich feature set.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.540
We're making some pretty
significant upgrades to the system.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.850
The first thing tracks some changes,
fairly major changes that are happening

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.050
in Apple's overall support for Java.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.010
The new version of QuickTime for
Java is compatible with Java 1.4.1.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.990
Very important.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:27.100
It's the latest version from
Sun that's widely deployed.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:33.900
It integrates fully with Java's
AWT and swing components.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.790
Very important to the
developers we've talked to,

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.640
we received a lot of feedback about this,
is that we wanted to see the

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.390
Java APIs in QuickTime conform a
little bit more closely to the kinds of

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.700
metaphors that Java programmers expect.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.430
And this is things like
factories and players and

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.580
drawers and that kind of a model.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.800
And so we've made some API changes
that will support this new metaphor.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.690
And of course,
you can still access all the

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:05.500
C APIs for QuickTime through JNI,
which is the standard model for

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.650
how Java connects to C APIs.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.060
If you've got existing apps, well,
you're going to have to make some

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.160
small changes to those applications
in all likelihood to be able to make

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.940
them run in the new world order.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.650
But you can continue to use Java 1.3.1,
and we're continuing to

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.330
ship that in the systems,
and so all of your existing

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.240
applications will still be compatible.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.980
But there are opportunities to do
new kinds of integration with Java,

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:35.210
and new kinds of capabilities enabled by
Java 1.4 that you'll need to switch over

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.040
to support if you want those features.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.480
We will make these capabilities
available for Mac OS X and for Windows,

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.980
and we've begun seeding already.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.030
As long as you're a member of ADC,
Apple's Developer Connection Program,

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.420
you can go up to the website and
you can find out how to get onto the

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.720
seed list and get the software today.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.700
The next thing I want to talk
about is QuickTime for Cocoa.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.380
As you know,
Cocoa supports QuickTime through

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.680
a couple of built-in classes.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.460
We've got NSMovie and NSMovieView.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.420
They use the standard kind
of object-oriented model

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.870
where you've got model,
view, controller,

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:16.180
and we've created a similar separation
in QuickTime in NSMovie and NSMovieView.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.810
We are going to be adding several
new classes to our support for

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.060
QuickTime for Cocoa programmers.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.470
Yes, long awaited.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.670
It's going to give you a lot more access
to the lower-level data structures and

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.020
some of the lower-level capabilities.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.840
Hopefully, this will all be packaged up
into an easy-to-consume format.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.360
Frank mentioned there's 2,400
different APIs for QuickTime.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.950
If you're just getting started,
if your orientation is around

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:45.640
building an application that
takes advantage of QuickTime,

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.160
you probably don't want
to look for a quick time.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.020
You want to learn 2,400 new
APIs before you can do anything.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.000
This is going to go a long
ways to making that task much,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.930
much easier.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.650
As with the Java work,
you can also combine this

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.340
with the traditional C API.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.300
So if you know those details,
or you need to get more advanced

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.750
functionality that we haven't
yet revealed in the Cocoa world,

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.330
you'll still be able to do that.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.990
We haven't yet begun seeding this work.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.690
It's not in your Panther packages,
but we're going to begin very shortly.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.520
And so if you're interested in this,
I would encourage you to

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.180
contact Guillermo Ortiz.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:25.490
He's providing all of the developer
assistance inside of developer relations,

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:27.270
and he'll make sure
you're on the seed list,

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.660
and we'll let you know just as
soon as the software is available.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.420
It's very exciting,
and we're really looking forward

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.520
to seeing what you'll be able
to do with QuickTime in Cocoa.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.740
The next thing I want to
talk about is performance.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:43.300
Multimedia really isn't much of a
phenomenon without good performance.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:48.080
And we spend a lot of time at
Apple working on performance.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.820
And this breaks down to
several different categories.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.170
Certainly there is the domain of codecs.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.820
We've got a whole stable of codecs.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.410
And with every release of QuickTime,
we try to make an investment

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.950
in improving the performance of
the ones that we're hearing from

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.520
you are most important to you.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.940
And the areas where we can see from
the ways that QuickTime is being

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.830
used are getting the most pressure.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.910
And in the last several months,
we've been making significant

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.120
enhancements with this
standard set of codecs.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.430
And that's a real important
part of what we're working on.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:29.080
The second area has to do not with
the side of getting to the screen,

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.220
but the part where you get the data
from the disk and into the system.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:36.280
I'll be talking in a minute about
some higher resolution video.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.650
And video work we've been doing.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:42.300
One of the really important elements
of working with high-res video and

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:47.220
uncompressed video is being able to
manage the super intensive data I.O.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.610
that's associated with these formats.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.720
We've been doing a lot of work
in the plumbing of QuickTime in

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.190
the areas of the data handlers,
the software that gets the data

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.790
from the disks and hands it off to
QuickTime in a timed sort of a way,

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.160
a synchronized way.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.820
And the video media handlers,
which are responsible for moving the

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.420
data through the QuickTime system.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.360
We've been doing a lot
of work here to be able.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.950
To make QuickTime be able to keep up with
the really high data rates that you'd

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.860
associate with uncompressed HD res video.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.620
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that shortly.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.580
The last area I want to talk about
relates to QuickTime and its usability in

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.880
a multi-threaded application environment.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.260
As most of you probably know,
putting QuickTime in a

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.480
multi-threaded environment has
been kind of a no-no to date.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.030
There are a lot of aspects
of QuickTime which have

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.550
not been multi-threaded.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.500
There are thread safe,
there's a lot of aspects of

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.450
the lower level system which
haven't been thread safe to date.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.520
But we felt that one of the most
important areas where we could provide

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.040
some substantial improvements in the
overall performance and responsiveness

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:55.910
of the system would come if we could
unlock some of those blockers for you.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.170
And so we've been doing a lot
of work inside of QuickTime to

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:02.960
be able to allow you to start
putting QuickTime functionality

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.650
on separate threads.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.320
Whether this is due to a single
thread or a single block.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.790
Whether it's doing background
compression or background

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.970
renders or exports or imports.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.800
A whole range of operations
that are really important for

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.080
building high performance and
highly responsive applications.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.240
And we're going to be delivering
this stuff in Panther and I would

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.560
encourage you to go to some of the
other sessions where they'll be talking

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.080
about the details in much greater depth.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:35.010
But that's a really critical piece of
our work for Panther in QuickTime 6.4.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:40.600
So, the next thing I want to talk about
is the QuickTime streaming server.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.680
We introduced the QuickTime streaming
server a couple of years ago,

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.940
and it's really been very,
very successful for Apple.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.040
I want to tell you very
quickly what's in it.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.920
So the server is a full function server.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.280
It's an industrial strength server.

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.120
It's able to support live streams.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.480
It's able to support video on demand.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.160
You can connect the
QuickTime broadcaster to it and

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.170
do all the replication of streams.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.890
So you can do multicast,
you can do unicast,

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.480
all that kind of stuff.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:12.430
We also built into the system support
for our proprietary skip protection

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.190
and instant on technologies.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:17.140
These technologies make the
experience of streaming much,

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:22.250
much easier and more enjoyable for
consumers working on the internet.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.940
Skip protection basically allows you to
utilize excess bandwidth of the network

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.380
to be able to buffer the content ahead,
so that when there are

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:33.440
glitches in the network,
as there typically are, packets are lost,

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:38.670
it provides enough of a... enough
of a buffering ahead so that you

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:42.030
can go back and get the packets
before they're actually needed,

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.830
so the customer never even notices
that the packets were lost or

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.380
that the network was flaky.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.820
The instant on, of course,
provides the experience of not having

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.380
to wait when you connect to a stream.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.810
The buffering messages basically go away,
and it's pretty much like what you

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.280
would experience if you were playing
the files on your local hard drive

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.020
if you've got the network bandwidth.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.430
We've got a very rich Apache style, plus,
we've got a very rich

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.960
Apache style plug-in architecture
for the streaming server.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.150
If you haven't looked at
this and you're interested in

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:12.270
server-oriented media operations,
I would strongly encourage you to go to

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.560
the sessions and hear more about this.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.770
The plug-in architecture allows you
to customize and extend all kinds of

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:19.600
functions in the streaming server.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.120
Really cool.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.180
This is all built into Mac OS X Server,
but in addition,

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.630
Apple decided back in the beginning
we were going to make the software

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.430
available through an open source project.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.430
We call it Apple's Public Source License,
also known as DARPA.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:33.990
We're going to make the software
available through a server

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.430
called the Darwin Server.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:40.820
And you can go out and download
the software and you can port it

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.800
to whatever platform you want.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.220
It's already available in binary
form for all the major OS platforms.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.570
And this has been very, very successful.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:53.820
We've had several hundred thousand
developers download and use the server.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:49:36.900
[Transcript missing]

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.430
Now, we've been having some network
challenges over the last 24 hours,

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:47.340
so just give them a
break if it has trouble.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:51.620
Okay, so as Tim kind of mentioned,
QuickTime QTSS Publisher is really

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.780
designed to solve those problems where
you've got your media all encoded,

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.290
it's all ready to go,
now it's time to get

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:58.220
it up on the internet.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.060
What do you do?

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.120
You go and FTP it up.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.020
Oh, God, I forgot to hint it.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.390
Hint it, put it back up.

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:06.480
What's the URL for that?

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.110
It's like it's always been
complicated for people,

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.590
so we really tried to simplify
that whole process for people who

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:15.340
are responsible for making the
content available on the internet.

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.750
So here's the application.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.460
When you bring it up,
you're going to see your media library.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.100
You can kind of view this
as kind of the staging area,

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.680
or it's basically the library of
all of your stuff that could be

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.490
made available for the internet.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.950
It's not yet available on the internet.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.280
This is just a place where
you kind of do all your work.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:38.080
You can view things hierarchically.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.680
You can organize things in any kind
of directory structure you want to.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.500
You can click over here
to the View All view,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.470
and you can see everything
in your entire library.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:51.930
So once you've decided you're ready
to put something on the internet,

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.010
just click on that.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.220
And then move over to the
settings for that application.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.630
So if anybody's ever tried to put
something up on their streaming

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.100
server and had to go through the
whole process of hinting a movie,

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:06.100
we basically have now made it one click.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:06.560
So you're done.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.770
This movie is now up on the server.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:15.840
It's showing me the URL that is necessary
for the viewer to look at this movie.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.000
So I'll click on that and it'll actually
preview it for me in the player.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.820
So that is a lot easier.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.090
Great.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:35.480
So the second problem that people
tend to have is setting up playlists.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.020
So I'm going to go back to media.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.000
This application lets you
manage all of your playlists.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.360
You can manage MP3 playlists,
which are using Icecast,

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.040
Shoutcast protocol,
or you can manage your

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.250
QuickTime playlists,
which can be movies or audio or

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.760
any kind of QuickTime content.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.830
So I'm going to show you how easy
it is to create an MP3 playlist.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.970
Let's click New Playlist.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:03.310
Let's say I want to set
up a listening party for

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:06.530
A new Linkin Park CD that came out.

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.190
We do this all the time at Apple.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:13.600
Click new playlist, I name it,
go find all the content I would like,

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.460
and I'm just going to
select the entire album.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.540
Those actually are the
real names for these songs.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.570
I dragged them in here.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:27.610
So I could click start
and it would just work.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.020
The playlist would be up and
available on the internet.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.610
But when you're doing a listening party,
you tend to want to schedule things.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:35.250
You want to play at 3:30 on Friday,
right?

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:42.910
So we've added functionality to let you
schedule when the playlist should start.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:46.620
So I could say I want
this to play on July 1st.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.310
I want it I'd like to start at 3:30 p.m.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:58.200
[Transcript missing]

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:05.480
and then going back to the media list.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.700
The other problem people tend to have is
that they've got all this content ready,

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.860
they think they've got
it hidden properly,

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:14.240
they've got RTSP URLs.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.290
It's always been a real pain to
kind of get all the HTML all set up.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:20.080
So I'm going to show you
now how you can do that.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.340
If you go over to your links view,
this is going to show you everything

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.420
that is available on the internet.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.500
So I've got all of these
playlists that are available.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.410
I'm going to go over to the Avril CD.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.470
I can drop in a custom image.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.200
This is what's going to
show up on the webpage.

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:44.660
I can also really easily generate
ref movies for doing multi bandwidth.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.040
So you've got people who
are listening on modems,

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:49.150
people on DSL, and people on LAN.

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:51.670
And basically it's just a matter
of dragging things over there.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:52.780
It's really easy to do.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.290
I'm not going to do that right now.

00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.110
The next thing is we will actually
generate the HTML for you.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.740
So this HTML is valid if you
were to take it and drag it into

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:07.220
Dreamweaver or BBEdit or your
favorite web authoring application.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:08.600
It would just work.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:14.670
Let me move on to one last thing.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:18.910
So we've also made it really
easy to generate web pages.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.410
So select a couple of items,
click web page.

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:25.550
Got the option to select a template.

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.170
We're going to ship with
a bunch of templates,

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.080
but we're using an open
standard called XSL.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.500
So for most of you professionals,
you've probably got your own

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:36.480
website that has its own look,
and you can use this

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.940
templating format for that.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.020
And I'll show you how easy
it is to update your content

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.160
or generate your content.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.150
So I'm going to click create page.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.950
What this is going to do is it's going
to actually generate all of the HTML,

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.520
put it into the appropriate web
directories for using the Apache web

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:55.700
server and Mac OS X server,
and then it's going to pop up

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.400
a preview for me in Safari.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.070
So click create page.

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:02.580
It's off doing its thing
with the web server,

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:07.470
and then it shows me a preview and I've
got a website with links that work.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.620
That's a streaming video.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.450
And that's it.

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:20.500
I'm a QTSS publisher.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.670
We think this is going to
make things a lot easier.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.790
There's no more FTP.

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.120
There's no more getting to the terminal.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.110
We think that people are going to be
able to use this to set up some really

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.490
great websites and really get their
content out in a much easier fashion.

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:33.560
Thanks.

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.640
So that's an update on the
QuickTime streaming server.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:42.900
Thank you, Chris.

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:44.010
I think that's going to be very cool.

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:47.390
And that's bundled with Mac OS X Server.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.960
Panther.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.610
So, the next section I want to
talk about is high def video.

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:58.950
The domain of high definition
video is one of these areas that's

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.740
kind of out on the bleeding edge.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.170
It's one of the coolest things
we've been involved with lately,

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.320
and it's got some unique challenges.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.700
And I want to talk to
some of those challenges.

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.960
The first thing is obviously just
take a little inventory of how

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.200
big are we talking about here
when we talk about high def video.

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:20.860
This is a representation of the clip
that you were looking at on the phone.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:24.800
So, this is sort of 3GP size, 176 by 144.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.240
This is sort of your standard
Internet type content,

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:34.150
320 by 240, sort of traditional quarter
screen kind of stuff.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:40.210
Here's a full NTSC size, 720,
this is sort of typical DV type content.

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:43.290
And here is the high res HD content.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.180
It's really quite remarkable.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:47.590
Um...

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.600
Now, that's great,
I love the size and everything,

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.500
but what's it going to cost me to
be able to work with this content?

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.800
It's a real problem.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.800
We look at the data rates.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.800
I picked kind of an intermediate
data rate for the HD content.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.560
This is,
it can run anywhere from 95 to 155,

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:09.170
160 megabytes a second,
depending on exactly how deep

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:10.800
color you use and all that sort of.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.800
That's compared to the DV content
or the internet video content,

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.620
which, you know,
it's like 2,000 times the

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.760
size of the 3G data rates.

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.500
It's just outrageously heavy duty stuff.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:28.050
Let me show you how that actually works,
though, and talk a little bit

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:29.800
about those challenges.

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.800
So,
let's switch over to the demo machine.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.680
So,
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.800
just going to pull up one of these files.

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:40.780
So, this is a 10-bit uncompressed HD.

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:44.590
Well, so the first problem I have is
it doesn't fit on my screen.

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.800
So, you know,
there's the title there in the middle,

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:52.800
so I can just scroll all day long and,
you know, it's kind of frustrating.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.160
I can't really get to the bottom
of the screen and so I can,

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.730
you know,
I can half size it and I can get down.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.800
Okay, now I can see the whole thing.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.800
Oh, great, there's some video.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.580
This is the Terminator 3 trailer.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:09.800
It's just about to be released.

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:10.760
Okay.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.800
Sure, let's go ahead and try and play it
and see what this experience is like.

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:21.800
Well, that's not really very exciting.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:26.390
So, what's going on here is this
file is so darn big that

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.800
I can't keep up with the disk.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.900
And as a consequence,
the whole experience

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.710
is just really chunky.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.790
These images are basically the equivalent
of a 2 megapixel still image camera,

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.810
each single frame.

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:43.500
We're talking about a 4
megabyte per frame image.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:48.580
The system really can't keep
up with the standard computer.

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:50.980
So what do people do when they
want to work with this content?

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:54.060
Well, if you go to the studios,
what you're going to find is

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.090
you're going to find a whole
bunch of really big disks.

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:59.080
You're going to find, no,
we don't have one of them in here.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.190
And I didn't want to bring one.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.990
It's talking about carrying a couple
hundred pounds of extra hardware.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.730
And my situation actually mirrors
pretty well the real world for

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:12.850
people who work in these studio
professional kind of environments.

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:16.410
There are going to be some people
who have the hardware to be able

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:18.500
to work with this stuff live.

00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:21.550
But it's really big,
it's really expensive,

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.190
and that means it's not
going to be widely available.

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.580
As Steve mentioned yesterday,
we find ourselves on occasion

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.370
working with this other company
that he has some involvement with,

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:34.800
Pixar.

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.130
And they've been telling us about
the problems that they have when

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.200
they're working with their content.

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:44.110
And the problems basically, to us,
sounded very similar to the kinds of

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.540
problems that everybody working with
HD content is going to start to have.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.240
And we decided we were going
to get involved and see what we

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.670
could do to try and help out.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.500
This is an interesting space for Apple.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:57.280
We care a great deal about
content creation and publishing,

00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:00.200
not just for consumers,
but also for the professional space.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.180
It's very important to us
because it's often the harbinger,

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:09.180
the leading edge of what will be
consumer technology in the years to come.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.290
And so we like to practice
our skills in the pro space,

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.130
and hope that those,
as those things become

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.280
more and more mainstream,
we'll be able to leverage

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.200
the know-how that we acquired
trying to solve these problems.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:23.000
So we built this codec called Pixlet.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.580
I want to go back to the slides, please.

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:34.260
Pixlet is this really interesting codec,
and I don't think we've ever seen

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.680
anything that's quite like it.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:39.650
The first thing we wanted to
design was something that could

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.080
handle studio-grade image quality.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.360
And this meant,
not that I thought it looked good,

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.870
but it meant that it could pass the
sniff test with people at Pixar.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.220
People who do this for a living.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.240
In order to be able to
achieve this quality,

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.280
we felt that the way we needed to
get there was to leverage some very,

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.110
very powerful still image technology
that's built into JPEG 2000,

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:06.040
but we took it and built a proprietary
version of this because what we

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.470
encountered was that the standard
algorithms are not computationally

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:14.320
sort of feasible on today's hardware.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.020
So we did a whole bunch of work
to tune the wavelet in order to

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:22.130
be able to run it in real time
on today's hardware platforms.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.960
If you tried to do this
experiment using JPEG 2000,

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.650
many of the characteristics
you'd be able to achieve,

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:29.440
but many of them you would not.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.290
And in particular,
the performance benchmark you'd need

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.900
to meet to be able to have this be
widely usable would not be possible.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.640
So we did a whole bunch of
work optimizing both for

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.520
the G4 and G5 architectures,
but also work in the core of

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.100
the math to enable the wavelet
algorithm to be efficient enough.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.580
The codec supports arbitrary resolution.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:52.200
It accepts very deep color,
as Steve mentioned.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.060
Certainly you can put 8-bit per
pixel channel color in there,

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.240
but you can go deeper
if that's important.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.800
And it's a variable compression.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.420
It's a very simple algorithm.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.370
So you can use 20 to 1.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.370
You can go up to 40 to 1.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.860
You can go outside that range,
but my experience is that most people

01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.540
are going to stay in that range.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.250
And that means that it
ends up producing for,

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:13.410
say, half HD resolution,
a data rate that's about the

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:15.500
same data rate as DV content.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.310
So it's not low data rate.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.860
It's not an internet file format.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.800
But it's a format that's very,
very usable in the studio.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.360
So let me go back to the demo
machine and show you what the same

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.700
clip looks like encoded in Pixlet.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.600
And I'll just let this play.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.130
The life you know,
all the stuff you take for granted,

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:43.470
it's not gonna last.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:56.210
Imagine a world of permanent darkness,
where machines control man's destiny.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.540
Imagine you were the only
one who could stop it.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:08.170
But before you do,
something terrible has to happen.

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:13.620
So I think you get the idea.

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:14.920
It's very, very high quality.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.280
In addition,
you can do things that you could

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.590
never do with the HD content.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.120
I'm going backwards.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120
Forwards.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.990
Oops.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:04:25.400
[Transcript missing]

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:35.060
So the next topic I'm going to
talk about is color management.

01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:38.700
Now, first of all,
a little bit of background about what

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.300
this color management problem is.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.390
Basically,
every device that captures images,

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:47.530
captures in a digital format,
captures them with certain

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:51.100
assumptions about what it means,
what the digital values that are

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.510
associated with the pixels actually mean.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.090
And of significance is the whole
question of what does the color,

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:02.140
a certain color, end up mapping to in
terms of the pixel values.

01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:05.650
Now, the unfortunate or just the
harsh reality of the world is

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:09.300
that from device to device,
whether it's a camera

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:13.010
as in an input device,
or a screen, an output device,

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.930
or a piece of paper
coming out of a printer,

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:17.850
this is highly variable.

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:22.220
And in addition to that,
the language of color that has been

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:26.970
developed in each of these different
market segments is very different.

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:30.710
Creates a tremendous problem if
you're working in a professional

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.760
environment where color accuracy
and color fidelity is important.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:39.760
So Apple created a technology that
allows you to solve this problem.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.910
We basically modeled the source
color profile of the source media,

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:50.040
source device,
and we modeled the destination device.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.640
And then we apply transformations to the
pixels to be able to adjust and normalize

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.140
and produce a calibrated result,
which is very, very important.

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:00.260
So, in the end,
we have a result which is accurate.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.760
It works really, really well.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:05.520
It's been widely adopted in the
professional publishing domain.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:10.700
But, you know, it was traditionally
quite an advanced feature.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:15.380
When we brought this out in 1995,
it was computationally pretty expensive.

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:18.310
And if color wasn't super
critical to what you were doing,

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.560
it wasn't something you were
likely to be willing to pay the

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.500
computational cost to support.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.380
And so it was an opt-in feature.

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.560
Now let me tell you the
second part of the story.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.180
We built these technologies
into QuickTime called Graphic

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.400
Importers and Exporters.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.470
Very powerful, very easy to use.

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:41.180
Allows you to open or save to a
whole range of still image formats.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.110
QuickTime supports a whole bunch of them.

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:48.210
And, you know,
we're adding new ones all the time.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:54.120
A lot of you have written importers,
exporters to support your own formats.

01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:58.260
One of the things about this is
that these images tend to come to

01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:02.600
you tagged with different color
profiles that are supposed to be

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:05.880
used in managing this color workflow.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.360
We've provided APIs inside of
the graphic importers to be

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.960
able to read these profiles,
and then on export to be

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.760
able to write them out.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.040
Hello.

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:20.700
But it was up to you to
go and make those calls,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.510
pull the data out,
and be able to write it back.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.330
Our experience is this has led to
a very inconsistent experience,

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.640
and I want to show you that right now.

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.660
Hello.

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.740
We're going to go to the demo machine.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.540
Oh, okay.

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.690
We'll just go to the demo machine.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:53.100
So the first thing I want to
do is I've got this Nemo image.

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:56.680
And I'm going to open
it up with Photoshop.

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:58.140
Photoshop's kind of the gold standard.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.010
They get it right.

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:03.410
So I want to show you what it
looks like when it's correct.

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:08.740
So there you go.

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.850
Now I'm going to open
the same image in BBEdit.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.840
Now,
you don't expect BBEdit to get it right,

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.490
because it's not really
an imaging application.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:21.060
And if you look here,
what you can see is that the colors in

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.360
the BBEdit version are much darker than
the colors in the Photoshop version.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.490
And the Photoshop version is correct,
and this is wrong.

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:30.840
I don't mean to slam BBEdit.

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:34.000
It's actually a fantastic application,
but it actually highlights

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.620
the problem we want to solve.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.900
Most people don't have time
to get this stuff right.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.640
Most people don't know that
they're even getting it wrong,

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.960
because how would you ever know if you
didn't see the two images side by side?

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.880
So we want to come over and
fix this problem in Panther.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.460
And here's what we've done.

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.330
We've built into Panther some
modifications to the graphic importer

01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:02.060
and exporter routines that basically
allow you to automatically apply the

01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:05.840
profiles kind of behind your back,
so that most applications will

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.850
derive the benefit immediately.

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:09.160
Can we switch to demo one?

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.080
So I'll open it up in Photoshop again.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.020
Open it up in dbedit.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:29.090
And what you should see this time is
you're getting a very accurate color.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.800
This is going to be great for consumers.

01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.560
The pre-press guys were
already getting things right,

01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:39.550
but consumers are just completely
baffled at what's happening to

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.000
them when they open these images
in different applications and

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.160
they get different experience.

01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:44.530
This is going to allow us to solve that.

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:47.280
Go back to slides, please.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.380
So that's color
management with QuickTime.

01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:57.410
So the last thing I want to
talk about is QuickTime audio.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.250
Mac OS X introduced a whole
new audio architecture,

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:05.180
and this is a major innovation,
not just in the realm of audio,

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.890
but in the realm of operating systems.

01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:10.100
It was a ground-up
redesign of the system.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.140
We wanted to support all the
modern hardware capabilities,

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:17.140
and this meant multi-channel,
high data rate, high res,

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:22.480
greater than 16-bit per sample,
high sample rates.

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.760
just out of range.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.540
Low latency I/O.

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:31.750
Anybody working in a professional
audio environment knows that if

01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:35.560
you don't have low latency I/O,
you are not working in a pro domain.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.410
You can't get your work done.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.190
It's just unusable.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:44.860
Mac OS X has the lowest I/O latency for
audio of any operating system anywhere.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.070
And I would challenge you to put
it up against even a wide range

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.580
of professional audio products.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.020
It's incredibly compelling.

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.520
As I said, we support bigger, deeper,
wider formats.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.340
It's got a very flexible plug-in format.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.910
If you're interested in audio and you'd
like to be able to extend the system,

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:06.310
there's a great API for doing
that called Audio Unit API,

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:08.520
and you can learn all
about that at the show.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.240
And we wanted to deliver
pro-level performance.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.570
Well, that was core audio.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.160
What are we going to do in QuickTime?

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.500
It's been a long time since we've
done a fundamental rethinking of

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.630
the QuickTime audio architecture.

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:21.890
For Panther, we are doing just that.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:26.650
It leverages core audio, of course,
and it's available on Macintosh,

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.270
of course.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:32.860
Many of these capabilities will
be provided on Windows as well.

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:35.220
First and foremost,
we break the 64 kilohertz

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:36.230
sampling rate barrier.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.340
We support 24-bit,
32-bit floating point formats.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.190
We support, for the first time,
multi-channel formats.

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:46.270
And I'm going to show
you some 5.1 audio today,

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:48.920
but we support all the different formats.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.240
There's just a zillion of them,
and there's a very flexible architecture

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.980
inside of QuickTime that allows you to
label the tracks appropriately so that

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.040
they end up going to the right speakers.

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:00.120
And it's very, very powerful.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.270
We support this both
for uncompressed audio,

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:05.090
PCM, as well as for compressed
audio formats such as AAC.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.360
And we've also done a major
rework of the synchronization

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.550
architecture in QuickTime so that
when you have multiple channels,

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:15.400
you will be guaranteed
sample-accurate synchronization

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.580
across your various tracks,
a promise we do not make today.

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.960
So let me show you how that works.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.270
Here we go.

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:34.360
So the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm just going to open up an audio file.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.740
And I'm going to show
you what we've got here.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.320
So I've got six soundtracks.

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:44.140
They're PCM, 48 kilohertz.

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:47.290
And the first thing you notice
is in the channel section here,

01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:48.400
it says left.

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:51.560
If I go through the channels,
I've got right-- well, so far,

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.310
nothing new-- center.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.930
LFE, Low Frequency Enhanced,
that's the base, subwoofer,

01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:02.930
left surround, and right surround.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.450
So the channels are now labeled,
and when we play this,

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.100
you'll be able to tell.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.780
Okay, well that's good.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.800
That's surrounding an audio file.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.880
But of course,
QuickTime supports video as well,

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.800
and I want to make sure that
you get a chance to see this

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.740
working in the video context.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.790
It's just like everything
else in QuickTime.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.800
Cut, copy, paste, it all just works.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.240
You stick it in the files,
you manipulate it exactly the same

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.860
way you manipulate audio in the
current version of the QuickTime,

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.800
and it works really, really well.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.630
This is the Matrix trailer.

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:37.260
Do we proceed?

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:37.930
Yes.

01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:38.740
He is still.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.810
Only human.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.500
So that's about that.

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:51.090
So that's high def,
I mean that's surround

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:51.090
audio in QuickTime.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:57.810
and that's going to be very cool.

01:14:57.810 --> 01:14:57.810
So, we are...

01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:00.660
We are wrapping up just in time.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.720
In summary,
we've got seven cool new capabilities

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:07.590
coming in QuickTime for Panther,
and I hope you'll take a look at that.

01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:09.400
I think there's something
in here for everybody.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.040
We've got a billion sessions
at the show this week.

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:16.570
I'm not going to spend
any time reviewing that.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.320
Hands-on Labs, content creators,
and software developers.

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:25.240
Go check that out all day long every day.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.980
If you have any questions,
you want to get more information

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.230
about any of these details,
contact Guillermo Ortiz,

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.060
QuickTime man at Apple.com.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:32.770
And that's the show.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.520
Thank you very much.
