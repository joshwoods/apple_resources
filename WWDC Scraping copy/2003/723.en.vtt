WEBVTT

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.020
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.020
I trust the mic.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.600
Oh, there it goes.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.890
It's good to be in San Francisco,
and I am very pleased to have the

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.420
opportunity to meet before you at
the Worldwide Developers Conference.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.300
It's a great opportunity for us
to explain these licensing terms,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.400
which have been the subject of
so much discussion in the press

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.840
and privately and so forth.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.340
And certainly,
interest runs no higher among users

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.960
of MPEG-4 technology than those
of you in this room and at this

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.830
conference because of Apple's,
certainly, their great support through

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.290
the QuickTime products.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.050
And obviously, that's very important to
the start of this market.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.720
The other element that is important
to the start of the market is

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.400
to clarify licensing terms.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.300
And I say that not only for
whatever needs to be done still now,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.590
but what needed to be done even a year
and a half ago when various controversies

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.020
started over what this license was
about and what it wasn't about.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.300
The reason I say this as
a platform is because,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.890
you know,
to start out the discussion here,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.160
is because every
technology such as MPEG-4,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.460
which is an open standard,
is subject to technology

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.960
that is owned by many,
many different patent holders.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.140
And in the old days, I say the old days,
the days before standards

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.170
were widely implemented,
before digital video and

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.100
digital audio and other digital
technologies were implemented,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.230
users were pretty much on their own when
it came to clearing rights under relevant

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.700
patents for the use of a technology.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.610
Picture the situation where, for example,
you as a user or other

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.520
implementers of the technology
go forward with the technology,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.520
or Apple, for that matter,
goes forward with the technology.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.400
and does not have the availability
of a license such as the one we

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.160
present that provides access to
many different patents owned by many

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.470
different patent holders in one place.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.420
The consequence of that, unfortunately,
is that the implementer, the user,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.420
the promoter

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.330
is subject to potential
infringement by 20,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.810
25, 30 different parties that may
own essential patent rights.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.400
So they go out with the technology,
and obviously there's a possibility

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.590
of litigation or infringement
allegations and so forth.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.850
And that's what
MPEG LA tries to clear up.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.710
That is the entire purpose of our being,
which is to try to bring as much of

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.740
this essential intellectual property
rights under one license as possible,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.150
so that when a user goes to market,
they don't have to have 20

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.740
negotiations or 25 or 30 negotiations
with individual patent holders.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.060
It doesn't take a brain scientist to
understand that a technology that has

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.370
to go through that many negotiations is,
frankly, dead on arrival.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.950
So what we try to do is bring the 20
or 25 or 30 patent holders together

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.880
under one license so that users
and implementers and promoters can

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.920
get the rights they need in one
place with one negotiation and move

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.010
forward from there without fear of
having infringement claims hoisted

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.700
upon them by the patent owners.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.500
Some of what I've said may
seem kind of cloudy to you,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.830
so let me take it step by step,
give you a little

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.730
background about MPEG LA,
and then let's talk specifically

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.600
about the MPEG-4 Visual License.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.670
I did want to just set that up as
background though for the general role

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.680
that MPEG LA plays in this technology.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.720
We all know that.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.560
A lot has been said.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.490
A lot has been written.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.520
I myself was a recipient
of probably 6,000 emails.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.180
Some of you in this room I'm hoping
I actually communicated with.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.910
We tried to respond to all of them.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.360
And by the way, they were very helpful.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.510
They made a tangible change in the
licensing terms as a result of what you

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.180
wrote and what you expressed and the
heartfelt feelings that you had about

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.970
the ease of implementation that you
faced or the difficulty of implementation

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.510
you faced when the terms first came out.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.890
As you may know,
they were revised about six months later,

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.790
reflecting many of your views.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.130
Obviously, not everyone is always
happy with licensing terms,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.010
but we went a long way, we think,
to correcting some of the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.940
deficiencies in the original license.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.530
That's what we're going to discuss.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.680
As I said, first I'd like to provide
some background on MPEG LA.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.040
MPEG LA is not a patent holder.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.690
MPEG LA is not a user of any technology.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.060
In terms of promoting
it or being a licensee,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.570
shall I say,
of one of our own licensing programs.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.990
We are an independent company.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.130
whose sole purpose is to try to
bring order out of the market chaos.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.090
The market chaos is what
I referred to earlier.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.740
The situation where a
standard that everyone likes,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.940
many people want to use,
has one single problem that holds

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.000
it back from implementation.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.500
And that single problem is how can
we get it out there and get it widely

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.200
used by the biggest number of users
without facing multiple infringement

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.760
actions or essential patent claims.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.210
So where we began was in 1997.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.540
As a company,
we began licensing the MPEG-2

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.280
video compression standard.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.320
That was our beginning.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.660
The single biggest challenge to
MPEG-2's adoption was dealing with the

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.470
essential intellectual property rights.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.640
MPEG, as you know,
stands for Moving Pictures Expert Group.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.720
It was a group of engineers from
all over the world who still meet

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.940
to discuss international standards.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.300
They are the authors
of the MPEG-4 standard.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.950
They were the authors
of the MPEG-2 standard.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.180
The standard was developed in
the early '90s to the mid '90s.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:09.230
It was an answer to where to begin with
a high quality digital compression for

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.700
real time video in the broadband sense,
in the broadcast sense, by satellite,

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.080
by cable, and by DVD player.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.420
And as I said,
it was well known going into this

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.140
process that the technology which
the MPEG group had put together

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.460
as a single specification to be
made available widely to the world

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.330
had one barrier to implementation,
one significant barrier

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.520
to implementation.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.620
I think it's obvious to all
of you in this room what the

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.360
benefits of interoperability are,
which is what the purpose

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.000
of these standards is.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:50.520
So the MPEG-2 standard sitting here
on a voluminous amount of paper.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.930
was no better than the paper
it was written on unless

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.640
it could be implemented.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.100
And many companies throughout the
industry had a significant interest

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.970
in seeing its implementation
because obviously that answered

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.560
the problem to interoperability.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.880
But, many patents owned by many patent
owners caused potential for confusion,

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:17.020
conflict, spelled litigation, and cost,
spelled multiple negotiations,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.100
and possibly endless negotiations,
and possibly negotiations

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.680
that were inaccessible to
the normally sized company.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.360
You know, maybe large companies,
maybe companies,

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.570
small companies with significant
technology would see the inside

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.160
of the door of a particular patent
holder who wanted to cross license

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.800
for that particular technology.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.780
But in general,
in order to foster the widest

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.510
possible use of this standard,
there had to be a different

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.860
way of doing things.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.190
So the MPEG group set in
motion an intellectual

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.980
property rights working group.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:56.560
It was headed by Baron Futa,
who is the current CEO of MPEG LA.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.000
They worked for a number of years
on coming up with a blueprint

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.470
for overcoming this problem.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.300
The result of that deliberation
was the creation of MPEG LA.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.620
Of course, MPEG LA used that blueprint,
but as a private company,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.850
had to sell patent holders on,
or shall I say convince patent

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.140
holders to include their intellectual
property under one license in a model

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.360
that had never been tried before.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.540
This was unprecedented.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.820
The venture, which became the MPEG-2
Patent Portfolio License,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.500
went before a six-month review
before the Department of Justice.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.800
As a matter of caution and common sense,
because it was new and unprecedented,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.610
and the Department of Justice in its
review found the business plan of

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.800
MPEG LA for MPEG-2 to be pro-competitive.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.390
It was designed with many elements
in mind to achieve fairness,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.240
reasonableness, and nondiscrimination.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.400
Fairness and nondiscrimination
and reasonableness,

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.700
particularly important elements.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.140
You'll probably hear me
refer to them later today.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:11.980
They're big words.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.300
They don't mean much by themselves.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.260
But we hope that our licenses and the
acceptance of those licenses in the

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.660
market helps to define what is fair,
reasonable, and non-discriminatory

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.900
in the marketplace.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.320
Obviously,
a license that is widely accepted

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.490
can be viewed as fair and reasonable.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.300
We administer them to
be non-discriminatory.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.180
What does that mean?

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.240
Non-discriminatory means
that a patent holder,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.600
a licensor as we call them,
who happens also to be a licensee,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.090
a user of the technology,
and there are many,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.040
will be treated the same
as any other licensee.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.960
They receive no favorable
treatment over a licensee who

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.450
does not have patents themselves.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.040
Very important principle.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.450
So not to pick on a particular company,
but if you go on our website

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.570
you will see that there are
currently 22 patent holders in the

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.030
MPEG-2 patent portfolio license.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:24.290
They include names such as Sony and
Matsushita and Columbia University.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.590
It's a wide spectrum of patent owners.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.660
And Columbia, of course,
is not a licensee because they don't use

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.640
the technology in the conventional sense.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.880
But a Sony, for example,
pays the same royalty rates

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.580
that any other user pays.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.860
Obviously, as a patent holder,
they get a piece of the revenue

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.210
that comes as a result of any
royalties that are collected

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.970
for the use of this technology.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.880
But the technology was
not developed for free.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.600
It was not developed at no cost.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.200
This is their way of getting a return,
a reasonable return on their

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.930
investment so that they,
like other patent holders,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:13.050
can continue to develop new
technologies that fuel the marketplace.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.460
Our sole business is based on what
we call one-stop patent licenses.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.300
Once again,
MPEG LA itself is not a patent holder.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.180
We aggregate essential patents owned
by many parties under one license.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.900
And then we have the right
to sub-license those to the

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.140
marketplace on the same fair,
reasonable,

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.340
non-discriminatory terms to everyone.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.660
We'll get into that more in a minute.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:49.810
I apologize if we spend this much
time on the background of MPEG LA,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.920
but I think it's important to try to
understand where we're coming from,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.990
what we're trying to achieve,
and I think it'll be easier to

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.770
understand the MPEG-4 license once
we begin that discussion momentarily.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.510
This is the problem that
MPEG LA set out to solve.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.840
I won't review it all,
but suffice it to say

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.120
that in the last 10 years,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.540
Companies, individuals have understood,
like they never have before,

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.080
the value of intellectual property.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:30.760
rapid patenting, voluminous applications
before the US Patent Office.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.040
I'm unprecedented in history in terms of
the number of patents that are entering

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.000
the office and are being reviewed.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.260
I don't have the figures at hand,
but I understand that it's probably

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.790
doubled over the last 10-year period.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:47.890
It means that people are patenting

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.830
Anything that they
believe to be patentable,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.990
something that is an invention which was
not subject to any prior publication and

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.550
which they are the first to discover.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.880
What happens is that there's growing
interdependence among patents.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.040
When you put out a standard
such as MPEG-2 or MPEG-4,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.080
it isn't just one invention like the
telephone and Alexander Graham Bell or

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.600
the other poor guy who had
the real patent on that.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.490
But it is a situation where the
standard that is established is

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:28.010
subject to many patents covering many
elements of the compression standard:

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:33.700
the decoding, the encoding,
the transport, and all kinds of elements

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.200
surrounding that,
whether it be spatial redundancy

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.980
or temporal redundancy or whatever.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.280
So there are many patents to deal with,
and it's not getting less.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.690
It's getting more.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.360
It's been referred to
as the patent thicket.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.040
And the result is that licensing
transaction costs for companies

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.530
who engage in MPEG-2 or MPEG-4
or other such technologies are

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.680
extraordinarily burdensome.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.260
The possibility that a technology
may do nothing except gather

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.000
dust on the paper on which it
is written is greater than ever.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.790
There needs to be a bridge,
and the bridge is to try to set up a

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:17.840
one-stop license as a transition to
the marketplace that can allow people

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:23.460
to have non-discriminatory access to
the technology with one negotiation.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.980
One-on-one licensing arrangements
ruled the day before MPEG LA.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.220
That's the way people operated.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.000
They negotiated one-on-one.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.580
And they still negotiate one-on-one.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.270
MPEG LA does not replace
one-on-one licensing negotiations.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.440
It works with those that
are necessary in the market.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.900
It's one more element that technology
users have to choose from in

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.390
determining how they want to deal with
their intellectual property rights.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.570
And I know I'm talking to a
group of knowledgeable people

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.210
who do a lot of development.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:06.540
But basically,
the laws of most countries worldwide,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.300
virtually all,
recognize the right of an inventor

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.510
to have the fruits of its invention.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.470
And what that basically means is,
I always try to draw it like a boundary

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.240
line of a piece of real estate.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.790
That basically means that
you carve out the four walls,

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.630
the four corners,
the four boundary lines of a patent.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.500
And if a user trespasses
on that property,

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:35.850
then what the law says is that
the patent holder has the right to

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:42.240
exclude that user from using that
technology on which they trespass.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.280
And that is the nature of a patent.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.600
So they're out there.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.070
They have to be dealt with.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.930
MPEG LA didn't make them.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.060
Obviously,
we're glad they're there because

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.480
that is MPEG LA's business.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.200
I can't apologize for that.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.460
But we take the
marketplace as we found it,

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.940
and we're trying to make it easier
for users to deal with that issue

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.040
rather than have to go through
individual negotiations with each one.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.990
So this is the way we do it.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.250
We put them in one license.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.980
We offer them on the same terms.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:21.000
And the result, for example,
in MPEG-2 has been quite remarkable.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.990
MPEG-2 licensing, as I said earlier,
began July 1997,

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.340
following the Department of
Justice's business review.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.700
Actually, I see a misspelling there.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.180
It should be licensors with an O,
but it still means the

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.360
same thing to everybody.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.200
We started with eight patent holders.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.970
Eight patent holders.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.740
To become a part of the program,
it's not your pedigree that counts.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.040
It's whether or not you
have an essential patent.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.660
An essential patent is one

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.990
That cannot be avoided in the
implementation of a technology.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.600
If it cannot be avoided in the
implementation of a technology,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.500
then it's essential.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.320
If there are other ways to perform that
same technology that is in the patent,

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.880
it is not essential.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.990
It's as simple as that.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.320
And rather than make those decisions
ourselves or rely upon our patent

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.400
holders to make those decisions,
the patent holders submit-- the patent

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.810
holders who want to participate in
this program submit their patents

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:31.940
for evaluation by independent
patent experts that we hire.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.490
We have independent
patent experts in the US,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:39.090
Korea, Japan, and Europe who review these
patents on a regular basis.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.080
And if found essential,
and if the patent holder is willing

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:49.030
to agree to the terms of license that
all the other patent holders agree to,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.220
they are included in the portfolio.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.220
So the license grows,
and it grows quite phenomenally.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.730
We started with eight licensors,
as I said, and we now have 22 in MPEG-2.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.470
Why 14 in the six years that
this program has been licensed?

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.300
Why those additions?

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.880
Well, in some cases,
it was a matter of expediency to

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.100
get the license going because the
market needed it fast in 1997.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.370
So a line had to be drawn.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.300
There were already a few patent
holders waiting to get in,

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.760
but we started with the original eight.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.450
Immediately after it began,
some more were immediately added.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.720
As for the others,
they fall into two categories.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.450
Some had patent applications
that had not issued as patents

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.600
yet when the program began.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.150
And this program deals
only with issued patents,

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.730
doesn't deal with patent applications,
which, by the way,

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.660
are not even licensable
in the United States.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.530
They are licensable in Europe,
it's my understanding,

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.890
but not enforceable in Europe.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.860
So we focus on issued patents because
issued patents have the mark of

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:04.330
validity that is basically the result
of their review process by the patent

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.900
office in the applicable country.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.600
So many of them had patents that
issued after the program started.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.790
They came in.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.630
And yes,
there were a number of patent holders

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.230
who didn't want to be a part of the
MPEG-2 Joint Licensing Program at all.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:24.240
But they subsequently came in too once
they saw that it would be successful.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.680
They were not early risk takers.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.290
They wanted to do it themselves.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.170
But they came in,
and certainly we're glad to have them,

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.480
because our objective is to include
as much essential intellectual

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.600
property in one license as possible
for the benefit of the user.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.360
And in fairness to the user,
when we grew with this phenomenal growth,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.530
which by the way began
with 25 patent families,

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.770
approximately 100 patents worldwide,
and now has grown to 123 patent

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:59.300
families representing more than
575 patents in 56 countries,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.190
the royalty rate never increased.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.290
It never increased.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.600
Our promise to you, the user,
is that the royalty rates remain the same

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.000
during the current term of the license.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.230
Now,
MPEG-2 has gone through multiple terms.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.900
But it didn't go down even
when it renewed for a new term.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:26.260
In fact, in January of 2002,
the market saw a 40% reduction

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.600
in the royalty rates charged
for decoders and encoders.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.450
The patent holders in
MPEG LA were able to do that,

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:40.750
one, because, frankly,
they saw the nature of the marketplace

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.900
and the declining prices of product,
and they wanted the royalty

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.210
to fit comfortably with what
people were charging for their

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.740
products going out the door,
whether it be a set-top box,

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:57.020
a DVD player, a PC equipped with
DVD playback or whatever.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:06.110
Under the old rate,
we had very high compliance

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.150
in most market sectors,
but not all.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.810
With the reduction to 250,
we are now able to boast that we

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:17.590
include north of 85% compliance
in every major market sector

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.500
that is using MPEG-2 technology.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.160
So it was a very significant thing to
reduce the royalty and increase the

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.770
compliance by many market sectors.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.980
And in this age of convergence,
that is no small thing.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.940
I'm sure you all realize,
given the convergence,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.160
but we heard from set-top box
makers who were upset that a

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.250
PC maker was not paying royalties.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.580
And we have, once again,
this may sound strange,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.450
but this is a licensing product,
and we love our customers very much.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.170
And we want to keep faith with them.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.460
And if we sense that
something is off balance,

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.360
we try to correct it.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.760
We try to go to the patent holders
who make the ultimate decisions and

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:06.310
try to talk out with them what we
see of our view of the marketplace

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.640
that may require a change in order to
respond to a marketplace condition.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.370
And at the time, January 2002,
we thought it was appropriate

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.280
to reduce the royalties.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.540
We now have more than
570 licensees in MPEG-2.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:28.330
We license now four other
programs using this same template.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.580
This MPEG-2 template,
so successful in seeing the

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.060
widespread implementation of
MPEG-2 across the marketplace,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.220
resulting in the inclusion of
as much essential intellectual

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.730
property in one license that
saves users valuable negotiating

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.380
time and creates a level playing
field so that what they're paying,

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.730
others are paying in other market
sectors as well as their own.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.540
The program has caught on to
be popular with helping to

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.020
foster other technologies.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.750
One quite familiar to you
as developers is 1394,

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:10.740
mostly known under the
Apple trademark FireWire.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.310
It's been a very successful
licensing program.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:18.330
It was organized in November 1999
to cover the 1394 standard,

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.230
including a portion of the IEC standard
that dealt with the peripherals

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.790
that are attached to the network.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:32.060
It has eight patent holders, licensors,
and now has more than 220 licensees.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.040
And I'm proud to say, of course,
Apple is a patent holder in that program.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.770
And of course, I think it's not unfair
to say that Apple,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.580
if you look at our list of patents,
which was posted on our website,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.110
this one on 1394LA.com,
and if you look at our list of licensees,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.420
which are also posted,
you'll certainly see that Apple is a

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:56.400
major player in the intellectual property
that was developed for this technology.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.060
Along with others,
but certainly Apple has the, has a large,

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.680
maybe the largest volume of
patents among all the patent

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.880
holders that are represented.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:14.810
Our third licensing program was for the
implementation of the DVBT standard.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.860
DVBT being the terrestrial broadcast
standard used in Europe and

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.140
Asia and other parts of the world,
I think all except for the US and Canada,

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:31.090
which have chosen the ATSC standard
for digital broadcast transmissions.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.980
We are licensing that program as well.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.920
And we have a London office to
try to work in the European market

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.040
where that technology is
getting its commencement point.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:48.190
And most recently,
we began licensing MPEG-4 Visual.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.240
I know, that's still the topic today.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.080
And the MPEG-4 Systems License.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.110
And I just note, for the record,
the MPEG-4 Systems License also

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.230
includes Apple's intellectual property
that is essential to that standard

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.870
in the form of the MP4 file format.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.780
Let's turn to the topic,
MPEG-4 Visual License.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.130
That's the background.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:21.740
What I just said really is our operating
procedure for all of our licenses.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.430
They deal with essential patents.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.840
They issue on a fair, reasonable,
non-discriminatory basis.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.760
They go through patent reviews
by independent patent experts

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.440
so that there is some sense of
credibility and reliability that

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.780
people aren't just sitting in
a smoke-filled room and saying,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:42.690
"I'll let you include your patent if you
include mine." That is not what happens.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.940
There's no horse trading going on here.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:51.530
A patent can only be included if it meets
the essentiality standard as applied

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.770
by the independent patent examiner.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:27:00.260
Every license, first to understand it,
you must lay out what it covers.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.340
What do you get for this license?

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.320
Now we don't ever say
that we have all patents,

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.690
because we don't know that we do.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.260
You who deal with intellectual property
may know there are a lot of what they

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.830
call submarine patents out there,
or likely to be.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.100
There's a possibility
of submarine patents.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.970
Second, even if we were to know about
other essential patents,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.180
this is a voluntary exercise
for the benefit of the market.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.860
It's a way of marketing the technology.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.520
It's a way of marketing the patents.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.070
It's a way of providing a service to
users who want to use the technology.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.370
But we have no way to compel
an essential patent holder

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.970
to include their technology.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.200
We can only hope that by the way
we do business and the way we

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.440
present the license to the market,
and by the acceptance of the

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.920
royalty rates and other terms,
that patent holders will want

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.340
to be a part of the license.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.750
They will have the incentive to be a
part of the license because they believe,

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.850
one,
it's the best service they can perform

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.230
for the market to make them available,
and two,

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:06.210
that it's actually the best way to
market their patents for this technology.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.130
So what does it cover?

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.160
A lot of words here.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.830
I'm not going to go over them with you,
but MPEG-4 Visual Standard refers

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.720
to Part 2 of the MPEG-4 Standard.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.540
There is a Part 10,
which has been the subject

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.470
of much discussion,
and we can take some questions

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.160
on it later if you like,
which is often referred

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.140
to as H.264 or AVC.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.480
But the MPEG-4 Visual Standard is
divided into profiles.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.060
The profiles accomplish
different results of different

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.460
complexity and different quality.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.420
And you, more technical than I,
probably know them far better than I.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.430
So I hope to avoid that today for myself.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.860
But the objective of this license,
initially when we started this license,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.320
and this was actually before
your QuickTime conference,

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.140
we were only focused
on two of the profiles,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.710
which were called Simple and Core.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.780
And when we went back
to the drawing board,

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.480
we thought it made more sense to
include all of the profiles in part two.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.540
We didn't want to set up a
situation where a user starts to

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:16.620
get married to the technology,
decides to migrate along its

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.320
path to a higher complexity,
and then, as a result,

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.980
And then only to find that the next shoe
drops from the patent holders and say,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.020
oh, that'll be another license fee,
thank you.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:31.470
So we decided to throw all the profiles
under one license so that users didn't

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.280
for themselves have to decipher one,
whether they were using

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.820
one profile versus another.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.260
In some cases, that's not so easy.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.900
We leave the complexity on the
inside for us to figure out in

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.100
terms of dividing the royalties.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.600
And then second,
we didn't want them to have to,

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.110
as I said, come back for another license.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:53.720
We wanted this license to be evergreen
for any use of MPEG-4 Part 2.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.590
So it covers all those profiles,
and this happens to be the official

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:02.910
reference to where those profiles
and this standard can be found.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.200
and not to confuse you anymore with that,
but it is the basis, by the way,

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.310
on which the independent patent
examiner makes their evaluations.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Okay, so how is this done?

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.190
I just went over the coverage.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.800
It's the entire MPEG-4 visual part two.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.980
How does it accomplish this result?

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:31.080
Okay, most of this you've already had,
but I'm going to repeat myself again.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.120
It's always a good thing to
do it in different examples,

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.410
I'm

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.010
We rely upon patent submissions by
parties who believe that they have

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.780
essential intellectual property.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.230
We ask them to submit the
essential intellectual property for

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:51.820
evaluation by the patent examiner,
and if found to be essential,

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.690
and a prerequisite for their
submission is that they will

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.920
agree to the licensing terms.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.100
They are admitted to the license.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.750
So that's the first thing.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.190
Each patent in the license is essential
to the MPEG-4 visual standard.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.340
Second, it's evaluated by
independent patent experts.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.130
Third, each patent holder promises
to us worldwide coverage.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.590
What does that mean?

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.290
Obviously,
they can't provide worldwide coverage

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.830
where they don't have a patent,
but it means that wherever

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:23.020
they have an essential patent,
in whatever country worldwide,

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.050
they may have an essential patent.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.240
That patent,
under legal obligation to MPEG LA,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.280
must come into the patent portfolio.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.500
So a patent holder can't say, well,
this is great.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.020
I'll give you the United States,
but I'm going to hold Japan to myself.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.120
No, no.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:47.670
You as a user must have the comfort
to know that if a patent holder's

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.290
name shows up on this license,

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:55.010
If they have an essential patent in
another country other than what's listed,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.670
or those that are listed,
that eventually they're

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.190
going to be included.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.850
That they can't come
later and say to you,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.660
"I have an essential patent, and oh,
by the way, I didn't include it in the

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.970
MPEG LA license." You have the
right to believe that they're

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:12.210
not going to bother you for any
essential patents that they may own.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.990
Some companies patent in 50, 60,
70 countries worldwide.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.840
They get very, very broad coverage.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.890
And of course,
it costs a lot of money to do that.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.740
Others focus on only a few countries.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.070
So the patterns of where these
patents show up can vary substantially

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.050
from one company to another.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.190
And remember,
MPEG LA has nothing to do with

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.530
the prosecution of these patents.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:40.480
We only receive them once they
issue from a patent office and

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.830
thereby qualify for inclusion.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.890
This means, of course,
that there's always more intellectual

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.890
property in the pipeline,
in the evaluation pipeline.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.730
There's more coming.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.080
Our independent patent
experts are kept very,

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.860
very busy.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.090
Between quarters,
when we announce the new patents

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.020
that go into the license,
they are busily evaluating them,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.230
and when found essential, they come in.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.290
And a question possibly on your mind is,
well, what about the dilution factor?

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:14.800
And the answer is, no.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.450
dilution factor to patent holders.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.430
And the answer is,
those are the rules of the road.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.000
That's what patent holders understand.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:27.840
And the fact is, like any growing,
emerging product,

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.240
the more patents that come into
a license don't make it less

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.700
valuable to each patent holder.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.290
They make it more valuable to each
patent holder because the product,

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.880
the licensing product,
is that much more acceptable

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.340
to the market at large.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.690
More users, more royalties,
more implementation,

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.620
and therefore more success.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.490
When they come in,
they are added at no additional royalty

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.210
during the current term of the license.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:56.640
MPEG-4 License, who owns these creatures
that we're talking about?

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.500
Who owns these patents that
have been found essential by

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.970
an independent patent expert?

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.470
This is the current list.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.490
There are others in the
evaluation pipeline.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.550
I'm not at liberty to say whether
they own a central property or not.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:17.000
The balls and strikes, as we call it,
are called by an independent umpire.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.050
That will determine the extent to
which other patent owners are included.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.630
But currently, there are 20 companies.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.880
Their promise to MPEG LA,
and by implication to you,

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.780
is that all of their essential
intellectual property will be included.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:39.070
That's the list, and of course it's also
available on our website,

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.230
in this case, mpegla.com.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.880
and then go to the MPEG-4
button which appears below,

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:49.020
MPEG-4 visual button which appears below,
and they will be arrayed there as well,

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.470
as will the current

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.700
portfolio of essential
patents that they own.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.900
This program is new.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:04.140
So, just like in the MPEG-2 program,
at the initial part,

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.240
the numbers of patents are fewer.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.320
But we have every reason to believe
that with this many patent holders,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:15.240
who are known for owning
patents worldwide,

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.680
that it will increase substantially
over the term of the program.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:24.340
We are still only in our first eight
months of offering the license.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.590
The license has been
called variously complex.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:38.080
I'm trying to prove that that is not so.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:45.280
This is what you need to know
about the license on one slide.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.740
And by the way,
let me speak to the complexity

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.320
before we go to this.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.500
What is perceived as complexity, well,
first of all,

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.780
licensing is a--tends to be a
one-on-one discussion in education.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:00.980
It's our business.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.920
And I don't mean it's our business
like you can't get into it.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.860
I mean, it's our business to deal with
our customers on a daily basis,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.600
which we do.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.810
We probably respond to, I mean,
I haven't taken a recent estimate,

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:17.220
but it could be as many as 1,000 emails
a week asking particular questions about

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.770
this license and our other licenses.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.870
And people share with us information
about their specific implementations

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.550
and their specific business models,
and we work with them to understand

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.000
how the license will apply to them.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.510
In some cases, there may be some quirks,
and we try to work with them

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.410
to make the license fit within
the limits of our authority.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.600
When we get a situation where we believe,
and by the way,

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.640
we're fairly inflexible in terms of,
because the whole key here is to

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.490
have a non-discriminatory license.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.550
So we don't make separate
deals with anybody.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.360
We have to assure ourselves that the
same license will be applied on a

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.830
non-discriminatory basis to everyone.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.440
So when we answer these quirky
implementation questions,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.740
we're very careful to stick to the
absolute principles of the license.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.050
And we're very mindful not
to do anything for one that

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:12.730
we wouldn't do for everybody.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.080
So what we'll do for one,
we would do for everybody.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.710
And these questions...

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.920
Sometimes tax that consistency.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.520
We have to be very careful.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:29.110
And we take that as a very strong creed
for us that we must be very careful,

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.260
and we are.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.520
If we see, though,
that there's something developing in the

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.770
marketplace that is not just a one-of,
that is widespread,

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.570
and that is really bothering users.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.770
It's something often that we
will take to the patent holders

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:48.890
and discuss as a possibility for
a need to change the license.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.790
MPEG-2,
we made a significant change early on.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:58.860
Actually, it took us a couple years to
accommodate the DVD/DISC market.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.590
When we went out,
we found that the royalties which

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.150
the patent holders had determined
were frankly not ready for prime

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:11.480
time when it came to enlisting
disk replicators to the license.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:17.100
And we worked with some major disk
replicators to understand their

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.270
business model more thoroughly,
recommended a change

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.950
to the patent holders,
which was approved,

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.250
and then made those changes
available to the market at large.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.660
And now today we have what we
estimate to be 85% compliance

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.000
by the replication industry.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.810
So we are not adverse to change.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:39.500
But on the other hand,
licenses like this have to

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:44.690
be administered in a fairly,
well, absolute non-discriminatory manner.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.680
And it is the only product we offer.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.990
We're not going to make different
licenses for different parties.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.990
So, long way of saying,
what about this complexity issue?

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.810
Complexity came from a very
well-intentioned thing,

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.110
which was to try to accommodate different
business models in this license where

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:07.870
the patent holders thought and still
believe there are significant differences

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.160
in the way people do business.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:14.330
So it does have different gradations,
different models for Internet and

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:19.410
mobile and what we call unique use,
which refers to cable and satellite.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:24.180
and for what we call stored video,
which refers to packaged media or

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:29.910
electronic transmissions of what
I would call DVD equivalent videos.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.330
And we work with some content
providers to try to understand their

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.870
business models before issuing the
license in order to make that happen.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.070
Now this isn't, in all cases,
ready to wear material, as they say.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.530
Not ready, off the shelf,
go out to the market.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.090
We've taken it off the shelf,
and the good news is

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.300
that people talk to us.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.060
They tell us their business models,
and we work with them very carefully.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.530
Recently, once again,
I don't know if you've seen this,

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.520
but there's been news of concern
among Japanese broadcasters who wish

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.900
to do a mobile broadcast service,
mobile service.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.360
And there's been some concern
among mobile content providers.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.780
And we are working with
them very carefully.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:16.740
And we are finding that in many cases,
the distance between us was really

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.450
to be educated on the terms of
the license and how they would

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.020
apply to their business model.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.880
And we believe that those
objections will be overcome.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.570
Not unlike any sales business,
you have to meet the user

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.060
and overcome the objections.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.150
That's the test here.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.700
One size fits all,
but it may not answer all questions.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.900
But if it's done right,
it can be adjusted for change,

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.920
or it can be worked to work
with individual business models.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.860
All right, the summary.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.380
Here's the way the license works.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.050
Generally in patent rights,
you have what are called a right to make,

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.170
a right to sell, and a right to use.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.400
and I'm sure people can
divide them in other ways,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.570
but I'm just keeping it simple.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:04.570
Make, sell and use.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.550
So the way the license is constructed
for MPEG-4 Visual is that manufacturers

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.440
pay royalties for the right to make
and sell decoders and encoders.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.590
That responsibility falls upon them.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.000
Who is a manufacturer?

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:21.540
A manufacturer would be the
end supplier of a product.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:28.410
a manufacturer of a DVD player,
the one whose brand name appears on it.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.930
In the internet and PC area,
it would be the fully functioning,

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.150
the manufacturer of the
fully functioning product.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.800
It would be someone who provides
the fully functioning software

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:49.100
that then gets downloaded,
for example, to a PC for further use.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.400
They pay royalties for the right to
make and sell the decoders and encoders.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.810
Now what's included in that
right to make and sell,

00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:00.490
beyond the right to just simply
manufacture it and sell it,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.910
is that the decoder and encoder
may be used for personal use.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.720
No limitation.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:14.000
And also, it may be used for what we call
end-user to end-user communications.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.300
Those are all covered as part
of the manufacturer's license.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:23.080
So if an encoder and a
decoder appear in a handset,

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.080
cell phone, mobile phone,

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.400
The encoders and decoders may
be used for people to send video

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.560
to each other and to communicate
with each other on a personal,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.970
private level.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:39.390
No additional royalty is
required for doing that.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.640
That is part of the
manufacturer's license.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.790
Similarly, on a PC.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.280
Whether it doesn't have to be mobile,
it could be on a PC.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.700
End-user to end-user
communications are included.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.290
If people are IMing each other, videos,
personal videos, family videos,

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.940
whatever it might be,
they're making some video creation,

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.750
that's included in the license
that the manufacturer pays.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:07.930
Even though a mobile provider may collect
money on a minute-by-minute basis for

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.730
the time that the end users spend online,

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.390
While they make their end-user to
end-user personal communications,

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.830
that is still covered under
this manufacturer's license.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:19.890
No additional royalty.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.100
That's not considered the remuneration,
which we're going to

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.490
talk about in a moment.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:32.780
Video providers, third bullet,
do not pay royalties unless MPEG-4 visual

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:37.140
material is provided for remuneration.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.120
What does that mean?

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.960
Basically, all use is okay.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.340
At the point where you are remunerated as
a video provider for offering the video,

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.850
then an additional royalty is paid.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.400
The remuneration may
be direct or indirect.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:44:00.840
It can be a subscription,
it could be a per minute charge for video

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.980
that's offered generally to the public.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.830
It could be advertising supported,
but it does not include

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.010
self-advertising or promotion.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:16.240
So,
Apple puts MPEG-4 video on its website

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.890
in order to promote its self-image
and its products and draw you to

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.480
the website with items of value.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.260
They're not paid for
including that video.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:31.070
They just offer it as a service to
you and as entertainment for you.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.990
That's part of
self-advertising and promotion.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.030
Not remuneration, no royalty,
even though it may sell

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.590
their own products.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.430
If the only remuneration is that
from selling their own products,

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:44.380
that's okay.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.840
That's included.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.330
Let me put it this way,
that gets into technicality.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:52.380
There is no additional royalty required,
and the patent holders are not

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.180
looking to bring legal actions against
people who engage in that activity.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.830
Fourth bullet,
if MPEG-4 visual material is

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:06.000
provided for remuneration,
then video providers pay

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.690
royalties for the right to
use the decoders and encoders.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.630
So this is the only
case where a use right,

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.910
remember make, sell, and use.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:19.950
And the make and sell is included
in the manufacturer's royalty.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.680
Use is included in the manufacturer's
royalty for certain limited purposes,

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.830
including personal use and end-user
to end-user communications.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.880
But where the video provider goes off
and offers its video for remuneration,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.470
then there is a separate
use right required.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.000
And that's where the video provider pays.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.080
That's the license in a nutshell.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:48.600
Manufacturers pay in the model royalties
for the right to make and sell.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.480
It includes certain uses.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.600
If a video provider uses the encoders
and decoders for remuneration,

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.890
additional royalties are paid.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.140
Otherwise, no.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.140
Okay, why is it structured this way?

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.390
What does this have to do with
the real world flow of commerce?

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.010
Why is it different from other
licenses that patent holders

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.470
have engaged in over the years?

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.090
And it is different in some respects,
certainly, as you can see.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:24.160
This reflects the attempt by the patent
holders to align with what we call the

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.180
real-world flow of MPEG-4 commerce.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:32.440
It was their belief that they put too
heavy of a royalty on the manufacturer.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:37.280
More than a nominal royalty
on the manufacturer,

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.990
that it would chill the
market and would not allow the

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.980
promoters of this technology
to offer the technology widely.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.240
So they did not want to put it all there.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.900
And in many cases,
especially with MPEG-4,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.010
which of course is in QuickTime, they

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.870
The technology is such that
decoders and encoders will

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.830
often be given away for free.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:03.100
They'll often be given out widely
in order to get the most massive

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.060
distribution for the technology.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:11.100
So the patent holders wanted
to assess the royalties mostly

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.500
where value is received.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.220
In other words,
those who can afford to pay should pay.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.850
And if the manufacturer is not
realizing the bulk of the revenue here,

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.920
the entire burden should not be on them.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.160
It should be assessed where a
video provider who is making money

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:32.770
can afford to build the royalty
charge into their business model.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.010
That's the concept.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.480
So, in this case,
royalty follows revenue.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.500
Royalty follows remuneration in terms of
the additional royalty that's required

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.550
over and above what I think is a very
nominal and reasonable royalty in

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:50.190
the marketplace for the manufacturer.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:56.110
Also, the license has as an objective,
as I said earlier,

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.910
and this is the source of some of
the complexity which people perceive,

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.850
that it is to be used across
different business models.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.010
And in certain cases,
different business models require

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.940
different royalty formations.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.810
For example,
in the case of what we call unique use,

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.530
which is a cable or satellite,
traditional cable or satellite,

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.660
conditionally accessed communication.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.520
There is a use royalty that
is paid one time upfront.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.330
It's equivalent to about five years'
worth of royalties that would be paid

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:31.100
by an internet or mobile provider
over the course of five years.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.900
But it's a one-time
upfront payment of $1.25.

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.230
We'll get to those
particulars in a minute.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.030
As a result of the market
discussion that took place

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:44.760
following the QuickTime conference,
the patent holders also understood

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.340
the need to provide caps.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:49.210
And in some cases,
there was not a direct connection

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.600
between the amount of usage
and the revenue realized.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.870
In fact, there might be a great
disconnect between the two.

00:48:56.210 --> 00:49:00.090
So they said, okay,
we should provide caps so that there's

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:06.390
a limitation on any royalty burden
that may attach to a video provider.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.060
And so when we look further
at the details here,

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:12.090
we'll see that there are
caps built into this model.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:18.120
Similarly, the patent holders understood,
at MPEG LA's direction,

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:22.770
that often the biggest
development in this area

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:27.160
starts with early stage adopters,
not unlike yourselves,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.070
who use this technology
in ingenious ways,

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.220
in clever,
creative ways that would not be possible,

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.810
frankly, in the halls of a big company.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.680
Some of you may be from big companies,
my apologies.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.690
But often the best way to get a
technology to be widely used and

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:47.920
widely implemented and to foster many
creativity -- many creative solutions

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.940
is to get it in the hands of many users
and have them develop and show the way.

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.140
So into this license are built
threshold levels below which no

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.110
royalties are payable at all.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:04.080
In the manufacturer's case, for example,
there are no royalties for the

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.680
first 50,000 decoders and first
50,000 encoders each year.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.960
In the video provider case,
if someone has a service that goes out

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:19.200
to 50,000 or fewer subscribers in a year,
there is no royalty charge.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:23.730
So even though you may be remunerated,
for the first 50,000 subscribers,

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:29.480
any remuneration you receive
is not charged a royalty.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.620
This was built into this also.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:36.990
And the hope, of course,
is that small users become large users.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:40.940
But initially,
we should minimize the impact

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.130
so that the market can build.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:46.850
And finally,
you'll see in the detail that there

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:52.730
are some alternative royalty options,
some requiring no royalty reports at all.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.230
Again,
to minimize the burden on users from

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.580
having to fill out very difficult forms.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.100
Well,
actually they're not very difficult,

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.310
but to have to even report
and record usage when their

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.340
usage is at a very low level.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:11.440
And in some cases, for big companies,
instead of having to catch all that data,

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.320
they have the option of a
lump sum payment so they don't

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.500
have to actually record things
on a minute-by-minute basis.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.910
Okay, let's look at the manufacturer's
part of the license first,

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.090
down to the detail level now.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:33.600
I said that a manufacturer pays royalties
for the right to make and sell a decoder,

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.620
an encoder.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.270
It's the end product in most cases.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:41.040
It's the fully functioning product
in the Internet and PC case.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.860
We talked about the fact that there
are different business models that

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.710
are encompassed by the license,
which may be the source of some

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:54.370
people's feeling that there's some
complexity that is difficult to swallow.

00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:01.020
This is an example of where
a decoder or encoder software

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.320
is provided for a computer.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.900
The manufacturer who would pay
the royalty here would be the

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.440
company that provides the software,
the fully functioning software

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.230
that is downloaded to the computer.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:15.540
So just because I show a computer there,
it was difficult for me to

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.030
make a picture of software.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:22.850
So I used a computer instead,
which is utilizing this software.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.040
And indicated are several,
four out of the five,

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.180
business models covered by this license.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.280
And they're indicated to show one thing.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:38.060
If the decoder and encoder is usable
across all four of those business models,

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:41.340
or three, or two, or one,
and all of them are

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:45.520
sub-licensed in one decoder,
the manufacturer does not

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.870
pay the royalty four times.

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.940
The manufacturer pays the royalty once.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.750
So for a single licensed product,
there is only one royalty,

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:57.030
and that royalty on a
decoder is 25 cents.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:01.160
And that royalty on an
encoder is 25 cents.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.960
And the one product, as I just said,
can be licensed across one or more

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:14.270
of the sublicense categories which
address different business models.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.130
Once again,
it's to encourage manufacturers

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:20.740
to make this stuff,
not get into too much complication when

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:25.050
it comes to limitations on the use,
potential use,

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.800
of their decoders and encoders.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:32.980
The decoder royalties at 25 cents
per unit and the encoder royalties

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:39.510
at 25 cents per unit are each subject
to a $1 million annual limitation.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:48.630
So a company making decoders and
encoders would never pay more than

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:54.020
$2 million annually for the right to
produce these decoders and encoders.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:54:00.230
The first 50,000 units of decoders,
there is no royalty at all.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:04.020
and the first 50,000 units of encoders,
there is no royalty at all.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.950
That's available, by the way,
just to be clear for the record.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.100
That's available to one legal
entity in an enterprise.

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.070
So we don't let,
if there's a conglomerate and

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:17.970
there's multiple legal entities,
the threshold's available only

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:19.690
once to one legal entity each year.

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.290
But for most people,
this will cover the issue because

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:27.280
the manufacturing is generally
done in a central place or

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:29.010
under only one legal entity.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.580
And when that's done,
the first 50,000 units,

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.120
both of decoders and encoders,
are exempt from royalty.

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:39.480
The manufacturer still signs the license,
but they report zero royalty on

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.510
the first 50,000 units of each.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.200
That's the manufacturer.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.910
Just to show you the manufacturer
in a handset setting.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.210
Once again,
the market is changing rapidly,

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.840
so PCs and handsets and
PDAs all start to merge.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.230
But for sake of understanding,
it's the same result.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.630
A handset might receive internet video,
it might receive mobile video.

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:06.060
The decoder that's in
there is used for both.

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.670
So only one royalty
applies to the decoder,

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:12.480
only one royalty applies to the encoder,
25 cents each.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.500
Again,
the million dollar caps for decoder,

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:18.380
million dollar caps for
encoders annually apply,

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.900
and the 50,000 unit
thresholds also apply,

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.000
below which no royalties are payable.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:30.790
This illustration also
shows that the right,

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:30.790
the left, the right, the left, the right,
the

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:46.800
[Transcript missing]

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:49.370
Let's look at the video
provider situation.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:53.030
Now remember, this is only a situation
where somebody is making money

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:54.680
offering the MPEG-4 video.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.900
Otherwise, no royalties are payable
under this license.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.550
So this...

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.560
License, this illustration, excuse me,
shows different examples,

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.140
different sources of video
being provided to a computer.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.940
and in each case,
it is the provider of that video,

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:17.210
if they are charging remuneration,
if they are being remunerated,

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.290
who would pay the royalties.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.020
There are three choices for them.

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:27.670
They can pay 25 cents
per subscriber per year.

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.840
So if they have a subscriber
for one day or if they have

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.760
a subscriber for one year,
25 cents for the subscriber.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.800
It doesn't matter how little or much they
use the service in a period of a year.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.640
One subscriber is charged one
royalty to the video provider.

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:47.900
Alternatively, they may meter it based
upon actual usage.

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:54.340
And this long set of numbers comes out
to about two cents an hour for each use.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.810
And the third alternative,
if they want to avoid all reporting

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.560
and they know they're going to have
enormous usage and enormous remuneration,

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.340
they can choose a lump sum option.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:11.020
which is the $1 million annual
fee for their video provider

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:13.530
service per legal entity.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.390
Again, this is subject to a 50,000
annual subscriber threshold,

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:20.210
below which no royalties are paid.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.660
And you see the same example played
out in the handset situation.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.240
It does not differ.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:32.840
Whether it's mobile or internet,
the consequences are the same.

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:37.380
As I may have mentioned earlier,
unique use cable satellite is subject to

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.310
a paid up amount per decoder and encoder,
which allows use in that

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.910
connection at $1.25 per unit.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:50.000
Stored video is a separate category.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.730
Stored video,
when we're talking stored video,

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:57.100
we're normally talking a DVD disk,
or DVD disk-like, I should say.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:00.040
Physical media with data on it.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.990
Or an electronic download or electronic
streaming of something that is

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:11.320
stored or storable or usable for
a minimum of 20 plays in 365 days.

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.080
Something that is really
permanent to the user and resides

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.670
on its desktop and is sold,
important,

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.900
sold on a title-by-title basis.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.480
So if it's not sold on
a title-by-title basis,

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:25.370
then it's not subject to
the stored video rates.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.990
And the idea here is simply
that where it is made available,

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.000
sold on a title-by-title basis,

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:38.010
The transaction,
the sale of that stored video is

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:42.280
able to carry the royalty in that
transaction because it stands on its

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.560
own and is basically economically
independent as a unit of commerce.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.320
But it must meet those qualifications
to be considered stored video.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:57.310
Otherwise, it's part of the Internet and
mobile video coverage.

00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:03.260
Finally, as we've said before,
everybody pays the same royalty rates.

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:07.130
So a big company is not treated
better than a small company.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.880
Patent holder is not treated better
than a non-patent holder user.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.870
Everybody's treated the same.

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.980
Licensee data is
protected as confidential.

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.640
This is important.

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.690
It may not be so important
to the users in this room,

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:29.190
but it's important to people like
Apple and others who do not want,

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:33.170
I think in most cases,
their sales information shared with

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.550
the patent holders in this program.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.880
We don't do that.

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:40.130
We maintain the confidentiality
of that information.

00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:44.490
When royalties are paid out to them,
it is paid out in the aggregate.

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:49.010
It is not broken down by user,
by licensee, and so they do not know the

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.910
specific sales information
of particular licensees.

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:57.800
And finally, there's what we call a
grant-back provision.

00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.060
It's not a grant-back to us.

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:03.240
It's a grant-back for the
benefit of any licensee.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:08.910
It would be unfair if a licensee
took advantage of this license

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:14.990
But itself held an essential patent,
got all the rights on this license,

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:18.890
and then itself held an essential
patent which it denied to every other

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:23.090
licensee or every other licensor who
had made its intellectual property

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:26.060
available in this arrangement.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:30.660
So what the license requires is
that if you take this license,

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:36.710
Then you must also license any
essential intellectual property that

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:41.680
you own to all other licensees and
licensors on fair and reasonable terms.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:46.380
So it forces the marketplace
to collectively look and take

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.400
advantage of and be able to
use any essential intellectual

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.010
property which may be out there.

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:57.240
I would note one other thing.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.320
In order to spur early adoption,
the license has also

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.680
provided for a grace period,
so no royalties would be payable on

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.270
products through the end of this year.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:22.710
December 31, 2003.

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.710
Give people a chance to get used to it,
get people a chance to understand the

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.710
license terms and how they apply and
gear up for reporting and so forth.

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.710
And that's an important element as well.
