00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.110
Hi, my name is Joseph,
and I'm going to be taking

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.300
you through basically what's
new with Final Cut Pro 4.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.300
Another quick show of hands,
the lights are down,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.300
but how many people here were at NAB?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
Just a few of you, excellent.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370
Okay,
so for those of you that are at NAB,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.300
you may have seen me do this
presentation on the main theater there,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.380
but that was, of course, a very short,
about maybe 12 minutes total of this

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.300
same demo content that I'm now going
to be running about an hour through.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.310
This actual demo is about
two hours in length,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.300
so I'm going to be cutting it down
in half from what it normally is.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.400
I'm also going to be kind
of moving a bit fast here,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.300
so if you have any
questions throughout it,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.270
feel free to call out.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.300
I cannot see you guys at all right now,
so if you do have questions, call out.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.290
If you raise your hands,
I'm not going to see you.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.100
But I don't mind you interrupting
me in the middle if you either don't

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.200
follow something I'm doing or just
want to take a quick branch off of it,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.300
that's fine by me.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.300
So, with that, we're just going to go
ahead and get started.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
This is, of course, Final Cut Pro 4.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
I'm going to be building the sequence
that you see on the bottom there,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.300
and what I'm going to do to
start is just play this through,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300
and then I'm going to start with a quick
tour of the Final Cut Pro interface.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.770
Jump into some very basic editing tools,
just editing tips,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.300
just for those of you who may not be
really familiar with Final Cut yet,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.300
and then we'll get into the new stuff.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.070
So, off the bat,
we'll go ahead and play the project

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.300
that I'm going to be building.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.700
Santa Cruz Bikes stands
for innovation and quality.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.350
Our goal is to deliver the
most technologically advanced,

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.700
customizable bike in the
shortest period of time.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.270
I want this product that I'm making
to be the best thing there is.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.240
Alright, so that's what we're
going to be building.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.600
So first off, a very quick tour of the
Final Cut Pro interface.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.500
I'm going to start in
the top left corner here.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.240
This is the browser.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.600
Now the browser is where
all of my media is stored.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.390
So any video clips that
I've captured or imported,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.340
any CG, any graphics,
any Photoshop files, any audio files,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.740
etc.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.090
that I've brought into the
application are stored in here.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.980
Now we have various views in here,
like list views and icon views.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.610
We can, with contextual menus,
just change the view into

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.100
icon view or list view,
open up the windows just

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.750
like you would in the finder.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.900
Within here, I can, of course,
create new folders.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.860
In Final Cut Pro, they're called bins,
store media inside of those bins,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.610
and so on.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.200
Over on the next window,
this is the viewer.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350
The viewer is where I make
my editing decisions.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.810
So any clip that I've opened from the
browser is going to open into the viewer.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.650
And from the viewer,
I choose what portion of

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.530
that clip I want to use.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.800
So for example,
if I shot 20 seconds of video,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.760
but I only want 5 seconds of it,
I would go in here,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.250
mark what's called an in point
and an out point to define the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.280
start and the finish of the clip,
and then add that to the project.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.080
On the right-hand side here,
we have the canvas.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.550
The canvas is the actual final
movie that we're creating.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.500
So this is the final
project that you'll view.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.480
Also, the canvas is where I do a
lot of my motion compositing.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.710
So any clicking and dragging to
resize various video elements,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.400
reposition them, and so on,
I would do in the canvas.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.500
Finally, on the bottom,
we have the timeline.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.920
Timeline, of course,
is the linear representation of

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.320
the movie that we're creating.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.050
And then on the right side,
there's a tool palette and

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.640
the audio level meters.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.440
So with that,
I'm going to go ahead and open

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.740
up the start of this project.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.850
We have one clip already
on here with an audio clip,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.400
just a piece that I've started.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.160
And I'm going to go ahead and open
up the first piece of video here,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.120
mark an in point and out point,
and then add it to the project.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.800
Just so you can see some of the basics.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.620
I notice there's a lot
of people standing.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.800
There are some seats up in here.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.310
If you guys want to just come in
here and squeeze in and sit down.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.600
[Transcript missing]

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.650
Alright, so anyway, as I was saying,
I'm going to mark an in point

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.700
and an out point on this clip
and then add it to the project.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.810
I can scrub through here and just
kind of choose any point at random.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.700
I've actually cheated.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.700
I've laid down a marker so I know exactly
where I want to put that in point.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.700
So I put the playhead where
I want to create the in point.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.100
And with Final Cut Pro,
you'll find that you have usually two,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.700
three, four, sometimes even more ways of
doing the exact same action.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.150
It's a very user-friendly
application in that you can find

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.660
whatever's comfortable for you.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.810
So, for example,
if you like to use buttons,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.640
we have on here a button on the
interface to mark an in point.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.960
I simply click on that,
and if I forget what the button is,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.680
you'll notice I hover the mouse over it.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.410
It gives a little tool pop-up telling me,
"Mark in." Click on that,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.620
and it marks the in point.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.560
And that in point is now
defined on that clip.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.700
Now, I want this piece to be
exactly one second long.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.700
One second is 30 frames in video.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.410
I've already marked my first point,
so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.670
and type on the keyboard,
"+29." And you'll notice in

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.170
this little window up here,
it's recorded in "+29." Hit return,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.700
and that moves forward 29 frames.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.520
When I hit an out point between the two,
that means that I have a total of

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.700
30 frames or one second of video.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.170
And you'll see this window here
telling me that I have a one second

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.700
video clip that I've just created.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.700
Now, to add this one second clip
of video to my project,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.660
I can drag and drop this onto the canvas.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.670
The canvas pops up something
called an overlay menu.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.160
The overlay gives me a few
different options of how I want to

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.700
apply this video to the project.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.530
Now, the default is overwrite.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.640
I can go over here and
choose any of these others.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.690
But for now, I'm just going to do a
simple overwrite edit.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.480
So,
I just go ahead and let go of the mouse.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.700
And it overwrites that video clip.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.700
And if you look down
here on the timeline,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.700
you'll see that that
clip has just been added.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.700
If I undo that and then redo it,
you'll see the effect that was added.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.580
That clip has been
added onto the project.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.330
So, if I play this through,
we now have the video that was there

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.660
before with the video that I just added.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.700
Our goal is to deliver the most
technological... Pretty simple.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.700
Okay, so now another edit.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.700
Something a little bit more advanced.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.680
I'm going to open up another clip.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.660
And this one, I already have the in and
the out points marked.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.700
So, you've just seen me do those before,
so I've already set this up.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.500
What I want to do here is an insert edit.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.810
The overwrite edit previously,
if I laid an overwrite edit,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.700
any video that was there
would get overwritten.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.610
Hence the name overwrite edit.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.810
Insert edit would push any video
that's there out of the way to

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.700
make room for the incoming footage.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.700
So, what I'm going to do is drag the
playhead back between these two clips.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.020
With this clip here chosen,
I'm going to go ahead and drag it

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.690
onto the viewer and choose insert.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.640
Now, when I do,
you'll notice that it pushed

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.700
the video out of the way,
but it also cut the audio

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.690
and moved it out of the way.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.690
I don't want to do that.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.700
I want to keep that audio intact.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.460
So, I'm going to undo that.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.680
I'm going to go ahead and
lock my audio to the back.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.700
I'm going to put my tracks in place.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.700
And then once again,
choose an insert edit.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.700
And that inserts the video,
pushing that video out of the way,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.690
leaving the audio intact because
I locked those two tracks there.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.700
So, I can go ahead and unlock those
now and I'm back in business.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.700
So, it's a quick overwrite edit
and a quick insert edit.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.590
Now that I have these pieces on here,
I'm going to show you the first

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.700
big new feature in Final Cut Pro 4.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.670
And that is multi-item properties.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.750
Now, for those of you who have worked
with Final Cut Pro before,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.700
you know that you could select a clip.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.790
And either from the menu,
choose item properties or

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.640
hit the keyboard shortcut,
command 9, to choose item properties.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.630
It would tell you
everything about that clip.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.700
Its compression codec, its data rate,
its size, its location on the hard drive,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.700
everything you would
want to know about it.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.700
If you wanted to compare multiple clips,
you had to open one, look at it,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.100
maybe take some notes as to what it was,
close it,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.700
repeat the process for another clip,
and then compare them.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.700
Well, now with Final Cut Pro 4,
I can select as many clips as I want.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.540
I'll hit command 9 to bring
up the item properties window.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.600
"It's a nice one, isn't it?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.300
Oh, we're just getting started." And that
shows me all four of those clips.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.300
And you'll notice here it has
all the information across.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.270
You'll notice that some of the text is
gray and some of it is black or bold.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.300
Basically what happens is
you read this left to right,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.240
any time there's a change in the data,
it becomes bold.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.300
So by looking at this,
I can see that--let's see here.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.230
If I look at composite mode,
I'll start from the bottom.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.060
They're all set to normal.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.460
So the first one is normal,
and all the rest are normal.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.300
They're all gray.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.300
But if I go up to, let's say,
the compressor, the first one is none,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.300
the next one animation.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.270
So that's different.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.300
Therefore, it's highlighted in black.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.290
The next one is DVC Pro and TSC.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.290
Once again, it's different,
so it's highlighted in black.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.300
The one after that is the
same as the one before,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.240
so it is gray.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.790
So I can very quickly go through here
and see what matches versus what doesn't.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.900
I'm going to cancel out of that.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.120
All right, now let's start doing a
little bit more editing.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.980
I'm going to open up
another clip on here,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.040
and I'm just going to drag this
to the timeline to add it on.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.400
Just simply drag and
drop this into place.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.300
And if I play this through,
you'll see it's about two

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.500
seconds long of this video clip.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.900
And the previous shots
were about one second each,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.200
so this is a little bit on the long side.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.390
I'm going to turn off audio
scrubbing real quick here.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.700
There we go.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.190
So anyway, so that was too long.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200
So what I want to do is shorten that up.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.700
Now, you all know that we have
a speed change command.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.700
I can select that tool,
hit the Control key,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.700
and choose the contextual menu,
and choose the speed command.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.630
And I'm going to go up to the duration,
and I'm going to type in one second.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.700
It's 196.67% speed change for a
total duration of one second long.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.200
Hit OK, and look at that.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200
It doesn't have to render.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.700
It is now a real-time effect.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.200
Now, for those of you who aren't
really familiar with real time,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.200
let me quickly explain
what we're looking at here.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.190
You'll notice above the clip here,
right where the mouse is pointing,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.700
there is a green bar there.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.200
That green render bar means
that it is a real-time effect,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.200
and real-time, of course,
means it doesn't have to render

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.660
before I can play it back to screen.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.200
If I go ahead and play that back,
you see that clip plays back

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.390
without any rendering required.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.940
It is dependent on CPU.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.800
The faster your processor,
the more you can do in real time.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.800
And you're going to see me expand
on this as we go through the demo,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800
and you'll see more and
more real time effects.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.800
Basically here, if that was red,
I would have to render it.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800
But again,
here it is now a real time effect,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.790
and that's new over version 3.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.210
So that's just a real quick
example of real-time capabilities.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.040
And before I move on to
show you more real-time,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.640
I want to show you other ways that
I could go about doing that same effect.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.910
You saw me do the contextual menu.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.740
Control-click on there and choose Speed.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.500
What if you don't remember
that you control-click,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.900
or you prefer to use keyboard
shortcuts or other ways?

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.440
Well, of course,
there's a keyboard shortcut for this.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.930
I can just hit that keyboard shortcut,
Command-J, to bring up the Speed command.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.860
Maybe you're not a keyboard
shortcut kind of guy.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.100
Maybe you really like buttons.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.950
I referenced that earlier,
being able to click on a

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.360
button on the interface.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.050
Thank you.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.540
Excuse me.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.380
Thank you.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:27.400
[Transcript missing]

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.250
Now let's go ahead and take that
button and drag it onto the interface.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.830
Close that,
select the clip that I want to change,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.860
click on the button,
and it opens up the speed command.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880
You like that, huh?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.850
I'm going to cancel that.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.840
I want to get rid of that button.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.340
We'll just drag it off
in a puff of smoke.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.400
See a little theme going here, huh?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.730
This whole OS X thing's working out,
isn't it?

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.790
So, buttons, commands is awesome.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.260
As you can see,
I'll bring up that dialogue again.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.750
Let's see here.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.900
Don't remember the keyboard shortcut.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.900
There it is.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.110
And as you can see, once again,
every command in here has

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.900
a button you can add to it.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.900
And you'll notice that I can
add buttons not just to here.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.900
Let's just go ahead and add
a few just for giggles here.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.900
I'll grab--drag and
drop a couple on here.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.750
You'll notice I can also
add them up to this window.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.900
I can add them to this window.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.900
I can add them to this window.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.840
Anywhere where there's
this empty space in there.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.900
We looked at the UI and said, "Oh,
there's wasted space.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.900
"What can we do with
it?" We can add buttons,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.880
and we're done.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.400
They will be saved, absolutely.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.480
They're saved when you quit.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.540
And you can also save main button bars.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.090
You can save these out as little files.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.600
You can take these files
with you to another computer,

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.590
load them in, load main button bars,
and load up your customized

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.630
button interface on someone
else's Final Cut Pro 4 system.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.060
So basically,
you know how if you have too

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.190
many projects open and once these
tabs get smaller and smaller,

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.350
the tabs continue to shrink?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400
That's basically what happens.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.400
So it'll force space for
those button bars right there.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.400
Okay, so there's another way of
customizing your interface for you.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.810
While I'm talking about that,
I want to show you another great

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.400
new customization feature in here.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.180
Adding buttons is great.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.400
What about keyboard shortcuts?

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.400
What was the keyboard
shortcut again for that clip?

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:32.300
[Transcript missing]

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.800
Let's go ahead and bring up the brand
new Keyboard Layout Customization Tool.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.800
We now have a fully customizable
keyboard for Final Cut Pro.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.380
How many people have used NavVid before?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.410
There are a number of people out there.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.410
Customizable keyboard.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.490
Pretty common on there, right?

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.300
You can map the control key,
the shift key, and the option key,

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.500
and that's kind of it.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.360
Well, if you look across the
top of this window here,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.410
you'll notice that I have, of course,
command, shift, option, control,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.020
shift command, command option,
control command, shift option,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.500
control option, control shift.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.010
I have, as you can see,
a lot of empty space in

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.340
here to add commands.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.460
Where was that speed command?

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.300
Let's go look for that again.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.340
Only two E's in speed.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.500
There we go.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.410
And let's say that I want to make that,
I'm just going to make it, what is this?

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:17.890
Where are we?

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.450
Control command 8.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.950
I'll take this,
drag and drop it onto control

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.500
command 8 right there.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.400
It shows my current keyboard shortcut
and the new one that I just added.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.320
Let's go ahead and close this window,
and I will hit control

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.890
command 8 on the keyboard,
and it brings that up.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.100
It is also still Command J, that's right.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.100
You want to do that?

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.970
Well, you can go back to the custom
keyboard layout and choose Reset.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.300
Oh, can you remove the Apple J?

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.830
Absolutely.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.100
So let's go here, where's Find Apple J?

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.970
Command J is right there.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.060
Let's just get rid of that guy.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.060
And it is now removed from Command J.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.040
So you can totally remap your keyboard.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.100
If you want to use an Avid-style layout,
you can.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.510
If you want to use a
Media 100-style layout,

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.100
you can.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.100
If you want to save these layouts,
move them to other systems, you can.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.950
If you want to save the hassle
of having to do this yourself and

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.430
simply import one that somebody else
created and post it on the Internet,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.100
you can.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.460
It's a totally customizable keyboard.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.750
You can save out your layouts and then
switch them on the fly as you like.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.300
That's a good question.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.300
I don't know.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.300
Michael, can you print the layout?

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:21.300
Do you know?

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.290
As a PDF?

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.300
Jeff says as a PDF.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:25.300
I don't know the answer to that.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.280
If I'm wrong, find him.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.300
Take a screenshot.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.300
Anyway, alright, moving on.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.280
We don't have time for this all day.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.300
Let's talk a little bit
more about real time.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.300
I have a few clips on here.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.300
I'm going to add a few more
clips to this timeline.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.250
Before I do, though,
I want to add another

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.300
pair of audio tracks.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.300
You'll notice that I have A1 and A2 here.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.300
Notice that my audio track here - this is
dialogue to go along with this interview

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.300
- is extending beyond my open video.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.300
If I bring in some video tracks
here that has audio with it,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.300
I'm going to end up overwriting my audio,
which I don't want to do.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
I'm going to create
two new tracks on here.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.300
You'll notice, once again,
some of this video does have audio to it.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.300
This is the video I'm about to add.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.300
I'm going to take my
targets here for A1 and A2,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.300
and I'm going to drag those down
to plug them into tracks A3 and A4.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.100
I'm then going to take all five
of these video clips and drag

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.300
and drop them into the timeline.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.160
Positioning them like so.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.300
See, I would have overwritten
that part right there.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.300
I didn't want to do that.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.300
I have these tracks on there.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.300
Now that my video is on there,
let's start adding a few filters to them.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.290
I'll play through a portion
of what I just added.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.090
In the shortest period of time.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.900
Okay, you'll notice here,
bicycles going left to right,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.910
right to left, left to right again.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.900
This guy doesn't really match,
I want to flop that,

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.100
so I'm going to take a flop filter,
drag and drop that on.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.170
It's a green bar,
it means it's real time.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.100
"Playing back without any
rendering." It's pretty good.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.840
I'm going to undo that.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.040
Flop filter is pretty easy.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.100
Let's try something a bit more complex,
like maybe a Gaussian Blur filter.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.100
Gaussian Blur starts off pretty light.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.520
Let's go ahead and open that.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.600
I just double-clicked on this
clip to open it to the viewer.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.070
Click on the Filters tab.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.010
It shows me the Gaussian Blur
filter that I added.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.100
Let's crank that up to
about a 17-pixel blur.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.590
You'll notice it's still green.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.060
"It still plays back in real
time." So that's pretty good.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.230
We're getting pretty good
with our real time here.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.760
We had that flop filter pretty easy,
the Gaussian Blur,

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.030
it's a bit more complicated.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.160
Let's do a color effect.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.160
I'll add a Sapia filter to this.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.500
Once again, it plays back in real time.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.080
It's not doing too bad here.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.990
I'm going to go ahead and take
that off and put my flop back.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.060
I kind of like that one.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.700
And just on the topic of real time,
I'm going to take a transition here,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.640
and add a transition
between these two clips,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.210
and play that back as well.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.580
So there is a fairly complex
transition added to this clip

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.310
that is now a real-time effect.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.020
So once again,
I've added all these things that

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.400
I've had to do no rendering.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.030
But that's still a pretty
basic level of real-time.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.090
So far, I've added one filter or one
transition to each clip and

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.470
it's played back in real-time.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.300
That's nice, but, you know,
kind of a big deal, right?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.900
Let's take a look at something
else called RT Extreme.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.830
I'm going to open up a clip here.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.860
I'm going to take this clip here,
which is just a

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.520
computer-generated graphic,
and I'm going to insert this

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.630
into the start of my project.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.880
So I'm going to go ahead and
choose the Insert command.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.150
It pushes this other
video out of the way,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.970
frees up space for the clip
that I just dropped in.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.180
And as you can see, no rendering,
so this is a DV codec clip.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.220
Play that back and you can
see what it looks like.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.800
I'm going to start by adding a color
corrector that's already been set up.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.080
So I drag and drop this on,
it switches to green,

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.150
so that color correction
has already been done,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.740
and it plays back, of course,
in real-time.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.620
I'll take a flop filter and add that on.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.620
Still plays back in real-time.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.820
Now, I didn't undo the previous one,
so I have the color correction

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.890
filter and the flop filter.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.830
Let's add a mirror filter on there.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.600
Still plays back in real time.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.500
I'll add an Invert Filter on there.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.320
Notice the render bar just went orange.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.730
Why did that go orange?

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.900
You've seen green render bars,
you've seen red render bars,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.110
but you've never seen orange render bars,
unless you saw this demo before,

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.550
and that's cheating.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.500
An orange render bar means that you
are now in the world of RT Extreme.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.370
What is RT Extreme?

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.300
Real-time extreme.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.100
RT Extreme is the next
generation of real-time support.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.490
You have over here an option, a new menu,
to choose between

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.090
Safe RT and Unlimited RT.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.600
Safe RT is essentially what you
had with Final Cut Pro version 3.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.400
If it can't play back at full
quality every single frame,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.500
it will not play back at all.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.590
By switching to Unlimited RT mode,
we're telling the software that we're

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.900
willing to sacrifice quality and
frames to get real-time playback.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.470
What we're asking the software
to do is pump as much information

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.290
as possible to the screen to
maintain real-time playback.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.800
And with that said, as I play this back,
you can see it's playing back

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.990
exactly as it was before.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.500
This may be an orange effect,
but you can't even tell.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.630
It's still playing back just fine.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.620
In fact, I'm going to take this
title 3D piece that I have,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.200
I'm going to add it on top of here.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.500
And notice if I just drag and drop it on,
it's too long.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.500
You can see the shadow on there.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.560
It's a bit too long to just
drop on top of this piece.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.150
So I'm going to go ahead and
choose the Superimpose command,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.620
which is going to automatically
trim that screen and turn that

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.400
to fit over the background.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.340
And once again,
it is still playing back in real-time.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.540
So I have a color corrector,
a flop filter, a mirror, a color invert,

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.410
and a title 3D all layered
on top of each other,

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.200
all playing back in real-time.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.500
Not bad, eh?

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.300
What's that?

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.300
What speed machine are you using?

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.300
This is a dual 1.4, G4.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.160
What's the speed of the machine?

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.130
I don't know.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.830
This is G4, Dual 1.4.2.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.890
The requirements for real time is the
same as what was in Final Cut Pro 3.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.860
Any G4 500 are better.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.860
Clearly, with the faster machine,
the dual processors,

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:28.860
you get more and more.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.900
So if you were to take the same project,
open it up on, say, a Dual 800,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.900
you would get--oh, I don't know,
I'm guessing here,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.420
but let's just say maybe
you could get to the mirror,

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.770
to the invert,
before it would go from orange to red.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.900
So there will be a threshold
where you will eventually

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.800
hit a non-real-time effect.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.760
You will exceed the
capabilities of that processor,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.370
put it on a faster machine,
and you're back to real time.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.440
The order of effects?

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.110
Not that I'm aware of, but hey,
I'm in marketing, so I don't know.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.420
Okay, alright, so that's the title,
and that is clearly a

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.940
Hollywood award-winning
title right there,

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.530
wouldn't you say?

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.430
So, this is a chance for me to talk
about another new application,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.430
an entirely new app that
ships with Final Cut Pro 4,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.140
and that is called LiveType.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.690
LiveType is nothing
short of unbelievable.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.800
So I'm going to give you a
very quick tour of LiveType,

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.260
because we just don't have
enough time to do everything.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.300
This is LiveType.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.320
Quick tour of the interface.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.700
It looks a little bit familiar.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.950
On the left side you have a canvas.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.820
Canvas is, of course, your working space.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.970
We have the inspector here,
which is kind of an

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.200
info palette gone wild.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.090
We have all the different information
about all of our pieces that we're going

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.620
to add that we can control in here.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.480
A media browser.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.280
I'm going to come right back to that.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.400
And then down on the bottom,
the timeline itself.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.530
So let's start with the media browser.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.200
I'm going to start by
looking at my fonts.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.450
As you can see, we have access to all of
our fonts in the system.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.190
So this is cool.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.180
Every font that we have,
we can just take anything from here.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.950
We can type in something.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.920
So let's just say LiveType.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.890
Go through here and choose a font.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.770
Find something kind of
nice looking in here.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:56.860
Let's see here.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.140
I know I have a good one.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:58.820
There we go.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.570
I'll choose Apply,
and it applies that font

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.650
to that text right there.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.400
A little hard to read.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.530
Let's go over here to Attributes really
quick and change the color of that.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.800
"Of course, I can go through here and
choose any other font,

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.440
hit apply, and apply that font to it.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:11.800
That's alright.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.750
This is just standard system fonts.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.790
We have something else in
here called live fonts.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.480
Live fonts are 32-bit animated
fonts with alpha channel that

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.010
are completely pre-built.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.110
All you have to do is choose
the one that you want,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.110
type in the characters that you want,
and you get this effect."

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.700
How many people use After Effects?

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.700
I've got to stop asking questions.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.700
I can't see people.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.700
A few of you.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.700
All right, cool.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.700
So you'll see that with tools like this,
you can save quite a bit of time.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.700
For those of you that
don't use After Effects,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.700
you're going to find that
you can do a lot more with

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.700
Type now than you could before.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:46.700
Now, that's cool.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.700
The live fonts are great,
but as you can see,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.690
there's not an infinite number of these.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.700
There's a fairly, you know,
robust amount here,

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.520
but not thousands and thousands of them.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.700
So what about really
customizable effects,

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.700
taking text and doing things
completely and totally original?

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.700
Well, you can have the Effects tab.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.700
The Effects tab,
I'm going to go up to the top on here,

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.700
gives you all these amazing text
effects that you can simply double-click

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.700
to apply to any block of text.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.100
All the animation work
has been done for you.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.600
All you need to do is take
one of these and add it on.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.170
You see we have lots of
different categories in here.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.900
Some pretty cool ones.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.680
Let's find some really fun ones in here.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:25.730
Various scrolls.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.110
You can do title crawls,
lower third crawls, zooms.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.600
Here's one of my favorites here.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.000
Behind Camera, right there.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.810
I really like that effect,
so I want to apply that to

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.500
my LiveType text on here.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.180
So I'll simply click on Apply.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.080
You notice that it adds a new
track to my timeline here.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.610
I'm going to shorten up
my render space on here.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.050
You'll notice this little instant
preview window up here showing me

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.600
what's going to happen to my type.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.800
I click on Play, and it's going to very
quickly cache that to RAM,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.360
and then play it back
looping in real time,

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.420
the effect that I just added.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.690
That's it.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.450
That's all there is to it.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.620
This effect is now done.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.700
I can render this out as a 32-bit
animation file with Alpha Channel,

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.690
drop this back into Final Cut Pro,
put it over whatever video I like.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.690
I can also import video from
Final Cut Pro or from any other source,

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.670
use that as a background,
and export out an entire

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.700
final rendered comp,
if I so prefer.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.700
So this is a pretty basic look at it.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.700
Let me open up something
that's a bit more complex.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.630
It's already been done.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.700
Let's see here.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.700
I have a lower third sample in here.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.490
I'm gonna play this.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.700
As you can see,
it's a combination of background effects,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.700
two different layers of text on there.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.770
There's multiple effects applied,
and if I actually go to

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.690
this Santa Cruz title here,
you'll see this top layer here,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.700
the piece that says Santa Cruz, has one,
two, three, four,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.660
five different effects applied
to it to give it this look,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.700
to give it this appearance.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.700
It's a simple case of
choosing the effect you like,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.690
double-clicking to add it on.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.700
You can reposition it.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.610
You can see the effects
are spread out on here.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.700
I have this rush hour and
behind-camera combined.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.540
Then the text just sits there for a bit,
and then this glow happens,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.440
and the text sits there for a bit,
and then the zoom and the vertical

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.700
blur happen as the text goes offscreen.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.630
So, full screen effects like that,
or lower thirds like this one here.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.970
And as you can see,
text is taking up a whole

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.510
new space right now.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.450
You can do some pretty amazing things
with very little time and very little

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.420
effort to bring back into Final Cut Pro.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.900
and I believe it's 99,
just like Final Cut Pro is,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.890
but don't quote me on that.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.790
How do you get the background in?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.140
Just import, play a spec on,
and just bring in any QuickTime movie.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.390
This is format and
resolution independent.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.560
You can do this at standard definition,
you can do this at high definition,

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.400
whatever you like.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:44.730
Final Cut Pro is a title I've
already done in Final Cut Pro.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:49.400
I'm going to bring it back into
Final Cut Pro to replace these

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.670
lovely pieces I did earlier that
just aren't going to win any awards.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:53.840
I'm going to select those two.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.170
I could delete them and drop
this other video back in,

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.680
but instead I'm just going
to hit Ctrl+B to hide them.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.650
I want to leave them in place because
I may want to come back to those later.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.960
Don't ask why, I just might.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.490
I'm going to add this piece on here.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.620
You might be wondering,
why is that giving me a red render bar?

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.780
There's a very good reason for that.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.050
This is an animation codec.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.590
It's totally uncompressed.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.040
This means that I can do further
compositing within Final Cut Pro and

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.070
then render it out in the native codec,
in this case, DV,

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:23.040
without having multiple renders,
without having multiple compression.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.400
If I rendered this out
of LiveType as a DV file,

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.490
brought it into Final Cut Pro,
and then decided to do a

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.050
color correction to it,
composite it with something else,

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.030
I'd have to re-render
it for the final output,

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.140
and that means it would have rendered
twice and the quality would go down.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.740
What we've done is we've allowed it
to bring it in at full uncompressed,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.980
un-rendered quality, pop that into place,
put whatever you want on it,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.010
and render your final output.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.690
So, for this final piece in here,
I'm going to go ahead and

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:46.800
add one more little segment.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.800
I have a little white flash because
the transition here from that title

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.440
to that title is a little bit harsh.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.630
So, I'm going to take a
simple little white slug,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.920
drag that on top of there.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.240
Let's go ahead and zoom into this to do
an effect and to make a change to it.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.460
And to zoom into it,
I want to show you a keyboard

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.040
shortcut that's really handy.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.320
You may remember the
keyboard shortcut Shift+Z.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.480
Shift+Z is zoom to fit.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.000
It zooms the entire timeline
or viewer or canvas in to fit.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.820
The new keyboard shortcut is to select
anything and hit Shift+Option+Z.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.190
And that is zoom selection
or zoom to selection.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.800
"It's a good one, isn't it?

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.600
It's just the little things, isn't it?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.790
So it very quickly allows you to zoom
into exactly what you're working on.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.220
I'll take my pen tool,
just do a quick overlay change on here,

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:31.800
so I'm changing the opacity from 0
to 100 and then back down to 0 again.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.560
And if I open up the next clip,
we can see what that's

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.710
going to look like,
and I'll render that or play that out.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:40.390
And we have a very nice
subtle effect in there."

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.470
Alright, moving on.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.820
Multi-channel audio assignment.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.900
This is another huge new feature
in Final Cut Pro version 4.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.900
Previously,
you had two channels of audio.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.140
You could set it up to your
left speaker and to your

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:51.900
right speaker and that was it.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.810
That didn't help out much if
you were on a professional deck,

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.820
like a DigiBeta deck,
and you wanted to lay down

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.900
four different tracks of audio.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.260
Or, if you had a setup in a
studio where you wanted to,

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.000
let's say, put all your dialogue
to a pair of speakers,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.900
or even to a single
center channel speaker,

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.900
put your music on other speakers,
put your effects on other speakers.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.900
There's all kinds of different reasons
you may want to have multi-channel audio.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.840
And what we have in here is a great
way to go about assigning that.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.760
I'm going to open up the project
properties and go to audio options.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.880
You'll notice that I have
on here two tracks of audio.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.900
Well,
how many tracks of audio could we add,

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.890
or channels of audio can we add?

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.620
Up to 24 channels of audio.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.680
That means that if I plug in a hardware
device with multi-channel audio out,

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.710
say a Motu device or an Emagic ME,
you can go ahead and

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.830
get six tracks of audio.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.900
So, you can choose eight, ten, twelve,
whatever your device will handle,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.900
channels of audio output on here.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.960
Now, I'm going to go ahead
and for this example,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:41.900
just choose four.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.900
What I'm going to set up is an
example of having all of your audio,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.900
your music, your background sounds,
and so on, going to two speakers,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.900
and then having your
dialogue go to one speaker.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.430
Let's say that's my center channel,
and in my studio I have my dialogue

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.860
speaker and then my sounds and
effects speakers over here.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.520
So,
I go ahead and I choose four channels,

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.300
but I only have three,
so I'm going to go ahead and

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.890
switch that from stereo to mono.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.900
Click OK.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.370
I'm going to ignore speaker four,
and then I go over here and I simply

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:13.900
choose audio outputs one and two for one,
and one and two again for track two.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.270
Continue to move through here
and I can choose track three

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.890
and track four for the other.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.860
So, let's just say,
actually right here I've

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.730
got dialogue up here,
so I'll set that to

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.590
three and that to three,
and then my dialogue is going to

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.890
be mixed down to mono and sent
out the same single speaker,

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.900
in this case channel three.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.760
These other two tracks are
going to continue to come

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.330
out channels one and two,
or in this case my left

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:33.890
and right speakers.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.900
Now, fortunately I just have
a mono mix down out here,

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.900
so I can't play this back and have it
come out properly out these speakers,

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.990
but in a proper studio environment
with the proper audio interface,

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.900
audio hardware, you can do that.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.900
And again,
up to 24 channels of audio out.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.710
1648, an engineer, help me.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.900
Is it 16?

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.650
Yes, thank you.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.690
Michael?

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.930
On audio?

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.100
I actually don't know.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.100
It's dependent on the DV Pro X.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.950
I actually don't know.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:19.100
I'm sorry.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.100
What's the session we're
supposed to drag people towards?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.030
What are the questions that I don't know?

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.260
I'm not a big audio guy, unfortunately.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.160
So, more of you.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.260
Sorry.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.260
All right.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.230
Moving on.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.260
What have we got here?

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.250
Let's take a look at some
more real-time effects.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.250
How are we doing on time?

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.260
None of these have clocks on them.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.260
How are we on time?

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.260
I can't see this thing.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.260
It says I have 58 minutes left.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.140
Is that right?

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.250
Yeah, you did.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.260
I'm sorry.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.050
I'm sorry.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.250
I'm sorry.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.400
Alright, cool.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.930
Alright, onward.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.390
Real-time effects again.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.700
Let's go look at chroma keying.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.400
Chroma keying in real-time.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.280
This is kind of cool.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.390
I'm going to open up
another sequence here.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.400
Shift-Z to zoom to fit.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.010
Here's a video clip
that I've already added.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.480
As you can see,
this guy was shot against a green screen,

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.400
making it really easy to
chroma key that piece out.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.800
What I'm going to do is take this track,
the video track,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.400
and I'm going to drag it up a layer.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.180
Just drag it up one track of video.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.700
And I'm going to take this
same yellow background and I'm

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.400
going to drag it behind there.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.310
So that once I drop out
the green background,

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.400
we're going to see the
yellow piece behind it.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.340
So let's go ahead and do this.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.280
I'm going to take my chroma
keyer and drag it on there.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.400
Open up that clip and
start doing this effect.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:29.760
Very simple.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.400
Here's my chroma keyer.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.150
Take the eyedropper,
click on the green background.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.400
Most of it drops away.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.300
It's not great yet.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.200
So what I'm going to do is expand
out my green there a little bit.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.400
Expand out my saturation
and my luma on there.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.400
It's definitely getting better on there.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.340
Let's expand this out
just a little bit more.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.090
I think I'll take my edge thinning,
take that down a little.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.400
Actually,
I'm going to take that up a little bit.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400
Encroach on that edge a little.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.400
Soften that a little bit.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.610
And without too much effort,
we now have... I want this product that

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.290
I'm making to be the best thing there is.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.400
Not a half bad key, huh?

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.100
[Transcript missing]

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.750
"Milk the audience,
come on!" So I actually have one on here

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.210
that I spent a little bit more time on.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.300
I'll go ahead and add that one on,
and as you can see this

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.120
one's even cleaner.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.860
"I want this product..." And it's
all playing back in real time.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.960
This is once again a real time effect,
new for Final Cut Pro 4.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.400
Lots of real time in here.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.350
To give you an idea of how
much stuff is in real time,

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.040
I'm going to quickly
go to the Effects tab.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.230
How do you know that a filter
or transition is real time?

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.690
"Bold." Bold, right.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.140
Well, let's take a look.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.950
I'll go to my transitions, and look,
they're all bold.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.250
Oh, they're all bold.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.400
They're all bold.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:42.680
Wow.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.400
Just about everything is bold in here.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.400
Not everything,
don't want to give you the wrong idea,

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.850
not everything is real time,
but the vast majority of the effects

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.350
and transitions are now in real time.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.400
Let's say that this wasn't
good enough for you.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.400
Let's say that you wanted to
go the level of Hollywood,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.360
and you wanted to buy
Shake to do your compositing.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.390
Shake is a fantastic compositing tool.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.400
How many of you out here
saw Lord of the Rings?

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:09.700
I hope everybody raised their hand.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.700
My goodness.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.640
Gotta see Lord of the Rings.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.660
Lord of the Rings is
composited with Shake.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.700
Compositing.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.170
Just real quick, if anybody's going,
"What the heck is he

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.370
talking about?" Compositing,
the action of taking multiple

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.700
layers of video and graphics,
CG, and so on, layering them together,

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.700
and then making them look like
they weren't layered together.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.880
So, for example, you'll look at a scene
in Lord of the Rings,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.650
you look at it,
and it's these guys walking

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.700
across a marsh with some
mountains in the background,

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.140
and you think, "Okay,
they shot that with these guys, you know,

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.800
in the wild,
with these guys walking across

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.220
the marsh with the mountains in
the background." And then you

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.010
look at the composite plates,
and you realize that the mountains

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.680
were shot in one country,
the planes were shot in another,

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.700
the characters were shot
against a green screen,

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.600
Gollum was, of course,
computer generated.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.660
There's layers of fogs,
there's layers of light,

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:51.680
there's about 15 to 20 different
layers of video and CG animation

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.300
all composited together to give
you the final output that looks,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.700
for all intents and purposes,
100% realistic and believable.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.700
So that's what Shake does.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.620
But that's a pretty
high-end use of Shake.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.700
You can use Shake as well to
do things much more simply.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.840
I can basically do
exactly what I did here,

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.700
but with Shake,
using a industry-standard,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.840
Hollywood-level,
Hollywood-grade tool to get

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.690
out my Shake composites.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.690
So here I have the same
composite done with Shake,

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.700
so it's gonna be just a
little bit cleaner in here.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.700
And this was once again rendered out
of Shake with the animation codec,

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.530
or no compression at all,
meaning that once I've got

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.700
it back into Final Cut Pro,
I can do more compositing.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.000
For example, I can go in here and add a
lower third on top of this.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.910
and I'll have my lower third
composited on top of this

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.200
composite that came out of Shake.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.320
I'm going to have to render
this before I can play it back,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.890
but as you can see,
the quality on here is

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.700
absolutely pristine.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.620
So what I'll do is go ahead
and open up the next sequence

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.100
where this is already rendered,
and you can see what

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.200
that would look like.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:54.290
This product that I'm making
to be the best thing there is.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.730
Not bad, huh?

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.960
So, before I move on,
I want to talk about the

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.440
rendering really quick.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.000
I just mentioned that we brought
these pieces in unrendered.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.400
We're now going to have to render them.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.990
This is a DV sequence.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.390
So we're talking about a pretty low,
you know, 411 color space.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.800
It's 8-bit.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.620
It's not going to be the greatest
color space in the world.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.000
But let's just say we're working
standard definition uncompressed,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.000
or even high definition uncompressed.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.000
Well, 8-bit color space,
or 8-bit rendering,

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.790
used to be the limit of
Final Cut Pro version 3.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.550
With Final Cut Pro 4,
if I open up my sequence

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:27.500
settings in here,
you'll notice that we now have 8-bit.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.500
If this was a high-def sequence
or a standard def uncompressed,

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.930
I could set it to 10-bit.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.440
More importantly,
we have this all YUV material

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:37.660
rendered in high precision,
which means it is a 32-bit

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.830
floating point render.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.500
This gives you the absolute best
quality possible for your renders.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.500
It's going to render it in a
32-bit floating point space,

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.640
and then on the final output,
bring it down to whatever level

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.000
your actual project is going to be,
whether it be 8-bit, 10-bit, 16-bit,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.990
or whatever you have.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.000
So this gives you the absolute
best possible render quality.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.500
You take a render hit time on this.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500
You turn this on.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.000
It's going to take a little
bit longer to render,

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.000
but you know that your quality is
going to be absolutely pristine.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.020
is it affecting any previews
in the timeline for the render?

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.230
Not quite sure what you mean.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.560
What you're gonna see is going
to look better on the preview

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.490
screen and out to your NTSC,
yes.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.750
I don't think so.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.810
I don't believe it does.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:22.810
Let's just find that out.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.140
Turn that on, and it does.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.050
Oh, no, no, it doesn't.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.140
It, uh, the real time is still real time.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.250
It just threw away the render files for
the pieces that were already rendered,

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.780
because they have to be re-rendered now,
but the real-time

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.140
capabilities are all the same.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.140
Okay, onward.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.170
Let's see here.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.280
Not completely.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.370
There is not a background rendering in
the sense of while you're still working,

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.280
it goes on and renders.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.360
But there is a feature
that I didn't talk about.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.490
It's a new feature in here.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.640
And that is Auto Render.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.270
Auto Render means that
after a set amount of time,

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.850
whatever you like,
if you walk away from the machine,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.390
you can have all open sequences,
current only, or everything except

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.880
the current sequence,
automatically start to render for you.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.770
So for those times when you go off to get
a coffee and end up going out for lunch,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.510
come back an hour later and think,
"I just lost an hour of rendering time.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.980
I could have had all those things
rendering while I was gone." Well,

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.560
this will automatically kick that
in and start rendering for you.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.520
You can also choose whether you want to
have the real-time sequences rendered,

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.900
real-time segments rendered
or not while you're away.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.420
So it's not true background rendering.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.180
It's not what you're asking about,
but this does save you quite a bit of

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.550
time for those moments when you walk
away and end up not coming back quite

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.870
as quickly as you thought you would.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.510
Okay, let's take a look at another
real-time effect and another

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.200
new feature in Final Cut Pro 4.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.320
Now, you saw the time speed change,
where I took the clip and

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.120
it was almost two seconds,
and I shrunk it down to one second.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.200
Pretty quick and easy.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.200
Played that back in real time.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.190
How about something a
little bit more exciting?

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.840
I'm going to take these two clips here,
Shift-Option-Z to zoom to fit,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.000
to zoom into those.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.200
I'm going to change the track height.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.200
Now, you may recall this capability
from within Final Cut Pro 3.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.050
You can adjust the track height by
clicking on these little buttons here.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.200
We have a new capability,
and that is the ability to adjust

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.350
individual track height on here.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.200
So you can set any single track
to any height that you like.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:22.700
This is great as well for taking, say,
your audio down really small and

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.460
keeping your video nice and big.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.970
So a lot of different options in here.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.100
All right, so I have this clip on here.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.570
I'm going to play this through.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.370
And you'll notice that we have on here,
the bicyclist jumping,

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.100
hitting the ground,
and going down the hill a bit.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.780
I want to make a change to this clip.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.640
I want to have this clip so
that the guy jumps in the air,

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.240
lands, and that's the end of the clip.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.480
At that point,
I want it to transition to the next clip.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.800
However, I don't want to change
the timing of this clip,

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.690
so I can't just trim it.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.570
I don't want to change the timing
because I have a lot of my clips

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.650
cut at exact one second increments,
and I did that so that it would be

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.760
really easy to do my music later.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.840
So I don't want to change this.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.100
I don't want to change the timing.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.570
But somehow or another,
I need to change the timing such that

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.200
he lands right at the last frame.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.710
So that's the first part of the problem.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.600
The second part of the problem
is I don't want to alter the part

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.120
where he jumps up in the air.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.740
I like that just the way it is.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.170
I've decided that I'm willing to make
a change from that point forward,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.560
meaning I'm willing to make a speed
change from the point where he's crested

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.620
that jump down to the ground to make it
fit into this one second space in here.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.840
So for this,
we use the time remapping tool.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.260
To access that tool,
I go to my tool palette and

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.900
I choose the time remapper.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:30.900
I

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.460
I'm going to go over here,
and the first thing I'm going

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.260
to do is click just once.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:35.740
Click and let go.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.130
And what I've done is I've added a
keyframe to that point on the timeline.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:42.620
I said that that point of video
is now locked to that frame or

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:46.350
that point on the timeline itself,
that segment of timecode.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.860
I'm now going to go to
the end of this clip,

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.910
and I'm going to click and drag to
reposition the final frame of video.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.600
Now I'm going to reposition it
so that it's just as he lands.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.340
You'll notice from the
little pop-up window there,

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.380
if you can read that,
it says that the speed to the left

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.390
of the cursor is 61%. The speed
to the right is 1,500%. Well,

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.790
the speed to the right is off-screen,
so I don't care what's happening there.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.040
The speed to the left is 61%.
Now I didn't have to calculate that.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.420
I didn't have to figure, OK,
from when he crests to

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.460
when he lands is this.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.360
And I could do the math and I get
61%. Don't have to deal with that.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.540
I simply click and drag,
visually assign the frame to

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.600
be the frame that he lands on,
let go of the mouse,

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:27.760
and now I can play this back in
real time to get that effect.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.900
That's pretty good.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.900
Let's take a little bit of a closer
look at what we're actually seeing here.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.900
I'm going to open up another view
here and turn on my time remap graph,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.400
which shows me the graph
that I've just created.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.370
Here's the graph that I've created here.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.770
Now, if you'll bear with me for a second,
this graph here is showing

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.370
me the time and the clip.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.730
If this point was all the way down
at the bottom and then this point

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.260
was all the way up at the top,
I would see the entire duration

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:58.500
of that clip ramping in real time,
at normal, standard time.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.800
"As I take that clip
and I make it steeper,

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:02.830
the clip is going to move faster.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.380
As I make it flatter,
it's going to move slower.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.220
So this point right here,
you'll see it's moving at normal time

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.240
and then gets a little bit faster,
or gets a little bit slower.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.100
Let's play that through again."

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.220
Let's make that more dramatic.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.500
I'll take this point,
bring it forward here.

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.030
I've just sped up this portion
dramatically and actually

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.300
slowed down this portion.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.700
So if I play that back...

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.430
If I want to smooth
that out a little bit,

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.850
just to make it a little bit more subtle,
I can go in here, Control-click,

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.140
and choose Smooth.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:38.110
Smooth out that ramp a little bit,
and let's play that back again.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.380
I actually kind of like it
with the sharpness on there,

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.040
so I'm going to take that corner back,
and I'm going to go over here,

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.190
take the pen tool,
add another point on here,

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.700
and drag this down.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:52.700
Now what's going to happen if this
time ramp starts to go downhill?

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.700
Oh, backwards.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.700
It's going to go reverse, right?

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.000
If I play this back...

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.500
Cool, huh?

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.150
I love this tool.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.200
This is a great tool.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.200
This is like the total
matrix time remap tool.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.200
I'm kicking cables down here.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.380
Jeff, how am I doing on time?

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.200
Because I know this thing isn't right.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.910
What's fine?

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.400
"I've got 15 minutes of demo left.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.300
Is that right?

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.030
We can go long.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.420
I like it.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.940
Alright, so there is some time remapping.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.560
Let's see here.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.360
What I'm going to do is
now fix the audio for this,

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.270
because you may have noticed - sorry?

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:37.080
I'm going to open up the one that
was actually kind of finished,

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.660
so let me go ahead and zoom
into this portion here.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.760
Let's open up that time remap.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.310
There's the final, quote unquote,
final time remap that I did

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:45.310
that's really nice and smooth.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:51.320
"I really like that effect."
But you'll notice here,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:51.320
if you listen closely,

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.340
The sound of him landing doesn't
line up with him actually landing,

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.010
so that's a bit of a problem, right?

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040
Need to fix that.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.960
Can I get some more water, please?

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:06.090
So what I'm going to do is
let's hide these layers here.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.220
I'm going to open up my audio here,
and I'm going to locate the

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.370
sound of him hitting the ground.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:12.060
So let's see here.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.130
There's my audio.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.780
and there is that landing
sound right there.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.030
So I'm going to go ahead
and place a marker on there.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.960
And now I'm going to look at the
video itself and I'm going to drag

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.400
through and find right where he lands,
which would be right about there.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:28.470
I now need to move the video without
affecting the audio and you slip

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.200
this video into place so that that
marker lines up with that playhead.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.460
So what I'm going to do is make sure
that my video and audio is unlinked,

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.980
which it currently is.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.280
Take my slip tool here,

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.160
And we'll just slide this over a little
bit and get that marker to line up.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.060
I should have linked these two
audio tracks as a stereo pair.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.130
Would have made that
save me a step there,

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.780
but there we go.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.720
Slip both of those into place.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:49.500
You see what's happened.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.960
I've moved that landing sound,
that landing peak,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.700
to run into that frame of video,
and now it should play back

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.300
and sound actually correct.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.760
Just like that.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.780
No, but with snapping turned on,
it'll snap it as you drag it,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.340
but there's no keyboard
shortcut for that.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:17.060
Okay, so now that that's done,
if I back up a little bit and

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.280
I play through the previous
clip and the next one,

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.900
you'll notice that there's a bit
of a harsh cut in the sound here.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.980
The audio transition isn't very clean.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.200
So what I want to do is add an audio
transition between these two pieces.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:36.240
So, I'll simply click on these and
choose Add Transition Crossfade.

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:38.000
Let's do that on both of them.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.780
I'll extend the duration
of that crossfade out.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.700
Just click and drag to
extend the duration.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.620
Makes that really easy to do.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.700
And now when I play this back,
it should transition much more smoothly.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.700
Now we're done.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.700
Pretty easy, huh?

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.700
Okay.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.700
Next, I'm going to go back and play a
piece of the final project again.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.700
I don't have time to go
through this entire build-up,

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.620
because this build-up on its
own can take about half an hour.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.380
But, as you can see,
this final piece that I'll play

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.700
is four streams of video playing
back with some compositing going

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.690
on and color correction filters.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.200
Let's just look at this.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.620
Thanks for joining me today.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:23.760
I'm Jeff Lowe,
and I'll see you next time.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:23.800
See you then.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.790
I'm going to open the second
clip and do the same thing.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.940
Mark an in, mark an out, drag that on.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.760
The third clip, and you'll notice this is
the third and final clip,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.720
has actually four sets on here of,
or four markers, so two sets of markers.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.750
Now I can scrub through
here and find these markers,

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.290
and as you can see,
it's telling me to put the V3 in

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.370
and the V4 out there and so on.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.860
But a little known feature in
here is that I can control click

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:14.760
on the time code window and show
all of my markers right here.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.550
So I can go ahead and
say let's go to V3 in.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.490
And it pops the playhead right there.

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.330
I'll mark the in point.

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.010
Let's go to V3 out.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.700
Mark the out point,
and I'll drag and drop that piece on.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.610
And then I'll do that
one more time for V4.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.740
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.080
Now, why did I just go through
all of this instead of just

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.100
showing you the final piece?

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.100
Well, there's a good reason for that.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.600
As I drag and drop this final piece on,
you'll notice something else

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.080
happens on the interface.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.100
Let's go ahead and zoom
into those pieces there.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.100
We have these little
red lines that show up.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.920
These little red lines are
showing me duplicate frames.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.100
It is a duplicate frame warning tool.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.510
Now,
why would you want to know about that?

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.600
Duplicate frames bad when?

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:52.790
In film.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.900
In film, it's very expensive to
reproduce frames of film.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.150
If you have an original frame,
you're going to put

00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.790
that in your Final Cut.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.840
If you have to duplicate that,
there's a cost involved.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.900
So you want to know if
you've accidentally used the

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:04.520
same shot more than once.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.470
So this is exactly what
that's telling me here.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.750
If I actually go in here
and Control-click on that,

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.500
it's going to show me dupe frames.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:13.230
It says I have 54 duplicate frames,
and it tells me exactly

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.430
where that is duplicated.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.400
If I select that,
it's going to bring the playhead to the

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.630
start of that clip that is duplicated,
so I know exactly where it is.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.990
So if you have a two-hour
long feature film on here,

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.390
and you've got at the very
end a duplicate frame thing,

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.560
and you're going,
"Where is the dupe?" Control-click,

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.760
and it takes you all the
way back to minute one,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.350
and you say, "Oh, look,
I used the same piece in the

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.240
intro," and there you go.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.370
You know you have to look for a different
shot or pay the cost of replication.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.680
How do we go about doing
this compositing effect?

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.480
I'm going to set up just one of them,
and then you can extrapolate and

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.920
imagine doing the rest of them
to get the same effect where the

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.690
video goes into all four corners.

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.700
This is just some basic compositing.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.670
I'm going to start with this
top layer of video here.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.330
Right now, if I play this through,
we're only seeing the top layer of video,

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:52.580
right?

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.700
Actually, if I go down to the timeline,
that would be better.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.700
And play that, you're only seeing the
top layer of video.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.740
You can't see any of
the layers underneath,

00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.590
because they're basically being obscured.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.700
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to take the playhead here on this clip.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.490
I'm going to go to my Motion Tab Effects,
and I'm going to lay

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.660
down a couple keyframes.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.630
I'm going to lay down a keyframe
for scaling and for my center point.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.800
And I'm also going to
expand this viewer a bit,

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.700
because this window, or this monitor,
is just entirely too small.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.700
If there's ever a need
for Cinema HD display,

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.700
it's with Final Cut Pro.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.700
You've got to tell your bosses
that when you go back home.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.510
"Dude, I've got to have one."

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.100
Okay, so I've just laid down a keyframe,
scaled it 100%, centered right there.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.730
I'm now going to,
up here in the Motion tab,

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:35.840
just type +20 and hit Return.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.840
That moves the playhead
forward 20 frames.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.980
I'm gonna take my scale,
set that to 25%. Actually, 50%.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.100
and I'm then going to go over
here to the canvas itself.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:49.810
And with Wireframe mode enabled,
I'm gonna manually reposition

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:51.100
this into the top corner there.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.100
Instead of having to figure
out what the numbers are,

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.070
just click and drag it wherever you like.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:58.230
And you'll notice in here that there's a
motion path telling me that I've created

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:01.100
a motion path so when I play this back,
that object is actually gonna move.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.930
So if I play that back...

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.170
you can see the effect
that we just created.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.490
Just like that.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.140
Now, if I want to clean that up a
little bit and go over here

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.290
and I look at that point,
you'll notice that it's...well,

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.940
since I did it by hand,
it's minus 181.07.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.830
Well, I can kind of guess that actually
minus 180 is the exact number there and

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.640
minus 120 is the exact number there,
and now I have it perfectly

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.860
positioned into the corner there.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.070
I can replicate that for the next
four clips and end up with a piece

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:25.380
where it goes into all four corners.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.570
The next step on top of that is to
add the real-time color correction.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:34.390
So I'm gonna go ahead and
reposition my window layouts here.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.290
And you'll notice, by the way,
that I just hit one

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.070
of these buttons here.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.200
These are the buttons that I previously
added to the timeline window.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.330
Instead of having to go up
to Window and choose a range

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.700
and choose a window layout,
I simply click on there to show that.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.200
So that is now in place.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.200
And I can go ahead and start
adding the color correction.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.350
So if I open up - let's see here,
where's my color correction piece?

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.800
I believe this has all
four of these scaled out.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.400
Yep, here we go.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.710
So here's all four of them scaled.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.300
I would then add a color
corrector to each clip,

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.760
animate the color corrector the
exact same way that you just

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.970
saw me animate the scaling,
and the final piece looks like this.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:16.500
So that's compositing or
animating video clips.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:18.030
What about animating stills?

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.650
Well, it works exactly the same way.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.620
So you can bring in
multiple Photoshop files,

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:24.440
multiple tips, whatever you like,
and composite them and animate

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.100
them within Final Cut Pro 4.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.350
You can do that with
Final Cut Pro 3 as well.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.990
Something else you can do is bring
in a multi-layered Photoshop file.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.860
So let me open up this
Photoshop file here.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:38.720
Right here you're looking
at an actual Photoshop file.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.400
You'll notice that it
has four tracks of video.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.750
Well, in Photoshop this is
four different layers.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:45.640
I can open up each one of these
layers and you'll see that I have,

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.120
go back to video here,
the Santa Cruz bicycles piece and

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:52.590
then I have these various little
faded segments of colored stills

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.370
that have been added in there.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.860
This is a simple Photoshop file.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:59.030
Bringing that Photoshop file into
Final Cut Pro 4 allows you to

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.200
then individually animate those
layers to create some movement,

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.200
to create a little bit
of motion in there.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.170
I'm going to go back over here
and I want to add that entire

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.660
Photoshop composite to this timeline.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.900
Now, with Final Cut Pro 3,
that would mean going over here,

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.080
opening a video track,
going back to your composite,

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.080
adding it in,
and then repeating that process

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.000
for the other four layers.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.270
Or you could go in here and just select
all and copy and then trim them down,

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.120
paste them and individually trim them.

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.580
Yeah, it's kind of a lengthy process.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.080
We have a new capability.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.010
We have a new capability in here.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:37.400
We've always supported nested sequences,
which meant that I could take this

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.260
sequence here and simply drag and
drop it onto the timeline like that.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:43.300
And I now have all four of those layers,
but to edit those layers I have

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.620
to open them up and do the
editing in a separate window.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:53.200
The new feature is to
take this composite,

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.480
this sequence here,
and drag it onto the timeline,

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.580
and by holding down the command key,
I can choose to expand

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.690
that nest on the fly.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.530
So, hold down the Command key, let go,
and it expands that nest,

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:04.900
and now all four of those video
layers are dropped in there,

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.240
expanded, ready to go.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.240
Just little things.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.390
Well, no.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.460
This is a - you've now basically
expanded that sequence,

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.040
right?

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.140
So, if I was to - since this
sequence essentially doesn't

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.090
exist on the timeline,
I've taken the contents of that

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.270
sequence and dropped them in here.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.110
So, no, changes made to this will
not affect this file here.

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:31.700
And then from here,
the animation effect that you

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.820
saw at the end is essentially
the same thing that I just did,

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.780
where I took a piece, keyframed it,
moved the playhead forward,

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:40.230
keyframed it in a different position,
and it slowly animates the pieces around,

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:44.930
and you end up with something
that looks like this.

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:51.560
Okay, now, all of that said and done,
just for the sake of argument here,

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.160
since we only have half
the time for this demo,

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.010
which is really needed,
we're going to say that

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:55.810
all the video is done.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:58.350
Here's my final video project.

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:00.820
You can see that it's
got everything in here.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:01.850
It's got my titles.

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:03.740
It's got my interview sequence.

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:07.150
Got all these other effects in here.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:09.040
Got this interview.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.270
Got my speed change.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:19.830
I've got this compositing,
and after that finally

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.300
the Photoshop compositing.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.430
So what's missing from this piece?

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:28.600
There you go, the music.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:28.600
Is that you, Jeff?

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.100
Exactly.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.340
So I need to add the music to this.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.070
Now, how do you go about getting
music into your video projects?

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:36.080
What are your options?

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:40.100
You can go to CD, rip a song off the CD,
or buy a song off the

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.100
Apple Music Store and put that in there.

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.640
And that's great if it's just for
you when you're doing family home

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.660
movies and you're never going to
show them outside of your home.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:49.600
Because if you did,
then that of course would be illegal,

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:50.090
wouldn't it?

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.100
You can't steal the music like that.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.070
So what are your options
for creating original music?

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.090
Well, if you happen to know a musician,
awesome.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:57.100
Good for you.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.040
You can have a musician compose
the piece for you and just create

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.100
that for you and you're great.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.840
But not everybody knows musicians,
especially ones who

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.100
work for cheap or free.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.100
So what about licensing music?

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.080
Well, you can license music.

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:10.100
That's certainly a really good option.

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.000
There's lots of ways to license music.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.620
The problem with licensing it, though,
is that you have to find

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.100
something that really fits the
mood or the feel of your piece,

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.550
that is the exact duration that you want,
and fits all of your beats

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:22.980
and fits all of your cuts.

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.870
And if you have a cut of video
that doesn't quite match the music,

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.090
what are you going to do?

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.100
Call up the store you bought the
music from and ask them to change it?

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.080
Forget it.

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.010
You have to change your video.

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.080
And that's not the way to go.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.100
So what about creating your own music?

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.100
You as a video editor,
what if you could create your own music

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:41.100
in an interface and a workflow that you
as a video editor are familiar with?

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.030
And that is what Soundtrack is all about.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.100
Soundtrack is an application
that ships with Final Cut Pro 4.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.100
So I have my video here.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:52.100
I go to the File menu and
I choose Export for Soundtrack.

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.320
The Export for Soundtrack dialog allows
me to choose whether I want to export the

00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:58.100
audio and video or video or audio only.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.720
In this case,
I've exported the video on its

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.540
own because I don't want to
have the dialog interfering

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.100
with my music creation process.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.240
I'm going to go ahead and
switch over to Soundtrack.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.100
And I already have this
piece of video imported.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.100
And I already have a
couple of tracks added.

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.100
And I'm going to start
to build up this music.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:16.100
Now, Soundtrack is essentially
a loop assembly program.

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:20.240
What I'm doing in here is choosing
from thousands and thousands of loops,

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.100
audio loops, music loops.

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.100
We are literally shipping over
4,000 loops with Soundtrack.

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:30.990
When you buy Final Cut Pro 4,
it comes on four DVDs.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.180
Over 4000 audio loops.

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.860
How do you go about finding
which audio loops you want?

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:40.320
Well, for this we have something
called the browser.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.330
The browser is awesome.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.070
I can go through here and
search by simple categories.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.190
Now we're actually looking at
a very limited library right

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.630
now for the sake of this demo.

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.400
I'm going to go to my setup tab
right here and I'm going to turn

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.510
off my demo library and turn
on the actual shipping library.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:56.370
You see 4,112 tracks.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.170
That's what it actually ships with.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.720
And I go in here and I click
on things like percussions or

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.290
synths or horns and world music.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.280
And as you can see,
there's a lot in here.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.860
As you look at the bottom,
it's actually showing

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:08.810
me 1 to 50 up to 721.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:09.880
That's just under world.

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.360
There's a lot of stuff in here.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.620
So how do you narrow this down?

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.040
Well, I'm actually going to go ahead and
turn my demo library back on so

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.260
I can find what I'm looking for.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.700
We go back to guitars and
I'm going to type in strum.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.520
I just want strumming guitars.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.940
That brings me down to a much
more manageable size list.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.490
So now I can start playing these
different soundtracks and listening

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.500
to them and seeing how they're
going to mix in with my music.

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.380
Or with my video.

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:34.060
Now I already have two
pieces laid down here.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.380
I have a drum kit and a synthesizer.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.670
Now those have been added already.

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:40.310
Let's go ahead and play this and see
what it looks like and sounds like.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.800
Okay, so it's a loop.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.300
It's going over and over again.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:53.300
Now, I want to start auditioning
other soundtracks.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.380
You'll notice up here that
it is currently running

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.800
at 120 beats per minute.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.600
You'll notice over here that the tempo
of these tracks is all over the map.

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.570
Here's one at 90, 120, 110, 85, 92,
and 80.

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:05.710
All over the place.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.340
If you take music that is of varying
tempos and you put them together,

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:09.930
what happens?

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:10.980
Sounds horrible.

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.280
If you take music of varying
tempos and you scale them

00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:15.660
to force the tempo to match,
what happens?

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.180
You get a pitch shift.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.900
Your guitar starts to
sound like the Chipmunks.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:21.460
Awful things happen.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:26.020
So what we've done in here is we've built
into Soundtrack the ability automatically

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:30.240
for your clips and your tracks to scale,
to tempo scale, time scale,

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.600
without any shifting whatsoever.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.170
Listen to this.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:45.700
[Transcript missing]

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.280
I kind of like this one.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.900
So I'm going to take this and I'm
going to add it to my timeline.

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:55.700
I'll extend that loop out.

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:57.900
It's got a bass guitar in here.

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.300
"I'm going to extend that out.

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.700
And I now have four instruments
stacked on top of each other,

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:06.290
all looping,
all playing in perfect synchronicity.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:07.300
Is that a word?

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.290
Maybe I want this to
be a little bit slower.

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:13.300
It's a little bit too high beat for me,
so let's just take that down a bit.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.300
Maybe I want to speed it up.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:21.940
No pitch shifting whatsoever.

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:24.760
Is that alright?

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:34.180
This is a phenomenal application
and it is free with Final Cut Pro 4.

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:34.590
Unbelievable.

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.600
Okay, so right now I've got four loops
repeating over and over and over again.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.600
It's going to take about two more
minutes for you to get a headache.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.640
So, what we're going to do is we're going
to build this into an actual song,

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:45.600
something that resembles real music.

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.110
So for that,
I'm going to take my drums and

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.570
I'm going to have them start
about halfway through this piece.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.860
I'll take the bass guitar,
I'll have that start

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.450
about halfway through,
and the synth, I'm going to have it start

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:54.600
about a quarter of the way in.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.430
The levels on the synth
have been dropped to -12.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.600
What I'm going to do is
I'm going to play this.

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.520
As the synth comes in,
I'm going to raise the levels up on here.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.600
I can actually keyframe all of this.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.550
Sneak preview there.

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.600
You can keyframe all of this stuff.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.600
We're not going to get into that.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600
So I'm going to go ahead and hit play.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.670
Raise the levels.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.490
Off to a pretty good start.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:25.240
Now it's pretty simple still.

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:29.200
So let's open up a project that has
a little bit more work done to it.

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.420
"I'm going to hide the browser there.

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.250
And if you look at this timeline,
you can see that we have guitar,

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:39.820
tambourine, another guitar, keyboard,
some drums,

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.840
another - it looks like a bass guitar,
another lead guitar, some cymbals,

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:44.210
some organs, some keyboards.

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.260
There's a lot of stuff going on here.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.090
Let's see what this sounds like."

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:08.560
Pretty good so far, huh?

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.100
Now, you may have noticed that there
was something a little bit

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.720
strange that happened back here.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.710
I'm going to play this again.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.870
There was an audio event,
an audio beat or change,

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:23.140
that didn't really match up with
the video event or the video change.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.110
That's right here.

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:26.110
As we transition from

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.300
There we go.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.300
This clip to this clip.

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:30.800
It's an obvious,
really big change in the video.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:31.220
Back up.

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:31.790
There we go.

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.700
Between these two,
it's an obvious big change in the video,

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:36.460
but if you listen to the music,
there's a change in the music that seems

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:39.080
like it should match up with that beat,
but doesn't.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.500
It's a little bit later.

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:42.940
So what are we going to do about that?

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.340
Well, first of all, how did this happen?

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.610
This is exactly 120 beats per minute.

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:50.810
I said earlier that I cut this video with
one second clips so that I would easily

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:52.520
be able to match it up to my music.

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.620
Well, 120 beats per minute,
one second per video clips, do the math,

00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.440
it's pretty easy to see that
this should line up perfectly.

00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.320
So what's happened here?

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.520
Well, what happened here is what
happens in the real world.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.660
You do a video project,
you show it to the client,

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.110
the client says, "This is great,
but I want you to cut this and slip

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.260
that and trim this and put this
over here and that over there."

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.140
And the next thing you know,
your very carefully selected

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.420
one-second cuts are no longer there.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.230
You have this piece that is
a little bit of an anomaly.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.160
It's off.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160
So what do you do about that?

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.500
Well, you can't change the video because
it's been approved by the client.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:22.140
You don't want to totally recut your
audio because that's going to be a drag.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.490
So what if you could just do a
little bit of a shift to make that

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:26.870
audio and video match up perfectly?

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.780
You can.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.600
Watch this.

01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:30.940
I have over here,
you'll notice that the play

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.710
head is right on that video cut.

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:37.510
If I follow the play head down, right,
follow the play head down,

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.460
here's the cymbal crash that we're
looking at that doesn't quite match up.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.320
Well, it turns out that this marker right
here is exactly on the point in

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.950
time of the new video transition,
the new video cut that is a marker that

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:51.400
I created in Final Cut Pro that was
exported out of Final Cut Pro as a new

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:53.760
type of marker called a scoring marker.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.890
And that marker I can now take
and simply drag so it lines

01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:58.880
up with the cymbal crash.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.080
What I've done is I've just
asked Soundtrack to very,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.750
very slightly alter the tempo
of the music before that

01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:06.600
marker so that they line up.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:06.600
Let's hear it.

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:13.600
You can do that again.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.600
Okay, undo.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.600
All you gotta do is drag it.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.860
Okay, so, here we are.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.430
It's running at 120 beats per minute.

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:22.180
I'll give you a little bit more
insight into what's happening here.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.380
120 beats per minute.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:24.760
If I play it through, it misses the beat.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.570
Music.

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:27.570
Right?

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.290
So, I'm going to take this piece.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.500
This is the marker.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.400
This is the symbol crash
I'm lining up to down here.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.720
I'm going to take this marker
and just drag it over so it

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.800
lines up with the symbol crash.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.800
You'll notice it's gone orange to
show me that I've distorted something.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.800
You'll notice now that I cannot
control the beats per minute anymore.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.750
This is now, since I've altered it,
Soundtrack has taken over that.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.500
I can no longer alter
that beat per minute.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.700
The playhead over here shows me that
I'm running at 120 beats per minute.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:56.300
If I put the playhead back here,
it's running it at 125 beats per minute.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.500
It has ever so slightly
altered the tempo of that.

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.430
I can go through here and
continue to alter this.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.390
Let's say I take this marker and
I'll move that over a tiny bit.

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:04.490
Let's move it that way.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.500
So, that's 125 beats per minute,
but the piece before it is 150.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.300
So, that's pretty dramatic because
it was so close to the beginning.

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.500
So, that probably would not
really work out very well.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.100
It's not a fix-all for everything.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.490
You can't take something that's 30
seconds off and fix it like this.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.980
You're going to have to
do a little work there.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.340
This is really designed
for those ever so slight,

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.010
you know, half second,
quarter second pieces that

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:23.300
are just off the beat.

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.700
And you can get away with doing
that ever so slight pitch shift.

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:27.540
ever so slight tempo shift.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.620
And so here we go again,
playing it through.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.400
Not bad at all, huh?

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.280
Alright, from here,
you can export out your soundtrack file.

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:40.370
You can choose to
export out a stereo mix,

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.780
which you can then bring
back into Final Cut Pro,

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.440
or put it on your iPod,
or whatever you want to do.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.740
You can choose to export
out single tracks.

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.660
Every single one of these
tracks will export out as its

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.360
individual own stereo pair.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.760
You can then bring that
back into Final Cut Pro,

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.240
if you like,
and populate the timeline with

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.010
all the individual audio tracks.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:58.410
Or more importantly,
you can bring it into an

01:02:58.410 --> 01:02:59.440
application like Logic.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.680
Within Logic,
you can do things like mix it,

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.840
do further mixing,
add other effects to it,

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.130
add virtual instruments,
mix it in with real instruments,

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:08.060
do all the wonderful things
you can do with Logic,

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.740
and then bring that
back into Final Cut Pro.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.000
The options are really endless.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.650
You can take this into Logic and
make a surround sound mix out of it,

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.120
whatever you want to do.

01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:17.580
I've already exported out a stereo pair,
so I'm going to go ahead

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.910
back to Final Cut Pro.

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:26.040
They're not timestamped with the
timecode that came out of the video,

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.520
but what they are is they're
all exactly one length.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.000
They're all exactly the same length.

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.900
So if you have a clip that starts later,
like this,

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.340
you'll just get blank space in here.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.370
So you bring them in and you
just slap them all to time zero,

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.370
or to the start of the playhead,
or the start of the

01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:41.460
video that you exported.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.420
So if you only exported
a small chunk of video,

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.150
bring them all in,
line them up at the start of that video,

01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:46.200
and the blank space is there.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.340
And you can trim the blank
space off if you want to,

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.890
but of course you don't have to.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:57.720
"You can do anything you want
with this music that you create."

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800
"I have not tried that yet.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.460
I don't see why I wouldn't,
but I don't know how it would handle

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.920
the whole 'do you have permission'."

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.300
or convert it to an AIF is
what you'd want to do.

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.290
'Cause going to MP3 would
be-- you'd lose quality.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.280
So you'd want to go to AIF.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.300
But, of course,
you shouldn't be doing that anyway,

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.970
because that's unlicensed music.

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.050
You're not allowed to do that.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.760
You're licensing it
for personal use only,

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.340
so you could not turn
around and rebroadcast that

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.770
or resell it or anything.

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:41.960
If it's personal use,
there are ways around it.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.400
You can do the AIF, you can do the MP3,
you can hack it,

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.390
but you're not supposed to.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.470
Am I allowed to say that?

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.600
I just did.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.200
It was on camera.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.840
No, you shouldn't do that.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.780
I mean, obviously,
you're not supposed to, so.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.000
Yes.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.110
The looping format is
an industry standard.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.640
We've added a few things to it.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.040
We've added a few extra tags.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.150
And so,
when you install this whole bundle,

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:05.930
this whole suite of applications,
there is an extra utility

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.250
called the Soundtrack Utility
or something like that.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.120
And it's in your Utilities folder.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.340
Let's see if I can
find that really quick.

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:21.050
Soundtrack Loop Utility will allow
you to import other loop formats,

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:25.760
add the extra tags that we want on there,
and queue them up and put the categories.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.580
See we've got all the categories in here,
so they line up with the

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.960
categories in Soundtrack.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.900
Oh, okay.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:38.400
So let's repeat all the
questions from the translator.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400
Sorry, guys.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:39.900
Okay.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:45.390
Is that the Soundtrack's ? Yes.

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:50.920
No, I don't want to repeat that.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.730
He said, is it true that Soundtrack
supports Logic plugins?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.650
Yes, as far as I know, that's right.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.390
Isn't it, Michael?

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:11.970
Just the filtered plugins,
not the virtual instruments.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:11.970
That's Michael Wong.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:11.970
He's our resident export on
the East Coast on this app.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:11.970
And he works a lot more with
the audio stuff than I do,

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:11.970
because he's a musician.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:11.970
I, on the other hand, am not.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.240
Ah, you can actually change that.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.540
Let's go over here.

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:20.540
I'll show you.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.610
Up to 96?

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.080
Oh, and here, um, well, you can change,
you mean, like,

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.800
the track height and... No, no,
the actual, like,

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.290
the kind of clips of audio you use.

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.300
Do you get sample resolution?

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.280
Oh, oh, oh,
do you get sample resolution on there?

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.300
You know, that's a really good question.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:44.300
I don't know.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:44.300
Let's see.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.300
They actually talk
about it down to beats.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.140
Down to beats.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.240
Wow, we're... Yeah, ask the audio guy.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.490
I was told I have like 15
minutes left until Q&A,

01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:56.740
and that's a lot more than I thought,
because I've... Five minutes to Q&A.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.440
Okay, that's better.

01:06:58.550 --> 01:06:58.880
Good.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.380
Now we're back on track.

01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:01.740
Okay.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:05.780
So, back over here,
this is the video that I had exported.

01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:11.330
Here is my soundtrack music that
I have exported out as a stereo pair.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.900
"And I can simply take this piece,
drag it onto the timeline in here,

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:17.260
and I've added that back in.

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:18.740
And as you can see,
it's exactly the right

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:21.460
length because I cut it out,
cut it to the video,

01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:25.190
so it is coming in at exactly
the right length in there.

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.190
And, you know,

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.430
Santa Cruz Bikes - Plans
for Innovation and Quality.

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:33.960
Our goal is to deliver the
most technologically advanced,

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.280
customizable bike and
ensure it's good with time.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:08:03.200
[Transcript missing]

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:05.900
Santa Cruz Pikes - stands
for innovation and quality.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.200
So what I need to do is lower
the levels of the audio on there.

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:11.670
Now I could go in here with a
pen tool and add a couple points

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.790
in here to lower the levels,
but there is a better and easier way

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.430
to do that now with Final Cut Pro 4.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.490
I'm going to choose a
new window layout here,

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:23.200
and choose my audio mixing layout
to reveal the brand new audio mixer.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.140
This is a 99 track audio mixer.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.460
You can have every single
track of audio on your timeline

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.200
represented in this mixer in here.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.340
You'll notice that I have
currently six tracks of audio,

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:35.640
therefore I have six
tracks on my mixer in here.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.380
On a larger screen, of course,
you'd be able to see all those at once.

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:43.150
I also have the ability to hide
and show individual tracks on here.

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:45.750
So if I do have 99 on here,
but I'm really only concerned

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.930
with a couple of them,
I can hide and just show

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.800
the ones that I want,
and I can even save different views.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.230
So for example,
here's view one with all of them.

01:08:53.230 --> 01:08:56.500
Let's go to view two,
and I'm going to hide three and four,

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.480
and we'll just say five and six.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.900
And I go back to one, back to six,
and back to two, back to one,

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.320
back to two.

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.720
So you can save out these
customized views very quickly.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.820
Just click on the number and do it.

01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:05.570
You don't even have to save
it out as a separate file.

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:09.510
So, let me go back to having
all of them visible.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.890
I'm actually going to hide 3 and 4
because I'm not concerned with those.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:15.800
3 and 4 right now are
my background audio,

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.660
the existing audio that
came from the video.

01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:20.360
Tracks 1 and 2 are my music.

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:22.500
Tracks 5 and 6 are my dialogue.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.390
What I want to do is lower the levels
of the music when the dialogue is on.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.090
So,
keyframe recording is already turned on.

01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:34.090
I'm just going to go ahead and hit
play and start adjusting these levels.

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.500
Santa Cruz Bikes stands
for innovation and quality.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.200
Our goal is to deliver the
most technologically advanced,

01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:42.500
customizable bike in the
shortest period of time.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.500
Back up again, and down.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:49.500
I want this product that I'm making
to be the best thing there is.

01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:58.400
And you notice that the
timeline has been altered.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.000
My levels have all been added
in there just like that.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:01.660
All there is to it.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.940
If I want to make changes to this,
I can go ahead and - let's go ahead

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.400
and zoom into this a little bit.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.000
I'll zoom into that.

01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:11.170
I can go in here, take the pen tool,
I can rearrange this however I like.

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:14.000
If I want to totally redo it,
I can just hit undo,

01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:17.620
or choose the remove attributes command,
remove levels, hit OK,

01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:19.400
and start that over again.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:22.200
Now you'll notice when I did that,
that it didn't lay down

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.550
a thousand keyframes.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.600
You may have seen tools
similar to this before,

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.200
where it lays down,
for every frame of video,

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.600
it lays down a new keyframe.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.880
Which means that when you go
back to change that later,

01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:33.670
it's just about impossible,
because for one second of video,

01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:36.540
you have 30 keypoints to move,
or you have to go in and remove

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.540
a whole bunch of them by hand.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.480
So clearly it's a tedious process.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.270
But what if you actually do
want those keyframes in there,

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:43.530
for whatever reason?

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:46.600
Let's say you're doing some
really fine tuning to it,

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.320
and you want to really
fine tune into your levels,

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.200
and you want to make sure that every
single nuance has been recorded.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.360
So I'm going to go ahead and
bring up my button search here,

01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:02.530
and I'm going to type in "keyframe".
Here's my keyframe recording button.

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:05.800
I'm going to go ahead and
drag this onto my tool bench.

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:08.200
Notice here that I have
three different choices.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.980
I have Record All Keyframes,
Record Reduced Keyframes,

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:16.010
which is what you saw,
or Record Peaks Only.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.100
Peaks Only is an extremely minimal amount
of keyframes that will be laid down.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.050
Possibly a bit too minimal if you have
any type of subtle adjustments to it.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.100
The default is the center one, Reduced.

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.080
But let's go ahead and just set it
to the All and see what happens.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.770
I'm going to go back down here,
play this through,

01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:32.590
and make these changes again.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.250
Santa Cruz Bikes stands
for innovation and quality.

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:37.300
I'll bring it down.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.460
Our goal is to deliver the
most technologically advanced,

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.300
customizable bike in the short term.

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:42.300
Okay, you get the idea.

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.270
And now as you can see,
there have been a few keyframes added,

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.800
yes?

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.760
Let's just zoom into that a bit.

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:50.960
Let's go ahead and make these
track heights really nice and big.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.170
And as you can see,
there are far too many frames

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:55.570
in here to want to edit.

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:57.350
So you can make that
choice if you want to,

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.630
so every little nuance is recorded,
or simply go to Reduced and have that

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:03.680
much cleaner and much more manageable.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:09.270
Zoom in on the playhead here.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.400
I mean.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.890
Yes, I just zoomed in on the playhead.

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:14.900
Oh, yes.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.900
Did I zoom in on the playhead?

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:16.840
Yeah.

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:19.180
If I just, basically, okay,
Shift+Z to zoom back out.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:21.480
Nothing is selected,
so when I do Command+ and -

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.060
it zooms in on the playhead.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.230
If I have anything selected, no matter,
regardless of where the playhead is,

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:28.370
as I zoom in and out,
it's going to zoom in

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.960
and out on the selection.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.240
So zooming and where it zooms is just
dependent on either whether there's a

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:37.070
selection or if there's no selection,
just the playhead itself.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.400
It's time to go to Q&A.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.090
Okay,
I'm going to wrap this up with one quick

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:44.390
thing that I do want to talk about here,
and then we're going to hit Q&A.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.640
Export options.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:48.020
You have under here a whole
suite of export options.

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.220
Export out to QuickTime Movie.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.080
Export out your audio to OMF.

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:54.970
A new capability that has
just been released here at

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:58.760
WWDC is the beta for XML,
exporting XML.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.560
The SDK for this is also
being released here at WWDC.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.760
So for anybody who is
interested in XML exporting,

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.200
this is all new, and there's an entire
session dedicated to that.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.450
So that's a big announcement
for us going out to XML,

01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:13.090
and that's something that if
you're interested in this at all,

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:15.200
you're definitely going to
want to check out that session.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.960
So okay, I think it's time for me
to hit some questions.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.060
So Jeff, you want to come on up?

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.890
And let's see if we can
answer any of the tough ones.
