WEBVTT

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.870
My name is Gordon Meyer.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.250
I work in Apple's
Instructional Products group.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.510
Instructional Products makes the
on-screen help and the printed

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.910
manuals that come with Apple products.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.400
And in this session, we're going to be
talking about Apple Help.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.880
You know,
it was five years ago at WWDC that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.440
Apple Help was first introduced.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.810
For back in Mac OS 8.5, it was.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.980
So I see some people who have been
with us all along from the very

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.250
beginning and developing for it.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.380
Thank you.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.030
Today we're going to have some
changes to announce that I think

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.500
you'll be very pleased about.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.800
You've certainly been very
patient waiting for them.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.180
And I see a lot of new faces, too.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.240
So I hope you're here to find
out what Apple Help is all about.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.540
If you're waiting on the fence to see if
we're serious about an HTML help system,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.350
well, you can keep waiting another
five years or come on in.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.120
The water's fine.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.260
We'll talk about how you
actually generate your content.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.490
You'll see how easy it
is to hook things up.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630
Now I'm the kind of guy who
likes to eat dessert first,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.950
so we're going to start with a demo.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.040
And the demo is where all
the exciting stuff is,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.380
and so we'll do that first.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.630
And in fact,
there are so many changes to Apple Help,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.170
so I'm going to start with a demo.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.260
I think you've reached the hood in
the last year that you might say,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.780
"My goodness, you've changed everything."

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.840
Well, we've changed a lot.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.340
But you don't have to worry.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.730
If you've been developing
for Apple Help for a while,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.990
your stuff still works.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.500
So in that sense, we've changed nothing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.560
From then, we're going to talk about how
to develop for Apple Help.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.090
You'll see how simple and easy it
is to get your book in the help

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.010
system and running under the system.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.160
And then finally,
we're going to wrap up with some tips

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.200
about how to optimize your help system
and how to take advantage of some of the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.200
unique features that Apple Help presents.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.680
So I'll let you in on a secret.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.940
We're actually going
to finish early today.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.940
We don't have the full time allotted.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.560
That's not because there
isn't a lot to cover,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.660
because there is,
and there's lots of things to say.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.360
You'll get to listen to me
blab for several minutes.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.050
But it's really a short
presentation because Apple Help is

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.700
so simple and straightforward.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.020
We've worked really hard to make
sure that you can deploy your

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.200
help content quickly and easily.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.460
But enough of that.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.370
Let's get to the demo.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.090
So, to get started here,
I'm going to open up the Help Viewer.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.830
This is Panther that you all
have in your registration kits.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.910
Wow!

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.310
Look at that.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.470
That was fast, wasn't it?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.600
In fact,
I almost don't believe it wasn't running.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.260
Let's try it again.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.630
About two and a half seconds.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.600
Yeah.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.760
Sure.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.660
You know,
I saw you in the back of the room.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.570
I said I was going to open up the help,
and you got up to go to Jamba Juice.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.600
Figured you could make it back in
time before I was ready to talk again.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.300
It's much faster in Panther.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.380
We've done a lot of things
to really improve it,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.660
and I know that was a
much-needed improvement.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.060
We certainly are aware of that and have
heard it loud and clear from all of you.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.500
But that's not all.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.020
You'll notice as I mouse
over this sample page here,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.620
we're getting some text decoration,
and that's being accomplished.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.460
The links are underlining.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.570
That's being accomplished with CSS.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.370
There's a style sheet here that
specifies this text decoration.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.440
So Help Viewer now works with
cascading style sheets and HTML4.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.460
In fact, it works so well with web
standards that you can now go out

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.930
to the Internet and find a site
that generates content for you,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.350
creates HTML templates,
and use them yourself.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.260
Just to prove the point,
I went out and found such a site

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.260
and asked it to create a couple
of dummy help pages for me.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.690
Now, I don't necessarily recommend
these as great help layouts,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.650
but they do serve a
really interesting point.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.530
I'm going to show you how to create
a style sheet for your Mac OS X.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.160
This is HTML 4.0 with a style sheet.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.040
As I click these buttons here,
you'll notice that I'm getting

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.520
some nice rollover effects,
and lots of colors are changing,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.390
and content is rearranging
itself on the page.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.950
That's all accomplished through
CSS with the same body text appearing

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.970
in each one of these styles.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.400
This turns out to be really powerful
not just for web development,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.500
but for help development, too.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.710
Because the more you can do to separate
style and decoration from the content,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.660
the easier time you have
developing your content.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.500
So finally,
you can do that with Help Viewer.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.360
Another thing we support is JavaScript.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.300
So this is a very simple
JavaScript demonstration

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.490
downloaded from another website
and just dropped into Help Viewer.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.130
You'll notice that the time is
incrementing as I talk here.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.240
There are lots of things you can
do with JavaScript in the Help,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.330
and luckily they all just seem to work.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.940
I'll stop the timer there and start it.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.550
This go-back button isn't a
hard link to the previous page,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.910
but rather a JavaScript function
that tells the viewer to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.440
go back in its history,
to go back in time.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.300
And that works in Help Viewer
just as you'd expect it to.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.800
So finally, web standard support and
help viewer for Panther.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.880
Let's go back to slides.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.700
So how did we accomplish this?

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.530
Well, it's no secret if you've read
your program or have been

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.910
attending other sessions,
Help Viewer is now a client of WebKit.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.450
We're using the Safari technology
to support all of our HTML display.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.740
This gives us a lot of speed
and a whole lot of standards.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.480
Help Viewer now supports HTML 4.0.1.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.260
That includes frames
and tables and forms,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.260
something you couldn't
do in Help Viewer before.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.940
Cascading Style Sheets Levels 1, 2,
and 3, such as it is so far.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.880
JavaScript 1.4.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.100
DOM Levels 0, 1, and 2,
including some Microsoft DOM extensions.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.570
and support for Netscape Cookies,
Netscape-style plugins, Java applets,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.040
more character sets than
you can shake a stick at,

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.840
bidirectional text,
and contextual letter forms,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.340
whatever those are.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.280
Seriously, I probably don't even
have the complete list.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.220
What you should do,
since you're help authors,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.180
is go to the session noted there.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.750
It's session 411, Web Standards.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.440
It's 10.30 tomorrow morning.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.730
You'll hear from the Safari team,
from the people who implement WebKit,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.490
and all of the stuff they talk about.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.040
It works in Help now,
and you can use it when

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.470
you deploy Apple Help.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.640
And while you're there, say,
thank you for me.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.500
But there actually is
more to Help Viewer.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.640
We've done more than
just implement WebKit.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.020
We've made a number of changes that make
it so much faster and easier to use.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.160
We've updated and standardized
our download policy.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.300
Now, Help Viewer uses the Internet to
retrieve remote content.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.380
It wasn't very fast at that.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.340
And in fact,
sometimes we retrieve content

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.620
when it wasn't necessary.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.820
What we do now is we use the
cache more as you'd expect,

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.650
and we check the user's
network connection.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.850
If the user has a network connection
and has a good network connection,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.020
meaning that the servers
are responding quickly,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.470
then we will ask the server
if there is anything newer.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.680
And if there is something newer,
we download it and put it in the cache.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.970
If there isn't something newer,
then we show what we have

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.640
on the machine already,
that being either the cached

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.060
copy or the local copy that you
installed with your help system.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.020
This is a good change.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.060
It really speeds things up.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
So you might say that
we've changed everything.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.740
We certainly have made everything faster.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.220
And we've adopted a lot of
standards underneath the hood.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.590
Another thing that we've done is
we've improved launch time by changing

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.560
the way that index files are loaded.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.240
Now in Apple Help,
books are indexed for searching.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.180
That's how we get our
searching capability.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.360
And we're going to talk more
about searching in a few minutes.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.140
One change for Panther is that the
Help Viewer expects to find the

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.680
index for the book in the location
where the indexing tool put it.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.250
And it expects it to have the name
that the indexing tool created for it.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.500
So please don't change the
name of your index file.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.400
And don't change its location.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.920
Now if you do,
Help Viewer will still find it.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.620
It'll go traipsing through your
book and find what it needs.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.370
But as you can imagine,
that slows it down.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.130
So you can help all of us keep
Help Viewer faster by leaving

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.150
your index file as it was
created by the indexing tool.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.220
Now what I'd like to do is talk
about how to deploy Apple Help.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.470
Now the main point is that all of your
existing content continues to work.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.300
A book created for Apple Help in
Mac OS 8.5 works today.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.620
One thing you do want to do, though,
is look at your content using the help

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.140
viewer you have on your Panther CD.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.840
The renderer is different,
and every HTML renderer has

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.750
slightly different ideas about
font metrics and sizing and

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.690
placement and that sort of thing.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.200
So I'm very confident that what
you have is going to look good,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.780
but it might look a little different
than it does under previous

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.100
incarnations of the help viewer.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.930
So it would be a good idea to
look at it and see if you're

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.980
happy with it and maybe make any
HTML adjustments you feel are necessary.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.550
You'll also want to look
at your QuickTime movies.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.020
If you have QuickTime movies
in your Help,

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.890
they're still going to work.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.560
But previously, Help Viewer played
QuickTime files natively.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.990
Now,
Help Viewer uses the QuickTime plugin.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.290
This is a good thing because it
gives you lots more parameters you

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.110
can use with the embed command.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.090
The QuickTime plugin supports
all sorts of interesting options.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.560
You might want to take a look at those.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.840
Those are documented in QuickTime Help.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.440
And see if there are any you want to
take advantage of now with Panther.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.840
If you don't change anything,
you can expect your QuickTime movies

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.150
to behave as they did before.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.570
So that covers the changes
to Apple Help for Panther.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.680
Let's spend the next few minutes
talking about what Apple Help is,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.320
why you might want to use it,
and what you can do when you deploy

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.390
your help book to take advantage
of some of its unique features.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.940
So what is Apple Help?

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.440
Well, Apple Help is the help
system for Mac OS X.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.670
It's built in, and sort of the most
visible component of that,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.170
the thing that users interact with,
the thing that we all see,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.530
is the Help Viewer.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.200
The Help Viewer is an optimized,
lightweight HTML browser,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.720
and it's optimized for help delivery.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.630
What we've done is we've built in a
lot of features and a lot of careful

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.910
attention to the UI to make sure that
it's good for delivering help and it

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.460
provides a consistent user experience.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.680
If you went to John Glensy's
Adopting Aqua session yesterday,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.110
you might remember that he talked
about Apple Help as one of the key

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.710
components of Aqua and one of the
checklist points for ensuring that

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.890
you're providing a good Aqua experience.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.200
One of the reasons for that is that
users turn to help when they're the

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200
most frustrated with their computer.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.200
Most users don't read
the help just for fun.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.190
They do it to find out
an answer to a question.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.200
They're trying to accomplish something.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.200
They've reached an impasse.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.290
They're trying to use your UI or
they have another question and

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.190
they don't know how to proceed.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.140
So at that point, they come to the help.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.200
By coming to the help viewer,
they have a consistent user interface,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.190
one that they've seen before,
that behaves the way they expect,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:12.200
that provides lots of features,
one of which is full text searching.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.180
Our searching is relevancy ranked,
so when you type in your question,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.200
you get a nice list of results back.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.300
And the presentation of those results
is similar to what users experience in

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:28.200
other searching throughout the system,
such as the Finder and Sherlock and Mail.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.620
It's not a part of the user
interface that people have to

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.110
figure out because it's different
in help than it is anywhere else.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.400
Now our search engine is really fast,
and it's really pretty good.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:45.400
It supports natural language query,
so while you can type in "burn CD"

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.040
or "fire bad" if you're the Hulk,
I guess, it's better to type in something

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.780
like "how do I make a CD?

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.910
How do I record a CD?"
The Help Viewer will parse that

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.140
correctly and give you the results
in a nice relevancy-ranked way.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.440
Another feature of HelpViewer
is AppleScript-based automation.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.180
We have special help colon URLs that
can trigger an AppleScript.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.740
So if your application
is AppleScriptable,

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.010
you can provide links within your
help that automate actions for users.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.760
This is a great way to speed users
back into using the interface

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.270
and getting a problem solved.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.480
You can automate things
like changing preferences,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.930
opening preference dialogues,
completing tasks for the user and

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.640
so your instructions are shorter,
so they're less complicated,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.230
and you just have a better experience
with the help in your product.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.360
It's another great reason to make
your application AppleScriptable

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.360
because you can take advantage of
it yourself in your help system.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.840
We've talked a little bit about
the display of multimedia content.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.890
Help Viewer does that.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.000
It now uses plug-ins.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.650
QuickTime and Flash are built-in
because they're distributed

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.640
automatically with WebKit,
but as additional plug-ins

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.340
are loaded into WebKit,
they become available

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.580
for use in Help Viewer.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:06.940
This opens up a lot of interesting doors,
particularly if you're documenting

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.040
a high-end application and you
need a specialized plug-in to

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.170
display parts of your help content,
now you can do it.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.170
Gordon Meyer

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.170
HelpViewer also supports
remote and local content.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.770
This is a somewhat hidden
feature of the help,

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.200
but it's very powerful
as a software developer.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.030
This allows you to ship your
application's help with your product

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:33.470
and then continue to maintain that help
on the internet as you discover what

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.680
kinds of questions people are having,
as you discover mistakes

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.740
in the documentation,
or other enhancements you can make.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.980
You make these available to your
customers simply by updating the copy of

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.480
the help that's on your internet server.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.220
HelpViewer retrieves it for you and
displays it for the user when they

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.120
have a good network connection.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.110
We're going to talk a little
bit later how to best take

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.330
advantage of this feature of help.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.180
And finally, the last and perhaps most
important advantage of using

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.080
Apple Help is that there are
system-wide APIs for calling it.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.390
Certainly that's how the Help menu works,
which we're going to talk

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.810
about in a little bit,
but there are also other ways to talk

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.480
to Help Viewer that allow you to provide
a good help experience for your users

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:16.480
using things like Help buttons and so on.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.100
So, maybe I've sold you.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.380
You say, wow, Gordon, that's great.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.040
How do I make my Apple Help book?

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.810
How do I get started?

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.110
Well,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.000
It's really very easy,
and there are only four steps.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.980
So let's go over them.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.900
Step one is develop your help content.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.270
Write your HTML.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.920
Now,
you can do this in whatever authoring

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.060
tool you normally use-- BB Edit,
Dreamweaver, GoLive.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.900
And now, because we use WebKit and
support web standards,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.040
you can even use tools on other
platforms that create help.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.460
I know that a lot of you use
things like RoboHelp and so on.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.330
You can get them to output in a
format that supports web standards

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.630
and will now work in Help Viewer.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.340
So the only thing special
you have to do to your HTML,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.400
over and above writing it
like you normally would,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.760
is to add one meta tag.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.690
It's the Apple title meta tag,
and the value of the tag is

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.740
the name of your help book.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.180
Now, this is a really important value.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.840
You put this in the
start page of your book,

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.160
your home page,
whatever page it is that you want users

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.480
to see when they open Help Viewer.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.830
viewer.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.290
Add this tag, and it provides the name
of your book to the system,

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.140
and as we talk about some of the
other things that you need to do,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.400
you'll see why this Apple title
tag is so important.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.420
The nice thing about this,
because meta is a standard HTML tag,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.750
you can go ahead and
add it to your content,

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.460
and even if you deploy
that content elsewhere,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.960
such as on your website,
it won't interfere with anything.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:53.960
Browser is all expected,
and just ignore it.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.500
So after you've authored your
HTML and added that meta tag,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.960
step number two is to index
your help for searching.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.410
Our search engine works because
Help content is pre-indexed.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.970
To do this,
you use the Apple Help indexing tool,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.690
which you already have.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.590
It's installed in developer applications.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.900
There are a few preferences you
want to look at and decide to set.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.190
One is to enter a remote
route for your content.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.170
If you're going to put Help on the
Internet and you want it updated,

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:31.590
then you enter an HTTP path in
the indexing tool preferences.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.460
You want to select a
tokenizer for your language,

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.800
particularly if you're not using English,
which is the default.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.690
And you want to turn on anchor indexing.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.690
Now, anchor indexing is a very unique
way for the help viewer to find

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.690
content within your help book.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:51.720
We're going to talk about
it in a couple of minutes,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.690
but basically it allows you to call
an individual page in help without

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.690
having to know what file it appears in.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.680
So after you've set your preferences,
you take your folder full

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.120
of your HTML content,
and you drop it on the indexing tool.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.920
The indexing tool scans it all
and writes out an index file

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.220
that's used by the search engine.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.340
Now remember, it puts that index file in
the place where Help Viewer

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.860
is going to expect to find it,
and it gives it a name.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.710
The name is derived from
the folder-- the name of the

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.200
folder that you dropped on it.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.980
Help Viewer is going to look for
that file by that name when it loads.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.020
So please just leave it as
the index tool creates it,

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.040
and performance will be better.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.290
If you do change it,
your help will still work.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.200
It will just open a little bit
slower than we'd like it to.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.340
Step number three, that's a short one.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.450
After you've added the Apple meta
tag and you've indexed your content,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.220
then you put your content
inside your applications bundle.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.970
If it's a localized resource,
you want to add it in the

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.100
correct Lproj directory.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.060
Step number four,
this is hooking up your Help menu.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.980
Now, this is different
between Cocoa and Carbon.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.070
If you're a Cocoa application,
you add two keys to your info P list.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:15.870
CFBundle Help Book Folder,
which is the name of the help folder,

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.870
the name of the folder that
you dropped on the indexing

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.870
tool when you did the index.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.860
And the other key is
CFBundle Help Book Name.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.330
This matches the Apple title
that you put in the start page of

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.810
your help way back in step one.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.200
This is how the help viewer
associates the name of your book

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.630
with your application and the
name that you use in the APIs.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.530
It's pretty simple,
just add those two tags.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.590
Next, a cosmetic point,
but an important one.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.750
In Interface Builder,
you want to change the item in the

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.200
Help menu to match your application,
instead of the generic

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.650
name that Interface Builder
gives you automatically.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.500
Now, if you're a Carbon app,
you do it slightly different.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.740
You also add the two keys to your
info.p list that we just discussed,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.690
and then in your code,
after you're initialized,

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.760
call ahRegisterHelpBook,
and point to the bundle

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.340
that contains your help.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.700
This lets the help viewer and the
help system know about your book and

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.000
associate it with your application.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.530
On Carbon,
this call is taken care of automatically.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.430
In Cocoa,
it's taken care of automatically.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.910
Carbon, you make this call.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.000
Now the details and some sample
code about how to do this are

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.520
in the Apple Help tutorial.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.640
Rather than talk you through the code,
I want to refer you to there because

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.250
it covers all of these steps,
and it gives you some additional

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.570
information on the code.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.040
And you already have that tutorial.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.920
It's installed in developer
documentation on your systems.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.740
So to summarize, four steps.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.080
Create your content
and add an Apple Help,

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.080
an Apple title meta tag.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.740
Index your help so it can be searched.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.720
Install it in your applications bundle.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.090
And then hook up your help menu.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.900
And believe it or not,
you're done at that point.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.900
You have a full working help system.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.520
When you choose help from
your applications help menu,

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.830
help viewer will open,
display your content,

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.700
and people will be able to search it.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.110
You can maybe even go
home early that day.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.540
But I hope you won't,
because there's a few things

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.600
you can do to optimize your help
and make it a little bit better.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.880
So let's spend a little
bit of time on that.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.420
So one thing you can do to provide
a really good help experience is to

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.090
optimize your content for searching.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.020
As Scott Forstall mentioned
in his talk on Monday,

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.120
searching is really becoming a
ubiquitous way of accessing information.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.210
There's a lot of search
language in the interface and

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.910
a lot of consistent searching
experiences that counts for help.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.260
And when users are frustrated
and they're coming to help to

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.920
find an answer to the question,
they know what it is they're looking for,

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:51.330
typing in a few words gets them to the
answer in the most quickest way possible.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.660
But that puts the requirement on you as
the help author to make sure that people

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.490
can find your content by searching.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.200
There are a few things
you can think about doing,

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.570
one of which is to use
the robots meta tag.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:15.900
Robots is a standard meta tag
used by lots of search engines,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.750
not just ours.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.750
You can add it to your pages and
it will work if you also put your

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.750
help content on the Internet for
people to look at in their browser.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.100
Probably the most useful value for
this is the "noindex" robots tag.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:30.200
"Noindex" tells the search engine to
not index any content in that page,

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.200
to make this page
invisible for searching.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.200
So why would you want to do that?

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.170
Well, a couple of key reasons.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:42.200
One is you probably want to make your
Table of Contents page not searchable.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.880
It has a whole lot of words on it,
because it's your Table of Contents,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.190
it covers your entire helpbook,
and if people search and find that,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.330
it's not particularly helpful,
it just has a bunch more links and

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.200
it might not be clear which one of
those triggered the search result.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.200
So make your Table of Contents noindex.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.940
Another time you might want to do
this is if you have a series of pages

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.120
that you have people click through.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:10.200
Maybe you have four steps and
each step is on a separate page.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.150
When people are searching,
they might come into

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.900
step two on page two,
or step three on page three,

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.600
come in in the middle of
the procedure and be lost,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.090
and not really kind of say, well,
I don't understand what's going on here.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.730
So in that case,
you might want to add the

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.790
no index tag to pages two,
three, and four,

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:36.490
making sure that when people search,
they only find page one,

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:36.930
and they get started on the right step.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:44.450
There are some other values
that you can provide in robots,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.450
and those are keywords and anchors.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.450
So let's talk about those.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.990
Keywords are really important
because when people come

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.850
and enter search queries,
they're representing

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.400
the task as they see it.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:24:03.050
So you need to think about how are
users going to phrase questions,

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.780
what types of words are they
going to type in to look for

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:03.780
this particular help content.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.420
This is a way you can provide that
on the page in an invisible way.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.600
Keywords don't appear
to the user on the page.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.640
They're not rendered by the HTML,
but they're picked up

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.360
by the search engine,
and they're given the equal

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.380
weight of the rest of the content.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.710
So keywords aren't weighted more heavily.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.710
They're just treated as if they
appear on the page normally.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.900
But of course,
they don't appear on the page.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:30.900
And one of the most common uses for
this is misspelling or a synonym.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.910
Particularly in the technology world,
there's lots of technologies

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.520
that real people,
regular people don't

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.760
really know how to spell.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.480
And even something like rendezvous
can be challenging to spell

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.520
for an English-speaking user.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.590
So we try and keyword for
a misspelling for that.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.350
Also think about things
like disk and disks,

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.990
right?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.520
Hominems,
users might not be thinking of that one,

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.900
of what the correct form of the
spelling is when they're looking

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.040
for something related to that.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.410
Think about the range of users you serve,
someone phrasing in a question

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.200
from an expert's point of view,
or from a very novice point of view.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.960
You might want to include something
like silver round thingy for CDs,

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.430
which is what my
father-in-law calls them.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.340
So, keywords are important
things to add to your pages.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.040
You just add them in there
and do it once or twice.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.430
They stay there for the entire life
of your content and they're picked up

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.500
by the search engine automatically.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.080
Now, earlier I mentioned an example of
where you might have four pages

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:33.020
and you've no indexed pages two,
three and four, so they don't show up and

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.600
only page one shows up.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.530
Well, that's a good strategy,
but you do have to think about

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.900
what was on those three pages
you just blocked from the search

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.160
engine and are those words,
do those pages contain words

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.590
that users are going to want to
search for because they won't find

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.360
them if you've no indexed them.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.490
You want to take some of those key
phrases and use them as keywords on

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:59.600
that first page and that way people
will find that first page very easily.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.800
Another step you can do to make your
help work really well in a search

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.170
environment is to add page summaries.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.510
Now, page summaries are provided
with the description meta tag.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.430
And again, it's a standard HTML thing.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.540
Lots of search engines use description,
and so does Help Viewer.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.200
And in Help Viewer's case,
the description shows up in the search

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.300
results when the user clicks the result.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.740
You see a little preview of what it is
you might get when you click that page.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.390
This helps users decide if
they've gotten the right hit,

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.140
if that's the page that appears
to answer their question,

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.580
if that's one they want to look at.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.680
So these are easy to add.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.020
They do become searchable
content as well,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.880
so they'll generate hits.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.780
So again, think about how users might
be looking for your page,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.510
and think about an appropriate
summary that might give them the

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.160
answer they need without having to
actually visit the entire page itself.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.030
And by combining those two approaches,
you can make sure that the

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.340
search results work really well.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.390
So let's change gears a little bit
and talk about how to further connect

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.200
your application to the help system.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.520
We talked about how to
hook up your help menu,

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.720
and that's the minimum you should do.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.520
That works really well.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.040
You choose help from
your applications menu,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.550
and you have the help
viewer with your content.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.490
But there are other things you can
do to make sure that users get the

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.170
type of content they're looking for
depending upon the situation they're in.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.830
Now, there are basically three ways you
can call Help Viewer directly from

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.170
your app or from other places.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.950
You can use a help: URL.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.310
You can do this in any HTML anywhere.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.480
When the user clicks it,
Help Viewer will launch and

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.490
handle the URL that you asked for.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.660
You could use an Apple script,
tell Help Viewer to do something.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.730
And of course,
there are C APIs that trigger

00:27:59.730 --> 00:27:59.730
things to happen in the help.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.270
So what kind of things can
you do when you call the help?

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.980
Well, you can perform a search,
give it a search string,

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.500
a phrase to look for,
and you can specify what book to look in,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.940
whether it's your own book,
somebody else's if you

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.060
think it will be installed,
such as Mac Help,

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.700
or all of the books that
the help viewer knows about.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.520
You can also open a help book.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.250
It's a very simple call,
and when you do that,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.960
the help viewer opens to the page
that has your Apple title tag,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.080
your start page.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.400
Gordon Meyer

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.700
And you can display a
specific page in Help.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.580
So let's talk about that one.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.480
This is typically what you would
want to do from a Help button,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.130
as you see in the little
illustration there,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.500
a little round button
with a question mark.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.330
You use this to provide contextual help.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.480
This might appear on a
dialog or a preference pane,

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.880
and when the user clicks it,
they should see content that's specific

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.870
to what it is they're looking at,
content that's targeted to

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.750
the condition that they're in.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:01.230
So you can do that by
specifically calling a page.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.800
The best way to do that in
Help Viewer is to use an anchor.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.600
Now if you're an HTML author,
you're used to anchors being

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.160
A specific location on a specific page.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.800
Help Viewer treats them
a little bit differently.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:22.500
To help viewer,
an anchor is a thing that appears

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.300
on a page in your help book.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.190
You specify them using a standard
anchor syntax like you see there.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.520
When you index your content
and turn on anchor indexing,

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.670
these are noted by the indexing tool,
and Help Viewer resolves

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.570
the locations at that time,
saying, ah,

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.710
anchor foo appears on page 123 HTML.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.660
Then, when your application
tells the help viewer,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:52.610
"Hey, display the page with anchor
foo," it knows it's on 123

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.080
and displays the page for you.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.510
You make this call using ahlookup anchor.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:03.140
So one of the advantages of this is that
you don't have to think about what page,

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:07.360
what physical page in the file
system that anchor appears on.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.440
Those people who are authoring the help
can move the anchor from page to page.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.110
Even if that's you,
you can put on your other hat and move

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.540
the anchor from page to page without
ever having to go back and change the

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.910
application to point to a different file.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.770
Another advantage this gives you
is that Help Viewer resolves this

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.760
anchor in the correct language.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.300
So if you've localized your book
and the user is running in Spanish,

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.750
when you ask for this anchor,
the Help Viewer will display the

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.760
Spanish page that has this anchor.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.870
Let's shift gears again and talk
about remote and local content.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:51.300
I've mentioned that we've optimized
Panther a number of ways to

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.460
make this work a lot better.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.090
Users no longer have to wait for content
to be downloaded from the Internet,

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.180
and that's a good thing.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.740
We've moved all the downloading
off into the background.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.030
So what does Help Viewer
do in this regard?

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.840
It's even more invisible now.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.300
Well,
there's basically two things that happen.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.780
One is that if you have provided
a remote route for your help book,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.960
and again,
a remote route is just an HTTP location

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.980
somewhere on the Internet.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.130
If the user is connected to
the Internet and they have

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.370
a good network connection,
then Help Viewer is going to

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.220
look at your remote route,
and see if there's a newer

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.850
index file for your book.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.230
If there is a newer index,
then it brings that index down

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.060
and caches it for the user.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.290
What this allows you to do is
continue to change and refine

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.460
your help content over time.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.130
You can remove pages, and to do that,
you re-index your,

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.080
you remove the HTML file
from your help book,

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.070
re-index the book,
and then put that new index

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.190
file out on the Internet.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.470
When users pull it down,
because all searching is

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.930
done through the index,
that page is now essentially

00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.930
invisible to your users.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.930
Gordon Meyer

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.500
More likely you can add pages.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.680
If there are pages you didn't
have done or you didn't think of,

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.850
or you want to improve,
you can put those on the

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:12.900
internet at your remote route,
re-index your help content,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.550
put the new index on the internet,
help viewer will retrieve

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.000
it automatically for
users who can get to it,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.360
and those new pages become
available to the user.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.310
They now show up in search results.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.660
Now those new pages are on
the internet and they do have

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.400
to be connected to view them.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.030
But when they do view them,
they'll be cached and saved for

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.000
the user for future reference.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:42.220
So that's automatic index updating and
how it works and the benefit it provides.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.600
Another level of Internet support in
Help Viewer is called Internet Primary.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.690
This is different than index updating.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:57.700
When you turn on the
Internet Primary checkbox for your book,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:57.700
and you do this in the indexing tool,
there's a preference for it,

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.910
This tells the help viewer to
prefer the content you have at your

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.500
remote root over the local content.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.640
When the user requests a page,
when they click on a link,

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.590
help viewer will check to see if
they have a good network connection,

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.370
and if they do,
it will check on the server to

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.860
see if the page they're looking
at is newer on the server,

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:21.860
and if it is,
then that page will be displayed.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.100
If they're not connected,
or they don't have a good connection,

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.130
then it looks in the cache to see if
it has a copy that it previously got,

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.290
or it defaults to the local
content that is installed

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.700
inside your applications bundle.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.540
This is a really interesting
feature of HelpViewer,

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.850
and it's one that's quite powerful,
although I found in talking to lots of

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.380
developers over the last year since we've
added this to HelpViewer that it kind

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.140
of requires a little shift in mindset
in terms of thinking about having content

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.720
done and shipped with the product and
then continue to maintain it over time.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.940
But it's nice because it allows
your help content to be as fresh

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.920
and as up-to-date and as correct
as people expect from the web,

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.730
but here they're actually experiencing it
directly from your application instead of

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:14.180
having to go off on a website and visit
your support site to get the latest info.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.680
Now if you're going to do remote content,
there's a couple things to keep in mind.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.760
It's really good to think about
organizing your content so

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.010
it's a single topic per page.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.760
Now this is really
good for searching too,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.990
because remember in search results,
what the user sees in the results

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.980
list is the title of the page.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:39.030
If you have several topics on that page,
that puts a lot of burden on the

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:43.820
title of the page to kind of convey to
the user what all is included there.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.190
If you break it up,
then it's easier to write a good

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.940
title and so people understand what
it is they're looking at and whether

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.170
or not they want to view the page.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.280
Well, short pages with a single topic
are good for remote content,

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.740
too, because they're shorter
and they download faster.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.520
Another thing you can do is
to set your cache periods.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.930
Now previously,
Help Viewer would delete items from

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:14.200
the cache after three days unless
they specified a cache retention

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.340
period using the cache meta tag.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.390
And the cache meta tag
provides an expiration date.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.400
It's kind of like the
date on a carton of milk.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.740
It tells Help Viewer when this page
is bad and should be discarded.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.100
Now caching works a
little bit differently.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.880
Since caching is handled
through WebKit and the

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.330
other changes in the system,
cached pages stick around

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.940
when there's space.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.690
And if space needs to be created,
then pages that specified

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.930
expiration dates are removed first.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.240
So if you want a page that you want
to make sure sticks around and doesn't

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.670
get deleted because space is needed,
you don't have to think in

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.780
terms of three days anymore.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:59.760
You just have to think of,
I want this page to stick around,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:35:59.760
so I'm going to give it an
expiration date in the future.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.270
It's okay to do that because in
an Internet primary situation,

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.910
we'll still do a compare
of the page to the server,

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:09.190
and if there's a newer one,
we'll still get the

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.880
newer page if it exists.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.170
Otherwise,
we'll use the one in the cache.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.630
There's also some other cache directives,
and these are standard HTML things.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:23.860
You can tell it to never cache a page,
which might be appropriate on a

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:30.380
late-breaking news page or something that
you want to get out to users temporarily,

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.010
but you think you're
going to get rid of later.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:39.060
You can also tell it to keep a page
nearly indefinitely by changing

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.950
the cache expiration date to
something very far in the future.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.040
Finally,
if you're going to use remote content,

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.680
think about the graphics
that you're using.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:52.110
You ship a large graphic that displays
in Help just fine with local content

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.970
but in an Internet primary situation,
if you have modified that

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.240
graphic on your web server,
HelpViewer is going to see that

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.780
it's newer and it's going to want
to download it and of course,

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:04.870
if it's a big graphic,
then it will take longer to download.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.530
Just something to keep in mind in regards
to Internet primary that eventually,

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.070
if you maintain it on the Internet,
as you've planned,

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.160
you will be triggering downloads
for people and you might want to

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.890
think about how big those are.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.740
So, in summary, we've made a lot of
changes to Help Viewer.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.050
Most of them have been very long
sought after and are very exciting.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.210
It's now much faster than
it ever has been before.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.600
It uses HTML standards,
which opens up a lot of new

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.700
doors for content development,
makes it much easier to deploy your

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:50.730
Apple Help because you can use authoring
tools that understand and create

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:57.600
HTML that was invented after 1996,
and it's smarter about Internet usage.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.280
In addition,
if you've been thinking about

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.810
using Apple Help and you weren't
really sure what it was all about,

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.350
I hope you've seen that
it provides a nice,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.280
consistent user experience,
has a lot of interesting help

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.700
features that are optimized
for delivering content,

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:17.700
and it's very easy to
author and implement.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:17.700
It's essentially four
steps to deployment.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.990
Now some of the details I've
glossed over a little bit,

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.010
but that's because you already
have them available to you and

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.800
they're very straightforward.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:32.490
You have documentation installed in your
system under Developer Documentation.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.790
You should also visit
the Apple Help website,

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.760
which is at ADC, under User Experience.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.880
There's a lot of references there,
some additional documentation,

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:42.880
and some pointers.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.990
And if you do have
questions and comments,

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.580
here's how you can get a hold of
the Apple Help Engineering team.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.060
Apple Help comments at group.apple.com.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.150
It's a group mailing address,
and so we all read it.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.010
We can't promise a reply,
but I do promise that we read

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.080
them all and take them seriously.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:03.920
And you can visit the
Help Authoring Mailing List.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.080
This is a public list.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.560
It's very low traffic.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.330
Go to list.apple.com and sign up for it.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.000
There are a lot of Apple Help authors
on there who have tried various things

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.640
and know lots of ways to deliver help.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.530
Post a question,
and you'll probably get an answer.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.360
If you don't post anything,
you may think the list isn't

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.220
working because there's
not a lot of traffic on it,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.580
but generally people who
use it get what they need.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.990
And several members of the
engineering team monitor that list.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.850
John Galenzi,
who is off busily preparing for the

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:46.070
spectacular Apple Design Awards,
which take place this evening,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.310
is our contact person.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:50.300
Information about your needs
in Apple Help and future

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:50.300
directions that you'd like to
see should be emailed to him.
