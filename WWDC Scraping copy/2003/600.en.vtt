WEBVTT

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.710
Thank you,
and I want to welcome you to the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.180
Enterprise IT track of Apple's 2003
Worldwide Developer Conference.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.180
Today, what we'd like to do
is review what Apple,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.140
our customers, and you, our developers,
have been doing with Apple and the

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.790
Enterprise over the last 12 months.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.690
We also have a special guest,
Tom Yaeger from InfraWorld,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.530
who is going to give us his perspective
on Apple and the Enterprise.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.760
And finally,
we're going to get a sneak preview

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.950
of Apple OS X Panther for servers.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.700
So, let's get right into it.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.300
A little background first.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.300
IT technology decisions are made
today in a very difficult environment,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.420
and any of you involved in IT, I'm sure,
realize this.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.860
The IT managers are being
asked to do more with less.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.630
Licensing costs seem to keep rising.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.580
Maintenance costs seem to keep rising.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.410
The only thing that doesn't seem to rise
very much is the economy these days.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.120
And in this challenging environment,
one of the key decisions being faced by

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.650
IT managers is the following dilemma.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.830
Everyone would like to
have the flexibility,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.540
the low cost,
the freedom to choose vendors,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.240
the freedom to choose the right tool
for the job that you get by basing

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.440
your environment on open standards,
multi-vendor,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.600
and heterogeneous solutions.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
However, this comes with a cost,
because some assembly is required.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.350
Putting together things in
your own shop takes time,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.210
takes money, and so it's incredibly
tempting for people to go

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.310
with a single vendor solution,
where that single vendor

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.060
will integrate things,
make it reliable, hopefully,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.800
and the downside of that is
that you lose flexibility,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.180
and you lose some potential cost savings,
and these days cost

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.510
savings are pantomount.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.430
Now, over the last five or so years,
open source-based solutions are

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.580
increasingly seen as an alternative
to the status quo of just writing

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.330
your check to your vendor every year.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.020
Now, open source, by definition,
drives you to an environment

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.570
with open standards,
multi-vendor, and heterogeneity.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.870
Open source means that you're
going to spend some of your

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.140
time putting things together,
making sure that they're

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.390
managed properly,
installing them.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.030
You're dealing, by definition,
with a heterogeneous system.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.000
The real challenge here is
to get those benefits of open

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.240
source without a huge cost.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.420
Now the benefits are, I think, huge.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.650
Over the past 20, 30 years,
software has been developed

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.450
in the same way that,
you know, a few minor changes that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.990
This change is now noticed
big time by the IT industry.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.690
Why?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.370
Well, number one, cost savings.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.700
Or I should say perceived cost savings,
because the price tag on

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.190
open source seems great.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.750
And we'll come back to that issue.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.950
Number two, by its very nature,
by the development

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.040
process of open source,
open source tends to be interoperable.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.090
They tend to hew very
closely to open standards.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.250
Apple has responded to
various cert alerts.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.590
We tend to respond extremely quickly
to those things because of the open

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.480
source underpinnings of Mac OS X.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.370
Another big benefit is code reuse.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.440
And code reuse goes without
saying in the open source world.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.940
And as you all know,
the best code and the most

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.840
efficient code is the code
that you didn't have to write.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.530
And in the open source world,
the ability to go and grab

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.000
something from one project and
reuse it in another project is key.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.990
And then finally, a deep talent pool.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.430
You are leveraging with open
source a talent pool of over a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.220
million programmers worldwide
contributing to various projects.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.630
And in fact,
there's increasing numbers of

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.220
people that you can hire in your own
IT shops who know and love open source

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.920
and can manage that Apache server
pretty much in their sleep.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.470
So it's really a myth that you
can't find people to manage these

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.940
Unix or open source programs.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.160
Now, over the last five years,
the same five years that we've

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.500
been developing Mac OS X,
open source has virtually exploded.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.860
And up on the screen are
just a few of the literally

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.140
thousands of projects out there.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.420
If you go to SourceForge and you
do a search on open source projects

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.850
on SourceForge for Mac OS X,
today there are over

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.280
1,300 projects there,
ranging from huge projects

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.060
to small projects,
but really it's a testament to

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.970
the activity in this environment.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.020
The price tag looks
right for open source,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.100
but it can sometimes
come with a hidden cost.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.560
And the hidden cost is that
there is some assembly required.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.660
And that means that it's not always
delivered with the management tools,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.550
with the vendor backing,
with the integration out of the

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.860
box that you would like to have,
and so that creates more work for you.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.700
In a perfect world,
what you would have is you would

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.700
have all of the benefits of open
source that we just talked about,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.090
plus the reliability and support
that you get from a major vendor,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.080
plus ease of deployment, installation,
management,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.520
etc., all of the fit and finish things.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.780
And if you had all those together,
you would achieve the nirvana of

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.640
lower total cost of ownership.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:08:11.300
[Transcript missing]

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.620
So this is our strategy.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.300
Leverage open source,
not just in the product,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.690
but outside the box.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.600
Let you leverage open source.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.960
And what we add is the fit and
finish of a commercial product,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.080
the management tools,
the installation tools, everything,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.430
so that your total cost
of ownership goes down.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.800
Now this strategy is
reflected in our products.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.110
It's reflected in our
software with Mac OS X,

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.770
Jaguar going to Panther.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.460
It's reflected in our hardware products
from laptops to XServe to XServe RAID.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.720
And it's reflected in
our service offerings.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.660
Service offerings we know need to
be different for the enterprise.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.330
This is an area where we are investing,
and will continue to

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.680
invest in the future.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.700
So let's start out by
looking at software.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.870
As was mentioned this morning by Steve,
Mac OS X is Unix-based.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.730
And it's not just any Unix.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:14.640
It is industrial-strength BSD Unix,
together with CMU Mach,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.470
to provide a highly
responsive environment,

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.910
not just for servers,
but also for clients.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.640
A key feature,
or a key thing to remember here,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.270
is that we use exactly the same
source code base when we build

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.340
Mac OS X Server as we do Mac OS X client.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.280
It's the same kernel.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.480
This is important because it
makes sure we don't have to

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.490
split our engineering resources.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.020
And as we fix bugs or security
issues in one product,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.120
they get automatically
fixed in the other product.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.620
And the two leverage each other.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.990
And it allows us to move very
quickly to add new features to

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.090
the Unix base of our system.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.000
Now, on top of this,
Apple has done something that

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.210
nobody else has been able to do,
even though many people

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.280
have tried over the years,
which is on top of a

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.880
Unix-based underpinning to
add state-of-the-art graphics,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.070
frameworks,
and user interface support on the client.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.120
So graphics, as you heard this morning,
state-of-the-art support for OpenGL,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.320
for PDF-based graphics, for 2D graphics,
frameworks from Cocoa to

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.840
Carbon to Java frameworks,
and then user interface,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.780
our killer Aqua user interface.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.880
And wait till you get a
chance to try-- I love Expose.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.040
It's going to be a godsend
on the user interface.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.620
Now, on top of these frameworks,
Apple integrates in the

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.640
box useful applications.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.910
And we all know and love-- there's
a ton of applications in there,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.380
including the iLife applications.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.700
But what I want to focus on are
the end user applications that

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.500
are important to the enterprise.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.000
In fact,
they're critical to the enterprise.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.790
They're end user applications
that mission critical in

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.790
any enterprise I know of.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.150
First of all, mail.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.060
So Apple has a great mail client,
just got a whole lot better in Panther.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:16.350
Integrates IMAP support, POP support,
can interact with any mail server

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.300
based on those two standards out there.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.960
Starting with Panther, can support SSL.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.750
So we're taking the mail app forward,
and we'll continue to support that

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.320
mission-critical app in the Enterprise.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.390
Address Book integrates with LDAP,
and more and more corporations

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.980
are moving to base their addresses
and employee information on LDAP.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.090
Address Book accesses all
that information seamlessly.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.930
Safari, I just,
I want to spend a little bit more

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.900
time on Safari because you don't
often think about it this way,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.090
but the web browser is actually
a mission-critical application

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.320
for the enterprise these days.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.970
As applications get
deployed to the desktop,

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.320
whether it be Oracle or
PeopleSoft or other applications,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.380
the browser is actually often the
front end of those applications.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.110
Now, to me, the exciting thing is this.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.450
In the past,
when we worked with enterprise

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.750
software developers like
Oracle or like PeopleSoft,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:16.550
they would come to us and say, well,
this doesn't work quite right on

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.840
Internet Explorer or on Netscape.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.890
And we would sort of
look at them and say,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.740
well, yeah,
we wish that would work better, too.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.860
It's a totally different
ballgame now with Safari.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.820
Safari's based on
open-source project HTML.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.550
We take that in-house.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.240
We add all the
Safari underpinnings around that.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.360
That is totally under our
control now to make it the best

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.370
and fastest browser on the Mac.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.170
And the conversations now that
we have with enterprise software

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.430
developers like PeopleSoft and
Oracle are totally different because

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.360
when they come to us and say,
we'd like to make sure that PeopleSoft

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.500
works really great with Safari,
we say, great, no problem.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.350
We're going to fix Safari to
work the best it can possibly

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.720
work with PeopleSoft.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.600
And you have PeopleSoft now announcing
they're going to qualify on Safari.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.110
So the world for enterprise
browsers on the Mac just got a

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.710
whole lot better with Safari.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.070
Java, of course,
Apple is recognized for having

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.980
the best client implementation of
Java Standard Edition out there,

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.340
not just by us,
but by others in the industry,

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.360
including Sun Microsystems.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.150
Java is the application
language of choice for many

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.680
places in the enterprise today,
not just on the client,

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.450
but on the server as well.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.090
And last but not least,
that key mission-critical

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.450
client-side application,
which is Microsoft Office.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.460
And the Mac business
unit continues to work,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.390
continues to invest in Microsoft Office.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.410
That will, you know,
it's very interesting because we are

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.950
the only Unix-based system out there
that also runs Microsoft Office.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.900
One of the things that this has done
for us is that anybody who needs

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.250
to run Unix for whatever reason,
in the past,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.810
they would typically have a PC sitting
right next to it because they

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.650
also had to run Microsoft Office.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.900
With the Mac,
those two systems collapsed.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:16.670
And that's a major place where we're
making inroads in the enterprise.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:24.650
So let's shift gears for a
bit to Mac OS X Server Jaguar.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:31.780
Mac OS X Server packages just a
ton of services that can run on any

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:37.070
server installation in the Enterprise,
and has those key services that

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.090
are important to the Enterprise.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.340
I'll just go through a few of those.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.210
In the area of security, we run Kerberos.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.110
I'm going to go into a lot
more detail later on Kerberos,

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.050
but Kerberos is key to single sign-on.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.650
Just leave that there for now.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.090
Come back to it.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.070
Directory, of course,
almost any enterprise today

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.330
has a LDAP directory server,
either LDAP or Active Directory,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.340
which is really kind of a flavor of LDAP.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.090
Web services, we have Apache,
which is the leading web

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.470
server on the planet,
supporting HTTP and all the

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.770
modules that you would want to
support things like SOAP and XML,

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.790
RPC, and things like that.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.190
Mail,
a very nice mail server supporting IMAP,

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.720
POP, and web mail.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.620
File service,
every file service known to man from

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.060
AFP to SMB with Samba to NFS to FTP.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.620
Print service with CUPS print serving.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.200
Internet printing protocol, LPR,
which Unix people know and love,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.900
Apple Talk printing.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.140
And finally, last but not least,
secure shell login,

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.140
remote login with SSH.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.610
Now, an important issue here
is that Apple doesn't just

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.570
take all of... You know,
these are all the things that we're

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:51.770
going to talk about in a minute.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.730
These are mostly open source projects.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.200
So we have leveraged
them into the product,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.110
but we don't just take the
projects and toss them onto

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.850
the CD and ship them to you.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.430
We actually spend a lot
of time integrating them,

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.060
making sure they perform well,
making sure that they're QA'd,

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.530
making sure that our management
tools can manage all these things.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.020
So that's the major advantage of
getting this from Apple versus just

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.780
trying to assemble your own out on
the web on something like Linux.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.180
Next.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.150
Now, to do this,
we provide management tools.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.270
We provide GUI management tools
for remote management of all the

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.840
services you saw on the last slide.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.460
In doing so,
we also make sure that we continue

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.170
to support terminal-based or
command line tool management,

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.750
because there are many people
out there that still like

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.170
to manage things that way.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.920
So we don't disable that branch
of managing all of these services.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.670
You can take your pick,
choose whatever works best for you.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.260
We also support SNMP for our
products so that the tools from

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:04.360
other major management vendors,
such as Tivoli, HP with OpenView, or CA,

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.590
those projects are enabled to manage
the SNMP aspects of our products.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.400
So we have really complete
management solution,

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:20.060
and I'll talk a bit after Tom speaks
in some of the very exciting directions

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.080
we're going to be taking there.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.240
Tools for the Enterprise.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.880
A complete set of tools for
almost every kind of application

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.800
you'd like to develop.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.360
Here we show WebObjects.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.000
We include MySQL in the box for database.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.180
Java, of course, is on our server.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.570
You can have Java from us.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.870
You can also get third-party
products like JBoss and use them

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.240
to develop EJB applications.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.710
Tomcat for Java server pages,
and of course,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.030
Apache World Class Web Server.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.080
So, no matter what kind of
a developer you are,

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.160
you're going to find tools,
and the session right after this

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.640
will give some of the Java tools,
an overview for some of the Java tools,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.720
but we've got J2SC,
JBoss is a third-party product,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:15.660
web applications, Safari, JBoss,
WebObjects, Apache, Tomcat, scripting,

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:20.540
every scripting language known to man,
and then some, are on the box.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:29.100
So, AppleScript, Ruby, Tickle, PHP, Perl,
TCSH, so if you like scripting,

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.130
you'll feel like you've
died and gone to heaven.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.180
And scripting is really the
backbone of many IT shops,

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.900
so that's a very important thing
we're doing for the enterprise,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.300
and just making sure all of
those scripting languages run

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.670
seamlessly out of the box.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.940
For open source developers,
now traditionally open source is

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.250
developed with some very vanilla tools.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.600
The GNU toolchain.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.200
So, GCC, GDB, et cetera.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.500
Often these projects
are maintained in CVS.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.670
What we've done is with Xcode,
we're really wrapping

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.270
around those GNU tools.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.290
So,
you can develop your open source projects

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.570
with Xcode and gain all the advantages
of an integrated development environment,

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.140
but still stick to the tools
that are tried and true in

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.070
the open source community,
GDB, GCC, et cetera.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.480
Then finally, for commercial developers,
which a lot of you are, Cocoa, Carbon,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.060
Xcode, and so on.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.160
So, you can develop your open
source projects with Xcode,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.160
and gain all the advantages of an
integrated development environment,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.160
but still stick to the tools
that are tried and true in

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.160
the open source community,
GDB, GCC, et cetera.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.160
Then finally, for commercial developers,
which a lot of you are, Cocoa, Carbon,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.160
Xcode, and so on.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.560
Cocoa, Carbon, Xcode, and so on.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.040
Cocoa, Carbon, Xcode, as the IDE, Java,
WebObjects, MySQL.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.360
So, what you end up with is
really a killer developer box.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.670
There are people I've talked to who
make their living doing consulting,

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.240
writing applications.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.680
They fly around on the plane.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.140
They develop Java application
in their seat on their tie book.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.190
When they get off the plane,
they install it on a WebLogic EJB server,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.110
and they're off and running.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.160
So, killer box for development.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.720
Talk a bit about hardware.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.160
We have Xserve and Xserve RAID.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.870
Talk a bit about Xserve first.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:01.380
Xserve is an extremely
cost-effective one-use server.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:08.420
It's highly optimized for a part of
the market that's very close to us,

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.560
which is the entertainment
industry and the biotech industry.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.560
In the entertainment industry,
pan-amount in that

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.320
industry is IO throughput.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.030
So what you'll find on XServe is a
huge focus on ins and outs to the box.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:29.400
So dual gigabit Ethernet built in,
dual port, 800 FireWire built in,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:36.000
optional optical connect
to your disk drive,

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.900
just huge torrents of bits
coming in and out of the server.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.390
XRAID partners with that.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.410
We're able to do that by
providing world-class storage,

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.580
XServe RAID storage,
but at a price that really

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.380
changed the industry.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.490
The price per megabyte is under
a half penny per megabyte.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:01.670
So a gigabyte for like $4.30
or something like that.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:08.420
You can get two and a half terabytes for,
I think it's $10,999, $10,999.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.400
And I don't know what you're going
to do with two and a half terabytes.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.520
We have customers that
are definitely doing it.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:22.100
If you downloaded every song
from the iTunes music store,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.940
that would be about a terabyte.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.630
So there's a good use for it.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:32.780
All of these servers remotely manageable
through remote management tools.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.860
So again,
Apple putting the fit and finish and

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.830
the management together with these
things so that your total cost of

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.240
ownership and deployment goes down.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.720
Finally, AppleCare.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.020
And as I mentioned,
there's a special version of

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.680
AppleCare that is specifically for the
servers and aimed at the enterprise,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.540
and this is an area of
continued investment for Apple.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.810
Let's talk a bit about some of our
enterprise partners that have come

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.060
online over the past 12 months or so.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.330
Today, we have some great
announcements from partners.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.890
Oracle has announced that the
next-- 9i was such a hit that they

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.580
have announced the next version
of the Oracle database server is

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.240
going to be targeted at the Mac.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.250
They're going to do a Mac version,
including RAC support.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.600
RAC, for those of you who know,
is their clustered Oracle server.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.530
So this is going to be a killer box,
extremely cost effective.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:34.810
Let's see, we also have announcements
from BusinessObjects and

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.540
WebMethods and iAnywhere.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.960
Take a look at your packs,
and you'll see some very

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.320
key announcements of
support for Safari targeting

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.300
Mac OS Server with their products.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.280
So we expect continued momentum.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.280
If you look over the past 12 months,
we've had announcements and

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.990
progress from all of these partners.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.680
I want to just mention one enterprise
partner that I think is key,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.640
which is Microsoft.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.590
And as was announced previously,
Microsoft is hard at work in

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:14.460
their business unit working on
Microsoft Exchange support for the Mac.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.560
And this is on track with
Exchange support in Entourage,

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.600
you're going to be able to
hookup to an Exchange server,

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.030
do all of your email,
do all of your scheduling,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.530
do all of your address book.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:30.920
So for those enterprises where you
absolutely must be on an Exchange server,

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.640
we will have from
Microsoft complete support there.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.700
And the Mac business unit there
is really excited about it,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.560
and so are we,
because as you probably know,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.190
this is a big request from
a lot of our customers.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.540
Let's talk about customers.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.610
We sell into several
enterprise markets today.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.020
Entertainment is a huge one for us.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.000
The entertainment industry
has need for huge storage,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.360
huge bandwidth requirements,
as I mentioned.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:02.860
Life Sciences was really a sleeper,
but it has really exploded

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.300
over the last year or so.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.710
Couple reasons for this.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:12.100
One is that they can really benefit
from the clustering of 1U Mac servers,

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.860
and there's a lot of clustering
activity going on because

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.960
they have massive databases to
search with the human genome,

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.010
and being able to cluster systems
to do that in parallel is just

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.880
fitting like a glove with biotech.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.650
We do that really well.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.190
Another big reason why biotech and
life sciences have taken off is

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:33.660
because many of those applications
were developed as open source projects.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:34.910
So guess what?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.300
When OS X came out,
those open source projects just

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.630
gravitated immediately to OS X.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.190
The porting of those
things was fairly trivial.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.380
They all showed up.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.640
Life Sciences has taken to Mac OS X,
and our products are

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.340
like a fish to water.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.970
Higher education has
always been strong for us.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.340
Now, with one-to-one ratios of
Macs or PCs to students,

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.610
these really face all -- the enterprise
challenges faced by an IT manager

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.050
are the same as the ones faced in
universities and higher education.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.130
So a lot of the products
we're talking about are very

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.950
appropriate to that market.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.420
And last but not least, government.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.180
Government's always been fairly strong,
and they've been strong for us.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.360
It is with Mac OS X being Unix-based,
being highly secure,

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.020
being open source-based,
it's just taking off like a rocket.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.780
And government, of course,
is the ultimate MIS shop,

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.170
and they are very picky,
and we are pleased to be able to sell

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.510
a great product into that market.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.980
One market that is fairly new for us,
and then I'll just

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.700
delve into a little bit,
is financial services.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.230
And this is an emerging market for us.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.410
It's not been strong in the past,
but with our server

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.070
products and Mac OS X,
this has a lot of promise for us.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.820
I'll just give you one example,
and that's RiskWise.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:02.040
RiskWise is a company
that manages credit risk.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.500
And what they do is they
have huge databases of your,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.660
mine,
everybody's credit card transactions,

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.180
and they attempt to determine from
that database what your likelihood is

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.040
of paying your next monthly statement.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.280
Very interesting business.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.290
In order to do this,
they have to do it in real time.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:25.030
So they have 190 XSERV systems
and growing very rapidly.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.420
They have 15 XSERV RAID systems,
storing everybody's

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.900
credit card information.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.080
They do over a million
transactions processed every day.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.160
Five nines availability
is an absolute must.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.360
And low entry cost and ease
of use of using Apple give

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.820
RiskWise a competitive advantage.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.270
And here's what they say.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.700
They can do transaction processing
for a fraction of the cost of most

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.740
credit bureaus with an Apple solution.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.860
They are pleased as
punch with this solution.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.540
And the surprising thing to some
people who don't know what we've

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.960
been doing with Jaguar and Unix,
et cetera,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.720
is they achieve their five nines uptime.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.980
This system just keeps running.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.850
It does not go down.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.510
If it did, their business would tank.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.020
So they placed a big bet on us,
and guess what?

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.830
We've come through with flying colors.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.080
Another example I'll delve into
is in the life sciences market.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.140
This is University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.770
And they have a program there
in what's called Protonomics.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.920
You've probably heard of genomics
where you study the genome,

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.460
DNA and the human genome.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.970
Protonomics takes it one step further.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.850
They take a cell and find all of
the protein fragments in that cell,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.530
and then they match up those protein
fragments against the entire 3 billion

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.070
base pairs in the human genome.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.900
Obviously,
that takes a lot of processing power.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.840
So what they've set up,
they have a 42 XSERV cluster running.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.040
They do queries on 30.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.410
They do queries on thousands
of proteins simultaneously,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.220
and the results are delivered in minutes.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.480
This is used for both diagnosis
as well as for drug discovery.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.560
So one of the things that brought them
to the platform was the incredibly

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.100
simple cluster management administration,
which lowers their

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.360
total cost of ownership.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.240
And here's what they say.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.900
They wanted plug-and-play solution
that was cost-effective in the

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.010
intermediate computing needs.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.200
So it's interesting to see plug-and-play
applied to clustered servers.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.060
That's the place where
XServe and Apple fits well,

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.210
especially with their new cluster nodes.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.590
So another example of very
large-scale computing done with

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.960
the products that we put together.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.820
Now I'd like to introduce Tom Yaeger,
our special guest speaker.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:50.020
Now Tom comes with a background of
over 25 years in the IT industry.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.790
He started out as a programmer,
progressed through the ranks,

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.040
became a CIO,
and over the course of that published

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.760
three books and hundreds of articles,
and he ended up going to InfoWorld,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.280
where he brought his
experience with IT and IT IT.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.900
management, and he maintains a very
close tie to the IT world.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.390
What he's going to do is give us his
perspective on Apple in the enterprise.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.020
So Tom, welcome.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.270
Tom Yaeger

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.570
I'll tell you,
it was worth sitting on a three-hour

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:38.560
flight here from Dallas-Fort Worth just
to listen to the keynote this morning.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.360
That's always true at Apple conferences,
and I love to see how Apple dropkicks

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.660
the rumor rags consistently every
time it throws one of these events.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.180
It's a lot of fun.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:58.710
I started my IT career back in 1979.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:07.550
I was hacking PDP-11's white hat,
and I'm fully rehabilitated.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:14.860
And I was also writing business
software for the Z80 microcomputer

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.930
using assembly language.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:23.810
So you Cocoa and Objective-C people don't
know the meaning of the word hardcore,

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.200
as far as I'm concerned.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:34.020
Now, I spent my career doing that,
and in 1982,

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.310
something happened that changed my life.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.440
I received the shipment of a
machine called the Model 16.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.620
It was made by RadioShack,
and it was running a little

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.580
operating system I'd never
seen before called Xenix.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:54.770
Xenix was made by an obscure
little company called Microsoft,

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.140
and it was,
at the time of its introduction,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.560
the first microprocessor Unix ever.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.590
And I immediately fell in love with it.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.100
I wanted to do the scripting,
I wanted to do the time sharing,

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.600
I loved the C programming language.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.590
So I bought into it completely.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.600
And that started my 20-year career.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.170
Odyssey with Unix.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:28.620
Now, in the early 90s,
an interesting thing happened.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.110
While I was in the interim
between Xenix and this development

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.510
I'm about to talk about,
I went through several flavors

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.770
of Unix and settled on one
that was my absolute favorite,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.020
which is BSD.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.360
If you talk to anybody
who is truly in Unix,

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.030
they will tell you that
BSD is the true Unix.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.010
I'll talk about the history
of System 5 a little bit,

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:58.980
because that happened.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.490
But in the early '90s,
while I was having this love

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:08.810
affair with Unix and with BSD,
I saw a machine that just blew me away.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:13.240
And it was a little magnesium
cube called the Next,

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.560
running an operating
system called Next Step.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.700
And unfortunately,
the market didn't grasp it,

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.900
and it went away pretty quickly.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.880
But it set all kinds of new standards.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.500
It had a PostScript user interface.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.320
It had an object-oriented
programming language.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.670
It had BSD,
which you know how I feel about that,

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:42.030
running on top of Mach,
which I also thought was very cool.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.800
And I figured, it's a real shame that
Next didn't make it,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.660
because I wanted all those
things together in one machine.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:58.420
Now, on the System 5 side,
there were interesting goings-on as well.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:04.670
AT&T had licensed System 5
to 11 different companies who

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.110
wound up selling it for the PC.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.460
And it started out cheap,
and it started out rich.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.810
I think it was,
I think the SEO distribution

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:20.810
was something like 25 floppies.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.690
And then it began to deteriorate.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.530
Each of the 11 vendors started
creating proprietary versions of it.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.140
And they couldn't get together.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.790
They didn't really want to get together
and make this thing interoperate.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.900
So it degenerated to the point
where these vendors started going

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.040
out of business very rapidly.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.460
The 11 licensees shrunk to four.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.810
There are now four companies
in the commercial Unix space,

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.240
plus Apple.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.360
And none of those four companies are
the original 11 licensees of System 5,

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:04.860
which gives you a perspective of how
quickly and deeply things fell apart.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:12.600
The last bit of our little history lesson
is what wiped out microcomputer unix.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:18.450
In 1995,
Microsoft introduced Windows NT 4.0.

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:23.790
And in 1996,
Microsoft introduced some free software

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.150
called the Windows NT 4 Option Pack.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.110
Microsoft had learned the lesson
with Internet Explorer that the

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:35.700
best way to get customers is to
give wonderful software away.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:42.240
And with the NT4 Option Pack,
Microsoft drove right through Unix by

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:48.560
giving customers back all the things
that the Unix vendors had taken away.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:55.300
So all the enterprise features like
guaranteed messaging and transactions and

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.750
database management and web applications,
they were in NT,

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.690
and you couldn't find them in any Unix.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:08.320
It was a bit of a drag,
but I have to give Microsoft credit.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.000
They really did a fabulous job on NT4.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:20.190
Now, consolidation trend was
obviously already underway.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.380
Unix, the Unix market had consolidated.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:29.310
Most of microcomputers were pulled
into Windows operating systems.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:36:25.800
[Transcript missing]

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.780
We also had a trend of commoditization,
and that's an easy one to describe.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:38.140
Commoditization is the practice
of a vendor deciding that all they

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.960
have to do is wait for everybody
else to develop technology,

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.200
then find a way to make
it with cheaper plastic,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.640
and then sell it back to the market
for a dollar less than the other one.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.490
And this cycle keeps wrapping
around until IT just says,

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.330
"I'm not going to buy this anymore."

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:04.750
When we got into 2002, 2003, IT said,
we're done.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.110
I don't see any reason to buy
a Pentium 4 desktop when my

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.500
Pentium 3 is handling my workload.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:17.450
Why should I pay $1,000 more for
a dual Xeon rack machine when

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.600
a dual Pentium 3 goes for $999?

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.020
It runs cooler and quieter.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:32.230
IT was making decisions based on criteria
that had never been present before,

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.140
and I'll get to those in a minute.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.980
Apple jumped into the
market in the early 2000s.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.740
I don't think it was on
the radar for most people.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:51.300
They were behind the scenes developing
Rhapsody and the early versions of OS X.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.400
When the PowerBook first hit,
it was amazing.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:02.560
When the gigahertz PowerBook,
15-inch titanium PowerBook, hit,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.890
it destroyed the market
for high-end PC notebooks.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:13.100
What had, up to that date,
been sold as portable workstations,

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.400
and I carried these things
routinely because I write code

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.080
and I do digital media work and
I need that kind of firepower,

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:27.540
I immediately hung up all of my PCs,
the best of the PC notebooks I had,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.650
and replaced them all with
one machine that to this day

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.030
I take everywhere with me.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.160
Apple declared this the
year of the notebook,

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:44.300
and they carried the technology they had
introduced with the 15-inch PowerBook to

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:49.870
the 17-inch and to the 12-inch,
and they continued to take more and

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.450
more share away from PC vendors.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.500
They also set standards
for portable computers that

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:03.710
PC vendors never managed to match,
which remains true.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:09.500
You look at things like battery life,
gigabit Ethernet, wireless networking,

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.490
which Apple pioneered and Apple still
does better than anybody else,

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:18.900
a gorgeous display with a 3D
accelerator built into it.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:23.990
When I picked up a
PowerBook for the first time,

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.610
aside from its looks,

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.580
There are two things that
really grabbed me about it.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.450
Well, three things.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:35.920
The first one was that it ran BSD,
and that just hooked me immediately.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.560
The second thing is
what Sons James Gosling,

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.200
the father of Java, told me.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.680
He carries a PowerBook.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.090
He does all his programming
on a PowerBook now.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.940
He loved the alien landing beacon
that blinks on and off when

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.380
the machine is in suspend mode.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.930
And when I asked him
the single best feature,

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.300
tell me the one thing that makes you
carry this machine everywhere you go,

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.200
he said, the lid works.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:17.900
That is no small thing for those of us
who have been using Windows for forever.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.160
Now,
we saw PowerBook redefine its market.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.350
We've seen XServe redefine
its market with price,

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.040
with ease of management.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.110
And now we see XServe RAID redefining
the market for networked storage,

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:39.880
not only by bringing prices down,
but by maintaining enterprise features,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.710
like redundant power supplies,
redundant controllers, swappable,

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:47.560
removable trays.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.890
It's not an easy ride for Apple, though.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.120
And we learned that,
InfoWorld learned that,

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.100
when we started running editorial
on Apple's enterprise efforts.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.930
We got a lot of letters from readers,
we got a lot of letters from PC vendors,

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.540
a lot of screaming phone
calls from PC vendors,

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.100
who were telling us,

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.090
I haven't heard this before.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.170
I'm not sure I buy it,
because I've been watching

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:21.430
Apple for 20 years,
and what you're telling me

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:25.710
about Apple doesn't map with
my version of the facts.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.340
The first thing they said is,
OS X is not mature.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.330
Look how long Windows has
been on the market.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.000
Look how long Solaris
has been on the market.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.160
This is a newcomer.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.340
I don't trust it.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.420
Remember what I said
about the next machine?

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.780
That was back in the early 90s.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.820
And it had these three things in it.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.130
It had BSD, which dates back to 1978.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.170
It has Mach, which dates back to 1985.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:42:00.930
And it has the next step APIs and
graphical user interfaces

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.800
that date back to 1988.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.970
I don't think you can compare
to that combination of

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:12.300
underpinnings for maturity.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:14.860
Hardware is slow.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.120
This applied to some of
the Macs a long time ago.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.140
It certainly doesn't
apply to current hardware.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:26.480
And the most concise observation
I've ever heard about performance was

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.180
uttered by Sun's Greg Papadopoulos.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.160
He's their CTO and all-around visionary,
and probably the third

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.350
smartest person I've ever met.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.090
And he said, "When you're talking about
performance in computers,

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.490
forget megahertz.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.590
It is all about throughput.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.790
If you can't get data
from the CPU to memory,

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:56.730
if you can't get data
from memory to storage,

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:56.890
it's all over.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.540
It really doesn't matter how
fast your chip burns cycles.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.460
It's going to spend most of
its time waiting for I/O."

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.870
Max are more expensive than PCs?

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.390
Sure.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:13.760
I mean, most of us remember the
2FX and the Quadra series.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.880
And they were just scary.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.860
You had to love the thing because
you were going to take out a

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.170
second mortgage to pay for it.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.700
But with the current market,
if you compare feature for feature

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.620
what Mac does with Power Books,
what Apple does with

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.330
its Power Mac systems,
which don't get much

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.890
attention at shows like this,
but thank goodness they did the keynote

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.860
the way they did the keynote today.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.260
Power Macs are cool, powerful machines.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.930
Where can you find a
Unix workstation anymore?

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.540
We saw the best example of
that technology this morning.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.690
It's just going to keep getting better.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:01.220
And on the XServe, once again,
if you line up features,

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:06.920
if you line up overall power,
if you line up IO throughput capability,

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.960
forget it.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.690
PCs can't get there from here.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:13.800
There aren't enough apps.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.840
Yeah, all of us remember
walking through CompUSA,

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.520
and there were 12 aisles
of Windows software,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.040
and there was one lonely
aisle of Mac software.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.620
And it was, you know,
games for two-thirds of it,

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.020
and then a little, you know,
a little column of

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.780
productivity applications.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.800
That's not true anymore.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.750
I'm not saying that we don't
have some distance to come.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.390
There is still a gap.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.140
There is certainly more software
available for Windows PCs.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.720
There is certainly more open source
software available for Linux.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.950
But if you look at the richness
of the software available

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:56.580
for the BSD operating system,
how easy it is to port to OS X,

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.320
and if you look at just
what Apple has done,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:00.320
you can see that there is a gap.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.910
And as far as I'm concerned,

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.700
The pace of new development
is just staggering.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.310
So when I say there's more to come,
I don't think it's going to

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.500
take long to play that out.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:50.740
I have some observations from
watching the market in general

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:56.180
that relate to the state of the
market that Apple is playing in.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.620
IT in general.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.100
It's been hard to figure
out what they want.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:04.200
I remember I've got a close
friend in marketing at Microsoft.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:08.410
We went out to dinner,
and we had a couple glasses of wine,

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:13.790
and then we got a bottle of wine,
and then we got another bottle of wine.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.540
And when we were done and we were
in the cab going back to the hotel,

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:23.420
he said, "You know that Microsoft would
just love to give customers

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:28.460
what they want?" And I said,
"That's really great.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.850
I'm glad that's so."

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:39.400
And then, in utter frustration,
he looked at me and said,

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:46.280
"So what the hell do customers want?"
Because you couldn't nail it down.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.780
It was a list this long,
and it was a different list

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.270
for every vertical market,
and for every line of business,

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:54.270
and every little segment.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.850
But now, thanks to the recession,
thanks to IT getting tired

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.970
of having no innovation,
we come down to some very

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.300
simple set of requirements.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.910
I want rapid payback,
which doesn't mean I can take

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:16.000
IBM Global Services and give these guys
with suits and briefcases eight years

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.300
to bang on enterprise integration.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.270
I want solutions that work when
I pull them out of the box.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.300
And I want payback in six years.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.300
And I want payback in six months.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.300
And if you can't give it to me,
I'm not going to talk to you.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:32.300
I want minuscule long-term
costs of ownership.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:36.300
I don't want to have to maintain a crew
of wizards to keep my stuff running.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.940
Zero lock-in?

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.180
Don't tell me I can never
leave this platform.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.630
Don't tell me that this architecture
you built this machine with

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.220
doesn't run anywhere else.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.140
Not acceptable.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.510
Purposeful innovation isn't
about bells and whistles.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.600
There's lots of cute
stuff on Apple machines.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:59.320
I have disagreements with
the people at Apple about the

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.050
blinky lights on the XServe.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:07.180
Apple has been criticized in the past for
not putting any lights on its machine.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.980
I remember one of their servers that
had a completely blank front panel

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.400
except for one little light for power.

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:18.590
And now, of course,
I would say they've overcorrected a bit.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:26.650
Now, the best summary of these
requirements came to me from a

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.560
gentleman named Winston Bumpus.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.600
That's the coolest name.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.720
And he works at Novell,
and he's probably the fourth

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.110
smartest person I've ever met.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:42.460
And he says, the only reason to buy
something is it makes you money,

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.350
it saves you money,
or it's required by the government.

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.210
And I thought, thank God.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.670
I mean, I can throw away my 30-page
summary of IT requirements

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.030
and just replace it with that.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.390
I thought it was sweet,
and I really do think

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.360
it describes reality.

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:08.170
Most of you know how well Apple has
done to adapt to these simpler and

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.860
far more demanding requirements.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:16.640
Apple's execution,
its ability to take these requirements

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.180
and turn them into products,
has been fabulous.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:23.700
That's because the execution
is based on customer feedback.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.700
It's based on the anticipation
of customer needs.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:31.360
When the PowerBook came out,
didn't you think it was serious

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.480
overkill for a portable machine?

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:40.340
Who on earth wanted to carry gigabit
Ethernet around with them on a notebook?

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.140
And of course, now we actually use it,
now that we can get a gigabit

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.940
Ethernet switch for 80 bucks.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:55.630
And Apple put in the box
very quick deployment.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:57.540
We get an out-of-the-box experience.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.980
The notebooks work immediately.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.420
XServe walks you through
the initial configuration.

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.260
XServe RAID, when I saw that demo,
I just about fell out of my chair.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.140
It was so easy to set up,
and it was so easy to use,

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.850
and it was so resilient.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.140
We were walking around the back
and pulling out power supplies

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.470
while it was still running,
and yanking drives out of the thing,

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:22.700
and shutting segments down
from the administrative tools,

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.400
and it just kept, yeah, whatever.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.250
And that's what I want.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:37.490
IT wants solutions that are consistent
across the vendor's product line.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.190
and no compromises.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:45.840
I don't want machines that make me make
choices about what I can do because

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:49.880
the technology isn't capable of it,
or because the vendor has

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.180
decided to impose choices on me.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:00.290
I think that as we watch how
these trends are panning out,

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:06.040
we see a couple of things that
will make sure that Apple stays

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:09.030
relevant in the enterprise IT market.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.390
And as we watch and as we see
Apple's technology march forward,

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:19.600
we see that IT managers'
confidence in Apple's place in the

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.830
enterprise is growing very rapidly.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:29.040
This company that had no footprint
in the enterprise three years ago,

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:31.000
look at where they are now.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.300
It's only going to get better.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:41.860
Right now, for financial stability,
for just basic grasp of the market,

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.660
we talk about Apple as a niche player.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.160
We talk about what percentage of the
overall computing market it owns.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:49.780
Who cares?

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.650
Look at its stability
and its core niches.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:54.060
It owns graphics.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.000
It owns broadcasting.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.520
It owns audio and video production.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.910
It absolutely owns ad agencies,
education.

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:06.440
Nobody is going to ever
pry it out of those niches,

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:08.880
and they're worth an awful lot.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.800
And they're developing online so fast.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.900
I mean, they were talking about how
many songs had been downloaded

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.720
in the iTunes music service.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.710
It's $0.99 a song.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:28.590
I've heard that service
referred to online as "iCrack."

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:40.530
Because once you get your first hit.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.010
In the near-term future,
I'm talking about

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.470
enterprise trust for Apple,
we see that Apple is building

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.700
its enterprise presence in
increments across its product line.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:57.460
Notebooks, wireless networking,
Airport Extreme, kicks butt.

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:06.140
It really is flat out the finest
access point in the whole world.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:11.340
I left out workstations,
but I shouldn't leave out workstations.

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:12.920
That's a very important segment.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:17.020
Scale-out entry servers that
you can cluster together,

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.700
that you can put in very
easy failover configurations.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.220
Apple has done that.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.700
They've nailed it.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:27.290
And with XSERVE RAID,
they've put land storage on the

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:31.850
map for small to medium businesses,
and for large businesses that want

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:36.280
to just stack it up and get terabytes
and terabytes for what they used

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.500
to pay for hundreds of megabytes.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.650
And in the long term,
the frontier of computing

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.700
is going to be convergence.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.700
We're going to see all of the ways
we use technology come together.

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.480
But the mobile devices
in the youth market,

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.770
the mobile devices that are used
for personal communication are

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:59.050
going to leak into businesses.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:04.070
And the best way to summarize
Apple's long-term potential

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:08.200
is that Apple gets one point.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.710
That I think no other vendor gets,
and that is that computers don't

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.140
exist to connect to each other.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:20.040
They exist to connect people to people.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:25.860
And if you can't do that with technology,
there is no reason for it to exist.

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:35.460
The people in this room,
the 3,000 or so other people

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:39.490
who are attending this show,
have,

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:42.800
I wouldn't call it a responsibility,
but...

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.610
I would say that when you look at OS X,
and you look at what Apple put into it,

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.490
and you look at what
Apple invested in their hardware,

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:53.700
real innovation.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.780
So much money on R&D,
and everybody here knows

00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:59.960
how good this platform is.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:05.370
We have to go to vendors and say,
you have to put your software here.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:09.070
We have to go to the
shops we work for and say,

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:14.670
we need to get development projects
ramped up on this platform.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.880
This thing is going to take off.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:20.350
We really don't want to be
sitting at the back of the room

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.570
when this thing catches fire.

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:28.120
So I think the catchphrase leaving
this show is going to vendors,

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:33.430
going to our bosses and saying,
call me when it runs on OS X.

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:38.000
So thanks very much for your attention.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.510
I'm going to hand things back to Bud.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:56.470
Thanks a lot, Tom, for your insights and
point of view there.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.280
Now for some fun stuff.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.430
Continuing in the theme here of the
idea that what Apple's really doing is

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.800
leveraging the world of open source,
but making it so that the

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.540
bicycle comes assembled,
and you don't have to stay

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.880
up all night assembling it.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:19.580
And I'm going to talk about Panther,
and how Panther is pushing

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.230
this even more forward.

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.950
And I'll start out--

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.820
Just mentioning a few things
about Panther on the client.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.500
Now, a lot of time was spent
on that this morning,

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.810
but hidden in the intricacies there
were some interesting things that

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:37.780
were just kind of glossed over that
are actually really key to deploying

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.440
Panther on the client in the Enterprise.

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.700
I'll just mention a few of those.

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.610
They fall into two major categories.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.860
One is open standards networking,
and the other is

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.400
Microsoft interoperability.

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:51.620
Both things are of key
importance to the Enterprise.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.740
On open standards networking,
NIS support in open directory, big deal.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.810
NFS file locking, also a big deal.

00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:00.600
It wasn't there in Jaguar.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.120
We have it in Panther.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.640
Integrated IPv6.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.630
Now,
IPv6 sort of hobbled along in Jaguar.

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.140
It's totally baked in in Panther.

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:13.900
And as the world, you know,
finally catches up to IPv6,

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.180
Panther's already there.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:21.010
802.11x authentication for secure
wireless communication built in.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:26.960
Kerberos mail,
Kerberos-enabled mail built in.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:32.270
Kerberos-enabled AFP,
Kerberos-enabled FPP, SMB, SSH,

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.600
Kerberos everywhere.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.260
Very important,
I'll spend a little bit more

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.460
time on that on the server side.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.280
Long password support,
X.509 certificate support.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.560
So all of these open standards,
all of these enabled, by the way,

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.860
by us going out and integrating
open source projects into Mac OS X,

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.360
providing the fit and finish,
providing the management,

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.790
making sure it works out of the box.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:58.550
Now, Microsoft interoperability,
actually a little bit more challenging,

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:02.530
but even there you can go and pick up
open source projects that help you along.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.380
Now, Active Directory integration,
we have a plug-in that lets you,

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:09.560
without changing the
Active Directory schema at all,

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.630
lets a Mac OS client use
Active Directory records

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:14.120
to be administered.

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.550
Incredibly important.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.870
Steve mentioned these this morning:
Browse SMB servers in the

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:29.800
Finder and SMB printing support,
both important.

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:35.790
And what's called Level 2
Tunneling Protocol/IPsec-based VPN.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.950
This is the VPN standard that
Microsoft and Cisco have adopted.

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:44.570
We support that natively in
Panther as well on the client.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:51.490
Now, shifting gears to
Mac OS X Server Panther,

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.700
or for short, Panther Server.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.470
This is a sneak preview,
and I want to just kind of

00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:00.920
go through some of the major
things that are in here.

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.800
Now, there's a lot of other things,
fit-and-finish things,

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.500
that you should definitely go.

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.090
There's an overview session for this.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:13.970
There's also an in-depth session for
Panther Server that'll cover things like,

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:15.780
there's all kinds of stuff in there.

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.130
There's support for
jumbo frames and TCP IP.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.890
So those of you who know
that for gigabit Ethernet,

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.600
you actually absolutely
want jumbo frame support,

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.750
that's in there.

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.400
Async IO, anybody doing database IO.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.540
Unix traditionally doesn't
have Async IO support.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.300
Async IO is in Panther.

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:39.300
We've done a major revision and passed
through the administration documentation.

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:43.330
So there's 12 new manuals
on administration.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:51.140
I just mentioned the IPv6
support for VPN on the client.

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.900
We have the mating service provided,
bundled in with Panther Server.

00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:00.540
So you can have a complete
VPN solution with client and server.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.300
So all kinds of stuff in there.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:07.880
But what I'd like to do is focus on some
of the major pieces that are in there.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.260
This is our best server release ever.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.620
Over 50 new features.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:14.040
As I mentioned, go to the sessions.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.460
You'll get.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.640
Get the full dose of it.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.550
So number one, automatic setup.

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:22.880
And Tom was mentioning the nice part
of what we do being that you take

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.170
your laptop out of the box and it
just sort of works out of the box.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.460
That it's very easy when you buy a
server or X-ray to kind of go through.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.680
We take you through the GUI tools
to set those things up very easily.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.680
But what happens if you have
a whole rack of these things?

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.890
Or like one of our customers,
I mentioned 190 of them.

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:48.100
Well, you don't really want to
go and wheel up a head,

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.440
attach it,
go through the GUI conversation and

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.320
get each one set up individually.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.420
So what do we do?

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.700
We now have in Panther Server the
fastest and easiest way to

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:04.800
set up a rack of servers.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.950
And it works very simply.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.070
It requires an iPod.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.140
It doesn't require an iPod,
but you can use an iPod.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.260
If there's any managers, close your ears.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:18.490
This is a great way to expense an iPod
if you have to administer servers.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:24.610
All you do is you create using a
GUI tool a server configuration,

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:29.290
create that once, load it onto the iPod,
take the iPod, connect it through

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.530
FireWire to the server,
turn on the server out of the box.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:36.000
So a Virgin server,
never been turned on before, turn it on,

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.490
it'll go seek out the iPod,
configure all of the services that

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:43.620
you need to configure on that server,
and you're done configuring.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.960
Now, that'll work fine if you've
got a rack like this,

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.220
you go set each one up,
minimal intervention required.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.580
What happens when you
really do have 190 servers?

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:57.690
Well, we do exactly the same thing
from an LDAP directory.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.580
So you populate the LDAP directory with
the server configuration information,

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.400
and that can actually be keyed
to each individual server if

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.170
they're going to be different.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.880
You plug in the server, turn it on,
it automatically finds those

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.700
records in the LDAP directory,
configure it, configure it.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.150
So it configures itself,
and you're up and running.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.130
So this is incredibly ease of
use brought into the IT world

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.240
and the server environment.

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:24.630
Really slick.

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:29.200
Second big feature, Open Directory 2.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:36.900
Now, Open Directory was in Jaguar,
but we have taken that to the next level.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.460
And Open Directory 2 in
Panther Server includes LDAP directory

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.820
and Kerberos authentication.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:51.300
It's LDAP v2 or v3,
and we've taken it a step further.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.240
We put LDAP on top of
Berkeley DB so it scales.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.710
thousands of records supported.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.440
But that's not enough scaling for us.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:09.920
So we also added the ability to support
local replicas for high availability.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:13.270
So if one replica goes down,
you can find the other replica.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.320
LDAP keeps running.

01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:15.920
Kerberos also keeps running.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.530
And remote replicas,
so that you can go and

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:23.640
set up a remote replica,
and a geographic site can serve

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:26.100
up all the same information.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.430
So this is actually incredible
state-of-the-art scalability

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:31.090
for both LDAP and Kerberos.

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.980
And I'll come back to the importance
of those two things in a moment.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.730
Actually, right now.

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:41.130
So one of the biggest challenges,
actually, I was talking to a CIO who said

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:45.830
one of their biggest costs on their
help desk was people calling up

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:48.830
because they forgot their password.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.240
And it's easy to find,
the reason for this is that

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.080
almost every network service ends
up requiring its own password.

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.430
And so you have two choices, really.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.150
Either you can just choose
the same password for every

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.510
service on your network.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.760
That's incredibly insecure, by the way,
and is frowned upon by

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.330
any security expert,
because if you crack into one service,

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.800
you've cracked all the passwords.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.350
But people do that because there's
really no other easy choice.

01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:19.490
The other thing you can
do is have a different,

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:23.180
you can force users to have different
passwords by enforcing a password policy,

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.930
so they have to actually
choose different passwords.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.740
For every service that they sign on to.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.970
Of course, then you've left the user
with only one choice,

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:34.640
which is to write down all
their passwords and put it

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.530
up on their bulletin board,
which you can see as you walk

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.840
around some of these places.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.050
So what everyone is moving
to is single sign-on.

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:43.840
What is single sign-on?

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.840
One password provides secure
access to all your services,

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.000
but it's done in a secure
way using Kerberos.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.780
The way this works,
the Kerberos server authenticates.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:59.080
So the Kerberos server
authenticates the user on login.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.800
They're handed out a token,
actually a ticket-granting token,

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.440
and they can use that key to log
in and authenticate themselves to

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.820
any other service on the network.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:13.230
So Apple's strategy here on the
server is to make sure every

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:18.380
service we deploy is Kerberized,
which is the term people use.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.430
And likewise,
to make sure the clients that access them

01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:25.880
on the client are Kerberized as well.

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:31.140
So, Panther gets us, I would say,
you know, 95% of the way there.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.030
There might be a few
things we've forgotten,

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.370
but we'll quickly fix them.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.820
In fact, Panther's not shipping yet,
so let us know about

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.460
things that we've left out.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:41.840
But that is, I think,
going to be incredibly important for any

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.620
enterprise deployment of any software,
really.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.780
So, we are well along that path.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.060
JBoss Application Server.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:06:01.410
JBoss is widely used to develop and to
deploy J2EE applications in the industry.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.810
It has been something you could
go-- it's an open software project.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.560
You can go and download it and
run it on the Mac if you want to.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:12.180
We are going to actually
package the JBoss application

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.490
server with Panther Server.

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:19.300
Now, what does that mean?

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:26.030
I'd say somewhere between 30%, 40%, maybe
50% of people have been exposed to JBoss,

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:28.860
because when you're
developing J2EE applications,

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.560
it is really just so convenient.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.780
You can develop with JBoss on a laptop.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.740
You can deploy it on WebLogic.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.900
You can deploy it on
IBM's application server.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.110
Any J2EE application server,
you can kind of share

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:49.850
J2EE objects between these
different application servers.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.440
If you want to put
JBoss on the Mac today,

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.860
there's a lot of work required because
a lot of integration has to happen

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.740
with Apache and with other things.

01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:01.380
So what we are doing with Panther is
we are taking all of those

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.510
pieces and putting them together,
including tools for managing

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:09.020
JBoss so it can become a
deployment environment as well.

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:16.470
And we are including with that
a tool for easily migrating.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.400
There are slight differences in how
J2EE objects are deployed between,

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.510
or EJBs are deployed between
different application servers.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.370
We have some tools, for example,
to very easily take a BEA EJB and

01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:33.610
import that into JBoss automatically.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.870
So this is going to be a very slick
set of tools for anybody in the

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.680
enterprise developing J2EE applications.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.810
I'd like to talk about Mail Server.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.160
With Panther,
we are moving to the Postfix mail server,

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.320
which many agree is the most
robust and scalable open email

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.040
solution on the market today.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.920
Now,
we're not just putting Postfix in there.

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.020
Postfix provides SMTP support.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.610
We're also including Cyrus to
support IMAP and POP.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.900
And you'll notice we have
Webmail and mailing lists.

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:15.440
For Webmail, we're using Squirrelmail,
so we're integrating in Squirrelmail.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.030
For mailing lists,
we're integrating Mailman

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.580
right in Panther Server.

01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:22.820
So you have a complete mail solution.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.170
We are also integrating
SSL for secure email transport

01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:33.550
between client and server.

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:40.340
Server Admin.

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.160
So we have had in Jaguar
some server admin tools,

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.200
some GUI tools,
and as I mentioned before,

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.420
there's also all the command line
tools that you know and love.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.680
But we've taken that to
the next level in Panther.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.510
What we've done is we can combine
the server setup and management

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:59.700
tools with the monitoring tools.

01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:02.920
And let me take you through,
I'll give you a demo of that right now.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.870
We could go to machine number one here.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.520
OK, what you're looking at is
server admin for Panther.

01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:15.260
And over here--

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.580
On the left would be listed
all of your computers.

01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:21.840
And right now we're just
looking at one server,

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.260
but you could imagine a
whole list there of servers.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:29.940
And on the right here is a pane which
tells you information about that server.

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.300
So which system is this running?

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.900
It's running Mac OS X, 10.3,
that's Panther.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.610
It tells you serial number, etc.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.850
I can click through here and find out.

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:44.760
Here's all your system logs,
watchdog logs, software update logs,

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.180
all the logs on that system.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:52.080
Information about the network interface,
what's mounted.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.640
Information about CPU usage over time.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.680
So let's see if I can find out how
long has this server been up here.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.500
Okay, so that's when it came up,
about three hours ago, four hours ago.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:09.190
I can look at network
traffic on that server.

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:13.690
And I can run software update remotely,
so if I have updates

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:18.950
available from Apple,
I simply check now, those are downloaded,

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.490
updated on the server.

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:24.960
Now, things get very interesting.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.930
If I click here, I open up this server,
and what I see are all of the services

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:31.860
that are available to run on that server.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:37.690
Apple Filing Protocol, Open Directory,
DNS Running Bind, FTP, Firewall,

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:41.940
which is the Berkeley IP Firewall,
Application Server,

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:50.240
which is actually JBoss, Mail, NAT,
Netboot, NFS, Print, QuickTime Streaming.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.160
That's new.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.170
You can manage.

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:55.030
So all of your services you
can manage from one place.

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:57.900
These blue dots over here,
if the blue dot is on,

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.220
that means that service is running.

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:02.120
If the blue dot is off,
that service is currently stopped.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.950
So let's go take a
look at what we can do.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:06.540
Let's click on Web.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:10.280
So what I'm really doing now is
managing the Apache web server

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.650
from Panther Server Admin.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.820
And here I'm looking at
where all the services stop.

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:17.840
So request per second is zero.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.480
Throughput is zero.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.370
I can look at all the logs.

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:24.480
Here's my Apache logs
that I know and love.

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:26.730
Graph the activity, which is zero.

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.260
Settings, et cetera.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.570
Now, in settings,
let me take you through a few of those.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.670
Here's one I like,
which is here's all your Apache mods.

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:39.790
You can turn on a module
just by checking it.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.460
Sites is incredibly easy.

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:49.180
So let's say I want to
set up a new website.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.560
Currently I have the default domain on.

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:54.210
I say add.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.130
I give it a name.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:58.240
Let's say, oh, Tribble.com.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.070
I haven't paid for that,
but someone else owns it.

01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:02.240
It's Star Trek-y.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:08.220
But let's say, let's say Tribble.com.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.070
I say save.

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:12.540
And go back.

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.140
And there it is.

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:13.880
Now it's sitting there.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.430
It's not enabled,
so it's just kind of sitting in wait.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.160
I enable it by clicking here.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.150
I start the Apache web
service by clicking there.

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.800
Tribble.com is now online.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.940
It's that simple.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:36.700
[Transcript missing]

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:42.060
If I could go to the,
actually the next thing I want

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.120
to talk about is Samba 3.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.110
Samba 3

01:12:46.290 --> 01:13:02.900
is the next version of
Samba after Samba 2.

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:02.900
The important thing about it is
that Apple is the first major

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:02.900
vendor going to be shipping Samba 3.

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:02.900
Samba 3 is in Panther today.

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:06.170
Important thing about,
one of the important things about

01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:10.660
Samba 3 is that it allows you to have
a single place where you're serving

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:20.380
up file systems and printing to both
Windows users and to Mac servers.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.120
And it goes beyond that in
that the MIS manager can

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:29.170
manage a single record and

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:36.640
and Samba 3 can become a
primary domain controller.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.840
Now, what does this mean?

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:45.120
This means that if I have a person
in my shop who needs to access both

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.600
a Windows machine and a Mac machine,
they can have a single

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.410
login and password,
and a single file home that they

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:54.680
can use to store all their files.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.290
So that when I go to the Mac machine,
I use that same login and password

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.040
as I use on the Windows machine.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.480
All of my configuration information
is stored in that record.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.630
The manager only has to
manage it in one place,

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:09.700
and the user can access
it from one place.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.410
Incredibly convenient.

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:19.900
So Mac OS X Server for Panther,
over 50 new features,

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:24.200
including automatic setup,
Open Directory 2,

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:27.810
Single sign-on,
so you can have a single password

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.030
to get at all your services.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:32.180
Everything Kerberized,
both on the client and the server.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.900
JBoss, the easiest way to deploy
J2E applications on Mac.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:43.020
Postfix mail server, the most robust,
scalable, open source mail server around.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.310
Server admin tools,
so out of the box configurability and

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:50.520
manageability and monitoring of all
of the services running on the server.

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:54.340
And Samba 3 integrated in with Panther.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.960
Price, $999 for unlimited users.

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.760
This is a big deal.

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:05.210
Almost every other operating
system for servers you buy out

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:07.700
there comes with a per-seat cost.

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.230
We don't do that.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:13.530
If you pay the $999 price,
you get unlimited users.

01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:17.820
Software maintenance customers
get it automatically.

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.780
and all WWDC attendees
get a developer's preview,

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.040
so it's in your bags.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.010
You should have it.

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:24.990
Please play with it.

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:26.240
Have fun.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.190
Thank you very much.
