WEBVTT

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.390
So without further ado,
I'm going to introduce

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.820
Jim Anders from Kydan.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.320
Jim?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.560
Thank you.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.410
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.130
When I was asked to speak
at the conference here,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.480
my first inclination was to do a,
you know, what's new from a product

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.680
point of view in QuickTime VR.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.860
But realizing I was going to have
an audience full of developers,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.860
I wanted to change gears a little
bit and talk about what's new and the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.820
way of opportunities for development.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.630
And to give you a sense of
what the market is like.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820
Because it's a vital market,
and it's one that's continuing to grow.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.200
So to start out with what's new with VR,
well, this is one thing that was new.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.200
I was really glad to see that Apple,
on the morning of the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.670
introduction of the G5,
chose to once again use QuickTime VR to

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.650
show the inner workings of the new G5.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.630
And for those of you who might not
be familiar with object movies,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.040
this is a QuickTime VR object movie.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.210
As you may or may not know,
QuickTime VR supports both

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.720
object-oriented images as
well as panoramic images.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.160
And usually you can just simply
do a simple rotation of an object.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.460
In this one, they're doing some more
interesting animation effects.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.910
You can see the cover coming off
and zooming in and out to see

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.840
all the neat details of the unit.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.730
So that's really cool.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.280
What I'm going to be talking about
this morning is essentially give you

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.920
a quick overview of QuickTime VR.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.620
Kaidan, our company,
has been involved right from the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.440
very beginning of QuickTime VR.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.860
Actually, we got started making accessory
products for the Apple QuickTake camera.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.080
And then shortly after the
Apple QuickTake camera was introduced,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.820
Apple announced QuickTime VR.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.540
So we've been involved right
from the very beginning.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.680
And I'm going to give you a sense
of a little bit of the history,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.440
a sense of where are we
currently in the technology,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.510
what the current and potential market is.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.380
I'll try to give you
some sense as best I can.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.390
And what opportunities are that I think
are for third-party development.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.610
And at the very end, after Terry's talk,
we'll have a Q&A session.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.790
Can I let that snow?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.860
So where have we been?

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.540
When QuickTime VR was introduced, gee,
seven, eight years ago,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.890
Apple had a product called the
QuickTime VR Authoring Tools Suite.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.340
For those of you who remember MPW,
it was MPW-based.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.580
You actually typed, you know,
stitched this movie in a

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.500
command line interface.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.810
There was a dongle.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.160
It was fairly expensive.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.500
And for those who went and took
the training class at Apple,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.680
the predominant camera,
the preferred camera,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.020
was a 35mm camera with film.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.960
And we actually shot film.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.180
They had photo CDs returned.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.010
And that's how you did it.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.090
And image quality was,
as you might expect,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.860
fairly nice with a photo CD.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.930
But as I was mentioning,
at that same time,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.160
Apple introduced the QuickTake camera.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.200
And we had been making, at Kadan,
close-up lenses and wide-angle lenses.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.560
So we thought it would be really
cool to be able to develop a

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.820
tripod head for that Apple camera.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.480
And at the time,
a lot of people were saying,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.150
35mm is the way to go.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.570
But you managed to get some
really kind of nifty shots.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.100
And it was clear to us back then
that digital was going to be the way

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.250
these images were going to be shot.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.430
Bless you.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.210
So that kind of kicked it off for us,
and in fact for the industry.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.300
Things just really started to
take off shortly thereafter.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.050
Apple did kind of the
next generation of tools,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.090
the QuickTime VR authoring studio,
which still is available today.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.140
And actually there's probably no
better stitcher for doing cylindrical

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.360
panoramas than that product today.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.690
There was another startup company
back then called Panimation.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.940
They made a product called
Nodester and Widgetizer.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.400
And today you can see the
successors of those products,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.730
the descendants of those products,
in the VR Toolbox Company product line.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.730
There was also a company
called Live Picture that made

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.180
a product called PhotoVista,
and that still is available today under

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.520
a new company name called IC Media.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.200
was also another startup
company called OmniView,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.390
and they're known today as iPix.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.040
New digital cameras really
started to take off.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.940
Apple revved their camera line.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.600
Kodak came out with digital cameras.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.230
And that was really the beginning
of the emergence of digital cameras.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.720
Things really went crazy.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.330
At that time, tripod heads,
which are used to actually

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.090
create back then and still
today the panoramic images,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.290
were close to $1,000.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
And when we got involved,
we decided to kind of

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.620
democratize the market.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.770
And we introduced a tripod
head called the Kiwi for $100.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.680
And things went nuts.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.280
Schools,
kids started to use this technology.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.810
It just really became a vibrant market.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.290
In the past few years, we've just seen an
explosion of applications.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.470
As I mentioned, Panimation,
those products are now being

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.920
sold and continually be
updated through VR Toolbox.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.920
There's a product called RealViz Stitcher
that does multi-row panoramas where

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.980
you can create very high-res panoramas.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.580
Authoring Studio is still around.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.290
But really,
the story of VR has been what the

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.510
third parties have done with it.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.560
And for those of you who
are developers out there,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.210
I mean, that's your challenge.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.160
I mean, there's a lot of things going on,
a lot of companies out there creating

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.020
really great products and doing
really interesting things with VR,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.480
both in the object and
the panoramic realms.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:58.520
So today, we have a stable,
mature environment to which to build

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.040
applications on that Apple has provided.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.740
You know, Apple's kind of in an
interesting situation.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.720
They developed the enabling technology,
and then many times they also

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.060
developed the consumer applications.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.260
And QuickTime VR Authoring Studio hasn't
been updated in a long time,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.410
and a lot of our customers and people
who are actually buying products,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.800
they bemoan the fact that
it hasn't been updated.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.430
Well, the good news for developers
is that this has been a fertile

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.510
ground for third-party development,
and that's the good news.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.940
Apple's kind of in a no-win situation,
but it's really a good news

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.640
for the development community.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.990
QuickTime VR as a format is
the most popular immersive

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.240
imaging format on the web.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.340
And we've, at Kaidan,
we've tried to quantify that by doing

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.800
fairly exhaustive Google searches and
actually canvassing and looking at

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.690
what formats out there on the web.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.990
And still today it's true that there are
no other formats that are more popular

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.800
out there other than QuickTime VR.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.760
That's because they're
both objects and panoramas,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.220
and a lot of the other competing file
formats are perhaps strictly limited

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.680
to panoramas and things like that.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.400
QuickTime VR also gives you a very
rich playback environment because you

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.520
have the ability to do all the other
kind of neat QuickTime things and

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.160
incorporate that into your movies,
things like sound.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.220
And the recent announcements in
QuickTime regarding sound is going

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.340
to be very interesting for developers
as far as surrounding sound and

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.510
3D sound and things like that.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.100
I also think QuickTime VR gives
you the best playback experience.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.930
There are some Java viewers out there
that display panoramas and objects,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.400
but generally they provide
a pretty poor experience.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.460
The cursor doesn't continue to activate
as you move off the window as it

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.900
does in the QuickTime environment,
and it's really... The Java players

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.150
are kind of annoying.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.990
And of course,
with OS X and Quartz Extreme...

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.300
Since we're dealing with photographic
images and graphic intensive content,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.420
there's no better platform
to develop than on the Mac.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.040
So things are good right now.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.470
And things are good--
I can say they're good,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.340
but yeah, Jim,
why don't you tell me how and

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.450
show me how good they are?

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.690
Well, there are a number of really good
success stories out there that one can

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.780
look at to see how good things are.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.410
We have-- you can't find an automotive
website that doesn't use QuickTime VR to

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.190
show off the interior of a new
car or the exterior of a new car.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.530
Motion Pictures.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.150
Obviously, Apple has had a great deal of
success with movie trailers.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.550
Well, we're now starting to see that
in addition to movie trailers,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.230
the movie studios are doing
VR content of the sets.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.660
And The Matrix is an example,
Harry Potter.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.360
And in addition,
educational and industrial

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.660
applications is just a tremendous use.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.820
And I'll show you briefly
here on the demo machine some

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.720
other examples of VR content.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.340
If we can switch over
to the demo machine.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.610
Sorry we had to do this.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.220
Keynote doesn't play QuickTime VR,
and there's another

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.310
development opportunity,
actually.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.790
Okay,
this is an interior of a new Audi A8,

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.280
I believe.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.330
And this is a VR movie that
was shot by Tim Petros.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.660
His company is Gyro VR,
and it's a QuickTime VR cubic,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.480
so we can look all the way up,
out through the sunroof, and down.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.690
Here we go.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.100
at the Dash.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.210
We can zoom in.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.070
As I said,
just about every automotive company

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.840
has this kind of content on their site.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.430
And they've done a lot
of studies and tests.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.420
QuickTime does it for them.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.840
They're very happy with QuickTime.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.800
They've also found out that if
you want to be able to zoom in

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.310
to see enough detail on the dash,
that was really important in

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.500
all their testing that they did,
so that you have enough detail so it's

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.930
like sitting in the driver's seat.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.900
That was a panorama.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.330
In addition to panoramas, of course,
QuickTime VR supports objects.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.800
So you can do neat things like,
instead of just a flat rotation, well,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.410
let's show the car off and zoom
in and zoom out as we move around.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.690
And the fact that it's interactive,
the fact that you're in control,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.380
the end user's in control,
as opposed to just a movie,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.860
makes all the difference in the world.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.700
One of the other areas
of success has been in,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.260
as I said,
motion picture and media content.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:06.390
Tim Petros, who did the Audi automotive
interiors and stuff,

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.260
has also been doing a lot of
work with Warner Brothers.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.470
They create models of all
their intellectual property,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.930
like Bugs Bunny.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:20.220
And in order to make sure that the
licensing is upheld and all the people

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.860
who have licensed Bugs Bunny to make Bugs
Bunny keychains and Bugs Bunny dolls,

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.960
in order to make sure that it's
been reproduced faithfully,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.040
they make models.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.310
Well, it's a lot easier to distribute
a 3D virtual model than it is a

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.000
real model to all the licensees.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.400
So here's an example of a
multi-row object movie that

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.200
I can turn around and look at all
different sides of the object.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.880
That's really neat.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.690
Another one, Tweety.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.100
mentioned industrial and scientific.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.740
This is a shot that was done
with a pano-scan camera.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.510
A pano-scan camera is a
very high-resolution digital

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.790
scanning panoramic camera.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.140
And what you're looking at here is
the interior of the space shuttle.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.270
This is a pano-scan camera.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.840
And here's an example where Cubic VR,
one of the more recent additions

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.740
to the file format by Apple,
really shines.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.100
I mean,
if you're shooting a house or you're

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.900
shooting on an exterior scene somewhere,
generally it's not that important

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.730
to be able to look straight up.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.790
But when you have something
happening on every side,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.450
as in this interior shot,
you can see that that's really important.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.280
Actually, this curved beam here that
you see on the interior,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.320
That is actually a shoot that's
used for when the astronauts

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.520
have to bail out of the shuttle.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.570
There's a strap that they
hook up on that curved rod and

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.610
then they jump out the door,
which is that round thing right here.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.340
and actually see the text.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.080
And this is a relatively low--
this is like a medium res file.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.700
I think this is only two megs.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.430
I have a higher res version
that you can actually read every

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.430
piece of writing really crisp.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.620
Just amazing.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.490
Obviously,
NASA loves this kind of technology.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.780
This isn't really
industrial or educational,

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.530
but I just liked the panorama.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.500
This is Las Vegas.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.600
And that's another example of a
cubic image that was shot with

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.090
Stitcher and a Kaidan multi-row head.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.070
This is just a really stunning image,
although I suspect the

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.440
moon was put in afterwards.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.890
Okay, we'll go back to the slides now.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:12.300
So market-wise,
I'm going to try to give you

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.120
an idea of what is really
the potential for the market.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.630
In the eight years that
Kaidan has been around,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.750
we've sold tens of
thousands of tripod heads.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.420
And for a good part of that time,
I would say for the first five years,

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.970
those have been sold
to the early adopters.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.340
These are the guys that were, you know,
read about QuickTime VR,

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.040
found out it was really cool.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.640
People like Dennis,
who's going to be giving the talk

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.000
later on after Terry's in my talk.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.150
But people that have really
kind of blazed the trail.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.090
And at Kydan, we kind of look at this
kind of pyramid effect,

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.560
where for the first
part of our existence,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.900
we've been kind of selling at
that kind of peak of the pyramid,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.890
the people who have been
really blazing the trails.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.330
But as time has been going on,
we've been coming further down

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.060
the pyramid into a larger,
wider user base.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.330
You know, kids, grade school kids,
creating object movies of bugs.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.230
You know, they weren't the first people
who bought our product,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.200
certainly.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.510
The other thing that's really
helped us is the digital camera

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.170
market has just gone nuts.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.500
The market forecast.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.500
And I've taken several.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.180
I mean,
kind of combine them a little bit here.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.610
All the four, even the most.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:17:07.300
[Transcript missing]

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.430
The other dynamic in the
industry that's happening is

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.660
that photographers out there,
the professional and commercial

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.980
photographers out there,
they've been struggling.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.430
And they've been looking for
new and different ways of

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.940
getting their content over.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.190
And wedding photographers,
we have wedding photographers who

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.090
are looking at new ways of capturing
weddings with immersive imaging.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.270
What?

00:17:31.500 --> 00:18:07.700
[Transcript missing]

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.370
The other thing that has changed
is that the applications have

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.640
changed significantly from the
days of MPW and typing in commands.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.810
You know,
there are dozens of easy-to-use,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.750
click-and-drag applications to
create this kind of content.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.000
And that's really made a big difference.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.800
As I said,
Apple created this enabling technology,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.960
and now it's up to us,
third-party developers,

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.340
to really make it happen.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.690
And I've tried to put my thoughts
together as far as what I think

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.300
are some of the low-hanging fruit,
as it were, for what the development

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.570
opportunities would be.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.830
There's a lot of them,
and I tried just to pick a few of the

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.390
things that are either needed in the
marketplace or conditions that exist

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:55.760
in the marketplace that really have
made this opportunity come to light.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.460
And one of the biggest changes has
been the availability of bandwidth.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.380
When we started with panoramic
images and object images,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.460
there was a big push to get
objects like less than 200K

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.590
because people had dial-up modems.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.010
You know, with a 9600 baud connection,
it's tough to bring in a 2

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.380
or 3 megabyte object movie.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.600
Well,
that's obviously not the case anymore.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.430
So, for example,
the automotive companies,

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.810
they have no problem putting a 2
meg object movie or a very high-res

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.800
detailed panoramic image up on the site.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.090
And people want that detail.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.000
They want to be able to zoom in
and read the gauges on the dash.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.540
They want to be able to see the
texture of the cloth or the details

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.950
or the inside of the new G5.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.330
Object movies.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.300
Originally,
object movies were just flat spinning

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.660
objects that would move on one row,
flat spinning objects.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.410
Multi-row object movies like the Bugs
Bunny and the Tweety that I showed

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:06.260
where you can move it in all directions,
a long time ago that wasn't done

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.670
because the file sizes were every
new row that you added to the image

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.750
would essentially double the size
of the image or triple the size of

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.470
the image for each additional row.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.620
Multi-row object movies
are coming back into vogue.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.530
People initially tried to use them
and they were too big and then

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.950
they throttled back to single row.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.660
We're seeing more and more
multi-row object rigs being sold,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.020
more and more of that kind of
content being distributed on the web.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.160
It's undergoing a real revival.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.980
So there's a real opportunity for
content providers to be able to provide

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.880
this kind of multi-role object movies.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.650
Stereo.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:51.250
I know Dennis is going to be showing
some stereo examples later on.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.060
But stereo is something that's really
never taken off and become commonplace.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:01.740
And it's a shame because you can get some
amazing imagery with some stereo effects,

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.260
either with panoramas,
as Dennis will be showing,

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.570
or with objects.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.790
And in the case of object movies,
you get stereo for free.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.690
A QuickTime VR object movie
is essentially an array,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.460
a matrix of images taking
around and up and down.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.570
And in order to get the stereo effect,
all you have to do is display

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.020
any given image in that
matrix and the adjacent image,

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.410
which is taken at a slightly
different perspective,

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:30.360
rotated.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.650
And if you display both of those images,
either with shuttered

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.680
eyeglasses or with the anaglyph,
red, blue type glasses,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.320
you get this stereo effect
and it's quite amazing.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:41.840
So it's free.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.200
It's already there.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.900
All that needs to be done is someone
has to do and package and put

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.630
together some neat tools to easily
create them and display them.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.280
Same with panoramas.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.290
We had made a, Kaidan had made a stereo
imaging tripod head where you

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.150
could take two shots at once.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.220
And people didn't really do all
that well in the marketplace.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.460
But I think with the
appropriate playback stuff,

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.220
there'd be some really good.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.950
a nice revival for that.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.620
Real estate virtual tours
are one example of VR,

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.840
but to be able to see this house
that you're looking to buy in stereo

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.420
could be really quite compelling.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.830
Cubix, QuickTime VR Cubix.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.920
Several years ago,
Apple added that capability

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.160
so that you could look up and
down and all the way around.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.810
And there's a lot of
opportunities to make that...

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.740
Image process of gathering those
images are easy and convenient.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:43.450
One of the products at Cadian that
we've had a great deal of success

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.850
with is our one-shot product,
where in one shot you can capture

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.080
a full 360-degree panorama.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.330
It does not yet handle
the full view of cubics,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.710
but we're working on it.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:00.000
And there's some ideas that we have,
and the lesson learned there is that if

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.440
you can make the capture part of it easy,
it makes the whole process

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.850
easier along the way.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.830
And there's a whole range of new
and innovative optical techniques

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.210
and things like that that would
just stimulate that whole process.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.800
So there's some good opportunities there.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.970
True 3D, QuickTime VR,
whether it's objects or panoramas,

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.880
is essentially flat images
projected in a new way.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.630
But you can take those flat
images and actually do some

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:34.900
interesting things with them.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.900
For example, if we were to shoot several
panoramas in this room,

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.900
you can take the similar points
analyzed at different locations

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.020
and construct 3D models.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.110
True 3D models that you could
then navigate and move around.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.970
Same with objects.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.660
You could capture an object
movie like Bugs or Tweety.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:59.160
And instead of just being essentially a
digital flipbook of images simulating 3D,

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.000
you could actually take that data,
the photographic data,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.100
and create a 3D model.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.920
And then use those
photographs to texture map it.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.280
There's another example of
things that can be done.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.980
And we certainly have the computing
power to pull that off today.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.940
Scripting, scripting and authoring.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.870
Apple Script Studio,
in the latest Mac Tech,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.690
Tim Monroe did a great little
article on how easy and cool

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.940
Apple Script Studio would be to use.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.560
There's really no convenient,
easy ways and tools out there to do that,

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.770
but it certainly could be done.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.680
There are Live Stage Pro and another
application called Revolution.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.060
They have support for QuickTime VR,
and you can generate some

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.340
compelling content with those tools.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.990
And that's more on the content
creation side than it is for

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.610
the software development side.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.280
One of the areas that hasn't
been explored all that much

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.870
is high dynamic range imaging.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.170
If you're not familiar with this,
this is a technique where you take

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.020
multiple exposures of a scene at
different photographic exposures

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.990
and then intelligently combine them
to create a very dramatic image.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.420
If I were to take a panorama here,
I have a huge dynamic range.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.370
I've got the bright lights
and I've got the dark room.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.190
But if I took a series of
photographs at all the possible

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.830
different exposure ranges,
I would see you guys

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.540
clearly in the audience,
the bright lights and

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.980
up here would be clear.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.740
And then you combine that and
it just creates amazing images.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.660
There's some examples of that out there.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.260
HDR Shop and Photomatix are two
examples of some software that

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.020
do that on conventional images.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.950
We could certainly do it on
objects and panoramas as well.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.480
And there could be some possibilities
with a pixelate codec to be

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.110
able to pull that off as well.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.190
CodeX is another really
ripe example for innovation.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:02.520
It's really not clear today
what CodeX are optimized for VR,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.220
and there's just kind of a general
confusion out there about CodeX and

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.990
what CodeX really work well and
properly in the VR environment.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.700
So there's some ripe areas there.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.740
For the most part,
objects are created by putting an

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.250
object on a turntable and spinning it,
like a car or something like that,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.360
or something bugs and Tweety,
for example.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.130
But there are some objects that you
just can't put on a rotating turntable,

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.760
like a statue in a park, for example.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.300
It's there,
and you have to walk around the

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.260
object in order to capture it.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.590
There are today no really easy-to-use
tools that allow you to walk around

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.180
a house or a battleship or a statue
in the park that allow you to

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.940
create an object movie easily.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.210
And if you're looking to
get in the software business

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.850
and create a killer app,
there's a great example.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.250
Just the ability to
animate objects as well.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.790
As you saw with the G5 example,
how the door opened and

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.880
the parts flew apart.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:11.280
There's no good tools to be
able to do that well either.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.540
It's all kind of painstakingly
done by hand and pulled out and

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.050
Photoshopped and things like that.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.840
Some other examples,
if we can move back over

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.460
to the demo machine.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:47.240
Objects.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:48.480
I mentioned briefly eBay.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:48.480
I'm sure everyone has seen
eBay or bought off eBay,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:48.480
but today you take multiple pictures
of your object to make sure that the

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:48.480
person buying it can see that there's
nothing broken on it or going on with it.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:48.480
But why not use object movies?

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.530
We were developing a new piece
of object software to make

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.700
object capture really easy.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.890
It wasn't ready to be shown here.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.440
But that's one area where
we're going to try to go after,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.630
is making it accessible for the
common eBay user to create this kind

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:09.030
of content and to put this up on
their eBay page as opposed to five

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.490
or six images that show the object.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.840
This is another example.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.700
Really makes a difference when you have
that ability to animate it and do things.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:30.160
Now in this case it's an object movie,
but we're not spinning the object around.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.640
We're just, kind of like the G5 example,
we're just articulating the

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.830
object to show how it works.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:42.070
That's another common way of
showing this kind of technology.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:56.670
Several weeks ago,
I came across a technical

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.830
paper where they were using

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:21.800
[Transcript missing]

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.360
These kind of complex 3D
mathematically described surfaces,

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.160
there's a whole kind of open
possibilities there for using

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.380
QuickTime VR to describe these
kind of complex surfaces.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.730
Here again,
with OpenGL and the kind of connection

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:44.360
between 3D and QuickTime VR,
there's another great opportunity.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.570
Thank you.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.890
So that concludes my part of the talk.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.780
Next up will be Terry Breheny,
and he'll kind of get into more of

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.300
the specifics about some of the new
products and things that are available

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.480
out there today in the VR space.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.820
And I guess in final closing,
assuming most of you are developers,

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.200
if you're interested and wanted to learn
more about some of the possibilities

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.540
of developing VR applications,
just see me after the session.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.560
I'd be glad to chat with
you and tell you more.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.440
Thank you.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.790
Okay, thanks.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.940
This is a pretty decent turnout.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.250
I appreciate everybody
coming in this afternoon,

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:37.960
or this morning rather.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.520
I should know it's morning
because I'm not a morning person.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.700
Staying with a friend in Knob
Hill and about four in the morning,

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.720
all of a sudden they're doing
some kind of construction on the

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.670
cable lines running up the street.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.860
So forgive me if I'm
not quite awake fully.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.750
So what I'm going to do
today is actually show you,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.140
as Jim mentioned,
both some hardware and some software,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.260
kind of what's new.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.370
And certainly there's a fair
amount of development going on,

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.900
which is very encouraging.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.740
And some of the stuff
here today is brand new,

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.670
and actually some of it's so
new that it's not even here yet.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.280
How many of you, first of all,
went to the Michael Schaaf's interactive

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.940
QuickTime presentation yesterday?

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.230
I don't know if you did.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.940
Okay, a few of you?

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.680
Okay, good.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.010
What I'm going to do then is just kind
of show a brief outline of the stuff

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.700
I'm going to show and then just jump
right into it because I do have quite a

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.220
few things to kind of get through here.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.540
Okay, software.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:45.580
I'll be hopefully looking at
LiveStage Pro 4.1 this morning,

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:51.460
VRWorks 2.5, which is in beta,
Zoomifier VR version 2,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.610
which was recently
announced and released,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.820
and PhotoWarp 201.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.400
And just quickly,
I put some prices up for you as well.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.100
LiveStage, this release, 4.0,
was kind of a revamping of the

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.180
whole interface of the software.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.860
And then 4.1,
they called it the VR release.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:15.400
The folks at TotallyHip
were really encouraging,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.190
trying to get input
from the VR community.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.710
They recognized the potential there.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.520
And so you'll be surprised,
those of you who haven't seen it yet.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.660
There's just tons of
QuickTime VR functionality now built

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.390
into LiveStage and done so in a way that
makes it quite easy for anyone to use,

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.900
even if you don't know how to
do any kind of queue scripting.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.410
So we'll look at that.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.940
Like I said, VRWorks 2.5 is in beta.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.150
They're showing it downstairs
as well in the exhibit booth,

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.760
so I'd recommend you go down there.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.040
But I'll also get into
it just briefly up here.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.040
And that's a QuickTime VR,
that's a complete authoring package.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.220
As Jim mentioned,
QuickTime VR authoring studio from Apple,

00:32:53.220 --> 00:33:01.280
which was originally released
back in like 1997 or so,

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.120
was kind of at the time the
only complete authoring package.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.330
VR Toolbox came along,
and they released VRWorks,

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.020
which has similar capability.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.020
And now I'm pleased to say they're
revving that for OS X and adding

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.790
some features and functions as well.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.580
And then Zoomifier,
for those who haven't seen,

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.980
is a nice way to do very high
resolution image streaming.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.050
And initially they
started with just images,

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.320
but they've incorporated VR capability.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.380
And then PhotoWarp is actually
software which is bundled with

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.010
an optic that Kaidan sells.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.180
It's a one-shot optic.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.300
And I'll be showing actually a
similar product from another company

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.620
that was just released today.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.540
So hardware, actually,
that's the optic I was referring to.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.400
The company's 0 to 360,
and they have a panoramic optic out.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.060
It's a one-shot solution.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.660
Manfrotto Bogan has a new...

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.460
This is a cubic/spherical
head that has just come out.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.000
In fact, it was just shipped from
Italy to me yesterday.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
And then this round shot VR drive,
unfortunately, is not here yet.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And something tells me it's probably
going to arrive this afternoon.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.070
So what I would like to do probably is,
maybe at the QuickTime feedback session,

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.400
I'll kind of be in the corner afterwards,
so that if it does actually

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.900
arrive from Switzerland and
anybody's interested in seeing it,

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.000
I'll have it there.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
You can just come over
and I'll show it to you.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.660
But it's just an automatic
rotating platform that Sights

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.830
and RoundShot have done.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.710
And then hopefully if there's time,
Denis Bila is going to show a customized

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.330
pano head that he had built for him,
specifically for a project

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.000
he's doing at the Smithsonian.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.390
So let's jump over here.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.240
And this will all,
I'll leave this all up here too

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.460
afterwards so you guys can come
up and actually get your hands on

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.350
it and see what it's all about.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.590
But this is the new...

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:18.300
[Transcript missing]

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.890
And some of the feedback that I and
Scott Height in his office have

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.900
given them is they need to put a
little retainer clip on this so you

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.680
don't lose this important piece.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.980
But then this is actually just
going to fold up like that.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:36.200
And then this gets returned
back into this position there.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.290
And then kind of the second part of
the unit is this rotator base here.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.110
And what this is,
it's an indexed base that

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.090
you can use with the head,
basically allowing you then to have

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.820
these click stops that are adjustable.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.600
You pull out this tab,
and you have essentially from 5

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.480
degree increments to 90 degrees.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:07.720
So anywhere from, say, 4 shots, 6 shots,
8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 24, 36, or 72 shots.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.400
And that's a nice solid piece.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.140
You know, it definitely clicks and
stops at each increment.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.980
So you're welcome to come up
and look at that afterwards.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.100
Let me just show you that quickly.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:28.380
And this is called the 303 SPH.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:42.950
How many of you have attempted to
shoot a multi-row panorama before?

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.140
A few of you, okay.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:50.450
So as you know,
it's not quite easy just yet,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:55.340
but with products like this and also
Kaidan offers a multi-row head as well,

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.900
it's starting to get a lot better.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:57.900
[Transcript missing]

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:24.380
Well, if I can't get this to go on here,
I think I have the wrong plate on here.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.780
The nice thing about this head,
actually I don't need the

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.730
camera to show it to you,
but so basically what it allows

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.990
you to do is you need to set
the nodal point this way.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.840
So basically it's going to move
the camera in three different axes.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.160
So you put the camera on here,
and you can align the nodal

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.910
point in this direction.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:45.360
And then likewise,
this is for shooting the

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.020
different tilt ranges.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.680
And then in this case--

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:55.560
If you shoot like this,
you're going to be able to

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.580
move in this direction too.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.180
Okay, so I'll get that camera up there,
and maybe we can even shoot a

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.420
panorama at the end with Dennis.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.880
That gives you kind of a
sense of how that works.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.160
So let's jump in,
then jump ahead to software,

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.600
and I'll get back to the
other hardware as well.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.890
We're going to start with Zoomifier.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:33.860
Okay, Zoomifier, it's basically you don't
need any server software.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.380
It's a, you know,
it all happens on the client side.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:41.200
And the actual application is
either a droplet that you use,

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.020
which I'm going to use today,
or it also is available

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.240
as a Photoshop plug-in.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.440
But in this case,
I have a bunch of images.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.440
It's just actually kind of a subset
of images I shot of a sculpture.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.360
Uncompressed,
these are all like 9-meg images.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.320
I think they're from the
Coolpix 995 or something.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.510
So, you know,
you wouldn't want to necessarily do

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.110
a big object movie with 9-meg images,
you know, of 36 images or whatever,

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:04.330
because it would just be huge.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.480
So I'm just going to grab all those
and then just drop it on the droplet.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.260
And then you'll see here,
we have these tabs, image,

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.460
object animation, slideshow, panorama.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.090
It knew that I had dragged
more than one image,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.460
so it assumed that
I want to do an object,

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.130
which is the case.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:41.900
So then you're just going to
choose where the destination is.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.380
Okay, then you can choose the
display width and height,

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.740
the background color, the zoom,
compression.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.880
You can add copyright information,
set the initial view,

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.800
and then you can tell it which kind
of files you want it to generate.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.350
Basically,
what they recommend is kind of doing like

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.910
an auto-detect and checking all these,
and that's definitely going to be a

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:16.180
fail-safe thing to do because it'll
generate every file that you need,

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.780
and then you just put
them up on the server,

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.170
and then the software is smart enough
to know whether or not the client

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:25.040
has either the Zoomify plug-in,
the QuickTime plug-in,

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.420
or it's going to use ActiveX or Java.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.210
There's all kinds of
different ways it can do it.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.760
It's pretty nice, actually.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.640
And it is a QuickTime component.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.820
Let me just emphasize that.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.760
So you can just generate
just a QuickTime movie,

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.440
and then it's part of the third-party
download component system.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.640
So we're going to do that.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.540
You can watch it do its thing.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.690
And basically--

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.980
What it's doing is it's taking each of
those images and it's tiling them up.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.820
And there's some technical name for it.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:00.770
Smart, bare metal,
preferred image serving

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.470
or something like that.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:06.240
But it's going to take those images and
just pretty much dice them into tiles.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.510
And then upon playback,
it's only going to serve the specific

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.260
area that you need to see at any time.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.270
So the nice thing about it then
is you're not having to download a

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.360
big movie because maybe someone's
only going to look at one view.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.280
Or when they go to zoom in,
you don't need to zoom in all

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.800
the other views that aren't
being seen at that time.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.320
So it's done.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.730
Okay, so look at that.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.200
I'm going to open that
in QuickTime Player.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.600
OK, so there's my movie.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.350
And--

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.400
So you can see then,
it's showing me kind of

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.840
the low res version now,
and then as I turn it,

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.180
it's going to look like it's
getting blurry because it's

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.590
pulling in those new tiles now.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:11.030
So it's only going to refresh
once you get to the new-- the

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.330
image data that's not there.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.790
But then the great thing, of course,

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.830
is as you zoom in,
it's just going to serve that

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.840
image data that you need.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.710
And you can get some really
nice detail this way.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.690
And so when we go back
and look at that file,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.300
This is a reference movie,
so it's only 8K.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.880
This PFF file right here,
that's the image data, basically,

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.300
and that's only 1.6 megs.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.300
So it took each of those seven images
that were 8 megs apiece uncompressed,

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.300
and the image data has now been
compressed to only 1.6 megs.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.020
So this file sits on the server,
and this little movie just

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.300
calls the data as it's needed.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.300
So that is Zoomifier.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.290
Highly recommended.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:10.030
Okay, so next then we're going
to look at the 0-360 optic.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.300
So this is a one-shot optic,
as I mentioned,

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.540
available from zero to 360.com.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.720
And there's a few of
these on the market now.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:35.270
But as you'll see,
it just screws onto a digital camera.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:43.980
This is a 360-degree shot of a VR.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
The nice thing about this is
that you can freeze motion.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
People walking in the
room can capture motion.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.460
Assuming the light allows you to,
you can shoot at high enough

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.000
shutter speeds to catch motion.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
There are some disadvantages
and advantages.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.320
The disadvantage is that all of
that data of 360 degrees is going

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.000
to be captured on one frame.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.080
The resolution isn't going to be
nearly that of shooting multiple

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.800
images and stitching them together.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:22.000
This is more of a web-friendly,
low-resolution way, and a very fast way,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
I might add, to get panoramas.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.220
If you're looking to do nice,
high-quality panoramas that

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.310
you can print or something,
then you'd want to do more of a

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.990
traditional route of stitching.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I'll let you guys come and look at this.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.490
this as well afterwards.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:44.300
So what we'll do then is look at
an image that was taken with this.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:49.260
Now, their software that they have,
they have apparently an application

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.760
that's Windows only right now.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:57.930
But they do have a
Photoshop action for OS X.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.900
It's kind of neat.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.370
So we'll take this.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.040
This is the image here.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.130
Open it in Photoshop.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.040
Okay, so there's the image.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.470
I'm gonna go to my action here.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.760
It's called the 0 to 60 Unwrapper.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.760
I'm just going to hit Play.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.740
And it's going to throw
up these messages for me.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.760
Please crop to just mirror and then
press Play again when you're finished.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.710
OK, so I'm going to choose the crop tool.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.700
I'll just kind of quickly do this here.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.570
About like that.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:43.940
Adjust that just a little bit.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.090
Okay.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:48.130
I'm going to say crop.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:49.340
Okay,
and then I'm going to hit play again,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.410
like it told me to do.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.510
That's going to say, you know,
this step you can change the image,

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.780
the canvas size, basically,
if you wanted to resize it,

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.760
or you can just continue.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.990
So we're going to just continue,
let it do that to this size.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.300
It's going to automatically
pull up the polar coordinates

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.400
filter to do the remapping.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.480
I hit OK.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.800
Image size, OK.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.800
And then now it's going to say,
now crop just to the image,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.060
and then press Play again.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:25.610
So I'll just crop roughly there.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.200
Again.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.190
And you're done.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.900
You can adjust levels, sharpness,
or whatever.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.860
Let me just brighten this up
just a bit so you can see it.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:50.800
Okay, so then from there you just save
it and then open it in any other

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.640
application to actually export the VR.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.100
They don't export the
VR from the Photoshop action.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.090
So what we can do is we'll put it here.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.800
Next one for now.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:22.800
Okay, so that's saved there.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.800
So actually what we're going to do
is we're going to kind of cheat.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800
We're going to look at that now.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.800
And the other application that we're
going to be talking about today,

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.650
which is VRWorks.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.500
Okay, how many of you have
used VRWorks in the past,

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.040
either version one or version two?

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.360
Okay, a few of you.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.880
It's a really nice application.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.370
It's just kind of a tabbed setup up here,
and it allows you to

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:56.340
stitch multiple images,
allows you to bring in existing

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:59.160
panoramas like the one we just did,
which is what I'm going to do.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.360
It does hotspots, multi-node scenes,
and such.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.460
So basically what they're doing now
is they have revved this for OS X.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.070
This is a beta release,
and so they still have some

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:15.700
things they'd like to do,
some of which, you know,

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.100
they're going to redo the
buttons and the icons to be all,

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.680
you know, 3D and conform to Aqua.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.980
All the modal dialogs are
going to be sheet windows.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.140
But one of the things from a
non-programmer's point of view

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:33.480
is they're going to try to make
this pane a little bit smarter,

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.210
which is the setup.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:37.220
In other words, you'll be able to just
drag your images on there,

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.220
and it's going to be kind
of an auto configuration.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:44.020
Right now, you have to, you know,
determine the-- what kind of image it is,

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.890
how many of them there are, you know,
what size they are, that kind of thing.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.000
But hopefully when this
is actually released,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.840
you'll just be able to
drag your images in there,

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.690
and the software will
figure all that out for you,

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.700
so you can kind of skip that step.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:02.370
What I'm going to do then, actually,
is just import a single panorama.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.000
Actually, let's just drag and drop it.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:14.400
So the one that we just
did from that other app,

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.460
which we called--

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.120
Thank you.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.120
I'm just going to drag that there.

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.120
It's going to ask me
if I want to rotate it.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.600
I happen to know that
I don't need to rotate that.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.120
It's already oriented correctly.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.120
and it's going to bring it in for us.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.420
So we can kind of look in there.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.200
The nice thing is, is they've always,
from the beginning actually,

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.560
although it's very seldom
used by a lot of people,

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.980
but you can actually
have access to filters,

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.100
all the QuickTime filters,
special effects.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.860
You know, if you wanted to add,
if you wanted to use

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.260
QuickTime to do blurring,
sharpening, that kind of stuff,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.680
you could do that all from within here.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:07.230
They have a built-in image editor,
so you can click here, bring it up,

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.160
and do some kind of basic editing.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.010
But also what's going to be new
in this version is the option to,

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:17.570
you know, say I'd rather use Photoshop,
basically,

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.960
and then when you click that button,
it's going to load the image

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:20.820
into Photoshop for you.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.060
So we'll jump ahead to hotspots.

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:30.270
And you basically choose a tool,
outline where you want

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.710
your hotspot to be.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.700
Tell it what kind of hotspot it is,
you know, a link or URL,

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.700
whatever you want it to be.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.090
Let's call it miscellaneous.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:48.050
And then another nice thing that
they've added in this version is the

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.240
ability to set all this information
and then basically choose a preset so

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.480
that you can always just go back then,
just drop down and choose a kind of

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.660
a template for all of the other ones.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.920
So we're just going to
look at this quickly.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.200
Oh, and you can do,
within the software now,

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.970
you can do fast start and
web fast track previews.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.800
So some of you have seen, you know,
you usually get the grid,

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.300
which you can also add so you can bring
in a low resolution preview for the VR.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.510
Yeah, preview the coming year.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.900
So there's our VR there.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.990
You can come up here,
maybe make it a little bit bigger.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.900
This is our hotspot.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.660
You can see the cursor change.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.900
Basically,
you can add annotations and stuff.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.400
Set the initial view if you
want to open up on that flower.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:50.900
You can go over here and set
that to be the initial view.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.470
And then export.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:58.340
So what I'm going to
do is export that here.

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:03.200
Call this Garden Movie.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:07.790
Oh, and then the other nice thing.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.440
So this is a project file right now.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.350
I'm going to close this project.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.880
Oh, rats, I forgot to save it, right?

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.700
Well, so what they've done now is
I can go back in to VRWorks,

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:25.860
and they have this nifty little thing
called Recompose Project for Movie.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:32.220
So those of you who have been using VR,
you'll see kind of the benefit to this.

00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:34.940
Now I can take the movie
that was just generated,

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:36.470
open it,

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.420
And it's going to recreate the project.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.920
So now I can go back in
there and I can re-edit it.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.270
There's my hot-- you know,
it's pulled the source basically back out

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.830
with the hot spots intact and everything.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.720
So now I don't have to worry about
saving all those project files anymore.

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.640
You can just recompose them
from the finalized movie.

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.900
That's a very powerful feature.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:53:59.910
We don't need that.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:00.410
Close that.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.570
Okay, so let's see.

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.360
Photo warp.

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:20.640
So PhotoWarp then is the software
aspect to the camera from IC360

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:24.120
and Kaidan called the i360 VR.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.060
And it's a similar unit to this.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.630
Like I say, there's about four or five
companies doing similar things.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.780
Kaidan is here downstairs if you
want to go down and take a look

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.800
at their optic and their software.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:41.490
But this is some very nice software,
you know, that a lot of time and thought

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.000
has been put in to doing it.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:47.820
So first of all,
I could just -- I have an image,

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:53.000
actually a fairly old image
from one of their optics that

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.330
I can just drag in there.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.700
I saw.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.700
Try that one more time.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:24.400
Oh, it doesn't like aliases.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.400
Okay.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.860
Yeah, it should be here.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.400
There it is.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.170
Yeah, okay.

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:36.200
I'll have to tell Michael.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.670
He doesn't like aliases.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:41.200
So it recognizes then that
this is one of its own images,

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.090
a 361 VR image.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.190
You can also import a
cylindrical or spherical image.

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:52.100
Then you can, under format,
you have QuickTime VR.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.730
It'll also spit out--

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.630
Java in this version, right?

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.060
And yeah, PT Viewer.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.760
You know, there's several other formats
that it'll spit out as well.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.180
So now here we, again,
choose the compression, choose the view.

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:09.350
So we have view.

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.420
You know, tell it what size.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.700
Again, you can also generate the
fast start preview here,

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:19.430
or you can choose a-- pull
in a different image there.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.960
Okay, so we'll leave that there.

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.440
You can set a target size if you thought,
well,

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.940
I'd like to have the key to move around,
you know, 300K or whatever.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:34.100
And let's just do this.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.360
Click on Warp.

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.750
And it's going to unwrap
that movie for us.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:57:00.370
And then it's putting it down
there for us so we can see it.

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:07.290
So then the other nice thing that I want
to show you is we can also then go back.

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:17.700
I'm going to change this
to a cylindrical image.

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:19.700
I'm not sure if I can
just drag this in or not.

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:23.460
We'll find out if it'll replace
it on the fly or if I have

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.700
to delete that one first.

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:31.320
But the other image I shot,
which is this one,

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:41.180
So then this is actually the cylindrical
image shot with this other lens after it

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.080
had gone through the Photoshop action.

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:48.760
So you can go ahead and import
a cylindrical image as well.

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.560
and again, go through all those steps.

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.060
But I highly recommend you go down
to the Kaidan booth because there's

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:55.360
actually a lot of nice features.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.920
There's some batch processing
capabilities and such that you

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.350
should really try to take a look at
down there if you are interested.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:12.000
All right,
now let's jump into the live stage.

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.670
How many of you are live
stage pro users currently?

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:19.840
A few of you, okay.

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:31.380
Okay, well LiveStage Pro is a
QuickTime authoring application.

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:33.080
Very, very, very powerful.

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.800
And it's come a long way
since it was first done,

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.460
and they're trying to make it, you know,
despite the Pro title,

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:43.020
they're trying to also now make it
a little bit easier for people that

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:46.440
don't want to dive in and have to
learn kind of a scripting language

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.340
and syntax and all that stuff.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.650
So it still is a very
powerful program that,

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:53.050
you know, if you want to get into
that side of things,

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:53.700
you certainly can.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.300
But as I mentioned with this 4.1 release,
they've really gone out of

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.340
their way to target the VR crowd
specifically and to make it much

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.590
easier because they have found,
like other,

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.630
as have other software developers for VR,
that, you know, a lot of the VR producers

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:09.480
are photographers,
and sure, they can use a Mac and such,

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.030
but they're not coming from the same
background probably as a lot of people

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:15.420
at this particular conference are.

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.890
So they wanted to kind of
make it a little bit easier

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:18.340
for people to get into that.

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.340
So they wanted to kind of
make it as easy as possible.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.340
So what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to take one of those movies.

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.340
Here's my library.

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.330
I'm going to drag it
over here on the stage.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:32.030
Pops it up and it's going to
add a VR track for me down here.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.300
Now, so one of the new features
in 4 then was the addition of

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.390
these things called FastTracks.

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.570
So in the old days,
what I'd have to do is I'd

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:48.400
have to add a sprite track,
have to add a sprite, and then, you know,

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.370
on the handlers, tell it, you know,
on mouse down, do this, do that,

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.370
and I'd have to know all that syntax.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:57.780
But now all I can do, or all I need to do
really is I can just say,

00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:00.300
"I want to add some controls."

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.340
So it's going to pop up this VR editor.

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:09.280
Okay, and it's going to add that track
for me automatically right here.

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:12.340
The nice thing about it is
it comes with default media,

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.310
which can be changed very easily.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.990
I think they give you
some other options here,

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.650
too.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.400
Basically,
all you need to do is from your library,

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.050
just click and drag and bring it over.

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:31.010
And then it's going to replace
it on the fly like that.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.210
So let's go back to the VR editor.

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:34.540
So here's the node we're in now.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.800
Okay, this is all live here.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.460
And you can change speed, et cetera,
et cetera.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.230
Basically, but that's all there is
to having to do that.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.420
So I'm going to close that, though,
just for a second and just preview this

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:49.970
just so you can see how simple this is.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.130
Okay.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.940
So there's my movie, as you can see.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.540
And I can use it the traditional way,
or I can go down here and

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.890
use these buttons this way.

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:08.530
And that is that image that I dragged in,
just kind of without looking what it was.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.170
Zooming in here.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.740
Okay, so I mean, that's a huge thing for
anybody that's ever seen.

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:20.870
That would have taken 40 minutes to do
prior to version 4 because you'd have to

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:23.450
do it all by hand and do all the coding.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.560
So now you can say, "Well, you know what?

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.470
I also want to maybe do a...

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.400
Maybe a compass.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.590
I'm going to add a compass track.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:39.420
Depending on the application,
compasses are kind of popular, you know,

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.400
kind of giving you an orientation
as to where you're looking,

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.400
especially if you're going
to be jumping around nodes.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.520
So again, they give you default media,
which you can use or not.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.660
And in fact,
you can choose a linear style like

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:57.600
that and have it kind of scroll
across like a dial or a radial one,

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.200
based either on pan angle or tilt angle.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.200
So we'll leave it at that.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.600
And say we want to look there.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.190
I'm going to set that as north.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.590
So now that's going to be north
so that the arrow's pointing

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.200
up at that particular view.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:16.340
Close that,
and I can simply go over here,

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:17.200
drag that around.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.000
If I were building this, you know,
I might have a nice background image.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.800
What I'm going to do is just
use their basic background,

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.090
but I'll go ahead and change it to...

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:41.100
[Transcript missing]

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:42.580
I don't know if you can
tell from back there,

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.740
but here's my indicator.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.400
And as I'm panning, it's panning as well.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.520
And as I face that fountain,
it's giving me the direction of north.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:59.270
So again,
that would have taken a considerable,

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.190
significantly amount of time
to do prior to this version.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.620
And then they also-- let's see,
they do-- you can do

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.180
directional sounds that way.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.900
You can add sounds.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.740
Let's go ahead, though,
and look at the VR editor

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.670
again for a second.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.100
Even though they don't do any stitching,
they have given us now the capability

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:24.170
to do hotspots within the application.

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:29.840
So there's the hotspot that
was created previously.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.990
I can go in here and see it.

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.700
And I can alter it, you know,
there it is there.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.010
I have to grab this tool.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.630
I can move it around,
put it where I want, go back,

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.440
change the settings associated to it.

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.740
I can use custom cursors.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.240
I can change the way it links.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.810
You know,
I can tell it where it's linking to.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:51.660
You can do all that kind of stuff.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.440
So it's very powerful.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.860
And then if you do want to get
into the QScript type of thing,

01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.860
this is kind of the
traditional way to do it,

01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:01.860
where the handlers are here.

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:04.760
If you, you know,
didn't want to use the fast tracks.

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:13.430
And then another very cool feature
that they added then-- let me

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.890
change this back a little bit.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.000
Back to my local library.

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.240
I'm going to take my other movie.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.730
I'm just going to simply go down here.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:29.840
And it's going to say append, and voila,
now I have a multi-node movie.

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:32.140
And not only that,
but the software was smart enough to

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:36.300
go ahead and automatically extend those
two tracks that it created for me.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.680
So now I have two nodes,
and the controller and the

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:48.660
compass are going to go ahead
and be there for both nodes.

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:51.150
So I can go back to this node.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.580
HotSpot.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.780
This is node one.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.900
There's node two.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:00.610
Link to node.

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:02.560
You'll tell it where it's going to go.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.930
All that kind of stuff.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.760
So I can add-- I can create
additional HotSpots here if I wanted.

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:10.680
Choose a color.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.480
And again, just go in there.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.480
And now instead of using the
one that was in there before,

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.430
I could create my own.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.120
So, very, very powerful, very, very easy.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.120
And they're also having a pretty
unbelievable sale price for the show.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.110
So you might want to try to hook
up with those guys if you can.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:38.230
What else was there to show?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.670
Let's see,
we did the Zoomify and the 360 optic.

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:48.640
We did VRWorks.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.600
And again, VRWorks and PhotoWarp,
they're both downstairs.

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:54.350
So I didn't want to spend a
lot of time going through them.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:58.180
Both of them have a lot more features
and functionality than what I've shown,

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.060
but since they're downstairs,
I'd recommend you go down there.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.180
Live Stage Pro we did.

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.340
Looked at the Manfrotto head.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.300
Oh, Dennis.

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.340
Is Dennis still here?

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.770
Yes.

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:13.140
So what we'll do, it's 10 now,
a little after 10.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:17.260
Dennis will take a few minutes,
show us a custom head that he had made,

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.260
and then we'll do some Q&A.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.810
Thank you.

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:07.440
This is a VR head that we had
custom fabricated for our project.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.630
I'm working at the
National Air and Space Museum,

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.360
part of the Smithsonian.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.400
We'll be talking about a case study.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.380
I need a microphone.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.400
Okay, sorry.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.390
Is this good?

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.400
Can you use this one?

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.470
She's waving to me.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.400
It must be okay.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.130
Thumbs up.

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:24.380
I got thumbs up now.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.400
So this is a custom fabricated head.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:36.400
We have a lot of issues on our project
building and shooting all these aircraft.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.660
We have 200 aircraft to shoot,
and we're using Jim's

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.400
standard spherical head.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:46.170
But we had some issues with
going into cockpits of jets.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.400
It takes 15 minutes to raise
and lower the canopies.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.350
So picture you had to raise and
lower the canopy for every shot.

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.400
You'd need to do 36.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.400
So we'd be there a few days.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.400
So we had a gentleman.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.500
A gentleman in the audience, Dr.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.400
Lewis Knapp.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.400
And he came up with this motorized head.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.750
Unfortunately,
Terry's still trying to figure out

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.290
how to work with his other stuff.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.320
I got it.

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:13.400
But basically,
it would just mount on a tripod.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.400
We mount it inside the aircraft.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.540
We hit start, close the canopy,
and then the head would automatically

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:25.310
start to rotate and put the
camera in the correct position.

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.400
Does the full 36 shots or
whatever it's programmed for.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.400
And it fires off the camera.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.380
So then we can open up the canopy,
then pull our equipment out and

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.400
move on to another aircraft.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.310
So...

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:41.880
Lots of different things
that we've had to do,

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.760
and we'll talk about
that in my presentation,

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.030
but Terry wanted me to show
another solution out there.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.440
Don't know how much it
would cost on the market.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.690
You'd have to talk to Louis.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.300
I think he's into taking your firstborn.

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:59.980
So, or at least, you know, the right arm,
you know,

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.280
whichever is the trigger finger.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.810
So that's kind of it for my presentation.

01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:04.160
Wow.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:04.520
Okay.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.060
Terry.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:05.400
Great.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.700
So we'll do some Q&A if
Jim wants to come back up.

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:18.630
I have flyers, actually,
for the Manfrotto.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.460
I forgot that what they do, actually,
is they supply you with

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.570
two sets of brackets.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.230
So I had the wrong bracket on there,
which is nice,

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:28.420
because they'll do larger brackets
for bigger SLR cameras like this,

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:32.210
or they'll supply smaller brackets if
you're going to be using a consumer,

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.880
prosumer-type digital camera.
