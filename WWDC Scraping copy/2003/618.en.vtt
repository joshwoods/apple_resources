00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.020
Please welcome Rob Neville to the podium.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.760
Thank you everybody.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.680
My name is Rob Neville and
I manage the engineering team

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.180
that does manage desktop 410.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.860
The sign outside says this is
managing for a networking environment.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.360
If you're here just to hear
something about managing in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.050
a networking environment,
it's going to be different than that

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.500
because today what we're going to
be talking about is developing for

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.400
a managed client environment for 10.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.710
Okay, so today what we're going to
be talking about is developing

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.720
for Mac OS X Managed Desktop.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.930
Mac OS X is a managed environment,
and we're going to be discussing

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.180
in a variety of ways how it
is a managed environment.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Ostensibly what we did when we were here
last year is we introduced you to the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.300
concept of Apple desktop management.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.300
And it's a year later.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
We've got a year's worth
of software under our belt.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.770
We've got customers who are
actually utilizing the product

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.300
and have been giving us feedback.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.430
We've got developers here
who are developing products

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.270
to work in that environment.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.150
So we'll be discussing where we are,
where we are today,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.300
where we've come from,
and what it is you guys need to do

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.300
and to learn to provide solutions
and to customize your environment

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.370
to work better in this environment.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.830
So we're going to be talking
about a managed environment.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.530
So I'd like to turn the
Wayback Machine back,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.090
take us back in history five years,
back before there was a Mac OS X.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.700
And what we had then was the Mac OS,
Mac OS 9, Mac OS 8.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.650
And that was an unmanaged computer.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.740
You plugged it in.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.140
You booted, you came up to the finder,
you could do whatever you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.980
want whenever you wanted.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.940
You got up and walked
away from your machine,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.230
somebody could sit down behind you,
do whatever they want,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.560
whenever they wanted.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.940
You had no way of controlling
that environment at all.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.900
To do that,
to do any sort of control at all,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.480
you had to get additional software.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.560
Apple provided you additional software,
it was called Macintosh Manager.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.840
Macintosh Manager gave you
the notions of having multiple

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.710
users use a particular machine,
putting access control,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.800
which applications could they access,
which printers could they use,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.240
a variety of things.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.990
You needed a server
to be able to do that.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.300
But you started getting the
notion of managing the computer.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.140
Well, Mac OS X comes along--let's
fast forward to the present--Mac

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.450
OS X comes along and out of the box,
it's a managed environment.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.490
If I go home today and open up a
brand new computer and boot it up,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.490
turn on MacBuddy,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.300
Install the software,
pick my admin account,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.290
get up and running.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.110
I auto-login, turn on fast login,
so I just come up,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.740
I never see a login screen.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.730
The user thinks that they're not managed,
but they are.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.190
There are some things that I cannot
do as that administration user,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.500
that only a super user can do.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.920
So right out of the box,
there are at least two

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.700
users of the system.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.740
and I am not, by default, the super user.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.500
So, just right out of the box,
we've got a managed environment.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.440
We put people into a home directory.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.830
They get a home directory for free,
even on a local machine.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.060
So even without any
Apple desktop management at all,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.610
you are managed.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.400
Taking that one step further,
then I start adding users.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.510
Again, if we're just even in
a local environment.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.720
So at home,
I have user accounts for my wife,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.200
for my children.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.930
I don't have any server involved.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.960
None of them--I have
no managed preferences,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.840
which is what our group primarily does.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.670
I've never run a work group manager.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.600
I still have a managed environment.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.960
I don't have access to the
data in my kids' home directory

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.070
unless I go in as a super user.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.710
So we'll be discussing a little
bit of that as we just have.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.830
We're also going to be discussing
some of the customer usage

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.970
scenarios that we've seen.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.360
What I just discussed briefly was just
a normal setup where I have a single

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.240
machine with just multiple user accounts.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.540
That's a managed environment.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.270
We'll be talking about what Apple's
desktop management solution is,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.100
what it is, what it isn't.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.700
I'll be talking briefly a little
bit about what we've learned.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.860
So it's been a year.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.360
People are starting to--if you
went to Michael Lopp's session

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.710
yesterday on the desktop solutions,
he talked about deployment, access,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.320
and assessing the deployment,
and rolling out.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.920
Well, people have been rolling
out--starting to roll out solutions.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.210
And for those of you--how many here
work in an IT department or work in IT?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.400
How many of you are
application developers?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.840
Okay, so we've got--looks
like it's about 70-30.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.380
Seventy applications developers, 30% IT.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.680
So with the IT--you IT folks,
you know that you test out a deployment

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.380
before you roll it out to your customers,
or disaster will happen in most cases.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.070
So what happens is,
as you're deploying that,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.360
you find the glitches and the gutches,
and you've been giving us feedback

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.400
on some of those implementations,
and we've taken those to heart.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
So we'll be discussing some of those.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.400
And where we're going to be taking
Apple desktop management going forward.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.360
I'll be showing you a little
bit about what's new in 10.3,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.110
which will be coming out soon.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.200
And what it is you--70% of the people
in here--what it is you're going to

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.160
need to do to work in that environment.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.320
Things you're going to need to do.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.400
Things you're going to
need to pay attention to.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.400
And really what you're going
to need to do going forward.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.830
So let's jump over to
our customer usage model,

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.710
because this is the way we
think about--what we think about

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.900
when we're developing software,
at least in my organization.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.980
We try and identify who
our critical customers are.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.400
Some of you are in this room.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.520
If you're not on this screen, you know,
come talk to me after the session,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.400
and we'll start paying attention
to what your usage scenario is.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.220
But what we do is we look at
various customer scenarios,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.880
and we try and gear our software and
the solution that we're developing to

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.930
meet one of these customer scenarios.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.800
So the first one we have
is a one-to-one deployment.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.910
And what do I mean by that?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.490
That's a scenario whereby
I hand you a PowerBook.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.200
I own the PowerBook.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.580
You don't own the PowerBook.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.740
I have given you an
account on that PowerBook.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.300
Let's say it's employee.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.980
You do not have super user
access to that machine.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.880
You don't even have admin
access to that machine.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.510
I put everything on that machine
that you could possibly want

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.510
to use that I can think of.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.320
But can you add new software to it?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.800
Not if it requires
admin access to do that.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.570
You would have to give it back to
me to install new software on it.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.180
But it's my physical machine.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.530
I give it to you.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.500
You can add bookmarks.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.000
You can do whatever you can do as a user.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.000
You have physical access to the machine,
but you don't have admin access.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.940
And one of our significant
customers of this is the schools,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.990
where schools will hand out CPUs on a
temporary or even a long-term basis.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.620
It's owned by the school system.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:41.400
[Transcript missing]

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:51.320
There's a full-blown IT deployment
where I've got a server in the back,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.150
I may have Big Iron behind
the server in the back room,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.800
you've got network accounts,
I have site license software

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.460
that I have in numbers of seats
that each individual can use.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.930
So I control which printers
you can have access to,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.510
which applications you
can have access to.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.290
How much data storage
you have on my servers,

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.410
what servers you have access to,
what your username is,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.640
what your password is,
how often you have to

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.350
change your password,
how long your password needs to be,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.340
what sites you can access,
what you can't access.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.960
I control all that you see and hear.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.640
In that particular case,
mostly the people have network accounts.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.040
So that's really useful,
but that in and of itself--and

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.760
we've tried to solve some of
this--can create problems.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.990
Usually not for a big IT place,
but I was in a session yesterday

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.650
where we were talking about
where a user got up and spoke at

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.060
the podium--at the microphone.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.960
And he was saying,
"We still have 10BaseT.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.920
We're still deployed on
top of 10BaseT." Well,

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.400
so if I have all my network storage
and it's all happening over 10BaseT,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.860
now with significant amounts of
data flowing around and lots of

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.380
people using my 10BaseT network,
even just doing browsing.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:22.380
Downloading some of that stuff
off of the net is something

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.500
we've attempted to try and solve.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.700
The other thing is the scenario
that I alluded to in the beginning,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.500
where you have an
at-home kind of setting.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.820
Though I know that some of you out
there are deploying capabilities

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.660
as an IT solution as well,
this is primarily geared towards a

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.500
small or very small number usage,
and that's the capabilities.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.890
However, the capabilities scenario,
which allows you to control

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.480
media--so Johnny can burn a CD,
Johnny can't burn a CD,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.500
but I can--and what
applications Johnny can use.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500
I don't want Johnny using the terminal,
those kinds of things.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.270
It's primarily for application access
control and media access control,

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.890
and it's in a small environment,
but the mechanism for doing

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:16.030
that is the same mechanism as
what is used in a big system.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.680
We don't have a separate
means for funneling that kind

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.500
of data down to the system.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.080
We use the same mechanism for
capabilities as we do for a

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.400
full managed environment in IT.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.820
Then we get the mobile user,
and the mobile user is a little

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.490
bit different from the one-to-one
deployment I was talking about.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.780
In this case, I give you the computer,
and you have a network account.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.340
You have this computer.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.100
You sit down,
you connect up to the network,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.490
and you log in.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.050
You log in with a username and password,
and then you unplug

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.310
that from the network,
and you take it home.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.950
You take it on the road with you.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.470
I have some medium of control,
but maybe not as much.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.400
I may say that you can
access the CD or not.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.400
But it's in a mixed kind of environment.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:12.400
And there are others, and we want to hear
what those others are.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.920
We really want to get a
feeling for how it is that you

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.560
people are using the product.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.520
Because the clearer the
feedback you give us,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.490
the better the product
we can deliver to you.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.240
So what is it that we're
talking about here?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.040
Apple Managed Desktop.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.000
So Apple Managed Desktop is a
mechanism for managing resources.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.280
And what is that?

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.110
Well, that's people.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.930
So I manage people by
managing user lists,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.640
by managing passwords
and password policies.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.200
It's managing equipment settings,
and there's some new

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.080
ones that we're managing.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.500
It's, you know,
does the computer turn off

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.680
at 10 o'clock at night?

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.960
Do I have screensavers come on?

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:05.510
Not screensavers,
but does the monitor dim automatically?

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.710
Do you have access to these
kinds of applications?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.040
Applications are resources.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.060
So how do we do that?

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.540
We do that through Workgroup Manager,
primarily.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.980
Capabilities is handled through the
system in a small kind of environment.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.610
But what you have is you have
your personal environment

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.240
where you have your accounts.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.020
And if you move from accounts
on a local level for a system,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.320
you move to Workgroup Manager.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.320
Workgroup Manager basically is
a bigger accounts management

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.480
thing with lots more options.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.020
Because you have lots
more that you can control.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.830
But what is Workgroup Manager?

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.100
Workgroup Manager is
primarily a directory editor.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.380
It edits data that sits in a directory.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:55.080
And that's going to become much
clearer to you all with Panther.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.390
Because for me,
a key feature of Workgroup

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:05.360
Manager in Panther is the inspector.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:12.730
Because that gives me the ability
to go in and edit my directory raw.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.050
That's a lot of power,
and there's not a lot of sanity

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.080
checking that happens when that goes on.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.010
So, you know,
buyer beware--user beware in

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.190
this particular situation.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:41.210
What we do in my group,
which primarily handles the

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.210
preference setting--and as we
look into Workgroup Manager,

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.210
you'll see, and we'll be dealing a lot
with the preference setting--is

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.210
we take those preferences and
we put them into an XML file.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.950
into an XML format, and we store those in
the directory structure.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.310
We really don't,
and then when a user logs in,

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:56.050
we go out to the server based on what
machine the user is logging in on,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.060
who the user is,
what groups they're part of

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.870
or have chosen to be part of
for this particular session.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.970
And we get that XML data
out of the directory.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.850
We unionize it or munge it,
put it down to the local system,

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.230
and that sets what their preferences are.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:22.140
We also do volume mounting as part of
the programmatic process that happens.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.190
We also pass information off
to the system so that if you

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.200
have applications that need to
launch or those kinds of things,

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.860
we set those preferences so
that other system services

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.560
can take advantage of those.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.830
But we really don't do a lot
of actions other than that.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.700
We are not access control lists.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.590
Though we do allow for permissions
and preferences and things like that,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.950
we're not setting up
access control lists.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.140
So we have a managed environment.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.090
The top of the managed
environment chain for us is users.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.380
The first thing you do is you
set up users and you set them up

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.000
usually with home directories.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Not always.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.090
Because I can set up a series of users
and they don't have home directories

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.920
and maybe they're all FTP users.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.080
In that case, they're managed.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.250
They're managed FTP users.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.350
They don't have--they're not going to
be accessing this particular device,

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.860
and so they don't have home directories.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.120
In those home directories,
we store preferences.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.720
So again,
a bunch has changed with Panther,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.080
and the things that you as
developers and you as IT folks

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:44.310
really need to pay attention to,
and that is today with Jaguar,

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.720
I sit down and I log in as me.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.760
And until I log out,
I'm the only one using the

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.430
machine for the most part.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.920
Now, I know people can SSH in,
people can FTP in,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.130
people can do a bunch of stuff.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:07.190
But as far as accessing freestanding,
native Mac OS X, you know,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.450
GUI applications, I'm the only one that's
doing any of that.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:25.200
[Transcript missing]

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:32.090
So that I can get up from my desk,
go to lunch, or I can be in a lab and be

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.510
sitting there and accessing it,
and then my lab partner can

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.540
switch over to their account.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.840
So now you have two people logged
into the machine at the same time.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.260
And application developer me puts
all those things in a global space,

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.030
or with an absolute path,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.830
Well, User 2 can't access the data
that User 1 is accessing because

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.600
I've got it open and running.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.570
So those are some of the things that
you really need to be thinking about

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.200
when you're developing solutions or
when you're testing out your products.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.000
Don't require specific folders.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.000
Now, last year when I was giving
this kind of presentation,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.390
I had a whole scenario where I showed
a demo and I ran FS usage on a

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.830
bunch of applications and showed
how some applications were being

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.210
bad and they were doing lots of I/O,
and if you have I/O over the network,

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.000
it's bad.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.990
I tried to look for some applications
that were doing some bad things.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Early iterations of
some people's software,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.000
if you didn't have a specific
folder with a specific name,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.590
the application would crash.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.290
Now, if you want a specific folder,
some of these applications,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:48.600
they will create a new application
with that particular folder.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.050
Our customers like to customize.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.200
Customers customize.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.280
And don't require them to
have a specific folder.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:04.170
Don't, you know,
"My App Folder." So you provide

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.940
an application and it has to have
these--don't use specific folder names.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:09.940
Use relative names where possible.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:20.020
Allow for one installation per CPU,
but don't require--don't disallow

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.140
multiple users from accessing
that particular application.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.200
This is, you know,
the fast user switching scenario.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.570
You can't be sure that only
one person is going to be

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.020
trying to run your application.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.400
You're going to be multiple
users in the machine.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:40.530
Also assume that your application
will be accessed over the network.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.440
So why is that?

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.350
Well, that's for a couple of reasons.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.530
I do some beta testing for
some Mac OS X applications,

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.900
which I can't talk about
because they're still in beta.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:57.450
And one of the first bugs I wrote
on these applications was I logged

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.840
in using my network user ID,
which is out on the network,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.600
and I tried to run the application,
and it crashed.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.010
It didn't like me not running locally.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.310
It also didn't like me
not running as admin,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.240
which is a totally also
different scenario.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.010
So there are two different things.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.250
One, assume that if I'm doing I/O,
for example,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:25.040
if I'm writing out to a cache or I'm
storing files in temporary folders,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.630
if they're stored out on the network.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.180
You have to assume that where
that user's home directory is

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.440
could be out on the network.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.740
And that if it's out over the network,
what we ran into here this morning

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.030
is there's a really big airport
configuration here for all of

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.150
you guys to have airport access.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.140
That can get really busy.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.670
And if I'm booting or running
multiple applications,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.600
all of them over airport,
and all of this data's in

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.610
various network home directories,
it might not be the fastest

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.500
airport implementation.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.430
In a lot of cases,
we have airport solutions

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.350
that we've sold to schools,
and they haven't updated to the new,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.880
faster airports.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.680
So they're accessing their network
folders over airport with 30,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.540
40 people connecting to the same
airport base station at the same time,

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.310
and the performance goes into the toilet.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.970
So you as developers need to take that
into consideration when you're building.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.730
You're writing your applications.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:33.070
Don't require the users to run your
applications if you're developers

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.910
out there to have admin access.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.560
As we get back to the usage scenario,
most of our users aren't

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.970
running as admins.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.100
Most of them are running
as network users,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:51.070
and some percentage of them know an
admin password for their machine,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.070
but

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:58.060
A large number of customers do not,
and some subset of

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.400
customers--one customer,
two customers--might be 40,000 users,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.540
where none of those 40,000
users know their admin password.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:11.450
So, use our product to test your product.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:19.000

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.500
Workgroup Manager.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.280
What is Workgroup Manager?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.390
Workgroup Manager is a way to
manage system-level preferences.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:35.290
How many of you have used
Workgroup Manager here on Jaguar?

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.480
So about 20-25%. For those
of you who have not,

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.460
Workgroup Manager allows
you to set preferences into

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.940
three separate categories.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.980
I'll be showing you a Workgroup
Manager demo here in a bit,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.120
and I'll go into a little bit more
because 75% of you haven't used it.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.440
Basically we have the notion
of three different groupings.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.640
We have users,
which I think you're all familiar with.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.380
We have groups,
which you're sort of all familiar with.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.260
The users are part of groups,
and you're familiar with that.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.580
And then we have computer lists.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.810
So basically what happens is
when the machine boots up,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.990
it is bound to--in most cases or
in a lot of cases--it's bound to

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.840
some directory in the network.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.280
So it gets network
services available to it.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.380
It's bound to some directory.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.890
And the machine will go to that
directory and find out whether or not

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.020
it knows about me on the computer.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.020
Does it know about me?

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.780
In its list, yes or no.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:42.110
If I am, are there any preferences
associated with me,

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.960
my specific device?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.870
There may or may not be.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:54.560
If I'm not in a list of known computers,
does the binding handle guest computers?

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.600
So anybody who comes and
plugs in their machine.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.880
And what preferences are
associated with that?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.610
Maybe I require everybody who logs
into my network to have a list log in.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.920
things like that,
we'll show you some of that when we get

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.420
into showing your workgroup manager.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.320
Then, it puts up the user list.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.070
You get a user list,
I get to pick what user

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.560
I want to log in as.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.020
Once I've logged in as that user,
then I get to pick what group the user

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.570
might be a member of multiple groups.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.900
And I can set preferences
at each of those levels,

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.500
and we'll show you how we do that.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.900
Workgroup manager also sets non-MCX data.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.950
That's the MCX data,
for system level preferences,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:36.920
as we'll see.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.020
It also sets up non-MCX data.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.900
This is workgroup manager,
where I go and I add users.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.960
And I add home directories.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.570
I add group volumes that
are accessible to them.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:57.010
and I set up parameters and
policies for those users.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.570
This user has a home .
They have 5K of storage in it,

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.400
because I don't have--I have
thousands and thousands of users

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.370
using this particular machine,
and I don't want them to have

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.890
a lot of network storage.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.710
5K is really small,
but let's say 5 meg or 100 meg

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.500
or something--something small.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.880
So--but I'm already managing
those users by telling them,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.070
"This is how much storage you have
on my network devices." The other

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:29.480
thing to remember with Workgroup
Manager is it's directory-centric.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.490
So I can set this thing
up in a directory,

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.140
I can configure users,
and those users could have

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.390
home directories on a totally
different set of machines.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.760
Setup in Workgroup Manager:
Where those home directories are

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.700
does not need to be on the machine
that is holding the information.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.690
So,
Workgroup Manager is a directory-centric,

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.690
it's not a server-centric configuration.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.830
Again, take the Wayback
Machine back five years ago,

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.800
and what we were dealing with was
Apple Share and Apple Share IP,

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:06.270
where your user list was
specific to a specific machine.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.490
What we do when we move into
a directory-centric model is,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.180
"I can have the same username and
password and have that be accessible

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.040
in multiple different arenas."

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.730
So what's new for 10.3?

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.840
Well, there are a couple of things.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.280
And the first one that you see up there,
mobile accounts,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.260
is something I'm really happy with.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:36.500
[Transcript missing]

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.900
and we'll get to one
of our usage scenarios,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.010
and that usage scenario
is the mobile environment.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.770
I give you--again,
thank you very much for volunteering--I

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:51.130
give you this PowerBook,
and you have a network ID,

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.010
because you're an employee for me.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:59.090
So you have a network ID,
you have a network account where I give

00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.090
you so much data storage on my server.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.090
and you can log in.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.180
When you log in,
you log in with your network ID,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.460
your username and password,
and you're sitting at your desktop with

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.740
your PowerBook and everything's fine.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:16.570
You unplug that PowerBook from
the network and you go home,

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:16.570
you go on the road,
you try and log in using your network ID.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:23.320
And you can't, because there's no network
user on that local device.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:33.370
So what do you do?

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:34.490
I've given you admin access
to that particular machine

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.490
so you can do some stuff.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.490
I'm a nice guy and you've
got control of the machine,

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.490
so you can create a local user
with your first name only.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:59.300
[Transcript missing]

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.100
Log out.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.100
Log back in as my local
user with your first name.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.670
Well, I'm out the directory,
but now I don't have read/write

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.620
access to my network home directory.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.980
What am I going to do?

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.500
Ha-ha!

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.780
You're going to use mobile accounts.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.500
Mobile accounts,
what that will allow you to do is,

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.940
I as an administrator know
what you're going to be doing.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:28.160
So I say, for you,
you have the ability to set up a local

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.460
account with the same name and password,
and to the system,

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.120
it looks like the same user.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:44.410
So you have the same permissions,
the same group access, the same user ID.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.500
All of that's the same.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.210
I unplug that machine, I take it home,
I take it on the road,

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.800
I type in the same username and password.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.390
I get the same password policy.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.300
Everything is the same.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.900
I plug it back into the network.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.230
Now,
what this won't do--this is just account

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.580
creation at this particular juncture.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.760
This is a transitionary solution.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.440
What we will do for you,
and we will allow you to do,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.200
is we will mount your network
home directory on your

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.270
desktop when it's available.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.060
so that I do my work and I want
to copy this stuff up to my

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.840
data storage on the network.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.430
Let's say I only have
100 meg of data storage.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.080
Well, that's fine for my documents.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.040
The documents that have changed,
my spreadsheet maybe or this

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.040
and that and the other thing,
and I can copy them up.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.160
I don't have to worry about permissions.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.520
I don't have to worry
about any of that stuff.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.450
We don't do that for you.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.610
We will mount the volume for you,
but we won't do the copying for you.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.690
We will put the documents
folder in your doc,

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.420
again, for easy transferring of data.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.320
So you'll have your network account
documents folder will be there.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.180
Your network account home directory
will be in your desktop if you want it,

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.990
and you asked me to set that up for you.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.110
We don't set up the synchronization.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.140
Our utilities,
our sync and some other utilities,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.710
and we're providing,
the OS is providing utilities

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.900
going forward that will allow
those kinds of things to happen.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.380
But for doing file copying and access,
we don't do that.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.540
So if I go home and I connect up
to 100 different browser sites,

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.700
and I add them bookmarks,
and then I want to log in at work

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.060
on my desktop with the same user ID,
I'm not going to get those,

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.000
unless I copy them,
in which case then I will.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.030
So very excited about that.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.950
I think that'll be a real plus,
make it a lot easier for people to work,

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.620
and I know it'll make it a
lot easier for me to work.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.980
Additional login window options.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.100
New in Mac OS 10.3, we have auto logout.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.560
I use this now.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.770
I set mine for 45 minutes.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.810
I get up, I go to lunch,
and when I come back in,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.900
I'm sitting at the login screen.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.900
I'm not sitting at the screen saver.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.290
I may be at the screen saver,
depending on how I configure that,

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.900
but I've actually logged out.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:03.890
So, auto log out.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:03.890
And the ability to manage that.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.060
Again, we have fast user switching,
and we've given you the

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.600
ability to manage that.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.000
We've given you the ability
to turn that off and on.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.000
Because what you may want is you may
want to have fast user switching on

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.580
most of the machines in your lab,
except for that special one in the back,

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.000
which has a new video card
or something else in it.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.100
We've also--and people talked to me
about this yesterday at another session,

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.690
just because they saw who I was
or remembered me from past

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:37.910
years--and that is the ability
to mount additional SharePoints.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:42.560
So you can, it's not just,
what we currently have today is

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.920
if you're a member of a group,
you can mount a group SharePoint.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.940
And that's good because it's
sort of workflow oriented.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.470
But this gives you the ability
to mount additional ones

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.650
because people are saying,
well, yeah, I want them to be able

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.680
to mount a group one,
but I also want them to be

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.780
able to mount a documents one.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.590
I also want to mount a pictures
one and things that are going

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.920
to be global to a whole bunch of
people that may be across groups.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.500
So we're giving you
the ability to do that.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.680
Universal access.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.870
These are things to handle
a lot of special ed needs.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.600
And the other thing,
and this comes up with where we've

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.720
been hopefully listening to you guys,
and that is for application access,

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.080
currently in Jaguar today
we have an allow list.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.870
Allow the users to access
these applications.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.930
Well, that's good.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.600
But not great.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.600
And why isn't that great?

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:44.470
Well, because you all, as developers,
may find and have found that at times

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:48.980
to solve a particular engineering need,
it's easier and faster to just

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.330
write a Unix utility that your
main application then calls.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.370
It munges some data in
the background for you,

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:02.670
you fork off some data to it,
or you pipe some data over here.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:02.670
And those

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:09.670
"Applications, or those little utilities,
aren't visible to the system in the same

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:13.170
way as your full-blown application is."

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.260
They actually don't appear
any differently to the OS as

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.860
a text file in some cases,
though there are file differences

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.680
and extension differences.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.170
But if I go to open the file,
it's just gonna look like a bunch

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.840
of text data in a lot of cases.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.120
So the ability for us in a user
interface to show everything that

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.610
possibly could be an executable
would be a very big long list.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.680
So we only displayed applications.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.660
So what might happen is I allow
you to run your application,

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.450
I'll use Photoshop for an example,
and let's say your dithering

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.390
utility is a Unix-based tool.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.200
I didn't allow my user the ability
to launch that dithering tool.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.240
So guess what's gonna happen when
they try to dither the image?

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.030
It isn't gonna work because they don't
have access to be able to do that.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.900
So what we've given you
is the ability to say,

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.710
well, allow Unix-level tools to execute.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:11.260
We've also given you the
ability to have a deny list.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.280
And what we found is that what
people really wanna have happen,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.560
what our customers really want,
is they don't want the

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.850
students to run iTunes.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.660
So, you can't run iTunes,
you can't run a terminal,

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.020
you can't run a console,
you can't run this, you can't run that.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.170
All the things that they can easily pick,
we just tell them you can't run those.

00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:33.050
And so we've added a deny list.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.180
And we think that with these
particular different groupings,

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:42.050
we've given you a lot
more flexibility for 10.3.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.260
So now what I'd like to do is
I'd like to show you a demo

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.770
workgroup manager here on Demo 1.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.900
So what we have here is something which
is probably familiar to all of you.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.230
We've got a little bit of--a
few things that are different.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.250
A little bit different look and feel.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.050
But ostensibly,
this is where we--this is where

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.900
everybody usually starts out.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:12.250
And I'm in here and I want
to create a new user.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.890
And I'll create my new user, WWDC.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.860
Give them a password.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.400
I can give them what
level I want them to have.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.720
I can have them administrate the server.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.120
I can have them administrate a domain.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.880
There is no domain set up
on this particular machine,

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.680
so that's not active.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.190
The ability to log in or not.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:36.700
So I'm already starting to
layer some management here.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.500
Depending on whether or not they
can administer the directory domain,

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.240
I can give them granularity for that.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.580
Again, I can't get to that particular
one because we're not

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.640
administering a domain here.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:55.580
Then we have--let me save that
so we have now a new user.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.740
We have a variety of different
options that we can set for that user.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.670
We can set their password policy.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.410
We can set what their shell is.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.980
We can assign them to groups.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.690
We'll get to that a little bit.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.060
We can also--again,
since this is freestanding,

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.740
there's another button which pops
up when it's not freestanding,

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.740
and that is a network button.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.530
So I can select--say they
have a network home directory,

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.650
but I'll go here under Advanced.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:26.570
And basically what
I can point to here is--

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.200
I point them to my server.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.340
This can be a server that's served
up over some other mechanism.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.810
It doesn't have to be served over AFP.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.980
I give them a path and their home.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:56.300
I can set what their--I could give them
five kilobytes worth of data storage.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.940
That probably wouldn't be real useful.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.040
I can set their storage in
this particular environment.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.800
So let's revert to that.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.470
I could say that they
don't have any home.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.570
Again,
that's a management choice right there.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.040
And all I'm doing is I'm
setting up a user account.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.450
So what I'm trying to get the
notion to you is you don't have

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:18.690
to have managed system preference
data to be a managed user.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.900
I can set up mail preferences,
print preferences,

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.520
preferences if they want
to have Windows access,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.710
those types of things.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:33.010
Then I get into--I can have groups.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:38.530
Create a new group--WWDC group.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:45.520
And for those of you who use
Workgroup Manager every day,

00:37:45.600 --> 00:38:02.200
[Transcript missing]

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:14.480
I can set that up here.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:14.480
I can designate a full
path in the advanced mode.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:14.480
I can add users to this.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.000
Add users to them.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.600
That's real easy.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.150
So adding and deleting users
in this particular environment

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:32.400
[Transcript missing]

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:57.100
[Transcript missing]

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.810
and i can do a bunch of things i can
i can set the access for these now so

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.960
this gets into an interesting kind of
scenario whereby i can have a user that

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.090
can authenticate as who they are they
really are who they are they've typed in

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:16.230
their username and password but i don't
allow them to use that that computer in

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:21.450
the back of the lab that i've saved for
my special ed guys they're not allowed

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:28.530
to use that computer or this servers
i got a bank of servers Only admin

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.450
users can log on to these servers.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:38.980
I don't want any Joe Blow to be able
to log in locally to these servers,

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.700
so I can set those kinds
of things up here too.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:46.410
Then you have a notion of a cache,
and this gets more into...

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:51.560
into our managed client
MCX data environment.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:58.990
And that is for the sake of speed and to
cut down on the network traffic and to

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:02.580
optimize for that as much as possible,
we keep a local cache of

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.340
the data that you set here.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.340
So when a particular user logs in,
we copy some of that data down,

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.680
the MCX data,
and some of that other data.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.540
When you're creating mobile accounts,
we actually create a copy

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.640
of the directory structure.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.200
So that they've got
the same set of groups,

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.220
the same user list, that kind of thing.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.920
And this is cache aging here.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:29.480
So what we've got here is,
I'm going to switch to guest computers,

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.040
and I'm going to switch over here to...

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:44.800
[Transcript missing]

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:54.190
to... Oh, I have it not authenticated.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.700
[Transcript missing]

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:30.420
I can say which applications.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.440
So what we have here is this
is the option that we have

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.540
which allows Unix tools to run.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.340
I can toggle that off and on.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:46.040
Basically, that allows any sort of
Unix tools to execute.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.430
Users can access applications
on local volumes.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.660
A lot of times what you want to
be able to do is you want to say,

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.480
well, I don't want them running the
network versions of these.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.780
I want them to run them locally
and allow applications to run

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.920
non-approved applications.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:05.680
And this is an ease of use or an
ease of facilitating the user's

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.680
ability to use the machine,
but it gives people the

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.710
ability to fairly easily,
depending on what

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.910
applications you give them,
launch any number of

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.570
non-approved applications.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.540
Then you can launch all
applications except these.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.850
So I can come in and I can say,
remove Activity Monitor,

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:33.240
remove Address Book--I want to be
able to do that--remove ARDAgent,

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.830
because I want to be able
to access the machine,

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:39.880
remove Classic, remove Color Sync,
don't remove Console.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.270
So I can go through and
I can remove applications,

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.500
move direct--nah,
I don't want them to access

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.000
directory access--the meter.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:50.280
And you can set--basically
you can set what applications

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.000
that they cannot access.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.310
So, that's revert.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.740
In the doc, we've added a couple
of things to the doc.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.290
In the doc, we've added the ability to
mount a documents folder.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:15.250
Shared folder, My Applications folder,
group volumes for groups--since

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.960
this is computers,
there are no group

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.460
volumes--and the network home.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:23.100
This gets to the mobile account
scenario that I was talking about.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:28.590
I want to be able to mount your network
home as a SharePoint on the desktop.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:35.640
You can also add documents and folders,
and these can be documents and/or volumes

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:41.300
that are individual separate volumes.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.110
And you can configure what
the doc is going to look like.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:54.700
[Transcript missing]

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.540
Let's not save that.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:04.170
EnergySaver was in and is in Jaguar.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.800
You have a variety of
different energy saver options.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.840
Finder--what's new in Finder?

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.390
When new in Finder,
the commands--we've separated out

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:16.020
the restart and shutdown commands,
again, at the request of some users

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.050
who wanted to be able to say,
"You can tell the machine to restart,

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:23.000
but you can't--because
something might happen,

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:28.550
you may want to restart the machine,
but you don't want it to shut down,

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.550
or vice versa.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.550
You can shut it down,
but you can't restart it."

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.090
We split out system preferences.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.660
In the past,
we had application access and

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.740
you had system preferences
was just a separate tab there.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.370
People wanted those separately
because they manage the ability

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:45.850
to access system preferences
differently than they do applications.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.420
Basically,
I don't want people here to set the

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.160
screen saver or change the sound volume,
those kinds of things.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.400
So we allow them to
manage system preferences.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.380
You can show none.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:00.190
And then I can go in and
pick printing and fax and

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.620
QuickTime only and I can apply that.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.360
So now the only things that are gonna
be shown for the guest computers are

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.100
QuickTime and print and fax because
that's the only thing I want them to do.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.160
Mobile accounts.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:16.090
Mobile accounts is...

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.440
Now,
I clicked here on always just because,

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.600
you know, for a bug standpoint,
but since I'm not going to,

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.220
but for the most part,
this would probably be best

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.760
done as a once preference.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.820
And what's the difference here?

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.400
Because we have preferences handled
in a couple of different ways.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.440
Once is like your initial setting.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.280
So if I come in and I want
my initial setting on my dock

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:43.640
items to be these things,
these five settings, I want, you know,

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.160
here's an intro to the school year,
or an intro to my business.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.200
I want that right in the dock,
and I want a whole bunch of other things.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:54.500
So I want, when the user comes in at the
beginning of some particular session,

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.690
or if I've just rolled
out a new IT solution,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.820
for example, well,
I want the help file for this

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.210
new process to be handled,
or it's time for them to

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.090
pick a new health plan.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.110
So I'm going to put down
in a set once setting,

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.030
I'm going to put down here's a
URL to the health plan in my dock.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.140
And that's once.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.040
And then they can change that,
and it won't ever show up again.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.590
But if I want something to go back and
every time they log in to be reset,

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:27.130
So, creating a mobile account,
I don't want to create this local

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.050
mobile account every time I log in.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:35.240
So, I probably want to do that for
the first time the user logs in,

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:39.980
they get this preference,
and I want to give them the option

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.810
to create an account locally that
maps to their network account.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:43.810
So, this is an example of one that
probably would be most useful.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.270
However,
you might want to do that always,

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:51.500
because the user might be deleting
their mobile account on a regular basis.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.880
It may actually just be being
used as temporary storage.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.340
So I may create a mobile
account on a PowerBook,

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:58.400
turn the computer in.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.060
At the end of the day,
I delete all the users on that computer.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.250
Next time that user logs in,
I want it to create another

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.150
account local to the machine.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.500
So there is uses for always.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:22.700
Universal Access is new.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:22.700
Basically, this tries to mirror the
universal access in the system.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.700
And then the other one we have here,
internet.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.460
Let's talk about internet for a second.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.680
So, and this brings up an interesting
point that I wanted to get to.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:36.170
So we do not manage everything in
the system from a system preference

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.250
standpoint from managed desktop.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.530
We don't manage everything.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:45.540
And we don't manage
everything in the same place.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.900
Why do we do that?

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.870
Well, if you look at Panther,
there is no internet

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.290
system preference anymore.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:57.700
In the Internet System Preference,
there was what is now in

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.300
the .Mac System Preference.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:05.330
Well, in Jaguar,
in the System Preferences,

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:08.350
we had email and we had web.

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.060
So, what we did

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:14.490
So with email and web,
those things aren't

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.040
managed in Panther anymore.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.410
They're managed in an application level.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.650
But for our Jaguar clients,
they're still managed.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.650
So that's why these are here.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.650
And we also believe that they're
good to be managed anyway.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.650
But we don't manage the iDisk ones.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.650
So because we're running
out of time here,

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.650
I want to show you something
which I think is really cool,

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.650
and that is the inspector.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.390
So we have the inspector.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.390
And ostensibly,
I'll come over here to Users,

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.390
I'll pick WWDC,
and I'll click on the inspector.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.390
And I've got WWDC.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:22.100
Here I have everything that's associated
with the standard password server.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.590
Notice I have no data
for MCX data at all.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.500
Click on Computer Lists
and click on Inspector.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.290
Here you'll see--whoops,
hold on a second, it counts.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.640
I don't see any MCX data.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.200
I thought I saved that.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.700
Didn't do it under Users.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:56.960
Let me go in here and create some.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:05.760
Users can use all
applications except these.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:13.700
You'll have to excuse me.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:19.170
The demo that I had set up here on
this particular hard drive would

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:23.850
not boot on this particular machine,
so we're running without a server setting

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.710
behind me with all of this configured.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:48.760
and there we have our MCX data.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:48.810
Why am I showing you this?

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:48.810
Well,
I'm showing you this for one reason.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:48.810
Can we switch back to the slides?

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:48.810
Because I'm going to--.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:13.200
[Transcript missing]

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.930
We've got both from user
accounts to file access to

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:20.600
application settings--excuse me,
to system-level settings.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.310
We're going to be showing
you application-level

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:23.400
settings here in a minute.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.240
It's been shipping since Jaguar.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.400
Workgroup Manager has been
part of the Jaguar 10 server.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.400
It can be running on a Jaguar machine.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.400
People are just beginning--the IT folks
are just beginning to deploy this.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.400
They've been evaluating it,
and they're now rolling out solutions.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.040
We're getting the feedback from you all.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.580
We're getting the feedback that we
did with the deny list that we're

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:48.150
adding to Panther and those kinds of
things--the gutches that you've run into.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:53.480
Preference Storage:
We want you to do a couple of

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:58.760
things for preference storage,
and that is, wherever possible,

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.700
we want you to cache files locally,
where possible.

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:04.740
And this is a little
bit schizophrenic here,

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.260
because I also want you to associate
these things with user records,

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.500
because more than one user
can be accessing the machine,

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.900
and I don't want you to have
global data floating around.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.480
But I want you to try and prevent,
wherever possible,

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:16.900
prevent network bottlenecks.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.630
And basically,
what that does is--I mentioned

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:23.780
you try and optimize your
I/O as much as possible,

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.850
so that you're not doing a
lot of small reads and writes,

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:28.900
because a ton of small reads and writes
spread across a whole bunch of folks,

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.850
all funneled through, you know,
one switch,

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.860
or all funneled into one Ethernet
port out the back of one server,

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:40.900
can really slow our users down.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.490
Multiple user environments are a factor
that you have to pay attention to.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.110
So as I mentioned before,
by paying attention to one of the things

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:59.070
that we did was we added your deny
lists for users to restrict user access.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.410
And hopefully that will prevent the
errors from happening and potentially the

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:08.020
hangs from happening when not all of the
utilities that you use to provide your

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.020
solutions are available for the users.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:16.640
Users are accessing their
home directories over airport.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.240
Is this the optimum solution,
and was this the design implementation

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.590
that we thought about when we were
doing home directory implementations?

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.070
This is what the users are doing?

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:26.990
Yes.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:32.900
So you need to take that in mind when
you're developing your solutions or

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.550
you're providing your applications,
is that they're doing I/O to

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.200
their network home directory.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:43.290
It may not be disk I/O speeds.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.800
And users want their application
preferences to be manageable as well.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.440
So what I'm going to be showing you here

00:53:53.570 --> 00:54:03.830
What we have here is a list
of the--we're going to switch

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:03.830
back to this demo machine.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.860
MCX data that's stored.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.650
And as you notice here,
this is the inspector editor.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.740
Here you have the XML.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.380
And we've got application access.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.580
That's the key.

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.820
Things are forced.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.220
We have where we set it.

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.240
Application access preferences.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.480
So what I'm going to be doing here is,
let me cancel out of this.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.580
Go back here to this application access.

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.780
Click on him.

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.560
Click on preferences.

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:37.480
And I'm going to set an
internet preference web always.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:47.920
I want my home page to be w.ample.com.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:54.120
And default web browser to be Safari.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:08.800
[Transcript missing]

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.100
That's good.

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.190
Now I've set my default web page here.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.100
Safari actually is one of
the applications which uses

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.100
this internet settings.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:19.330
And so now people will
go to www.apple.com.

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:23.280
Well, that's all well and good,
but I want more.

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:28.000
So what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to go under my applications,

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.730
and I'm going to open up Safari.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.190
This should be interesting
to the IFT folks.

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:39.700
It may not be interesting at all to
you application developers out here,

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:43.440
with the possible exception of,
if you do this with your preferences,

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.200
your customers are going to be
able to do this with our product.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.110
So we're going to look
here at preferences.

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.200
Oh, look!

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.410
I have a home page here too.

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.790
Well, let me do http://

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:14.400
[Transcript missing]

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:26.590
and that looks good.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:26.590
Bookmarks, that looks good too.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:26.590
I want them to enable tab browsing.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:26.590
New tabs, I'll set that.

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:33.850
Autofill, security,
I want to block pop-up windows.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.260
Yeah, I'm sure I want to save that.

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:42.020
So I've just set up the preferences
for this application by myself.

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:49.060
So now I'm going to quit this application
and I'm going to go under my home.

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:58.410
And I'm going to open this up with

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:08.080
I didn't want to open it
with the plist editor.

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:09.940
I didn't want to open it
with the plist editor.

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.080
Let me quit plist editor.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:40.100
[Transcript missing]

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:51.800
I'm going to copy this,
paste it into a new file,

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.980
save that file as--

00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:11.400
[Transcript missing]

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.980
Now we're going to edit
these preferences here.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:26.010
So what I've got here is
I've got application keys.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:43.500
and his team have a lot
of application keys.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:43.500
And here we have apple.internet.com.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:43.500
So I am going to

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:53.000
[Transcript missing]

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:10.380
and I are going to paste that in there.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:10.380
And now I've just pasted in

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.890
If I was able to connect
up to the other server,

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:17.400
basically what I've done is I have
now added Safari preferences

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.940
to this particular user's

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:24.470
So,
when they log in and they launch Safari,

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.840
they're going to get
those same preferences.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.460
I could do that to a group of users.

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:30.200
I could do that to a computer list.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.640
Any preferences I can set
in an application that are

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.900
stored in CFPreferences,
using the inspector

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.450
with Workgroup Manager,
you can copy and paste those

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:39.150
preferences into their MCX data.

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:42.100
When that user or group logs in,
that data will get composited

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.100
and put in their plist file for
Safari in their home directory,

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.800
and they will get those preferences, too.

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:52.910
So, we're giving you a lot of
very powerful tools with

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.800
Workgroup Manager going forward.

00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.750
And we don't do any sanity checking here.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.390
If I had pasted this
in in the wrong place,

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.860
offset that dictionary by one,
those preferences might

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.730
not have launched.

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:13.090
So, it would have behooved me to make
a copy of those preferences first,

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.640
save those out,
so I would have been able to restore,

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.670
should it not work.

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:26.420
But this allows you to go into any
application that stores the bulk of

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.550
its preferences in the same folder.

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:28.550
And you can do that with
any of your applications.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.840
In CFPreferences,
and to be able to edit those

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.800
preferences with a text editor or
with any editor of your choice.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.220
Back to the slides.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.640
So what are development guidelines?

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.400
These are the things we
want you to think about.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.400
Your product will be used
in a managed environment.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
So test with our product.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.970
You should have been given a
CD with the server software on it.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.340
So install the server software.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.630
Run this software locally.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.410
You can run this stuff locally.

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.500
You can sit it on a machine
and run all these preferences

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.140
locally for local users.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.740
Or you set up a server so you're
actually doing traffic over the network.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.100
And if you run into problems,
you can debug them in

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.400
a network environment.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.910
and run capabilities.

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:22.440
Run capabilities.

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:35.140
The capabilities defaults
might be different.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.140
Assume that your applications will
be controlled in some fashion.

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:41.940
If you have helper applications,
please call those out in

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.840
your documentation if they're
really full-blown applications.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.660
So let's say I have a chart application
that puts up a pretty graph based

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:53.660
on the data in my application,
and that's a real

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.860
application that I write.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:00.340
It's a bundled Cocoa app, for example.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.870
Put that in the documentation so
if a user is doing an allow list,

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:06.600
they can pick all the
applications that are usable.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.140
Minimize wherever possible
the use of the unbundled.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:24.840
If you have some utility or scripts that
you execute as part of your solution,

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.980
those won't be runnable.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.790
We will say that the
administrator is the king.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.740
If the administrator sets
something up in a particular way,

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.900
we will try and enforce that.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.340
If it says don't give access to
this particular application or these

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.650
particular sets of applications,
we won't.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:47.320
And assume that your product
will be used on the network.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.460
So try and optimize your
I/O wherever possible.

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:55.050
Don't assume that the configuration
that you test with in your

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:59.800
office will be the configuration
that the user has in theirs.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.800
So try not to hard-code file path names.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.700
Use CFPreferences.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.610
Again, you just noticed how easy it was
for me to cut and paste those system

01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:14.510
preferences out from Safari to
MCX and put it into the MCX data.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.690
It's the same data.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.630
"Rolling your own preference management
might not work well in the future.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.700
There are no guarantees.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:25.040
But if you see a
preference going forward,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.190
we'll still be able to manage that."

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:33.900
So just to close up and to wrap this up,
Mac OS X is a managed environment.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.640
You guys are IT guys,
you already know that.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.700
Application developers,
I want to thank you very much.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.290
When I was sitting putting together
this particular presentation last year,

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:48.240
I showed three
applications that were bad.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.070
And I showed how their behavior was bad.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.680
And there were some Apple applications,
too.

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.810
And, you know,
I really thought that there--it

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.490
would still be really easy
to find bad applications.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:03.000
And I went and checked a lot
of your applications out there,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.250
and you guys listened.

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.030
Thank you very much.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.240
You're not doing a lot of the
things which preclude you from

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.040
running in this environment.

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.470
And keep up the good work.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:17.270
I didn't show any bad applications
out there because I didn't find any.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:22.540
And what I found was things like Safari,
things like, you know,

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:27.190
other applications that are
storing their preferences and

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:31.250
CF preferences--not all of you are,
but a good portion of you are--and

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:36.270
in dictionary formats that are easily
transferable for our IT users out there.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.280
Not all of them are,
but a good majority of them are.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.420
So thank you very much.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.270
And talk to me about what your
customers are seeing and what

01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:47.330
your customers are needing.

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:49.700
So who to contact?

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.840
Myself, Michael Lopp,
who gave the overview of

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.510
this particular stuff.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:59.810
Skip Levens,
your technologies evangelist.

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:03.790
and the session we had--they
had the session yesterday,

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:07.450
so I don't know that we
have any follow-on sessions.
