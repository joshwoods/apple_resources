WEBVTT

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.080
Let's get the whole view here, right?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.860
I got this shirt in Hawaii.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.460
I just came back from the Geek Cruise.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.240
Did anybody hear about the Geek Cruise?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.300
It's the weirdest thing.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.140
You know, you get a bunch of Mac heads
on a boat with normal people,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.300
and you cruise around places.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.910
So I did the Geek
Cruise to Alaska last year,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.620
and this year was Hawaii.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.670
And it was interesting because
in order to save money,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.540
you know,
conferences are working together.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.540
So we had a combined conference.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.480
It was actually Macmania, which was the,
you know, Mac geek part of it,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.650
Pearl World for Pearl guys,
and Star Trek.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.560
And you know,
so you go into the main dining

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.140
room and you're sitting there,
they assign you seats,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.510
and the conversation was
unbelievably strange.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.550
And this year I had Pearl going
in like this while I was getting

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.390
Vulcan stuff going that way,
and somewhere in the middle

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.460
they met and made sense.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.610
I don't know how it worked.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.000
Thank you for spending time
today and coming in for the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.670
AppleScript and QuickTime session.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.130
You're going to get an overview of what's
available for you to use right now,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.940
what kind of QuickTime tools
are out there,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.200
and some ideas about how to use them to
automate some of the processes that you

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.920
do with QuickTime content every day.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.040
Just a quick question so I can get
a sense of whom I am talking to.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.600
How many of you in here
are scripting already?

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.490
Yes!

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.010
See,
your work has been validated right here.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.110
And I assume that most of you are
also doing QuickTime content as well.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.950
Okay, so there's some scripters in
here I see by the disparity and

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.080
difference there that are scripters
that want to start incorporating

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.710
QuickTime into their lifestyles.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.370
Is this true?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.100
Okay, right there,
there's one right there.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.540
He just got a cable modem,
he wants to live the QuickTime life.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.890
Okay.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.730
I do too, all the time, I think.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.010
The story of AppleScript and
QuickTime is one of the real unsung

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.700
success stories at Apple Computer.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.080
And through the very diligent
hard work of Gary Flynn,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.490
Tom Becker, Rhonda, Frank,
and everybody involved in this,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.140
it's been an ongoing process.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.000
It's just bloomed and
bloomed and bloomed.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.490
And it basically came down to the same
idea that affects every business is,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.480
how do I get consistency?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.230
How do I get accuracy?

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.660
How do I get speed?

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.900
How can I scale what I do and make
more money and stay competitive?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.290
And the answer in any business,
whether it's in multimedia or

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.380
whether it's print or whatever
kind of business it is,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.370
it's automation is the answer.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.000
So with that in mind,
the QuickTime team and the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.900
AppleScript team focused
on delivering quality.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.070
And the core functionality that
allows you to automate a lot

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.940
of the repetitive things that
you do with QuickTime content,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.690
such as applying annotations
to 400 movies that are going

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.580
to go up on the website.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.050
Done by hand, that's very tedious.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.260
Done with a script, it's go get a donut.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.180
So the whole idea is to incorporate this
automation with the world of QuickTime.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.540
And so what I'm going to do,
first of all, can I have laptop one,

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.320
please?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.730
That was all the slides
you're going to get out of me,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.130
by the way.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.090
I don't slide.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.460
I like to show you what it
is instead of talk about it.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.840
It's like dancing about
architecture or something.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.590
So what we're going to look at
first is what's available to us,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.880
what kind of resources are there,
what kind of things has Apple done,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.760
where is it on my operating system,
what does it look like?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.210
And then we're going to go from
there into three core new features

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.110
added in the most recent version
of QuickTime just for AppleScript.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.860
Just for AppleScript.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.820
You're very special.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.720
There are three extremely
powerful features that can

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.620
only be done with AppleScript.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.180
And they're in the new version.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.190
We're going to look at those.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.900
And I'm going to have a guest come up
and show some of the automations based

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.950
upon some of that technology that we
use in-house and with some customers.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.550
And then at the end, we're going to look
at AppleScript Studio,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.920
which is part of the Xcode package.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.010
And what that allows you
to do is create a native

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.420
Mac OS X application using AppleScript,
Objective-C, Java, C,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.480
or any combination thereof.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.850
But what we're going to particularly pay
attention to with AppleScript Studio is

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.990
the ability to talk directly to the
QuickTime APIs from AppleScript.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.340
So all the commands that you
wanted but you couldn't get to,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.400
you can now make yourself.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.430
And I'll show you an example project that
you can download today and start using.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.840
So let's begin.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.710
My first slide is going to take you
to the venerable QuickTime website.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.130
We all know how to get there.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.590
QuickTime.com is the shortcut
that the people in the know use.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.760
You can do the same for
AppleScript as well.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.960
It's AppleScript.com.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.060
And down the right-hand side,
you'll see a thing that says

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.800
QuickTime products over here.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.190
And under QuickTime Pro,
there's a nice page that gives

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.180
you all the reasons why you
want to get QuickTime Pro.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.710
And trust me, if you don't have it,
you do want to buy it because it

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.560
turns on a lot of functionality that
you really want to take advantage of.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:10:37.400
[Transcript missing]

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.990
It's infectious, isn't it?

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:39.770
It really is.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.840
This script menu is installed
in the AppleScript folder,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.690
which is in the applications folder.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.640
You just double-click the
thing that says script menu,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.950
and it installs up into
the menu bar for you,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.180
and you can't see the
glorious-looking icon that we have.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.690
But by default, it has dozens and dozens,
about 30 or 40 scripts

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.520
pre-installed for you.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.710
And when you download
this script collection,

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.550
you can get the QuickTime broadcaster
scripts and the QuickTime player scripts.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.120
And these 100 scripts right
here are these scripts in

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.300
this particular collection.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.160
It's really easy to install.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.180
You simply go to open the scripts folder,
which is in your home library folder.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.360
You drag your folder of QuickTime player
scripts into that folder,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.840
and they show up in the menu.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840
It really is that easy.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.100
And then anytime you
need to run a script,

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.900
you can access it from there.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.440
We have some nice scripts that
really help save some time.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.550
For example, one that was that this was
one of Rhonda's big ones.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.580
She came to me about this one and said,
Sal, we have to automate this.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.420
And it's chapter creation.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.950
Instead of creating text files with
certain codings and importing it,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.740
this is really interactive.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.170
You literally just put the movie
where you want to go and say,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.020
make a chapter here, and it will do that.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.370
We'll be demonstrating it.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.750
So all of these scripts.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.190
Deal with the various
things about chapters,

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.750
editing them, renaming them,
deleting them.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.490
We have a section of scripts
that just deal with the nuts and

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.200
bolts of editing movie files.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.420
For example, if you want to cut from the
current selection to a new movie,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.870
instead of going through a
bunch of steps on your own,

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.150
there's a quick script to do it.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.680
Cut from the beginning,
copy a selection to a new movie,

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.910
edit a frame in graphic converter.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:19.800
That's a nice one.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.160
Merge the front movie into the
second movie automatically for you.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.910
Scale the front movie to
a specific percentage.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.610
Little tools like that that you'd
use throughout the day that each

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.800
one saves you a couple seconds
or saves you a half a minute.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.010
And by the end of the day,
you're able to stay more focused

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.290
on the task that you're doing than
the how am I going to do this.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.600
There's a section of
scripts for exporting.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.090
And there's a special one right
here that we'll be talking about.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.180
Save export settings.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.530
That's a new feature.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.720
There's a section of scripts
that deal with favorites.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.320
And actually, an HTML embed tag wizard.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.540
If you've ever been daunted
by the task of writing to

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.440
HTML for a QuickTime embed tag,
this actually walks you through it.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.450
It looks at the front movie and analyzes
it and asks you a couple questions

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.290
about what you want to do with it and
then writes the embed tag for you.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.290
We'll either put it into a file
or copy it to the clipboard.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.260
There's a section on info scripts,
and these give you more information

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.040
for the front movie quickly.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.340
Here's a nice one.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.100
How to get to source URLs.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.190
You are also the front movie
if you're interested in

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.600
where a stream's coming from.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.850
Some miscellaneous ones.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.390
Here's a very useful one
that we'll be demonstrating.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.990
It's creating a thumbnail link movie
to place into a web page so that

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.880
it's a miniature of your movie.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.340
And when they click it,
it actually launches your

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.790
movie in the QuickTime player.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.870
That usually takes a lot
of steps to create that and

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.210
then embed it in your page.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.790
And there's a script that
does it very easily for you.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.330
There's some other navigation scripts,
some play scripts,

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.640
some previewing scripts,
some property scripts.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.750
And these are setting the
specific playback properties

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.060
like auto quit when done,
auto close when done, auto play,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.320
playback properties in general,
href of the front movie.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.560
There's a couple scripts
dealing with SMIL,

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.900
S-M-I-L.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.350
If you want to be able to write
XML but never got around to it,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.840
these scripts will write it for you.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.120
And then there's a series
of scripts dealing with text

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.600
tracks and tracks in general.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.720
Just about every property that
you want to deal with the track,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.040
you can deal with these scripts.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.760
And finally,
an interesting script for setting

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.080
the position of the movie in the
window because movies remember that.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.230
And if you wanted exactly 72 pixels
by 90 pixels down from the left,

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.120
you can do this if you're
anal retentive like me.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.020
So there's a page that you're going
to go to and you can download that

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.710
script collection that I'm going
to be demonstrating now from that

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.470
site and start using these today
to start saving yourself some time.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.850
Any question about that at all?

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.500
No?

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.470
Pretty straight ahead.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.320
Pretty straight ahead, isn't it?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.200
Okay.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.270
And this is the QuickTime scripts
collection as it looks

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.440
like when you download it.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.280
The readme file again is the same.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.260
Open Safari, I hope.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.680
Nice, okay,
let's just drag it up over here.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.620
The README file is the same
file that you just saw.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.440
So all that explanation you
don't have to write it down

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.620
or copy it from the website.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.050
It's right there for you,
a detailed description of each one of

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.820
the scripts that we'll be dealing with.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.920
There's installation
instructions that tell you,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.920
you know,
where you're going to put the files,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.560
what you're going to do with them,
what kind of requirements

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.480
you have for the scripts.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.510
And then there's the collection
of scripts themselves.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.630
The applets, droplets,
there's some example files to

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.240
help you try out these scripts.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.430
There are some script templates that
you're going to use today and that I'll

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.360
be demonstrating that make actually
writing the scripts a very easy process

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.120
because they're pre-done for you.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.080
You literally just open
up these templates,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.020
put in the couple lines of
code that you want and save it.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.810
And all of the error handling and
repeat routines and everything

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.410
else has already been done for you.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.880
I know I'm bowling you
over with all this stuff,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.300
right?

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.290
There is the collection of
QuickTime player scripts,

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.220
which are the ones that I have
installed in the menu up here.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.190
That's the collection right here,
the QuickTime player scripts.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.900
And there's some various images
involved in this as well.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.440
And I have this new thing called
export settings that we'll be

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.960
looking at in just a little while.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.970
So let's begin by looking at some
of the applets and droplets that are

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.360
available and how they work and how
you can use some of these yourself.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.990
Yes?

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.760
You can get those from
the AppleScript website.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.340
They're on the page about Bluetooth and
the clicker controlling the broadcaster.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.400
Yes, and you can just download
them and copy them from there.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.340
I just got them and put
them in a little collection.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.000
Any other questions
before I roll on here?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.920
I'm sorry?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.110
I'm sorry?

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:07.700
Okay.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.400
Okay, very good.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.440
So, if it's a burning desire,
wherever I got that from.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:13.950
No?

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:14.660
Okay.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.780
Then we'll,
as Rhonda pointed out so nicely to me,

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.170
we'll save the questions for the end
unless it's something really important.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.910
And then you can come up to the mic
and say it so that we can get the

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.160
translators to translate it so that
everybody else in the world out there

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.080
at large gets to enjoy this as well.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.760
Here's our applets collection
and there's the add to favorites,

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.800
annotations drop, all annotations,
annotations and credits droplet,

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.240
clear all annotations.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.550
For example, and all of these droplets,
the ones with the blue arrow,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.940
are designed to be double clicked
and you get a preference dialogue.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.070
All of them have some kind of a
dialogue that tells you what the

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.110
script does and then usually has a
set of preferences involved with it.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.290
For example, if I click this, it says,
do you want to retain the

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.740
existing full name of the movie?

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.370
When you set these
settings and I say yes,

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:06.320
and then you can enter a
value for the album artist.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.380
I'll just click enter key.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:13.220
So you can set any of these
properties and it will get stored

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.290
in the script and be part of
the settings when they get set.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.560
So you can copy the script,
keep a couple copies, rename it,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.290
call one, you know, internal use,
call one website, call one, you know,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.380
CD use.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.340
And then based upon that,
you can go ahead and save it.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:28.380
Okay.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:28.460
Okay.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:28.510
So, I'm going to go ahead and save it.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:28.580
Okay.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:28.620
Okay.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:28.720
Okay.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.380
what you're going to do with your movie,
you just drag it on there

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.290
and it sets the annotations.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.820
Here's one called
annotations and credits.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.470
This actually will make a rolling
credits based upon your annotations

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.320
but I'm going to start with the
limited annotations droplet.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.100
Now this particular droplet applies
a small subset of your annotations.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.640
It doesn't go through all
40 that are available.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.760
Just the ones that you have put
into the property and to the comment

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.160
window of that particular script.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.640
So I just got the information for that
droplet and you'll see down in the

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.470
comments field it says product colon.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.840
Product is the name of the annotation,
colon divides it from whatever

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.520
value you're going to have.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.020
So I have three annotations,
your video product, authors,

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.480
ordinary user, performers, there's me,
myself and I.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:23.080
So to set the annotations to a movie,
I just drag that movie onto the droplet.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.500
It opens up the movie, applies the stuff,
and closes it.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.000
It's that fast.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.820
So now let's go back and
open up that movie again.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.400
And then when I get the
information for that movie,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.590
you can see up here that it applied
the annotations for you automatically.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.410
Now,
that's not so impressive with one movie,

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.110
but it's very impressive with 300.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:46.830
Small.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.600
We're starting small.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.450
We're building here.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:48.880
Okay.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.060
We're going to take that same
movie now that has that applied,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.740
the annotations applied to it.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.750
I'm going to drag it onto the annotations
and credits droplet and let that go.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:06.130
And it's going to want to know
a destination for the new movie

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:07.640
that it's going to make from this.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.500
And I'm going to just put
this as a destination.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:12.500
Destination.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.660
Create and choose that.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.660
So it'll open up the movie and
then extract all the annotations,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.180
create a credits that goes
in front of the movie,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.560
then save it off.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.720
Now,
this is useful for if you're reviewing

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.560
content and you can't keep track
of every movie that you're seeing.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.200
You need something that brings up
the annotations information first.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.880
So we'll go back to
this destination folder,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.420
open up the movie, and then run it.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.780
And you'll see that it brings
up the annotations information

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.880
before it plays the movie.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:59.800
[Transcript missing]

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.020
Plight Golf Clap, I like that.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.070
Very societal.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.470
Oh, these guys are great.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.720
Tarantino has nothing on them.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.000
And then it plays-- ah, of course,
copyright.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:26.800
[Transcript missing]

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.740
So there's an example of a
script that builds upon something

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.930
else that another script did.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.260
But that way you can now take
that movie and give it to somebody

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.940
else who's not familiar with your
organization and your material,

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.040
and they instantly have all the
information in front of the movie,

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.040
and it took me all of how
many seconds to do it.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:49.020
Little things like this make a
big difference during the day.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.640
And let's continue to look for
some of our other examples here.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.720
Display a folder as a slideshow.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.530
This is useful.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.800
I'll open the QuickTime scripts here,
go to my examples files.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.400
And I'm going to choose
a slideshow images.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.600
So this has a couple images in it.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.560
And what I'll do is I'll just
drag that onto the script.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:24.800
And now I have an instant slideshow just
so I can preview and see what's going on.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.450
I don't have to actually import
them into iPhoto to be able to

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.730
quickly browse through a folder
of images to see what I want.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.070
That ability is already
built into QuickTime.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.440
Now if I want to save this at this point,
I can, or I can just delete it

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.000
and don't save it at all.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.970
But that's a quick way to do
an entire folder as a set.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.450
You can also,
there's another pair to that one

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:52.620
where you can save the entire
folder as a slideshow as well,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.840
and that's called create
slideshow from folder here.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.030
And that will go through the process
of actually building it and saving it.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.870
So you can automate 40 or 50 slideshows
if you want to do it that way.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.620
There's the limited annotations
droplet that we just saw where it

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.450
does a small amount of annotations.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.860
And then there's the playback scripts.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.940
For example, let me see.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.210
Let me open up another.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.060
Switch.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.520
I hope you like switch ads because I'm
going to use those as my material today.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.280
Is that okay?

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.580
All right with that?

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.150
Switch.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.590
All right.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.200
I'm going to double-click the script
because all of our scripts can be set.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.280
There are preferences that can be stored.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.080
So the presentation is normal
size continuation dialogue.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.770
Now, what is a continuation dialogue?

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:42.190
Well, I made the script for automating
the playback of movies and

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.280
I forgot to give it a way to stop.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.680
So what happens was guys internally at
Apple were using these shows and they go,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.280
"Oh, okay.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.370
I got to stop." And they'd stop the
one movie but the script would keep

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.820
going and load the next one and it
became Fantasia with the water wizard

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.240
and everything happening all at once.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.700
So what this does is it brings up a
quick dialogue for a couple seconds,

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.510
self-closes, that says,
"Do you want to go continue?"

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.720
And that's an option you could say,
"I want to display the movie

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.000
at a normal size and bring me
a continuation dialogue." Okay.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.600
So let me just grab a couple of slides.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.400
I'll grab a couple of these
and I'll try to do different

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.980
ones each time we do them,
okay?

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:24.260
I'll grab this one and this one and
I'll drag it onto the play movie script.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.310
Now,
these you can keep in your dock as well.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.860
Just have them there all the time.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.140
Get your iPod.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.800
iPod's here.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.240
I sell iPods at Dodger games.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.880
Two, and then you gotta pass them down
kind of the way they sell hot dogs.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.220
I've got about 1,500
in the trunk of my car.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.540
I'm usually shirtless, just for effect.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.810
The money just starts flowing in.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.520
You can listen to all these songs.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.760
I say at least over 50 songs.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.520
I'm not quite sure of the amount.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.000
I think it's like two million songs.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.760
My name is Will Ferrell,
and I'm a porn actor.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.640
So it closes it,
brings up the continuation dialogue.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.220
Christmas songs that drive Santa crazy
are I Saw Mama-- So I'm gonna just

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.240
save that one for a little bit later,
okay?

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.180
And then the script senses that
there's no more movies open,

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.620
and it will close itself.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.120
So if you have a series of movies, again,
that you wanna be able to just present,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.480
how do you do it?

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.320
What do you do?

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.210
You line 'em all up in the movie player,
and then click, you know, click, click,

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.780
click, and play all movies,
and then they all start

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.030
going . I'm Will Ferrell.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.250
No, I'm Will Ferrell.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.560
So this is just a little
organized way to do that.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.760
Now, as long as we're getting into
being able to play movies,

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:44.100
movies have specific invisible
properties that make them very appealing.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.780
And some of these properties
are such things as setting a

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.040
movie to automatically close,
or automatically quit,

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.820
or automatically play.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.960
Now, we know from the QuickTime player
interface that you can set that flag in

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.770
the properties to do an automatic play,
but there's no place in the

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.320
interface to set an auto close.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.320
So I'll take Will.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.380
I'm gonna drag him onto auto close.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.320
And now Will's ready to go.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.570
And so while I'm at it,
I'm going to drag Will onto autoplay.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.300
And now, Playwell.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.820
Christmas songs that
drive Santa crazy are:

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.600
"I Saw Mama Kissing Santa Underneath
the Christmas Tree," "The Jingle

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.610
Bell Rock," "White Christmas,"
"Forget It," "Enough," "I've Heard

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:40.400
That Over a Billion Times," "Yes,
Santa Has an iPod and Playlists,"

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.280
"980 Christmas Songs,"

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.340
And then 20 Doobie Brothers.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.920
And one Sheryl Crow.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.780
My name is S.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.400
Claus.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.940
I live in the North Pole with
elves and reindeer.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.680
So, did you notice the
movie closed on its own?

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.360
Nice way to present.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.690
So that stays with the movie file.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.460
As a matter of fact,
if you use that movie linked from another

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.450
movie or from a link in the website,
this kind of thing happens.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.300
He's got all this stuff like
prepared in a little example.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.540
Finds in where, where, Sally, Wally.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.480
Okay.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.500
Help Center.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:26.000
I'm going to find my copy of Safari.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.420
So this is a QuickTime movie.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:37.920
It's a one-frame movie that has a href
applied to it using the href droplet.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.800
And the href is interesting.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.530
It is a open bracket, self-present.move,
close bracket.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.530
The self-present.move is the name of
the movie that this is targeted to.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.290
The movie is naturally
set to self-present,

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:53.940
right?

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.160
The T means target.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.360
Then the next bracket is
QuickTime player and bracket.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.340
And if you use this as your URL,
what's that saying is open up

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.250
this particular movie that's in
the same folder as this file and

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.940
play it in the QuickTime player.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.380
So a simple click on
this opens up the movie.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.160
you

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.800
And then closes it.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.140
Nice way to present a
movie from a web page,

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:23.530
isn't it?

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.240
Or from a help page.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.230
The user doesn't have to know anything
about controls or about how to

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.080
manipulate the player or anything else.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.890
All they have to do is just click.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.230
Click.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.480
Okay, click.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.930
Reload.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.080
Click.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.980
Oh, the QuickTime player.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.050
That's because I have Panther installed
on the other stupid partition.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.700
It's been bugging me all week.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.530
OK.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.840
Hold on.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.460
So click.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.190
So this movie's set to
auto-quit as well as auto-close,

00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.750
right?

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.000
So I'll relaunch the
player here to get it back.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:08.150
So there's an example of how you can take
that playback property and incorporate

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:13.520
it and change the way that you're
displaying the content on a website.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.440
Okay, we're going to continue on.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.320
There is the auto-quit property,
auto-play, and then there are some

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.820
droplets for batch setting them.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.480
So if you want to set the playback
properties back to where they were,

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.420
you just drag it on top of this,
and it gets rid of all those

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.250
playback properties and returns the
movie back to its pristine state.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.160
If you want to do them all together,
then you can double-click this

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.790
particular droplet and determine,
you know, what time you want to

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.530
have it for display,
and then drag it onto that to set.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.320
So that's a couple of the,
of those playback properties.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.780
Another example where
AppleScript can really help you

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.020
save some time is in media skins.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.600
How many people are using media skins?

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.590
How do you go about doing media skins?

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.400
It's a multi-step process, isn't it?

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.220
It's a quite involved process.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.510
You have to have all
your materials together.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.330
It's like watching the
Saturday morning cooking shows.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.550
They make it look so easy
because somebody else has

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.380
already cut up the carrots,
and they have the little thing here,

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.410
and they just make
their happy little mess.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.990
And then they don't even have to cook it.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.920
They just look at something
that's already cooked,

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.880
and they go, blah.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.840
What a bunch of cooks.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.350
I don't think any of
them can actually cook.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.720
So here's an example of how
AppleScript can automate some of

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.760
the process and take some of the
sting out of making media skins.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.580
So you can really take advantage
of this incredible technology

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.070
that's unique to QuickTime.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.430
Here I have some of the elements
that are incorporated in the

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.520
process of making a media skin.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.880
There's the media skin itself,
there's the mask that indicates the

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.510
area that's going to be cut away,
and there's the drag mask which is

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:04.340
going to indicate which part of the
QuickTime skin is going to actually show.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.780
My source movie is this
little movie here of a plane.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.140
So I want the plane to
fly through this queue.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.980
Now,
instead of going through the multi-step

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:22.310
process of having to do that by hand,
I'm just going to take the plane

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.590
and drop it onto this script.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.970
And it says, where do you want me to
put this particular movie?

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.390
When I get done with it,
I'm going to say choose right there.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.000
And I left these little dialogues in.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.550
You can turn them off.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:47.260
But I left them in so you can
see the steps that it's doing.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.600
It's going to add the media
skin to the background,

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.000
move it to the back,
activate transparent areas.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Okay, that's a bug on my
computer and nobody else's.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.390
That area that's white
should actually be white.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:06.600
It's going to write the XML data to disk,
open the new movie,

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:13.070
and then apply the playback settings,
save the finished movie, close it.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.260
Delete temporary items, movie processed.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.400
So you can turn off those if you want
to batch process this kind of thing.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.370
You don't have to have
those dialogues running.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.510
And here is the resulting movie.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.500
On my computer,
I have a bug in my computer that makes

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.940
it so that you can't see through.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.580
So I'm going to go in here by hand
and go properties of this movie.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.360
And I'll show you what it looks like,
actually.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.460
And we're going to choose
media skin background,

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.440
graphics mode, transparent,
and set the color for white,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.080
I believe it is.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.790
That's black.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.880
This way, Sal.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.960
That's only on my computer.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.600
It's not on yours.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.900
This will actually work on your computer.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.180
Save it.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:03.890
Close it.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.180
And now launch it.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.400
So that's a multi-step process.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:12.810
Thank you.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:20.540
It's a multi-stage process involving
a lot of work that's now automated

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.490
down to just a single drag and drop.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.600
And now we've added in some playback
properties to make it even cooler.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.950
And that's, again,
part of this whole collection

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.940
of applets and droplets that are
available for you from the website.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.110
There's other ones such
as set controller type,

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:42.190
set window position, save as uneditable,
save in various formats like copy,

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:46.440
make a copy as hinted,
export it to a DV stream if you want to.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.700
So all the export kind of ideas
are available to you as well.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.020
I'll show you one more,
which is the set href property.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:34:01.660
And I'm going to set the
preference for the target URL to be

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.790
http://www.apple.com/.applescript.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:10.680
And that's going to be the preference
for this so that when I drag

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.790
on any movie onto that script.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.370
And let's do this one.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.480
Yeah, right, I'm going to love expose,
right.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.790
OK,
so it just set the href of this movie.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:45.600
[Transcript missing]

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.710
So that's how you set
the href for a movie,

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.320
very easily with AppleScript.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:54.910
Again, so you can begin to get an idea
about a workflow that would involve

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.320
maybe having a folder of some of
your favorite automation scripts

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.140
in a location on your computer,
either on the dock or someplace else.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.580
And as you're working with
QuickTime content during the day,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.920
for those small tasks
that you need to do,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.790
I need a copy of this in this format,
I need to set this for our home URL,

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.380
I need to set the
annotations on this one.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.060
It's just a matter of you
dragging to these little tools.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.240
It's like those neat
little kitchen tool things.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:26.200
Okay, let's take a look at some of
the scripts that are part of the

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.500
QuickTime scripts collection.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.820
I'm going to open up my Momoko again.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.960
And I'm going to add
chapters into this movie.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.390
Now, how do you do chapters?

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.900
How do you add chapters into a movie?

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.370
You shoot yourself?

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.460
Okay.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.520
It's an interesting way
to go about doing it.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.540
Probably a more pacifist way
would be to use AppleScript,

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.840
and we're going to try it that way.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.550
Thank you for being patient.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.400
So the QuickTime player,
I'll choose chapters,

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.240
and the first thing I'll
do is create chapter track.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.970
And what that script will do is says,
which track do you want

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.900
to tie the chapters to?

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.050
The audio or the video track,
and I'll choose the video track.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.300
So it goes through the process of
creating a chapter track and inserting

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.020
a chapter at the very beginning.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.540
Start.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.330
Now I'd like to add some, let's see,
full screen.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.220
So go back right to there.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:22.520
Okay.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.440
So it's just about to, right there.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.290
So she's standing up.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:26.560
Okay.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.920
Now at that point,
I'm going to go back to

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.130
the QuickTime player,
and I'm going to choose chapters,

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.390
add chapter at the current time,
and I'm going to give

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.770
it a name of full shot.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.560
Right there.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.540
Click okay.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.550
And you can see that it
added a chapter there,

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:43.280
and it has still wanted
to start like that.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.580
And then I'm going to
continue down over here to.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.780
Where it brings in the logo, logo.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:56.010
So I'll go back and choose chapters,
add a chapter at the current time.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.610
I'll say logo.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.570
Logo.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.640
Choose OK.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.740
So now I have chapters
inserted for a full shot.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.550
Start.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.710
Logo.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:15.180
And of course,
they change as the movie's playing.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.370
This one doesn't want to
scroll very well today.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.960
If I want to delete one of
those or rename a chapter,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.140
I can go back and do that.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.210
I'll choose chapter,
and I could say delete

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.500
chapter or rename a chapter.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:33.300
So instead of full shot,
I'll call that halfway.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.000
And you can see from
our chapter list here,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.280
our chapter pop-up, it's halfway, start,
and logo.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.240
Easy.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.190
Chapters are a piece of cake now.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.000
And what can you do with chapters?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.080
You can add chapters into
your QuickTime content,

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.710
and then when you put
that into the new iDVD,

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:56.110
it will automatically sense
that and break those out into

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.310
separate DVD portions for you.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:03.580
So you don't necessarily have to be
in iMovie in order to add chapter

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.200
tracks into your movie content.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.900
It's really easy to do
right from AppleScript.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.070
Now,
all of this has been happening because

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.690
of the power of AppleScript working.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.560
Behind the scenes talking
to the QuickTime player.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.650
All of these scripts have involved the
use of the QuickTime player application.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.380
It's actually the pro version.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.310
I got the pro version.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.040
I actually bought the pro version myself,
I must say.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.760
I want to support my company.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.690
I bought the pro version myself.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:37.130
And then I took five keys off the
server and used them for other things.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.860
But basically, I did pay more.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.910
And all of this has been happening
with the QuickTime player application,

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.040
and it involves the
process of writing scripts.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.650
When you write scripts
and use AppleScript,

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:53.210
as you guys well know,
use the script editor.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:59.420
This is the first version of
the new script editor beta 2.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.500
The second version has a lot
nicer icons and a little bit

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.790
different interface here,
but it's basically the idea that

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.300
this is the area right here in
which you write your scripts.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.230
Now I'm going to open up the
dictionary or the internal

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.400
commands available to us from
AppleScript for the QuickTime player.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.660
And to do that,
I went to the file menu and

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.370
I chose open dictionary.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:27.600
I get this wonderful dialogue that shows
me every scriptable app on my computer.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.770
Hopefully your computer does
not look anything like mine.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:38.290
And here is the dictionary
for the QuickTime player.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.780
Now,
since a lot of you have scripted before,

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.130
you're not afraid of seeing
this kind of a thing.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.730
This makes a lot of sense to you.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.090
There are the standard suite of events.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:51.160
These are commands that are common
to most scriptable applications.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.780
They're usually a set of verbs
or commands that indicate

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:59.770
standard actions such as close,
count, delete, does something exist,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.160
make, make a new movie, open, print,
quit.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.190
So these are the commands,
the verbs that you use.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:11.220
And this section of the dictionary
is the QuickTime player suite.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.820
And this contains commands and
objects that are particular to

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.680
the QuickTime player application.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.090
Under the category of classes,
you see this collapsible

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:23.340
thing right here.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:27.220
Those are the objects
that can be scripted.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.440
There's commands or verbs
that are the action,

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.780
and then there's the nouns,
which are the objects

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:33.780
that can be scripted.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.620
And then there's the action,
and then there's the action,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.460
and then there's the action,
and then there's the action,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.080
and then there's the action.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.420
There's annotations,
and an annotation has

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.540
some properties about it.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:46.180
It has a property called full text,
it has an ID, it has a name.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.020
The application,
which is the QuickTime player

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.850
application itself,
actually has a very interesting

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.340
set of properties here.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.100
And it also shows you that
the QuickTime player has these

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.100
elements that belong to it.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:04.320
It has a display, which is your monitor,
a favorite, a movie, a recent item,

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.810
and a window are all things that
the QuickTime player application

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.300
deals with on a scriptable basis.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.360
And these are some of the properties
of just the application itself.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:18.190
And some of these are pretty interesting,
like open movie and new player.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.630
So you can remotely have
AppleScript control the way that

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:25.840
the movie player on the customer's
machine is going to respond before

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.660
you even play the first movie.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.960
So you can set this property,
you can get this property,

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.780
and change it as you need to.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.040
You can find out what is your
current QuickTime connection speed.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.420
You can find out what QuickTime language
is QuickTime Pro installed.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.380
What is the version of QuickTime?

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.980
Do you want to show the equalizer?

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.480
Do you want to show the favorites window?

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.300
Do you want to show the
movie window window?

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.380
Do you want to show the
welcome movie automatically?

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.270
And what version of the
QuickTime player are you dealing with?

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:58.020
There are then the scriptable
objects themselves that make

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.500
up the QuickTime player.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.440
And one of the first ones we're
going to go to at a higher

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:03.940
level is the movie object.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.910
Because we all deal
with this pretty much.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.660
And a movie is composed of annotations,
it has chapters, it has a file,

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.520
or an internet location.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.880
An internet location for a stream, right?

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.640
A file for a movie that
you're running on a CD.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.320
It has tracks.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.770
It might have video tracks, audio tracks,
graphic tracks.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.660
Any kind of QuickTime track
would show up here.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.180
And it has a window that
the movie executes in.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.110
And these are the properties of a movie.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:39.600
And you can see that Gary's done
an incredible job of supplying

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.020
the kind of things that we need.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.120
It's really, really amazing.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.950
There's your auto quit when done.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.140
And it says it's a Boolean value,
which is true or false.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.540
So I could say,
set auto quit when done of

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.160
the front movie is false.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.970
And it will not quit when done.

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.490
If I say, set auto quit when done of
the front movie to true,

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.440
then it will quit the
QuickTime player when it's done.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.610
The same applies for close when done.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.660
You can set the controller type to
a specific kind of controller type.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.660
To none, or to VR player,
or whatever you need.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.660
You can get the current
time of the movie.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.660
You can get the dimensions.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.640
You can get the duration, fast start.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:19.660
You can get the href.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.660
So this is what those droplets
use to go in and set the movie.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:30.090
And you can see that they're
quite extensive in their variety.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.150
Now, a movie is composed of tracks.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.160
Well, tracks also have a collection of
properties involved with them.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.170
From whether it's an audio sample rate,
or whether it's a language,

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.160
or what kind is it.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.460
Is it a video grayscale?

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:49.080
What are the natural
dimensions of that track?

00:43:49.200 --> 00:45:07.100
[Transcript missing]

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:13.750
is showing an example of three
of the new features that are

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:17.240
part of the QuickTime dictionary.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.690
So let me go back here for a second
and pull that dictionary back up again.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.980
What's the recent items?

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.000
Okay.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.940
And one of the new events is enter
full screen and exit full screen.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.990
We have the ability to
auto-present a movie.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.920
So you saw previously when I did
click the link in the web page that

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.780
the movie went full screen and then
presented itself and then closed off.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.560
But you can actually see
the movie loading in.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.630
You can actually see the
file open up and then play.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.030
For smoother presentation,
what we've implemented in the new

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.620
version of QuickTime with these
two commands is the ability to

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.300
first set the monitor to a color,
just a plain color that you want,

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:08.020
whether it's white, black, red,
chartreuse, teal, whatever you like.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:11.830
And then we load the movie in behind
it and then present the movie.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.320
When the movie's done,
we close the movie,

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.360
bring up the next one, play that,
then close that one,

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.940
then bring the screen back to normal.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:24.800
So this enter full screen command
can... comes in very useful when you

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.250
need to present to somebody who's
got a wallet that has money in it.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.540
See, I always think about how
AppleScript's used in money,

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.690
you know?

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.230
In terms of money,
because I used to write

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.050
scripts for a living.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.880
And all of this technology
has now been built,

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:44.000
that command's been built into the new
version of the present movies script.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:48.460
So some of the new
abilities are presentation.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.480
Do you want it full screen?

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.700
Do you want it double normal?

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.460
Do you want a continuation dialogue?

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.500
Do you want it to loop?

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:54.870
Do you want to set the volume?

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.720
And what kind of background
color do you want to apply to it?

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.310
So I'll set some of these preferences.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.880
I'll let it go full screen.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.900
I'll leave the default volume.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.400
Should it play?

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.940
No continuation dialogue, no looping,
and I want to set this

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.640
background of it to white.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:17.230
So you can see that that's been
applied and saved into the script.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.230
Now, when I drag...

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:22.430
Since we're programmers here,
I'm going to drag these

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.770
two onto the script.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:29.080
You see it go full white first?

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.220
You didn't see the movie load?

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.000
It happens very fast and very smooth.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.990
I had everything set up on Windows.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.060
I had my whole life on that machine.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:41.320
You know, my illustrations, my writing,
my banking.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.560
You know,
it's like being stuck in a relationship.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:43.630
My fiancé knows him.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.730
It works on some level.

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:49.040
So now you know somebody that
knows somebody that knows him.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:55.440
Okay, well let's watch when this closes.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.640
Closes, screen, new movie, comes in,
smooth.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.060
We decided to try to upgrade.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.140
We were lured by the iMac.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.180
Then we looked at the
operating system and said,

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.940
wow, this is possibly the best
operating system I've ever seen.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.780
So I was expecting to see
3,000 guys looking at him here.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.600
Imagine my surprise.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.210
It's not just for artists.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:21.200
It's not just for pointy-headed
intellectuals from California.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:21.570
Yes!

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.320
It's for us.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.450
It's for developers.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.320
This thing is an all-around computer.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.870
I can use this for everything.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.840
Now watch it close.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:28.880
I'm a programmer.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.330
If I try it.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.060
Then back to normal.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:33.350
Nice.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:38.090
Let's thank the QuickTime team
for putting that in there for us.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:42.170
Another new feature that they
inserted into the new version

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.850
of QuickTime that's very useful,
especially for those that

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:50.460
actually know what they're doing,
is this thing called a matrix.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.640
Anybody here familiar with matrices?

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:56.940
Grumble, grumble, couple people, yeah,
yeah, cool.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.140
Couple people, algebra, I hated it,
I hated it, I hated it.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.620
It's like where you have three numbers,
and then you have three

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.300
numbers underneath that,
and then three numbers underneath that,

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.640
and you change these numbers,
and somehow it does something.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.540
They have it in Photoshop,
and I've opened up images and just

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.920
typed in numbers and watched them go,
grumble, grumble, grumble,

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.160
and then you can't get them back,
and you know, Aunt Louise has a carrot

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.980
growing out of her nose,
and it gets weird.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:24.340
So, they've opened up the ability
for us to set and get the

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.780
current matrix for a movie.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.840
So,
what I'm going to do is open up a movie.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:43.860
And what I'm going to do is go in
here and choose Get Movie Properties,

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:48.700
Video Track, Size, Adjust.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.410
So the first thing I'm going
to do is just grab this here.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.090
You click it once,
and then I'm going to just kind

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:56.580
of skew it a little bit like this.

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:58.540
So I've actually changed the movie.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.240
The movie still plays like this,
but now it's been altered.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.050
And this has been altered to
a mathematical calculation

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:06.770
involving a matrix.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:16.280
So I'm going to write a script,
tell application QuickTime player.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:21.820
To get the current matrix,
can you see that?

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.280
Of the front movie.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:27.460
Don't you love this
heavy programming stuff?

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.440
And if I run it,
you can see that down here at the bottom,

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:38.240
we have an AppleScript list of three
numbers corresponding to the top numbers,

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.940
three numbers corresponding
to the middle numbers,

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.130
and three numbers corresponding
to the bottom numbers.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.850
That's the matrix of this movie.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.220
And then if I go into the movie and
I again do some more things to it,

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.760
like I'll grab the rotationable,
rotate it like that,

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:57.130
and then run the script again,

00:50:58.050 --> 00:50:59.840
You can see that the value here changed.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:05.720
So you can literally go in and use
AppleScript now to morph your movies

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.060
into any kind of way that you want to.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.560
And this is available to you.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.260
I forgot to turn it off, okay.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:16.000
And there's a script in the
QuickTime player collection

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:20.020
called XMiscellaneous,
set matrix of the front movie,

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.650
and we've included a
couple just by default.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.860
Horizontal squeeze, where it slightly
squeezes the front movie.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.870
- Ooh.

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:36.440
Go back to that, miscellaneous,
matrix of the front movie.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.020
Make it back to normal.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.400
Let's see normal.

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:42.730
And don't worry about hurting your movie,
because the movie actually knows

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.840
what it originally looked like.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.730
And you can really muck it up
in it and get it back to normal.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.130
You can even make it
look like a flying card,

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:50.810
you know?

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.300
It doesn't freeze.

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:53.700
It's Superman.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.640
Everything just works.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.180
It just works.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.060
Unfortunately,
my dad-- So I'm interested to

00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.760
see what kind of mathematics some
of the guys out there who really

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.000
know what they're doing with this
kind of thing can do with movies,

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:07.090
maybe turn them into Krispy Kreme
donuts or something like that with

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.640
weird centers and things like that.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.560
But that's another second feature
involved in the new QuickTime player.

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:17.840
The third feature,
the third new feature that

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.620
I want to talk about is--

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:24.680
A very important one that's
been a wish list item for

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.400
everybody for quite some time.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.970
Now, you'll notice that under export,
we've always wanted to use the incredible

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:35.560
engine that's built into the operating
system of QuickTime to do compression.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.270
You might not know this,
but all the compression tools you

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:43.270
need for really doing good quality
compression are built into the

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:47.080
QuickTime architecture and can be
accessed from the QuickTime player.

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:52.350
And naturally, since they're scriptable,
you can use those to batch process

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:55.050
some export of items yourself.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:59.650
And until now, until the most recent
version of QuickTime,

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:03.150
you would have to say
using a settings preset,

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:05.660
which was one of these things.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.870
So if I open up Dave again,
and I choose... You had gotten

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.060
so disgusted with the machine.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:15.010
Dave got so disgusted with me,
I had him set to autoplay and present,

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.140
didn't I?

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.320
So if I chose export... - All right.

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:23.660
These settings here,
I could use default settings,

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.050
most recent settings,
or something that was pre-named.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:31.370
We didn't have the ability in
AppleScript to go into the options

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:36.000
and really get at all the various
settings and get into details.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.990
And we couldn't set those on
the fly like we wanted to,

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:42.560
to be able to do some very
sophisticated batch processing.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:48.080
So what they've implemented in the
new QuickTime player is the ability

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.320
to actually save an export setting.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.870
Now, these settings get saved to a
specific kind of file that only

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.260
QuickTime pays attention to.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.030
You can't open it up into
BBEdit and play with it.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:03.040
But what you can do then is save
off your favorite set of settings

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.920
and then use those settings
when you want to batch export.

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.820
So you could have 20 different
settings for just audio.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.780
You might have a set that really
worked well for classical stuff.

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:15.550
You might have a set that
really worked great for jazz.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.580
Or you might have a set for video
that you like a certain way.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.550
And now all of those are available
to you using the save export command.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.920
And the way you would do that
is you would say save export

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:32.330
settings for the front movie,
for perhaps MPEG-4, to a file location.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.820
And you always want to do this.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:38.300
You always want to, first of all,
set up your settings.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.370
So I'm going to go options, MPEG-4.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.960
I want video to be here.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.780
Ding, ding, ding.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.080
I want that like that.

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:48.940
Ooh, this is going to be ugly.

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:51.260
Like that over here and about there,
okay?

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.760
And then I go okay, save,
and then start the

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:56.870
export and then stop it.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:00.460
What that has done is that's
set into the QuickTime player,

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.270
those as being your most recent settings.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.610
Now when I use the command in
AppleScript to save export settings,

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.860
I'm actually saving those settings.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.060
So yes, it's going to take you maybe
a couple hours to set up all a

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.000
batch of your favorite settings.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.160
But once you do,
you can do cool things with it.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:17.800
And so I'd like to bring up now.

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:21.760
Ryan Lynch from the QuickTime team
is going to demonstrate this tool

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.490
that he created himself to use
internally and with some clients.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.370
Thank you, Ryan.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.990
Can we have demo two, please?

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:30.780
Oh, yes, demo two.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:37.000
So part of my job is dealing with
production of streaming media.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.920
And so it's terribly tedious
and repetitive if you don't have

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.270
any tools to take care of it.

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.140
So what I've done is use a lot
of the scripts that we have.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:46.900
Demo two.

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.600
Thank you.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.310
Some of the things that Sal came up
with before and tweaked them a lot

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:55.160
and helped to really automate some
of the processes that we have to do.

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:59.960
So taking off on the saving
this export settings,

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.920
I have a fun little tool that I wrote
here called QuickTime Compression Helper.

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:09.200
And so, you know,
I've got some nifty AIFF files

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.820
and I want to actually do a
batch and code of these things.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.700
So if I were to open it
up in QuickTime Player,

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.840
we'll go through this
whole thing and set up the,

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:24.300
I want to export to a
QuickTime movie perhaps with...

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:29.450
AAC is awesome, so we'll do that.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.470
And good enough.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:36.580
So, okay,
so if we were to export that to desktop,

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:36.580
go.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.240
So now, if I were to run this,
I can just say,

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.920
save my QuickTime settings.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.040
Because I just did the QuickTime movie,
so let's save the

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.460
QuickTime movie settings.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:50.480
You can save any of
the settings for 3GPP,

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:56.060
which is new in 6.3 QuickTime,
or even the hinted movie, any of them.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.220
So let's save that.

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.140
I'm going to call it--

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:02.240
I like Bob.

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:03.490
So, Bob test.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.140
Now it's saved it off.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:12.700
And if I were to grab all of these files,
drag them on there.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:15.600
It gives me a list of all the
settings that I have that I've already

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.200
saved off in my settings directory.

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.720
So I can say, Bob, test in a 96K.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.460
Go.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:24.040
And now it's going to go
through and export those two

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.900
movies at both those bit rates,
save them back out to disk.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.100
Really cool.

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.300
So you can basically set up your
own poor man's version of Cleaner,

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.980
and it works very well.

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:38.780
I actually like to think of it as
the smart man's version of Cleaner.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.520
Because the nice thing is this is yours.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.450
You customize it the way that you want.

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.460
You're not dealing with
somebody else's interface.

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.820
You're not dealing with somebody
else's rules of the game.

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.160
This is something that
you do that's yours,

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.830
that really works for your needs
and the needs of your client.

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.470
And it's a tool that costs.

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.780
Rhonda, what does QuickTime Pro sell for?

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:03.570
29.99 and you get access to
this incredible technology

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.580
and compression ability.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.900
Can you get it free in a book?

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:08.100
That's another good one.

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.760
There's a QuickTime for...

00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:11.450
The web.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:12.500
Web.

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.900
I thought I was going to
get somebody to say that.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.180
QuickTime for the web.

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:16.980
It also includes that as well.

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:19.800
OK, so we got one that came out.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.460
I think this is the last one.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:22.740
Okay.

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.460
That's not bad.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.660
What are we doing this on?

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:26.090
What is that?

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.960
Oh, it's not a G5.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.210
How come?

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.290
I want one.

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.350
Okay, that's enough of that anyway,
so we'll stop that.

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:38.600
And let's take a look at what we got.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.290
So we have four new files that's created,
it's exported,

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:45.950
and I've named them with the names
of the settings that I used so that

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:47.800
you know what you've just exported.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:49.400
So that's kind of nifty
and works pretty well.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.540
Oh, got to tell this to shut up.

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:57.440
And so now I've got these files,
but when you have just movie

00:58:57.450 --> 00:59:01.160
file or just audio files,
they don't look very pretty.

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:04.100
So we want to--when we present
these things for the web,

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.430
I usually like to add a graphic
onto them and let--so there's

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:11.890
something for the user to actually
see and get more of an experience.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:15.430
So I've got some--no, not that one,
the other one.

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:19.350
I've got some files here
that are all audio files.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.260
They're not very special.

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:23.470
You know, they've got... They just...

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.700
They're all the same, actually.

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:27.800
So we're going to take these guys,
and I'm going to drop them on my

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.610
little image and annotation script.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:33.730
And none of them had annotations,
so I like to do a whole bunch of things

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:38.270
together and just string a whole bunch
of operations into one AppleScript.

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:39.020
Like a workflow.

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.100
Yeah, a workflow.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.310
So it works very well.

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.860
So we have,
I'm going to set the annotations.

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.360
It actually saves,
this version saves the annotations

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.590
that I used last time so
that I can use them again,

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:49.800
which is kind of nifty.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.720
It's a wonderful feature, the properties,
you can save everything into them.

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.520
And so there we go, that sounds good.

00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.480
I'm going to choose my graphic file.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.580
Hey, that looks good.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.490
Go for it.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.870
So I'm just copying and
pasting it in there,

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.660
and boom.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.660
Done.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.460
So now, if I were to open this up,
it sets auto,

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.660
I guess that one sets autoplay too.

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:16.210
So you could actually have a series
of images and have a slideshow

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:19.340
going along as that's playing too,
just with images you get of the group

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:21.080
from the web or whatever as well.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.070
Great use?

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:22.420
Yeah.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:26.000
Excellent example of a simple workflow
put together with AppleScript and

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.870
the tools of the QuickTime player.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.030
Thank you.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.760
My pleasure.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.110
Appreciate it.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:39.030
So the next thing,
can we go back to laptop one?

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:41.240
Laptop one.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.960
So that's some of what's
in the QuickTime scripts.

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.160
If you actually delve through there,
there's a lot more involved and there's a

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.360
lot more that you can take advantage of.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:53.300
Due to time constraints,
we're going to move on to

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.280
some heavier hitting things.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.770
This year for Apple and the
last year for Apple has been a

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.600
tremendous year of innovation.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:05.240
And as Steve said a couple years ago,
when he was asked a question

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.800
about the economic slump,
he said that Apple plans to

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.830
innovate its way out of the slump.

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:14.340
And we've been doing that as witnessed
by some of the materials and things

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.060
that you've seen at this show.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:20.020
So one of the key things that we
were able to do that we introduced

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.520
a while ago was AppleScript Studio.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:28.030
What AppleScript Studio is,
it's a peer development

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:32.980
language to Objective-C,
Java, and C, uses the same tools,

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.420
development tools that all
those other languages use.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.450
And now at this series,
at this conference,

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:44.260
we introduce the culmination
of the original work that

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.990
we did with Project Builder,
and we introduced Xcode.

01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:51.940
And I've just opened up Xcode here.

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:56.680
And AppleScript Studio is
actually a component of Xcode.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.780
It's part of Xcode.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:02.280
And what it lets you do is it lets
you develop real applications for

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.860
Mac OS X written entirely in AppleScript,
partially in AppleScript,

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.120
or a combination of AppleScript, Java, C,
Carbon, Cocoa, whatever you want.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.260
You put it together and it's yours
and it looks like a Mac OS X app

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:18.470
because it is a Mac OS X app.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.850
And one of the neat things
about this and one of the really

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:26.200
innovative things about this is the
crosstalk now between languages.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:31.530
AppleScript can now communicate directly
with any system API or any framework,

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.100
including the QuickTime framework.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.320
I'm going to launch this
little app that's on my desktop

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:39.320
here called the Movie Player.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.890
So what this will do is I'll
just do it and you'll watch.

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:51.190
Watch it fade.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.270
Ooh, did you get it?

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.200
Wait, it faded in?

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:56.670
I'll run again.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.850
I'll run again.

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:02.700
I found a new property.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.690
See the way the movie faded in?

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.700
Ooh.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.200
It's going to fade out.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.190
Now, interesting thing about this movie--
I get to fade it in one more time.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.430
I like my toys.

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:17.200
I'm going to stop it.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.100
As this movie player
application has some commands,

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.880
I can rewind.

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.830
I can play.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.480
I can stop and I can set preferences.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.680
So it has a series of preferences
that I can set for auto-play,

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:33.920
auto-quit when done,
do I want to hide other application

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.580
windows when I launch this application,
and do I want to fade

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.620
the movie in and out.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.470
And this is a native
Mac OS X application.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:47.200
I've created my own
movie player application.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.440
And like any other
Mac OS X application that's created,

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.660
it has a bundle.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.510
It is actually a package of things.

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:59.030
And if I open up the contents folder,
resources folder,

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:01.680
there's a folder in there called movie.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.730
And I can literally just take this
movie out and drag in another one.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.580
I won't take that one.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.300
I want something more.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.390
Give me Momoko.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:11.570
Yeah, there we go.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.700
And I'm going to close that
and now run the app again.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:53.600
[Transcript missing]

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:57.040
Because like the QuickTime guys,
we got our own address.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.740
And click the AppleScript Studio button.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.650
And there's a project down here
that's called Movie Player Project,

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:05.020
and you can download it
and actually use this.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:09.420
And I'm going to open that
project up right now into Xcode.

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:13.350
And you do that by just
clicking the blue kind of file.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:20.230
And this is Xcode,
if you've seen it demonstrated

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.440
throughout the conference so far.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.100
And we live in this project,
we live in this environment too.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:30.050
This is our environment just
as much as it is Objective-C,

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:32.920
Cocoa, Carbon, any other language.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.780
This belongs to AppleScript too.

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:39.020
We are peer development
language now on Mac OS X.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.310
And as you can see,
the MoviePlayer project

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.450
contains a scripts folder,
which will contain the

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:46.700
scripts for our project.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:51.120
It contains a resources folder,
that in this particular case contains a

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.960
movie folder with my movie in it as well,
icons.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.120
Rhonda Straatton,
Sal Soghoian And you'll notice

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.800
that there's a frameworks folder.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.940
And one of the things that
are in the frameworks folder,

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.120
let me open this up a little bit here,
is I've loaded in the

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.620
QuickTime framework.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.340
Rhonda Straatton,
Sal Soghoian So AppleScript can

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.870
tie in to the QuickTime framework.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:08.940
Rhonda Straatton,
Sal Soghoian And you'll notice

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:08.940
that there's a frameworks folder.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:08.940
And one of the things that
are in the frameworks folder,

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:08.940
let me open this up a little bit here,
is I've loaded in the

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:08.970
QuickTime framework.

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.780
to the QuickTime framework directly,
you can write your own

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.420
commands to do this.

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:17.660
So what I'm going to do is, for example,
I'll open up the

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.790
AppleScript script itself,
I'll just double-click it.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:26.160
And this is the AppleScript script
that's in there.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.120
I'm going to set this for
editing out of a single window.

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:32.340
And it has a lot of documentation
built right into the header,

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.780
so it tells you how to use this.

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:38.180
And it tells you about some of the
QuickTime calls that are available to

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.960
you and documents each one of them.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.100
But I'm going to just jump
to where the script is.

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:46.460
So this is actually the script that
makes up this particular application.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.230
It has some handlers for what
it does when it launches.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.940
It has some properties that it stores
and writes to a preference file

01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:55.560
like any other Mac OS X application.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.930
And it has routines
for loading the movie,

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:01.580
what it will do when the
movie is finished launching,

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.120
what the application will do
once it's finished launching.

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:10.880
And then it has an idle handler
right here that the application

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:14.500
will watch and determine when
the movie is finished playing.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.100
Well, that's not a command that's
readily available to AppleScript.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:24.640
There's no "Is movie done?" playing
command built into Xcode at this point.

01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:26.960
So how did we accomplish that?

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:31.000
Well, we did that by tying into
one of the QuickTime APIs.

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:35.040
We created a little
routine for ourselves here.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:38.840
And it ties into the QuickTime API.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.280
This is a little Cocoa thing here.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.010
It's a Boolean value,
meaning true or false.

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.300
This is the name of the
routine I've put together,

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.360
isMovieFinished.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:50.360
And here you can see it's actually
calling into the QuickTime API.

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:53.580
An API call that they have
is called isMovieDone.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.990
It returns a value of 0 or 1,
true or false true,

01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.170
depending upon whether
that movie is done.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:05.310
And you pass it in the QuickTime movie
that you're going to be examining.

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:07.540
And all of this can be found.

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:21.690
You can go find and...

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.340
Is movie done?

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.650
It's too fast for me here.

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:32.780
It's in the movies.h file right here.

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:36.860
So this just went into
the QuickTime.h file,

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.270
and you can see that here this was
put in in version 10.0 and later,

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:47.090
Carbon 1.0, QuickTime Live 2.5 and 3,
and here's the, oh, it moved it on me.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.710
Natural bounds, wherever it went to.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:50.820
It slid around.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.510
But you can see it takes you
right into the QuickTime headers,

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.100
and you can actually see all
the calls that you can make.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.790
And the way that it's called in
the AppleScript application is this

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.630
particular thing called call method.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.530
Then you give it the name of
the method with any parameters

01:09:07.530 --> 01:09:09.240
that you're passing through.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.460
So at this point,
AppleScript leaves its world,

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:16.410
calls into the QuickTime frameworks,
has it do something or

01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:19.700
return some information,
and then gets that information

01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:20.800
back and then proceeds.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.680
So it just leads on with it.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:29.270
Now, this sample project that's up on
the website contains a library here.

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:31.580
Let's just go right to it.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.400
I'll show it to you.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.710
.h file.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.190
Oh, that's the wrong one.

01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:37.950
.am file.

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:40.280
And then switch over to the thing.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.910
Here are some of the calls that
are available in this little sample

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.660
that we have in this project.

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.630
Getting the time value for a movie,
setting the time value,

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:51.800
getting the duration value for a movie,
getting the time scale,

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.610
the bounds of the movie,
the natural bounds of the movie,

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:57.450
rewinding the movie, going to the end,
is the movie done,

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:01.620
what's the bounds of the main screen,
and setting the volume for the movie.

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.180
This augments the abilities of
AppleScript Studio as it is right now.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:11.750
And it's a great example of how to expand
your work beyond the normal scope that

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.140
you've been able to do with AppleScript.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:17.190
Instead of waiting for a scripting
edition to be written by a third

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.200
party that you have to make sure
is installed on every machine,

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.850
you can now just call the calls directly
yourself through AppleScript Studio and

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.540
create a visual interface that
determines what the user sees.

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:35.340
As part of the project, of every project,
this particular

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:39.770
application has a nib file,
an interface builder.

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.100
And this is the interface builder.

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.780
Let me hide all the other
stuff so you can see.

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.500
This is the preferences window.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.240
Here's the application menu.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.340
This is the floating window,
and it has certain properties

01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.940
involved with it as far as
how it's designed to expand.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:05.770
And the movie view that's inside of
that window that I have stretched to

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:10.830
fill it is also set to expand so that
when the movie's placed in there,

01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:14.430
AppleScript asks for the size of
the movie from QuickTime and then

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.140
tells the window to size yourself
automatically to these dimensions,

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.730
and naturally the movie
goes to that dimensions,

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:21.990
and then it shows it.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.480
All of that put together
inside of AppleScript Studio.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.780
Brave new world.

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:30.700
You have a lot more abilities
than you ever had before.

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:35.740
And it's all available
to you on Mac OS X,

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:40.380
Jaguar,
and Panther with Xcode moving forward.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:44.000
So that's just a quick overview of
some of the things that you can do with

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:47.830
AppleScript and AppleScript Studio and
QuickTime and some of the

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:49.730
resources that are available today.

01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:51.880
Small things and big things.

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:53.780
So with that, we have a few more minutes.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:56.030
I'll be glad to take some questions.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.440
Do I have an assistant
on the questions here?

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.430
Ah, okay.

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:00.870
Thank you.

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.440
Nope.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.000
So I guess I'm the
assistant on the questions.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.520
So quickly,
we'll go through the upcoming roadmap.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.900
And as we're doing that,
please line up at the microphones if

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.640
you have any questions for Sal or Ryan,
if you have any.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.600
Here's the roadmap of upcoming things.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.200
There is a QuickTime alternative
programming environment,

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.260
which obviously we just
had a big lesson on that.

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:28.490
And if there's any questions
on who to contact regarding

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:32.860
anything to do with QuickTime,
it's Guillermo Ortiz.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.060
He's at QuickTimeMan at Apple.com.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.540
Reference library,
Sal pretty much told you

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.530
about all this stuff.

01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:46.900
And don't miss, there's a lab downstairs,
open every day,

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:50.740
where you can talk to engineers
about anything you need to do.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:55.280
And there's also a content creation
lab about creating content.
