WEBVTT

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.690
Good afternoon.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.380
Let me get a quick drink here
before I get the cotton mouth.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.210
All right.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.800
So my name's Michael Lopp.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.150
I'm the manager of
Desktop Management Solutions for

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.500
Apple Computer.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.080
I'm really excited to be
talking with you guys today,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.830
mostly because I've been
sitting in the car for two weeks

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.850
working on this presentation,
and my wife and kids are really

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.420
getting tired of hearing about
managed desktop technologies.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.810
So let's get started.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.460
We're going to spend a little time today,
we're going to be talking

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.040
about what our strategy is for
desktop management at Apple.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.270
And as we go through,
we're going to give you some

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.920
live demonstrations of NetBoot,
Network Install,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.840
and Apple Remote Desktop,
as well as managed desktop.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.950
So let's get started.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.020
So what we're going to learn today.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.180
We're going to give you this
overview of what we've done

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.140
as part of Panther Server,
as part of Apple Remote Desktop.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.850
We're going to spend some time
on understanding how these

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.260
different technologies are
actually going to work together.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
We're going to talk about some
of the new features that we

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
have in each of these releases.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
And most importantly,
what we're going to be doing is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
we're going to be giving you,
sysadmins and IT folks,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
ideas of how to use these solutions
together because you all have different

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
management policies out there.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
And our tools,
it's really important that our

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
tools work well together to
provide a variety of solutions.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.090
So before we start, a show of hands.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.440
How many people are responsible
for two or more Macs?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.480
And by responsible,
I mean if something goes wrong with them,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.730
you're the person that's called.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.410
Hands up.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Two or more.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
OK.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Good.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
OK.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Keep them up.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Keep them up.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
So 50 or more?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Whoa.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.900
100 or more?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.750
A thousand or more?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.750
Aha, OK.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.750
Interesting.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.750
Oh, sorry.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.750
I can't really see you guys up here.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.750
5,000 or more?

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.600
Excellent.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.590
Very good.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.350
Great to see.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.600
5,000 Macs, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.600
That's a lot.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.410
One more?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600
This guy's got more.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.600
Is he an Apple employee?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600
35,000.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.600
35,000 Macs.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
We're all NetBooty.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.620
I wonder about that.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.800
I wonder about that.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.620
One second.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.620
OK, so 35,000.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.580
I lose the bet.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.410
OK,
so let's talk about desktop management.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.990
A gentleman here in the front
row earlier was asking me,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.860
what does management mean, right?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.000
Is it my manager talking
to me and doing stuff?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.820
No, it's not that.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.550
What it is, the way that we see it is
there's basically three

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.420
steps to desktop management.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.530
And we're going to talk
about the lifecycle here,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.900
desktop management lifecycle.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.130
We're going to make it simple.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.790
Let's not talk about 35,000 mats.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.200
Let's talk about one single Macintosh.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.990
And the steps-- well,
the business process steps that we see,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.740
that I see, are deploy, manage,
and assess.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.740
Now let me talk about
what each of these means.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.990
For the one Mac, deploy.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.330
Box shows up.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.340
Get it out of the box.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.300
I've got to get it to somebody.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.000
It's got to be a marketing person.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.590
He needs an operating system or
she needs a set of applications.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.870
That's deploy.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.960
Bunch of decisions.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.200
Some action.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.900
Then we have to actually
get it out to them.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.740
Each of you has a different
management policy.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.190
Some of you are giving them a
user and a network password.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.910
Some of you want absolute
control over the desktop.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.660
So you've got a whole other
set of decisions there.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.840
That's manage.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.330
And then there's assess, which is, OK,
great.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.270
I've got the iMac.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.230
It's sitting out there.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.650
And then things are happening to it.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.400
There's new software coming out.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.190
There's troubleshooting
that needs to be going on.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.900
There's new operating systems coming out.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.460
So all these things,
every decision that we just

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.180
talked about here is part of
the work for you guys out there.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.580
They're actually working
on managing these machines.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.680
And I'm just talking
about a single Mac here.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.940
We just talked about one single Mac.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.960
So what about if you've got five, 50,
35,000?

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.270
What if you're this guy?

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.600
What if you've got-- that's
a lot of iMacs there.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.050
So think about it like this.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.390
The point is this.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.910
Think about applying a
software update to this lab.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.540
We take it for granted as individuals,
because the Macs are so easy to use,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.450
that it's really easy to pull
down a software up and do it.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.690
If you want to pull a software
update to this set of Macs,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.960
we're talking about a weekend.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.040
We're talking about hours.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.880
We're talking about a huge
amount of money being expended.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.260
So what our goal is,
what our strategy is,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.420
where we're driving the products,
is to develop an integrated suite of

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.920
products and technology to simplify,
automate desktop management of

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.540
Apple hardware and software.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.430
Hardware and software.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.840
That's not just desktops.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.920
That's portables.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.420
That's all the software.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.140
This is a very, very, very broad goal,
and it's something I think we've

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.770
done really well as part of
Panther Server and Apple Remote Desktop.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.840
So let's go back and see how we
actually fit in with the current

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.110
products we have now relative
to this management lifecycle.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.760
So for Deploy,
and we'll talk about each of these

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.080
products in depth here in a second.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.880
For Deploy, we have NetBoot,
the ability to NetBoot systems,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.370
do network installs.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.910
We have Manage,
so you can actually set up images and

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.800
actually broadcast them out there.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.080
That's one of our management solutions.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.400
Hello.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.140
There we go.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.800
We have the Workgroup Manager,
specifically managed preferences

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.310
to help set up the management
policies for you guys out there.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.280
And then we have Assess.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.410
You'll see the ARD, Apple Remote Desktop,
actually covers all of these because

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.090
it touches each one of these.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.790
It's a very different tool than the
Panther server because it's a box

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.860
and it's a separate application.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.210
But it's something that we feel that
covers all of these different sectors.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.830
So, click.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.460
There we go.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.860
So let's get into some specifics.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.890
NetBoot and network installation.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.060
This is part of Panther server.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.490
I know a lot of you probably already
are very familiar with NetBoot.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.050
For those of you who are not,
the basic building blocks

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.770
of NetBoot are images,
disk images.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.420
There are specific images for NetBoot
and specific images for network install.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.860
Let's talk about each one of
those after I have some water.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.010
Okay.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.810
So, two flavors.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.390
Same technology,
two different flavors of this.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.400
First, we have Network Install.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.550
The way I think of Network Install,
I think of it as sort of a

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.890
poor man's software update.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.400
The idea here is you
actually build images,

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.010
put in whatever arbitrary software
operating systems you want into it,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.370
and allow the user to actually
do installs over the network.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.410
Something to remember about
NetBoot is it's for the wire.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.400
It's not something that's for wireless,
because these are big images, right?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.400
We've got operating systems in here.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400
You've got applications in here.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.400
So, that's Network Install.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.620
NetBoot, slightly different flavor.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.390
Again, some of you know this.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.400
NetBoot is centralized boot images.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400
What does that mean?

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.400
What that means is it's actually booting
up off the server from a NetBoot image.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.000
There's actually nothing
being stored except for a swap

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.400
file in the local machine.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.270
So, that sounds nice and handy,
but why would I really

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.380
want to actually do that?

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.400
It's really useful for, for example,
a network.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.380
For lab situations,
go back to the guy in that slide, right?

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.400
With NetBoot, what you get each time is
you boot up from the machine,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.400
and you get the exact same system.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.800
So,
if you've got a hostile user out there,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.400
and he or she does some
things to the machine,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.400
next time you reboot to a NetBoot system,
you actually get the exact same system.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.930
So,
it's really handy for the lab situation,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.850
kiosk, and that sort of thing.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.370
So some examples,
some real-world examples

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.700
of network install,
again, as I already mentioned.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.610
Pushing OS updates out,
pushing out applications,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.500
pushing out whatever disk images
you want in network install.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.780
Full updates, partial updates for
all the Apple hardware.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.840
And you can actually do it with ARD.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.400
You can actually use
the machine to actually,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.200
as you see here on the
Apple Remote Desktop shortly,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.850
you can actually change the
startup disk to actually

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.990
reboot from a different image.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.970
And you can actually do that.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.270
Or the system or the users can actually
update at their own convenience.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.460
For NetBoot, again, zero administration.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.560
You don't have to do anything.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.980
You have this one image on a server,
and you don't have to worry about your

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.420
machines because you know they're always
going to be in the exact same state.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.580
is a great example of how to use NetBoot.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.830
You could have a different boot
image for different departments,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.290
marketing, engineering.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.020
Or another thing you could do with a new
feature that we put into this release,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.650
we have a diskless NetBoot,
where there's absolutely

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.000
no storage on the machine.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.050
And that would be really handy for, say,
if you want to deploy a

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.830
network diagnostic image,
where you can actually have a

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.050
diskless NetBoot and actually
not have anything on the machine.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.350
So that would be something
to be really handy.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.090
So another use of NetBoot would
be network diagnostic and repair.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.540
So what did we do in Panther?

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.080
We did a lot.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.610
We changed a lot.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.000
For those of you, again,
familiar with Netboot,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.930
setting up a Netboot environment
has been complex in the past.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.880
So our first goal was to really
simplify the setup and the

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.640
configuration of Netboot servers.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.310
And I'm going to show
that to you in a second.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.590
The other thing is you've
got all these images.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200
These are big images.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.980
And you've got to do a
lot of things to them.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.510
And there's more software coming out.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.950
So we had this tool called
the Network Image Utility,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.660
which is a simple tool.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.420
We've completely rewritten the
Network Image Utility as part of

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.270
Panther Server to be something which
is much more geared at managing images.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.400
Managing meaning I've got new images.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400
I want to update images.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.240
I want to edit images.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.520
I want to sync them with other sources.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.490
I want to create--
I want to clone volumes.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.480
We've added all of that to
the Network Image Utility.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.980
I'm going to show you some
of that here in a second.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.130
So here's a screenshot
of the NetBoot server.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.170
This is actually the images pane.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.120
You can see it's very similar
to all the other server admin

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.320
plugins that we have here.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.460
We'll actually show this to you
in a demo in a couple minutes.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.390
So I'm actually just
going to blow by this.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.000
As you can see,
simplified user interface, server admin,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.560
very familiar.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.900
Anyone who's using server admin is
going to be able to use the NetBoot

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.100
piece because it's all the same UI.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.000
As I mentioned, we added another feature,
which is Dysos NetBoot.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.180
That means that there's nothing
being stored on the machine

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.590
that's doing the NetBoot.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.440
And also we've provided
Netboot over HTTP as well.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.450
Network Image Utility.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.160
For those of you familiar
with the other one,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.560
this is a brand new one.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.720
We've completely redone it.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.710
We've rewritten it completely in Cocoa.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.090
What you're seeing here is a list
of all the images that you have in a

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.200
local machine when you fire up the NIU.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.470
And actually, we're going to show
this to you in a second.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:22.600
[Transcript missing]

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.760
So, like I said,
we've already been in Cocoa.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.300
We've given you the ability to actually
walk through and create these images,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.800
make it easier for you to
understand what you need to do.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.620
A feature that was really popular
is we now have the ability

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.560
to clone existing volumes.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.790
So here's a great idea.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.800
You sit down, you configure the
system however you want,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.800
use the network image utility
to actually clone the volume,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.780
create an image out of that.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.800
It's a really handy way
to actually set it up.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.370
Another thing that you'll see is we
actually give the ability to import

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.800
and export images from the NIU.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800
Remember, these are big things.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.800
These can be huge files, right?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.680
So we actually, within it,
you actually have the ability to

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.800
actually import and export over there.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.280
And another thing that we've
been asked for is the ability

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.800
to put post-install scripts.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.690
So one of the things
you can do is actually,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.530
if we can't do something for you,
you can put an arbitrary script

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.230
that does some set of things,
some other setup that we haven't

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.780
thought of in there as well.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.790
So that's built right into the NIU.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.110
Let's take a look at these guys.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.640
Nice and fast.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.950
OK.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.000
So here we are in Panther Server.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.300
And we're going to fire up the new NIU.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.850
Okay.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.430
So what you're seeing here,
these are just some images we

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.900
put together for this demo.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.500
These are the different
images that I have here.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.400
You can see here these are
all in this local volume here.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.100
I'm trying to give them useful names.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.850
So here we have the Jaguar
latest NetInstall image.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.200
We've got a Panther raw.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.200
Maybe I have a couple different
images that I want to have here.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.900
The idea is you've got
a whole listing here,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.300
which is sortable and by
the last modified date,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.710
and you can actually use this
to actually get an idea of what

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.800
images you have on this machine.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.380
All right,
just going quickly across the toolbar.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.380
The two basic types of images we
have are NetInstall and NetBoot,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.750
so you can click on these
to actually do that.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.340
We'll actually do that in one second.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.340
You can edit the image from here as well.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.420
I'm not going to do that right now.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.220
And as I mentioned,
you can import and export as well.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:18.940
So let's see here.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.450
What do we want to do?

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.080
So we're going to go ahead and
actually just start to network,

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.760
creating a network install here.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.340
Let's see here.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.380
Let's call this--

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.620
Demo, WWDC, we'll give it an ID.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.220
Another thing,
another feature that we add

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.600
in here is the description,
right?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.900
So what was in that image
that I called image 27ab?

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.360
I have no idea.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.800
This is the Panther image.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.200
Please don't touch.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.050
So you can actually put that
description in there and put a

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.480
little more content in there.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.480
So what I'm going to do here,
and I'm actually not going to do this

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.300
because this would take a very long time,
but just to give you a feel for it,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.610
is we're actually,
what we do here is we're actually

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.900
going to clone this volume.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.030
What I have here is I have a Macintosh,
I have this partition right

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.370
here that I want to clone.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.400
But there's another thing I want to do.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.500
I noticed there was this keynote
update that I wanted to add as well.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.720
So this is how easy it is to
actually go and create this.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.740
So I'll go ahead and I'm going to
pull this package that I've already,

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.630
already sat here.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.000
Hello.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.010
You waking up there?

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.400
Maybe not.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.100
There we go.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.200
I'm going to go ahead and add that.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.850
Okay.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.160
Now, I'm not going to actually
do this right now because,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.120
again, it would take too long.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.000
But what I've just done here
is I'm now creating a network

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.050
install image from a partition.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.170
I'm adding another package at the end.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.020
I could add another post install script.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.880
I click create and I actually
see it actually create.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.020
One nice thing for you guys out there
who want to know what's going on.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:45.640
Excuse me.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.040
There's an actual log here.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.060
The old NIU didn't have anything there.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.230
It was just taken away.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.470
You can see the log here.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.820
You can actually see the
tools that we're using in the

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.140
operating system to create this.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.540
So if you want to do it yourself,
just take a look at the log.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.410
So that's the NIU.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.840
Network image utility.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.680
Let's see here.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.270
Okay.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:11.000
So the other thing I wanted to show
you guys is the server administrator.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:29.200
[Transcript missing]

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.850
Glad to hear that.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.950
Good feedback.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.820
OK, so here we are.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.480
As I mentioned,
there's a lot of different pieces to

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.340
NetBoot to get it setting up and running.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.120
So here's the overview.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.410
You can actually see what
you need to get going.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.460
You've got NFS running.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.380
You've got AFP going.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.610
Take a look at the logs here.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.340
Show me the logs.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.420
Tell me what's going on.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.600
Clients that have booted from this.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.240
There's no one actually booted from this,
so we don't actually have

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.480
anything in here yet.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.840
And here we're getting to the setting.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.670
This is really the meat
of setting up the server.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.980
What you're seeing here is that
I'm bound to an Ethernet port.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.130
I can say why I want the client
data and the images stored

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.900
for this particular server.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.990
But really the meat of what
you're going to be doing is,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.200
managing what images you
have from the server.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.760
So here we are.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.310
Again, you'll see, exactly like the NIU,
this is a list of images that

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.660
I have on the server here.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.700
I've enabled a net boot
as a default image.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.050
So if you hold the N key down,
this is the image that

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.500
will come from this server,
right?

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.720
But we don't want to
do a network install,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.630
because that'd start installing
stuff on someone's machine.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.770
Again, you can enable here as well.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.870
Excuse me.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.500
And also, if you want to do diskless,
this is where you'd be

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.300
setting this as well,
as well as setting which protocol

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.420
you want it to be served over.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.900
So with this configured like this,
the process of actually firing

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.850
up the servers is pretty simple.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.850
You click Start.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.080
And you wait a second.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.560
And you wait one more second.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.000
There we go.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.480
NetBoot's being served up right now.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.490
Really simple,
really easy to use interface

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.000
for a very complex problem
that we're trying to solve.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.790
Okay.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.170
So that's it for the demo.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.570
Let's back to slides.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.020
Okay, thank you.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.200
Easy to use, NetBoot.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.910
You've got to love it.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.570
Okay, Managed Desktop,
the other second of our two

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.240
management technologies.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.890
I want to jump back to something
I started with a little while ago.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:42.260
We've got a variety of people out here
with five machines and 35,000 machines.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.670
The fact of the matter is each of you
has a very unique management policy.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.830
Some of you, like I said,
just want to control the

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.880
username and the password.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.840
Some of you want absolute control
over it because you're education

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.000
and you don't want your students
having access to network resources or

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.560
maybe some of the system preferences.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.420
What Managed Desktop does for us is,
for those of you who've attended

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.960
some of the directory sessions,
what Managed Desktop does is

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.900
it gives us the ability to...
Managed Desktop does for us is it

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.400
gives us the ability to manage the
preferences on these client machines.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.950
What happens is, via directory services,
we actually pull down these managed

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.060
preferences to a local machine,
and then the operating system

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.250
uses those preferences as the
preferences for that machine.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.650
Important point here.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.740
When these preferences are
pulled down via open directory,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.760
they're cached.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.340
So we've got these portables out here,
these portables that may or may

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.150
not be actually on the network.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.230
So the nice thing about this is that
we can actually use these portables to

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.940
manage the preferences on the machine.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.540
The other nice thing is that
these preferences that you'll

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.140
be setting in WorkRouteManager,
and we'll be showing

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.930
you this in one second,
are actually going to follow

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.020
these portables around.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.720
That's really handy.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.280
The other nice thing,
as you'll see in the WorkRouteManager,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.840
is we have a very flexible way
to define a set of policies.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.820
This is because all of you,
each one of you, has a very,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.460
very different set,
has a different policy.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.710
So you can set policy for computers,
sets of computers in a lab.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.420
You can set policies,
preferences for groups.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.880
So I've got this group of students,
or I've got this group of employees.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.420
So you can set those preferences that
you need to set in certain preferences.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.420
Or you can set it on an
individual user basis.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.580
All of those preferences,
when you set those,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.370
and then pull down the machine,
are composites.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.830
So I can set them up here
at the computer list,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.620
in the group, and in the user.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.940
So, and again, as I mentioned,
it's designed to support

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.210
portable hardware.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.910
One thing that I'll
show you here shortly,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.830
and I know this is coming
up in a lot of the sessions,

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.300
one of the things that we've added
as part of Managed Desktop and

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.320
Workgroup Manager is mobile accounts.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.320
Has everyone heard of this yet?

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:40.900
Okay.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.260
So what mobile accounts are,
what this does is using this

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.200
Managed Desktop technology,
it actually gives you the ability,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.800
when you set an account as mobile,
to actually cache the account,

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.080
cache the user name,
as well as the network credentials.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.970
This means that if I set up the user to
actually do it with a mobile account,

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.560
this means that if I,
when I first log in,

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.810
my credentials are pulled down,
my accounts are pulled down,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.300
they're saved locally.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.130
When I disconnect from the network,
I can still log in with the

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.510
exact same network password,
right?

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.060
So you IT folks out there who always
want one's password for each computer,

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.290
each person,
this is a great feature for you guys.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.640
So, Managed Desktop.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.250
Provide standardized
desktop configurations.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.300
Give the ability to
manage system preferences.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.060
Control access to hardware, to software,
to network resources.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.120
The ability to automatically
provide network com directories,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.640
control the desktop, automatically launch
applications that log in.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.140
There's a lot of pieces to this.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.050
So, what we're going to do,
what we did as part of Panther was

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.690
a managed desktop was something
which we introduced as part of

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.650
Jaguar and continue to support.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.640
So, we want to continue to
refine the technology.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.740
Additionally,
there's new preferences which

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.130
have landed as part of Panther.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.900
So, we need to extend it to
actually support those.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.150
And we want stronger support
for portables because there's

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.890
a lot of you out there,
a lot of your hardware out

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.400
there is going to be portables.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.310
And if you want to manage it,
the technology needs to support you.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.020
So let's quickly go down the
list of managed preferences

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.500
that we actually manage.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.720
And I'll go through these pretty quickly.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.240
Application access.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.100
Which applications do you want
them to be actually able to manage?

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.940
Managing the classic environment,
when you want it to start up,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.960
dock behavior, how it shows up.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.750
Basically, everything you can do within
normal system preferences.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.690
A new one as of Panther is
the Energy Saver settings.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.080
You lab guys out there,
you've got labs that you want

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.770
to start up at 9 o'clock and
you want to shut down at 10 p.m.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.500
With this managed desktop,
this feature that's new Energy Saver

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.130
settings is now managed.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.940
So you're going to be able to
do that in your labs as well,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.260
which is a really popular feature.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.680
Thank you.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.950
finder behavior.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.100
Internet preferences.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.070
Careful.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.100
This isn't in Panther.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.620
Why is this still listed here?

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.720
Remember, not everyone is going
to Panther tomorrow,

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.250
right?

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.300
Maybe they will.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.120
Who knows?

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.790
This is a preference which is
something which is in Jaguar.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.930
Managed preferences needs to
manage machines that are in

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.680
Jaguar as well as Panther.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.060
So what you're going to see when you
look at our preferences for managed

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.460
desktop is it's going to be a union.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.250
It's going to be the full set of
them so you can continue to manage

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:34.170
your Panther machines just like
you're managing your Jaguar machines.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:34.170
Full backward compatibility.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:40.260
Login items, auto-launching applications,
media access, control the media.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.820
This is another popular
thing in education.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.460
You don't want them burning a lot of CDs,
so you just turn off the CD player.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.240
Mobile accounts,
which we already talked about,

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.950
the ability to actually cache an
account that follows you around.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.360
Printer access quotas,
and then management

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.150
assistant preferences.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.150
Maybe I don't want people to
get to the accounts button.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.130
So using this-- and actually,
I'll show you this in the demo--

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.900
you can actually turn this off,
or whatever preferences you want

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.150
not available in system preferences.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.000
So let's do that.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.700
Let's actually show this off.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.780
OK.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.310
Workgroup Manager.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.930
For the sake of simplicity,
what I'm going to do here is I'm

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.220
actually going to just edit locally.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.960
So I'm not editing an LDAP server here.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.400
What I'm doing is editing a local NetInfo
database just for simplicity's sake.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.760
So I'm going to go ahead and
I'm going to create a group.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.790
And this is going to be a new group.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
I'm going to call it WWDC Lab.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
Lab 1.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
Go ahead and save that sucker.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
All right.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
So for the lab, let's see,
what do I want to do to this guy?

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
For the lab, I'm a very smart IT guy.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
And I know that if you
put the doc on the right,

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
huge productivity gain.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
So I'm going to force everybody in
my lab to have the doc on the right.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
Because I can't.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.890
All right.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.520
Okay, so quickly,
just to go quick for these

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.220
settings here that we have here,
what you can do for each of the

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.710
settings that we're going through,
you can have it not managed.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:11.880
You can have once.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.910
Once, the difference between once and
always is really extremely relevant.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.530
Once means that this
setting is pulled down once,

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.230
and it's sort of a breadcrumb.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.280
You're trying to help out your user
by setting up something so it's easy

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.150
for them to get around their desktop.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.470
They can then change it.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.230
Always means it's always.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.900
They can't touch it.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.390
And for this,
I'm going to make it always.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.020
So here we go.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.520
Dock on the right.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.520
Good luck.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.350
All right, so what we just did there is
we set the dock to the right so

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.340
anybody within this group is going
to get their dock on the right.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.160
All right.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.500
Let's go ahead and create a
user as well and show sort of,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.340
we'll show accounts.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.560
There we go.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.200
Show actually compositing
of preferences as well.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.830
So I'm going to create a new character.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.150
Let's call Rans.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:01.080
All right,
so we'll go ahead and we'll make Rans.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.570
He's probably going to need a password.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.570
Give him a name and a password.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:16.400
[Transcript missing]

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:18.770
All right.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.790
So, Ranj is sort of a sketchy character,
so what we're going to do here

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.740
is we're going to manage some of
his system preferences as well.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.960
I don't want him to have account access,
and I don't want him to have

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.690
expose because it's just too
cool and he's not a cool guy.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
Okay.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
Okay.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
So we'll go ahead and we'll apply that.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
And what we're going to do is we're
actually going to log in to log

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
in as RANS on this machine here.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
So shut this down.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
And we'll log out.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.830
No, we'll really log out.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:15.000
[Transcript missing]

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.490
And there we see it.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.430
Doc on the right.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.000
Hugely productive rams.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
So, thank you.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
What you'll see here is
actually you can't change it.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.310
This is not -- it's because we made
this a forced preference on here.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.500
It's set to always.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.810
When you go and you take a
look at what he can get to,

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.500
you can't get to expose.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.130
Oh, my God, what's he going to do?

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.700
And you can't get to accounts as well.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.320
So this is a really trivial example.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.110
But you get the idea if you have
multiple workgroups or lots of

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.090
users or computer lists that it's
really easy to actually set these

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.450
up and deploy them to your users.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.390
You're going to want to know
about mobile accounts because it

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.040
seems to be a very popular topic.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.540
I would direct you toward
the session tomorrow at 9:00,

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.330
developing for managed networks.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.600
No.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.160
Is that right?

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.230
9:00 session.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.150
And they're actually going to be
demoing it there tomorrow so you

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.860
can actually see that at work.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.670
So let's log back in as admin.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.120
And leave this for the next demo.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.410
OK, back to slides, please.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.960
OK, so that was Managed Desktop.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:28.190
OK, last of the three.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.250
Apple Remote Desktop.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.000
So this is very different than the two
technologies we just talked about today,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.050
we already talked about.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.640
It's a separate product.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.820
It's why there's a box.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.560
There's a big difference
between these technologies,

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.400
this product and the technology
we just talked about,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.770
because Apple Remote Desktop is
more of a real-time technology.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.730
It's a separate product to actually
do things in real-time of the now,

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.030
as I would like to think of it.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.070
One of the key features with
Apple Remote Desktop is the ability

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.200
to use it on not just one machine,
but actually to broadcast

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.500
to multiple machines.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.340
That's a big differentiator.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.210
As I mentioned, it's a separate product
from Panther Server,

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.630
and it's really ideal for small to
medium-sized deployments of Macs.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.540
Let's take a look at what
we've got going on here.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.860
So this is a sample screenshot
of an Apple Remote Desktop.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.200
What you're looking at
is up in the bottom here,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.370
we've got a list of the machines
that we're interacting with.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.400
Over here on the right,
we're doing a multi-observe,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.130
looking at four machines
at the same time,

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.790
something maybe you want to do in
a classroom if you're monitoring

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.940
what your students are doing.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.880
There's a sending a text message,
and that at the top is actually a report

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.260
that's been generated against this.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.870
We're actually going to do a
live demo of this in a second,

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:45.280
so let's talk a little bit about how
you're going to use Apple Remote Desktop.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.860
System management, copying files,
moving applications,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.910
that's more of the software distribution.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.800
System management,
making sure that you've

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.300
got the right machines,
doing profiling against them,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.810
doing remote assistance,
doing actual interaction with

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.220
these machines via screen sharing.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.360
System profiling is one other big thing.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.800
We're doing asset management.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:14.070
And software distribution, again,
installing packages over the network,

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.480
doing all sorts of things.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.210
It's the Swiss Army knife.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.320
That's what I always think
about Apple Remote Desktop.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.110
There's a huge amount of
things you can do that.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.730
And when you sit down and
you take a look at it,

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.960
there's just a huge amount of
what I call management verbs that

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.220
you can do with this application.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.550
And we're going to show you
a bunch of those in a second.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:36.180
First, what did we do with ARD or
Apple Remote Desktop this year?

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.460
First off, we had two releases this year.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.630
We had the
Apple Remote Desktop 1.2 release,

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.370
which was out last March.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:47.860
An incremental release,
but we did add some key new features.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.170
The ability to set the
network startup disk.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.110
Again,
utilizing NetBoot and NetworkInstall,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.930
the ability to do that so you can
quickly repurpose a large set of

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.710
machines to a different disk image.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.660
Remote software installation,
the ability to broadcast packages

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.210
to a large set of machines,
as well as make it really

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.150
easy to auto-update prior
versions on the network.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.860
That was one release.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.180
There's another release.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.930
So we actually did
something with Panther.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.380
And those of you who have gotten your CD,
you've installed it

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.920
and taken a look at it,
in the sharing panel,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.510
there's a new little checkbox.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.050
Apple Remote Desktop.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.830
What did we do?

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.340
Did we give you a free copy of ARD,
Apple Remote Desktop?

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.280
Actually, what we did,
there's two pieces to

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.280
Apple Remote Desktop.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.280
There's the agent.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.600
Those of you familiar with the product,
there's the agent.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.180
What we've done, there's the agent and
there's the administrator.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.780
The administrator's the
console that you look at.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.460
What we've done,
is we've built the agent into Panther.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.720
The number one complaint people
had about Apple Remote Desktop is

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.550
it's hard to configure.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.160
I've got to go visit
every single machine,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.940
install the agent,
make sure everything's in.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:53.520
It's built in.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.130
Every Panther server and and
every version of Panther has

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.540
this built into the product.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.600
So you click-- well, we'll actually show
it to you in a second.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.180
So what I'm going to do now is I'm
actually going to bring Chris Sorman.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:16.220
He's the
Apple Remote Desktop Engineering Manager.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.710
Welcome.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.850
So what we're going to do here is we're
actually going to do a little scenario.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.200
We're an IT administrator,
and we're actually going to do

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.640
some management of our machines.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.180
Let's go ahead and fire up ARD,
Apple Remote Desktop.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:43.400
Chris is going to go ahead
and add four machines.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.560
We have a wide variety.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:57.600
We have a 17-inch PowerBook, a 15-inch,
a tangerine, we have a lot of hardware.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:57.600
He's going to go ahead
and add those machines.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.710
So let's first,
what we want to do is let's say we've

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.000
got a problem with one of these machines.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:07.740
So let's go ahead and actually
control one of these machines.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:21.100
[Transcript missing]

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:44.600
[Transcript missing]

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
So the first question is going to be,
well, what if I've got 30

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
machines that I'm observing?

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
So when you get to more
than four machines,

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
what you actually do is you'll
start cycling through them.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
So if there were six there,
you'd get one, two, three, four,

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
and then it'd cycle to
the next two as well.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
One of the nice features that we
put into ARD 1.2 was the ability

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
to actually jump in and actually
look at one of these machines.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.580
Click on that, boom, you're right there.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
And then pull it back.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
Great.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
Okay, so I'm sort of a finicky IT guy,
and I like my machine

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
names to be a certain way.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
And right now they're all set to,
it looks like, English Lab.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
Actually,
I'm going to give it a different name.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
But again, we've got to be thinking
about multiple machines here.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:27.970
So what we're going to do here is we're
actually going to give it a new name.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.020
is the founder of Mathlab.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.850
Oh, that's right, it's in Mathlab now.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:33.880
I forgot completely.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.680
What you see here is happening
is he just typed in Mathlab.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.060
And each of them just
actually auto-incremented.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.720
And he did a massive change
of all the names right there.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.920
But again, be thinking about 20 machines.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.660
Be thinking about 50 machines here.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:54.380
So next up, we're going to do a
little asset management.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.780
I'm going to go ahead and do a system
info report against these four machines.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:10.900
[Transcript missing]

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:27.900
[Transcript missing]

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.150
So there he goes.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.150
You just do it to a known format.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.150
It's just out to the desktop.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.150
There you go.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.150
Right there.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.150
Again, four machines,
but imagine if this was 400.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.150
You've just done all of this
work from a single machine.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.840
Well,
next thing we're going to do is actually,

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:55.760
we're going to actually push
some bits onto these machines.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.550
Chris has a thing called
Developer Essentials on

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.620
this machine right here.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.210
What he's going to do is he's actually
going to go ahead and deploy this

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.490
set of information to these machines.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.430
What you saw there is he just dragged
and dropped it to the set of machines.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.500
It's asking him right now
about where he wants to put it.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.500
And it's the same relative location.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.500
And there it goes.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.450
Aha, it's already there,
so we're going to replace

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.500
the ones that are there.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.380
And it's going and starting to copy them.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:32.100
[Transcript missing]

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.830
So next thing we're going to do,
one of the things we have

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.840
is there's a lot of software
updates coming out all the time.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.340
And one of the things you want to do is
you want to take these software updates,

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.160
you want to push them
out to a set of machines.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.620
So what Chris is going to do now is
he's going to fire a software update up,

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.980
and he's going to pull
down a small update.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:36:07.600
[Transcript missing]

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:16.200
[Transcript missing]

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:20.860
is going to actually move it onto
these machines using one of the new

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.870
features in Apple Remote Desktop 1.2.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.680
So what he's going to go ahead and do,
after he moves it into the finder,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.220
is he's actually going to go ahead...

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.920
When he gets to Apple desktop,
eventually.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.290
There we go.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.120
Okay, so one of the new features is
actually install a package.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.120
So again, 50 machines, 100 machines.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.120
What we want to do here is actually
going to do an install there.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.120
Keep an eye on the status.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.120
First off, it's copying it,
it's broadcasting out

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.120
to all the machines.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:37:16.300
[Transcript missing]

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.490
I'm guessing those are the iBooks?

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:18.980
The iBooks.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.460
Okay.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:32.700
[Transcript missing]

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.090
Still going.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.090
Is that one still installing?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.090
All done.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.090
Is that the tangerine?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.090
Okay.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.090
I'm going to go ahead and reboot.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.090
You're going to hear this noise here that
I'm sure is going to be very familiar.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.560
coming offline.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.990
And sounds good.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.710
So what we did there is we just did,
again, a small example of doing

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.460
some management with ARD,
Apple Remote Desktop,

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.780
and showed off some of the verbs
that we have built into the system.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.510
There's a bunch more,
and I encourage you to

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.230
take a look at that.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.560
And it should be a lot easier
for you to do so because we

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.730
actually built the agent in.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.210
So thank you, Chris.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.300
Okay, so that was the
Apple Remote Desktop demo.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.620
Keep your eye on this space.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.080
There's lots of fun things
happening in this space.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.460
So, wrap up.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.170
This is a holy grail demo that I would
have loved to give you guys if we had

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.440
the time to actually be able to do it.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.070
What I would have loved
to do is actually pull a,

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.620
do what you all do all day,
is pull a new machine out of a box,

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:51.170
set it up, hold down the N key,
have an automatically network

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:56.080
install that I've built previously,
start to install automatically,

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.030
have the network, have everything set up
on that machine for you,

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.730
so that you don't have to do anything
other than hold down the N key.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.290
So when the user actually gets a machine,
they fire it up,

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.540
they're just sitting there
at their login window,

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.930
they can use their name and password,
and you didn't have to do anything other

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.790
than build that one image for them.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.690
I think that would be a
really compelling demo,

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.810
and I think one of the things
that you should know now is

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.590
that using these technologies,
you have the ability to do that.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.560
So, key points that we have.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.150
I think what we're doing is we're working
on the best tools and technologies

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.710
to manage Macintosh hardware.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.140
I think what we're showing off here
today is we're showing off that

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.000
they're designed for flexibility.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:41.870
Because again, all of you, 35,000,
all of you have a different management

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.250
policy and we need to be able to
provide tools and technologies

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.080
for you to be able to do that.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:50.690
And again, these are built in to
Panther and Panther Server.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.410
So it's already out there and
I encourage you to give them a try.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.480
Just so you know,
there's a lot of other sessions

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.790
which actually support us.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.700
Directory services relative to
managed desktop is really important.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.470
I realize a lot of these
may have already occurred.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.600
So I encourage you to look at
the slides or review these.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:11.580
Building applications
for managed networks.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.460
We'll be showing off mobile
accounts on that tomorrow.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.590
That's tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.190
Authentication.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.930
Again, this already occurred.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.000
So I encourage you to look at
the slides or review these.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Building applications
for managed networks.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.000
We'll be showing off mobile
accounts on that tomorrow.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.000
That's tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Authentication.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Again, this already occurred.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.380
occurred, but it's something I encourage
you to take a look at.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.380
Here's our contact information
if you want to come find us.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.740
Here's some great resources
of resources up there.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.100
What I'd like to do now is I'd like
to invite some of the rest of the

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.950
team up here to actually come up here
and answer some questions for us.
