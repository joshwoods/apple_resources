00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.370
QuickTime Media Skins.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.240
My name is Glenn Bullich.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.290
I work in the QuickTime product
marketing group,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.980
and we're very, very,
very lucky to have the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.340
two presenters here today.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.420
Very, very, very fortunate indeed.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.680
So many of you obviously know
what QuickTime Media Skins are,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.580
and we really thought that this
particular session we could present

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.090
to you probably some of the largest
media events out on the web in

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.260
QuickTime wrapped in media skins,
and the two people that we

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.440
have to present today drove
the teams that delivered that.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.110
So what I'll do is I'll just give,
we're going to do about 30

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.200
minutes for each of them,
and then we'll do some Q&A afterwards.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.520
It's really important if we do.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.750
If you do want to ask some questions of
these folks and some of the other people

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.520
in the audience who supported them,
that you do walk up to the mic because

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.670
the questions will be clearly translated,
and that way we can have it as a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.160
record for everyone to use on the
DVD and on the VOD afterwards.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.820
So originally with Fallon, Minneapolis,
Mark Sandau drove the team that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.930
delivered the BMW Films experience
over the last couple of years,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.640
and we're really thrilled to have him.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.240
And Lori Schwartz with
Zentropy Partners has driven.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.810
We've done an incredible amount
of work with notable companies

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.590
like Reebok from Los Angeles,
and so we're going to have both

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.380
of them present in reverse order,
and we'll start with Lori.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.260
So thank you for coming,
and I hope you enjoy.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:03:57.800
[Transcript missing]

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.790
The first case study, Reebok,
is what we call the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.230
Reebok Experts Network.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.300
Basically, Reebok came to us and said,
"Look, we have all these master trainers.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.840
They're fitness experts,
and we'd like an opportunity

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.830
to show them off.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.700
These are the people that
invented Step Reebok.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.890
We've got all this cool video content.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.940
We have interviews with them.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.970
We have images.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.900
We have text.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.800
We want to figure out a
way to house all this.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.660
So let's build something in
Flash," because everybody

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.290
was familiar with Flash.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.130
They were also looking for something
that could compete with Nike and

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.240
some of their other competitors,
because all their other competitors were

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.290
doing really interactive Flash sites.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.470
So because we had done these
demos with QuickTime skins,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.310
our creative group said, "Well,
why not house all of these really

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.300
great assets in a media skin?

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.030
It's a perfect place,
because QuickTime is, after all,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.770
a bucket of content,
to put all this cool stuff." So our

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.300
solution was to build a master
trainer skin to house eight...

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.300
eight pieces of trainer information,
basically.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.240
So the first thing that we did
was we built a pretty intricate

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.180
and detailed user experience,
information architecture flow.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.650
And this was really important,
because there were... there

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.300
are actually eight different
skins within this larger skin,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300
and there are actually three
pieces of video content,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.290
each with three bandwidth choices.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.600
So it was a lot of material to
house inside of one piece and could

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.300
get very complicated and at times,
very complicated.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.300
So we built a user experience chart here,
and you can just see,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.240
and I'm sorry the images
aren't a little bigger.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.630
And the final execution is over here,
and you can see there was a global nav

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.570
established just so everybody would have
a place to go and a real detailed spill

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.300
down into how this thing would work.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.300
So let me give you a little demo of it.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.240
Oh, terribly sorry.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.030
And some of you may have seen this.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.000
This was out about two years ago,
I think, maybe a year and a half ago.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.770
How many-- have many of
you seen this before?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.740
A few of you?

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.280
I know my Live Stage Pro guys did,
because this was actually

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.210
built in Live Stage Pro,
which I believe has a sale

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.860
going on right now at the show,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.460
I'm not a Live Stage employee.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.580
OK, so can we go to the iBook, please?

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.560
Great.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.830
Okay, so let me just show you
how that guy launched,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.220
really simple.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.140
So this actually lived off of
Reebok's website in a special

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.120
section of their Reebok University.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.060
It's branded to Reebok,
and we have a little flash navigation

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.580
here with eight trainers on here.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.980
There's a link to go
back to this main page.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.600
There's also a link to go directly to
a URL where you could find a trainer in

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.440
your area by putting in your zip code.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.660
So the idea here is to create a
really cool marketing experience,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.450
but also to create something
that does something.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.900
So they wanted to drive people
to their trainer website.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.810
Okay, so let's click on a trainer here.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.300
Okay, so, Gin Miller was famous for
inventing Step Reebok,

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.180
so we created a skin here
that highlights Step Reebok,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.130
and there's three questions
that she answered,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.920
so user would click on one of
these questions and it would

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.720
bring up some video content.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:30.540
My favorite aspect of training now,
at my age, at 45, is to release stress.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.200
If I've had a hard day,
or I've been at the computer all day,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.420
or I've had a hard home call,
just try to get people different

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.980
things or answers to questions.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.020
I need to get out the door,
find my credibility, and go for one.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.270
There's also bios here so that people
can find out more about the trainer.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.990
Now, interestingly enough,
there were a couple of interesting things

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.280
that came out of building this thing,
and we can go back to the PowerPoint.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.760
The client wanted a streaming
experience because two years ago,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.280
streaming was like, "Whoo,
streaming!" We were actually pushing

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.140
for a progressive download experience
because we knew that progressive

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.450
content is better for like one-minute,
two-minute pieces of video,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.450
but they were, you know, really,
we want streaming.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.000
So we went ahead and we built a
streaming version of the Reebok Skin,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.490
but what happened with the programming
was that when the video ended,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.380
it needed to trigger a snapback
to the questions that you saw.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.470
So the streaming version actually
had a terrible user interface because

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.200
you'd have to wait a long time until
that buffer signal ended and it

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.420
would snap back to the questions.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.710
So we ended up going back and
building another version of it that

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.280
was progressive and then getting
the client to sign off on that.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.460
So it ended up being a lot more fun.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.830
It ended up being a lot more
production time and a lot of

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.940
aggravation that didn't need to happen
if we could have sold the client

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.900
originally on the progressive idea.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.540
And what this really did was it helped
me to formulate some best practices

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.200
that we present to the client up front.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.970
You know, more officially saying to them,
"Look, we've looked at streaming and

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.320
progressive and how to really build
this experience in the best light,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.260
and for shorter pieces of content,
for things like this,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.460
it's better to go with progressive.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.550
For other longer, chapterized things,
it's better to go with streaming."

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.090
So this really helped us
educate ourselves and in

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.190
the future educate our clients,
and that was a big lesson

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.300
that we learned here.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.940
We also learned that we had to
have more QA in the project because

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.180
we had milestones set throughout,
but we didn't have enough milestones.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.590
And so sometimes our programmer
would go off and do some things,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.620
then we'd take a look at it and we'd
see he'd gone too far down the path and

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.460
we'd have to go back a few steps again.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.610
So that was a big lesson for us to
schedule in more client reviews,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.460
more QA, and to really get best
practices out there.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.460
Let me go forward from here.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.600
Also the other thing that we
kind of really figured out is

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.480
that whenever we're dealing with
media skins and new technology,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.460
we still have to talk about the brand,
go over the creative brief,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.460
provide stats, metrics,
context for the client.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.090
So just because we're doing
something kind of new and groovy,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.150
we still have to go back to
all the methods that we used

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:22.460
for a traditional web page.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:23.350
So we're going to talk
about the web page,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.420
the web development,
and online marketing.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.100
And the more that we saturate this
process with our traditional practices,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.350
the more that this stuff
becomes real to everybody.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.460
It becomes safer.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.620
It's not something scary
to go out and build,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.420
and the client feels more secure.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.200
So that was another thing that we
learned is that we really have to

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.820
sell this in the same way that we
sell in everything and not make

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.460
it so intimidating to a client.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.420
Could I have the real-time?

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.930
These are some of the questions
that after this process we came

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.480
up with whenever we try and
sell something to a client.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.140
What was the original business
concept that launched the

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.500
product or technology concept?

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.980
What business value was
it designed to impart?

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.290
In this case,
it was a marketing experience.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.080
What is the return on investment?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.770
Well, we're trying to drive clicks to a
specific section on the website,

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.750
so that's what that URL was.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.640
What's the return on investment?

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.120
Has it proven successful?

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.630
And when we looked at the numbers,
and I think specifically when it

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.750
was listed on the QuickTime site,
we had about a 10% increase to the

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.080
site when this thing first launched.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.230
And then why or why not?

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:33.700
And always to do a postpartum on it to
see how you really did on this thing.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.300
Okay, so let's jump into the
Nautica case study.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.850
Nautica specifically is a great
example because it shows how we sort

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.210
of had a turn in how we're looking
at media skins and also how we're

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.710
selling media skins to our clients.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.150
They came to us and they asked us to
design and build a website that had

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.170
the following objectives in mind.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.440
They wanted something to
combine all of their brands.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.480
And they also had a great
deal of offline video footage,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.540
footage from events, from, you know,
models and fashion shows.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.930
And they also do a lot of co-branding
things with sporting events,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.860
with sailing and things like that.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.860
So they had all this video
content that was just sitting

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.600
there and wasn't being used.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.320
And they were thinking, well,
how can we use this?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.080
So once again,
we pitched the idea of building a media

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.580
skin that would house all of these assets
and put this media skin on the site and

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.650
we would call it the Nautica magazine.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.940
And the ultimate objective for them was
to collect emails because they wanted

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.490
to develop a more robust user database.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.700
So we consolidated all this content
onto one section on the website

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.320
called the Nautica Magazine,
and then we built what they

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.620
were calling the NS83TV,
which was a customized QuickTime media

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.240
player which housed all the assets.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.220
And we also included a
registration box on the home page,

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.600
and we actually ended up
collecting about 8,000 emails

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.540
two months after it launched.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.780
Now the interesting thing about
this skin that's different from the

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.070
Reebok skin is the way we sold it.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.610
In this case, we sold this as a desktop
application that could actually grow,

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.470
that you could scale out as
more content became available,

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.690
that we could turn into something
that lived and breathed and stayed on

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.310
a desktop so that the user could have
this persistent Nautica experience.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.040
And one of the ways that we
encouraged the idea of this to the

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.270
client was to build a flash nav,
and so that as more

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.470
content became available,
we could grow it.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.040
So we started to grow out this flash nav.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.700
So let me launch the skin for you.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.000
Is everybody having a good time so far?

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.810
Good?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:44.890
Okay.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.590
It's 3 o'clock.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.900
I know it's -- sugar's dropping.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.840
Did everyone have some candy
to get their energy up?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.640
Okay.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.790
That's important.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.790
Okay.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.790
So --

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.290
That's just a reference file that we use.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.190
So this is actually our Nautica skin,
and it's not the sexiest

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.020
skin in the world,
I admit, but it's still on the

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.200
Nautica site right now,
and I have the client calling me and

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.740
asking to put more content on it,
and I just think that is a tremendous.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.980
So here's the flash nav up there,
and what we do is,

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.220
as more fashion shows and
content becomes available,

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:24.150
we just expand this global nav,
so they don't have to keep paying for

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.570
a rebuild of something cool and funky.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.000
We have something that can grow
with the brand and with the client.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.490
Let me show you some content.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.180
So that's Daisy Fuentes,
so that really makes a lot of

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.120
people happy to see Daisy Fuentes.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.970
And we did sell this as
something that also we could add

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.550
a chatting functionality to it,
we could add email collection

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.700
right inside of this skin.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.070
We talked about all the powerful
things that you can leverage with

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.620
QuickTime and with XML and the fact
that you could dig into a database.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.730
Now we haven't gone
there yet with this skin,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.360
but that was part of the sell and
the client really bought off on that.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.370
We also have the traditional small,
medium, and large bandwidth choices,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:14.270
and obviously all these buttons work.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.850
Now, the other interesting
thing that happened,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.210
and this is another best practice lesson,
is that the client discovered

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.960
iMovie and decided to start
compressing their own video,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.840
which, you know, is all great for getting
Apple products out there,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.490
but a terrible thing,
when you receive a 56K

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.220
file for 56K compression,
that's 320 by 240.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.160
So, I had to actually,
in a good way with the account manager,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.170
guide the client through the
fact that we can't control,

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.360
you know, quality,
we can't give quality assurance unless

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.680
we're the ones controlling the assets.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.430
So, now the client sends us, you know,
beta or DV cam or whatever it

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.260
is that they're working with,
and they let us handle

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.730
all the compression.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.140
And, again, that's a best practice thing.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.400
That's really educating the client on
how this process works and the best

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.180
way to deliver the best experience.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.290
Because they don't want their video
looking like... They don't want their

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.300
video looking like crap on their website.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.300
And this thing can also,
and I don't know how many

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.640
of you are familiar with it,
but it's QuickTime,

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.630
so it can be laid off to CD-ROM.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.650
The reference file for
this can be emailed out.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.170
So, it's a very viral experience as well,
and everybody likes to hear

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.940
viral in this community.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.480
Not in regular life, but in this,
everybody likes it.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.610
So, can we go back to the PowerPoint?

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.500
Thank you.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.130
So the other thing that I've been
finding in building these skins is to

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.460
really leverage press opportunities
because these haven't been done

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.380
yet the way they should be done,
I feel.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.490
And so when we launch one,
we get great grassroots marketing,

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.190
and I turned to Apple, actually,
to help me do that.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.100
And so every time I launch
an interesting media skin,

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.750
I get help from them,
and they put it on What's On,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.930
if they think it's interesting,
What's On, in their What's On section,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.080
and also in their QuickTime.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.600
And so I've been able to get a
lot of people to come in and say,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.850
hey, I want to know what's on your skin,
and I can't tell you how powerful that

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.970
is for my Nautica client to hear that
they're getting free press and getting

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.230
thousands and thousands of consumers
out there reading about their skin and

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.910
then getting driven to their website.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.320
So it's very powerful.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.290
And the fact that it's so powerful
actually got the global manager,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.110
the global head of Zentropy,
to write a quote in a press release,

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.540
and we sent out a press release
about this Nautica skin.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.000
And this was huge because this
is a guy that two years ago,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.820
refused to have anything
to do with QuickTime.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.570
And because one of the things that we're
doing as an interactive advertising

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:45.460
agency is looking at ways to leverage
client assets and to really grow a

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.200
brand in a lot of different ways,
he was so excited about this,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.160
he now sees the potential of it,
and he's talking about

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.580
QuickTime all the time.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.620
And I just remember
the first time he said,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.880
we could do QuickTime.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.580
I dropped whatever I was holding
because it had been a two-year journey

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.540
for me to get him to feel that way.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.020
So everybody now is really... behind
the development of this stuff.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.550
So where we are right now as a company,
as an interactive agency,

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.890
is looking into solutions for our
clients that really highlight branding,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.400
that highlight conversion.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.280
And what I mean by conversion is if you
have a consumer who's never heard of the

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:26.820
brand or who's not a fan of the brand,
experiences that attract them,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.470
that get them hooked on,
that get them seduced and become

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.200
lifelong members of this brand.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.020
And also applications that collect
data and information and that

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.020
stay persistent in a user's mind
and perhaps on their desktop.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.720
So desktop applications and the
use of QuickTime Media Skins

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.720
for me is just an all-around
great solution for these ideas.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.490
Also, everything that you build
in this can be tracked.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.530
So for a lot of our clients,
they want to see numbers on

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.250
how these things are doing.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.510
So you can directly
look on a daily basis,

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.080
see what people are doing,
see where in the skin

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.140
they're interacting,
what content.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200
And then you can also look at
the content that they're using.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:03.840
So you can look at the content
that they're using and see where

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.570
in the skin they're interacting,
what content is exciting them and

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.190
really leverage all of that information.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.940
And the other thing also to be aware
of is right now what's happening in

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.480
the living room with cable operators,
with video on demand and with TiVo

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.490
and other PVR solutions is pieces of
video content is really becoming a

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.200
much stronger player for advertisers.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.000
What used to be video that just,
you know,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.560
stayed on the cutting room floor
is now becoming significant

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.130
content that people are showing.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.430
And with living rooms becoming wireless
and the opportunity for a user to have

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:38.410
a dual screen experience where maybe
they're watching some kind of television

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.900
show or a game show or something in the
living room and then they have video

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.070
on their lap or some sort of experience
on their lap on their Mac or PC,

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.190
that becomes very, very powerful.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.990
So that's why this,
the use of video and media

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.860
skins are so significant to me.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.410
And lastly, I just wanted to mention,
and this is revisiting

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.180
this GM demo that we did.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.040
GM ByPower,
which is one of our biggest clients,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.630
is actually a website
that drives dealer leads.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.810
It basically,
a user goes on there and has a

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.360
choice of all the different GM cars,
and they actually get

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.930
drilled down to a dealer.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.270
So if we could go over
to the iBook again.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.990
So actually, if any of you are in
the market for a car,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.090
please go to GMPiPower.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.360
Let me show you this.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.000
So this is something that
we built two years ago,

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.500
but it's come up again as something
that now the client wants to pay for.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.510
And that's because GMPiPower is
really interested in tools that allow

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.940
the user to interact with different
assets that will help sell the car,

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.000
basically, and get them interested.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.290
So this skin was built as
a place to look at and say,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.880
"Hey,
I want to look at all of GM's SUVs."

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.970
So here is basically a content well of
all of the content for GM-branded SUVs.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.880
So a user could basically launch this,
either on the GMPiPower site

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.980
or the GM.com site,
choose an SUV that they're interested in,

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.190
and then we have an application here
that houses all the assets so they

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.500
can find out more about that car,
including commercials.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.070
. Tiger Woods is a Buick's boy right now,
so we put all the

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.500
Tiger Woods commercials in here.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.500
So you think... Where is it?

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:24.500
I don't see it.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.500
. . .

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.540
You know, this is like a million
dollar commercial or,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.570
you know, gazillion dollar commercial,
however much these things cost,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.220
and now we're repurposing it
and using it in this world,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.640
which is a great way to repurpose assets.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.450
Also, our friend VR,
so the user can really see that

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.960
car and in the inside of the car.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.860
So if a major corporation like GM is
actually really starting to see the

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.400
importance and the sexiness of this,
it's really exciting.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.940
So look for something like this to
be out in the next six months or so,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.540
and maybe it'll be something that
will actually launch off of GM.com,

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.320
which is actually a QuickTime site.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.300
And that's it.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.260
- Am I on?

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.290
I'm here to talk to you about the hire.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.400
My name is Mark Sandau.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.020
I am the interactive creative
director for an agency in

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.030
Minneapolis called Carmichael Lynch.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.890
And these two slides were
in the example I was set,

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.010
so I just filled in a little overview
for objectives of the project,

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.010
creating an interface,
a little bit about the

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.150
execution of some of our ideas,
and some of the success we

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.970
found with this project.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:49.340
So I'm just going to lead
you through one case study.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.200
Go to here.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.840
I never know if people
know about this or not,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.840
but sometimes I feel
stupid asking the question,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.640
other times I don't want to assume,
but have anybody seen the films?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.230
Is that something you guys
are kind of familiar with?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.620
So, real briefly then,
this is a series of short films

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.860
that happened over two seasons.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.080
The first season was pretty successful,
so they came back with three more.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.020
And they're all about this
guy who is the driver.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.650
And what's kind of interesting
to note is there was a different

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.850
director for each film.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.130
So, there's kind of a different
take placed on all these.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:30.520
And our job was to take whatever
they do and get it out to the world.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.960
My part being purely interactive stuff.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:39.500
So here's a quick trailer if you
guys haven't seen this before.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.490
There is audio on this.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:42.490
I probably should have.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:53.810
Just imagine it being the
best audio you've ever heard.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.700
and Here's a list of some of the
directors that we worked with.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.320
Well, this is the list of
directors we worked with,

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.080
so you can get an idea of some
of the caliber of some of these

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.860
people that we're working with,
and this is kind of important when

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.820
I talk about some of the other stuff
we've tried to ask them what to do.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.800
The distribution of the films,
as I mentioned, was on the internet,

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.410
but we also had broadcasts.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:38.550
There was actually a television channel
on DirecTV dedicated to BMW for a while,

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.500
even as far as in-flight
movies and disc-based media,

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.200
so it got passed around quite a bit.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.800
Goals and Objectives.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.860
This was our, I guess,
working brief as to what we were

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.100
going to try to do with Season 2,
and I'm going to talk specifically

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.120
about the second season.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.420
Obviously, A number one is excellent
quality presentation of the film.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.640
Whatever we did was just
to present the films.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.580
We could not mess with that.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:09.100
But we also needed to create a really
compelling and engaging interface.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.140
Just to, you know,
not to be outdone by the films,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.910
we needed to make our
piece just as engaging.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.500
Another side piece was always
increasing distribution,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.180
and I'm going to talk a
little bit about that later.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.240
And again, one of the things that
was in the original brief,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.780
even from Season 1,
was unique delivery of a

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.510
unique piece of content,
I think.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.320
In Season 1, we kind of did it,
but in Season 2,

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320
I think we did a much better job.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.050
And of course,
reliable and stable technology.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.510
One of the quotes then is,
sometimes they summarize this

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.950
for you as you get this brief,
it said,

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.440
"Must perform like a BMW," and I always
thought that was pretty interesting.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.620
I don't know if that
always gets played out,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.250
but the interface, not only the content,
but the interface is

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.070
really a brand extension,
and if this thing doesn't

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.740
perform very well,
it doesn't shine a

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.220
very good light on BMW.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.150
DV light controls and special
features also made it.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.320
Here's two slides about Season 1
and things we had changed.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.500
Season 1, we basically made a VCR,
and we had all these different tapes.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.160
So you download the player,
and you plug in these tapes.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.180
And we thought, well,
that's kind of a neat idea.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.970
You can collect these things,
and it's a pretty familiar interface.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.030
And it looked a little bit like this,
where we had these little,

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.240
these little chicklets would fill
in with these snapshots of the film

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.350
if you had downloaded that piece.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.740
But what we had found out was,
that wasn't simple enough.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.740
It got confusing,
there was multiple downloads.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.020
So we took everything from
that previous statement about

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.210
what these films needed to do,
and then we took all our learning from

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.730
Season 1 and we came up with this.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.830
We really needed to simplify the player.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.820
We needed to make this easy to
use with no instructions at all.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.700
I think for as many
times as you hear that,

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.330
that gets lost so often that it's good
to reread that over and over again.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.640
We need to reduce the physical size.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.110
One of the things that we noticed
as these things get popular,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.360
people download them a lot.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.380
And we ended up paying a lot of server
fees trying to distribute this stuff.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:05.240
Last season was in QuickTime 5,
Sorenson 3, and we thought if we went to,

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.970
or the first season was in QuickTime 4,
this season was in QuickTime 5,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.110
so we did a little math.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.190
We also tried to reduce the screen
dimensions of the films to bring them

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.720
down from this funny size of 800 by 340.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.700
I don't know if you guys have
ever tried to work on anything

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.480
bigger than that magical 720,
but it's not really worth it.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.000
We thought we could do it,
but no one noticed when we went to 720.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.900
And then viral distribution,
it was kind of interesting

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.540
to hear you say that.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.610
So again,
try to save a little money by letting

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.130
other people host our content.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.360
So we came up with this great idea
that we thought the film is the player.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.500
So each player will be its own film,
and each film will be its own player.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.440
And if people want to collect them,
they can do that,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.690
but it won't be this VCR type of system.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.410
So when we end up with this,
basically what I'm trying to say is

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.500
we ended up with a QuickTime solution.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.700
The first version was Director,
and we had a Flash layer,

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.030
and we brought all these
QuickTime films in,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.460
but it just wasn't the
system that we needed.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.000
This system ended up just being so
much less complicated to develop.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.120
And this is kind of my little
plug for QuickTime and for Apple,

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.990
because it just worked out
fantastically well for us.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.000
We had one environment instead of
two because we had a binary file.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.990
We had such less technical support.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.310
It was just something that you
could really measurably... That's

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.710
information I can't release,
but I wish I could,

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.760
because you could just
see it drop so much,

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.000
the number of emails,
and even from the client, like,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.350
"How did this work?" or "What
happened to this film?" or "Where

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.080
do these films go after I download
them?" This was such an easy,

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.210
simple solution that
you just had one file,

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.000
and you could keep track of that.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.010
And then a less complex interface,
and I'll talk a little bit

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.800
about how we came to the
interface that you'll see it in.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.810
Another thing, I don't know if you
guys have run into this,

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.820
but we had a lot of trouble with people
trying to download these at work.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.830
Just because, you know,
they have their broadband connection

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.920
at work and it's lunchtime.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.480
But it would not make it
through these firewalls,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.250
our little director solution.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.640
Here, basing it on QuickTime,
it's all part of the browser.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.250
However they get this information,
it's not us.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.330
It's not our fault anymore.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.490
We don't have to handle that ever again.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.220
That was a lot of time
spent just on that.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.560
Viral distribution,
we made a real conscious effort

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.140
this time to make smaller files
because they're easier to send.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.900
Again, binary files so people didn't have
to post if it was a Mac or a PC,

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.140
and then any viral distribution
is free distribution in our mind.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.690
So we really encouraged it.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:31.810
Nobody could put up a branded site that
tried to take control of the content,

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:31.890
but certainly if it was passed around,
that was fine with us.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.540
And then I'll talk a little bit about how
we tracked our viral film views later.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.040
So here's the demo.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.150
If we go to the demo machine,
I will play for you what our

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.380
skin ended up looking like.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.360
So here's our piece with our music.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.100
Right down here is where
the slider will develop.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.800
These are our play controls and
then a little bit of navigation.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800
That's about all we had.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.430
Everything will happen
in the same interface.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.000
You're not really moving to different
pages or anything like that.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.780
We hope that the play
button was pretty obvious.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.840
Clicking on play takes
you right to the film.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.400
Over here is our volume control.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.870
We had this neat little system
that we just had one slider,

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.140
but it had multiple functions.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.150
We can change it to base,
and now I'm controlling the base.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.080
Change of treble,
and now we're changing the treble.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.380
Again,
really trying to simplify this interface.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.160
Over here,
you can see we had a scan backwards,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.190
and we had scan forward.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.870
But if I hit pause,
now they turned to step.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.990
So again,
trying to really simplify this interface

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.780
and not have a lot of controls.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.850
We found this just to be much more
easy for people to use than season one,

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.400
that we had to download the piece.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.500
Here, we were going straight to it.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.670
We were one click away from
watching the film at any time.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.140
Little section about the Roadster.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.700
I'll show you some of
this cool stuff later.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.930
And then we have a little section
in here for credits where you

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.100
can click on people's names.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.830
So we had accomplished everything
that we had done in Season 1,

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:17.500
but this was all done
through a skinned player.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.370
Back to the slides for me, please.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.090
And those are still out to
download at bmwfilms.com.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.940
All the films are out there now
for season one and for season two.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.540
So here's a brief rundown of what we had.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.910
We had to do everything in
that great cinema format,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.720
2-3-5-1.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.250
We had a full-screen video option,
so clicking on the full-screen option

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.220
in the corner would black out the entire
screen and play the video in the center,

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.770
which was a great
accomplishment thanks to...

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.140
A few people working very hard,
like Chris Stock and Guy.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.940
We had director's commentary in there.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.760
We had biographies and filmographies.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.000
We had our sound control.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.030
We had a whole gallery section.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.830
We had closed captioning in there,
which is really amazing.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.860
And we had web links that all
exist in that little piece,

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.500
which I just think is a
lot of content for that.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.340
Executing the idea.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.180
Here's a little process
that we go through,

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.630
and it sounded pretty similar
to what Lori had talked about.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.160
We start with a schematic.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.030
If it's not appropriate
in this situation,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.940
we go to a wireframe.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.130
We do things that are called mood boards,
and I'll show you what those look like.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.060
And of course,
we have to take into consideration

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.430
now that we have those done,
what our fonts and our colors and

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.080
what our graphic standards might be.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.640
And finally, at that point,
we go to creating a layout.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.870
I think that's really important that
you do all these steps before and before

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.710
you start working against the layout.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.420
And of course, some user testing.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.280
We'll get to the final piece.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.090
Here's our version of a wireframe.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.330
This is something that we present
to the client to give them an idea

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.620
of what the content is on the page.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.760
Sometimes I present this idea and people
have never ever seen it before and other

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.880
people have different names for it.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.870
I can't remember the
name that you would use,

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.120
but... Oh, yeah.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.520
Do people use these?

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.160
I was just curious.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.040
Do you guys do this very
often or once in a while?

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.740
I find it really helpful,
especially if some clients are

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.190
just not able to absorb those three
different pieces of information.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.270
If you can just say, okay,
this is purely the buttons and

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.560
the switches and controls that
will be on your interface.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.570
That's all you have to worry about.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.160
Don't think about fonts, colors, content,
anything.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.380
Just look at this for me.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.590
It's really helpful.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.220
Second step is these mood
boards that we call them.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.330
This is us collecting pieces of
information to give the client an idea

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.810
of what this thing is going to look like.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.750
I had a picture of the room,
and I should have brought it,

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.010
that just has hundreds of these
things clipped to the wall.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.590
This is just a few of the stuff.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.980
These are kind of these MP3 skins
that we had found that we liked.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.640
There might be just little hints
and pieces of things that you see.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.920
It could be clips from movies.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.870
It could be magazines, books,
whatever you find in the newspaper.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.570
We just keep collecting stuff.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.820
You get it on a napkin.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.650
Hey, that was kind of cool
the way that thing moved.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.060
Just keep collecting stuff.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.240
In the end, you kind of color it down
to a few different pieces.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.740
This is a great way of quickly showing
your client kind of some ideas of

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.700
what this thing might look like
without you spending a real lot of

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.520
time on actually making layouts yet.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.490
Here's just a couple quotes that I like.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.400
Simplify, simplify,
make everything as simple as possible,

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.110
but not simpler,
is a quote that we use quite often.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.140
Again, that's kind of my credo
when looking at work that's

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.060
presented to me by my designers.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.930
I think hierarchy of
information is pretty important.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.210
I think we did a really good job in
the situation that we didn't have

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.720
to have our step forward and our
scan buttons visible all the time.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.110
We thought if you're playing the movie,
then you probably don't want a

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.320
quick pause and step forward.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.010
You probably want to scan and vice versa.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.000
And I think it's important,
a fundamental of design is to only

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.420
present the information that's
really important at that moment.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:46.520
Know what to leave out.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.690
I don't know if Steve Jobs actually
said that first,

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.720
but I've heard it mentioned in this
Time interview that he had about OS X,

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.940
and I always thought that was
a great way of putting it.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.720
Use conventions found in
the interactive language.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.180
We found it really helpful just to
make that play button a triangle,

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.580
even though other people have
tried a lot of different things.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.940
I think I've got a lot to worry about,
and I think I might just go with

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.540
some of those so I can move on.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.900
And then we also had to make a template
that was appropriate for all films,

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.840
and I thought that was kind of an
interesting challenge that not only

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.400
did we have this piece for one film,
but we had to make it work

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.140
for eight different films,
being these different directors

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.840
of different types of movies.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.760
So we started with those two things.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.640
We had shown them a mood board.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.100
We had got sign-off on
some of these things.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.240
We knew some of our standards.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.790
We kind of knew what
the posters looked like.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.600
So we moved to the
Flame Surface QuickTime skin,

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.200
which was based on the
shapes of the BMW Z4,

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.520
the car that was featured
in those three films.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.630
We tended to call this the movie theater.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.160
That's part of the reason why it goes
black when you get to the movie and

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.120
you're actually watching the film.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.640
The kind of interesting note,
the original concept was done in 3D,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.320
but we were never able to achieve
exactly what we wanted to do.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.300
So we ended up creating the
whole thing in Photoshop.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.080
This photographer,
I'll have these URLs up later if you ever

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.890
want to work with some of these guys.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.100
They're just amazing,
had created this whole

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.500
thing with photography.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.140
So here's what the Z4 looks like.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.720
Notice the rondelle,
the side marker light where the

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.710
BMW logo is and how that's shaped.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.000
And kind of notice the taillights,
the way they're sculpted

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.660
around the taillights.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.520
So we had taken some of those ideas
along with-- that's pretty dark--

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.940
where the backlight of the cowling
sits and where the gauges are.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.940
And here's our player.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.680
And you can kind of see some
of those same tones and ideas

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.200
making their way into our piece.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:58.190
Music, I think that's really important.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
I thought I'd just play this
little clip of music that we had.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
I think sometimes you run into these
skins and these other pieces and they

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
just have this little four-second loop,
you know,

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
they just keep going over again,
hoping you don't notice.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
And this is such a great little
piece of music that I think

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
sometimes it doesn't get appreciated.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
Again, based on the... No.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.210
I was kind of above the standard,
and I think sometimes those

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.300
things don't show to the surface,
but those attention

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.040
to details eventually,
when you get them all right,

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.460
really makes for a really nice piece.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.790
Motion VR is this great
idea we came up with,

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:41.480
where we took a 50-second
movie clip of the Z4,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.690
and we made basically a traditional VR,
but in this case,

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:46.610
the vehicle's in motion.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.680
There were two VRs created.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.600
There was a front angle during the
daytime and a rear angle at night.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.720
And we were able to take this content,
kind of talking about what

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.880
Lori had mentioned about,
because it was QuickTime,

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.700
we were able to use this piece on a DVD.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.710
And we had a self-contained
QuickTime movie for this,

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.970
and then it was also embedded in the EFE.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.390
And I'm going to go to the demo right
now and show you what that looked like.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.200
Switch me over to the demo machine,
please.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:22.990
Here is the standalone version.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.800
I'm going to turn that down.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.000
But here we are,
moving through Las Vegas at

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.620
about 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.640
And it's still about 108 degrees.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:41.040
So we're shooting this,
and the user can watch the Z4 motion.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.910
We just thought there was something
really beautiful about watching

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.020
this car move and watching the
lights dance across the hood.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.720
So you can move through all
these different angles on demand,

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.310
and even on a sequence.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.120
Just like a VR, but in this case,
it's in motion.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:01.680
Is that actually separate
video practice on VR?

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.320
Exactly, yep.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:18.400
[Transcript missing]

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.930
Yeah, it's very much a workaround
in the background,

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.620
but very much the live
stage and a lot of work,

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.970
again,
from Guy and those guys helping us find

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.650
a system that we can stream all these,
run all these things at the same time

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:30.930
and be able to switch in between them.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.190
Back to the slideshow, please.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.300
That's also on the DVD.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.700
You can get a DVD of all these films,
and that piece is on there.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.490
Of course, it's full screen,
and it's big and beautiful.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.000
You can use your angle button,
which you never get to use on your DVD.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.900
I love that piece.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.300
So our Z4 MotionVR was
eight still cameras.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.670
Those are all still cameras that we shot.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.180
We didn't drive very fast,
and we rattled off a ton of still frames.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.410
They were mounted to this custom rig,
and I have a picture of that,

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:05.740
and I'll show you what it looks like.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.300
And we had a chase car falling behind.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.610
In the end,
we shot 64,000 frames of this stuff.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.520
It ended up for just
these two 50-second clips.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.080
We stitched, we call it stitched,
into these QuickTime movies,

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.840
and we used Apple QuickTime VR Studio,
which I believe is still in 9.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.920
I don't know if there's any chance.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.710
Anyway, moving that to 10,
that would be nice.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.870
And they were retouched with Photoshop to
try to take the bottom of the rig out,

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.600
and we used LiveStage and QScript to
control the layer switching.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:40.160
And here's what that rig looked like,
about as long as the car.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.060
It's kind of a close-up.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.190
about all the other things.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.790
Big, huge CF cards on those cameras so we
could try to snap as many frames as

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.330
possible before we could switch them out.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:59.440
We had rented every D1 camera
they had in Los Angeles for this.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:06.500
That's a great question.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.350
We shot a test in video,
and it ended up looking a lot like video.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.950
And I don't know exactly how,
but the still just looks

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.860
so much more beautiful,
and we knew we could use

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.560
a still frame to layer.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.550
We also found out that hanging as many
cameras as we wanted to need off the

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.920
back of that rig was really a pain
with their batteries and everything.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.310
But the still cameras were so
much more lighter and flexible

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.630
that we ended up going there.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.400
Shelley Ward is the name of the
company that built that rig,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.880
if you ever need a rig
for that type of stuff.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.900
Again, I think that's at the
end of my presentation.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.600
Those guys are amazing.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.140
They'll build you anything you want.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:46.740
I think so, but I think it would
have been a lot of work.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.460
I'm getting pretty close now.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.940
Interior VR, I don't know how many people
have worked with interior VR.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.440
I'm sure you're all familiar with it,
but I thought I'd just

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.080
show this real quick.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.990
The photography was done on a soundstage,
and the lighting is fixed

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:10.180
as the camera rotates,
which is kind of interesting.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:13.980
Here we are shooting
that on our soundstage.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:15.600
I think that's kind of a fun photo.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.990
People probably don't realize how
much lighting is done on these cars.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:22.500
You think you have just one light,
but that wasn't even our complete setup.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.280
I'm going to just show that real quick,
just because I think it's big

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.380
and beautiful and I want to...

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.340
Mark, with favor of photography,
shot this.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:42.070
And I just think it's some of
the nicest VR work I've seen.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:51.890
And then he had went out and shot
this bridge in one of the films.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.600
We shot at,
and so we did a lot of work to try to

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.680
marry up the films with its environment.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.390
Again, like that Las Vegas shot was,
I don't think I mentioned this,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.270
was used in one of the films too,
so we tried to do as many things

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.840
as we could so this whole thing
felt like a unified piece.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.980
And back to the slides.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.410
So, this goes without saying,
but so much of this stuff

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.000
was done in live stage,
but just to reiterate,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.030
we used a Flash layer really for
all our graphics and animation.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.180
We used it to control
the user interaction.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.380
We used it to pass the
user request to QScript,

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.900
and we really used QScript really
to control everything

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:32.620
that was QuickTime level.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.320
And I think that worked out really good,
making that decision,

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.670
which we didn't quite make right away,
but when we did,

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.340
I think it really worked out well.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.580
We said, hey, everything graphics,
everything that's user interaction

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.400
will handle with Flash.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.140
Everything that goes to the
workings of this whole thing,

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.760
we need to do in QScript.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.560
And just by notes,
it's all a new technology.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.950
It requires a lot of experimentation.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.760
I think a couple times we had
given up on that motion VR,

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.880
thinking we can't get this thing to work.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.370
And we had tried turning off
layers or enabling layers or

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.900
bringing them to the front,
and there's 20 different

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:02.900
ways to skin that.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.160
And we finally ended up
with something that works.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.320
So,
I guess my advice to you is try a few.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.340
Try a few different things,
because sometimes these

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.020
combinations of this newer
technology don't always work out.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.520
Um, and compression,
I think you all know this too,

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.470
is that compression's really a craft,
and good results come from a lot

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:27.050
of experiment and experimentation,
and, uh, and also the original source

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.820
material really helps if you can have
them try to shoot something that,

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.010
uh, that's able to compress,
and that's why I kind of showed

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.340
that director list before,
because we had had a few

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.340
conversations with some of these
directors trying to tell them,

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.420
like, you know, you need to shoot this
way so it compresses well.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.420
It was kind of an interesting
conversation to have when you have,

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:45.600
you know,

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:47.300
People like Ang Lee on
the end of the phone,

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.760
you know, he won an Academy Award.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.700
And I'm like, "Wow,
if you could cut it just a little less,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.070
that would be helpful."
That whip pan was really bad.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.280
And then we had Yu Sorenson III,
MP3 Audio, and Cleaner 6.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.600
Here's our success.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.600
I think this is kind of
our great little telltale.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.790
We have 40 million views as
the official number so far,

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.870
and you know the media that we got.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:16.220
Here's my favorite slide.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:20.060
There's season one, our director test,
and I love director.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.550
I grew up on director.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:22.700
That's all I did.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.070
It was on VideoWorks or
whatever when it first came out,

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:27.670
and that was my idea.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:32.590
But we had 29% of the people actually
downloading the piece and 71% streaming.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.480
Season two,
we went to the QuickTime solution,

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.070
and now we had 75% people downloading
these pieces and 25% streaming them.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.880
And I think that's an amazing
testament to some pretty unique

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:48.910
technology that's very stable and
makes your work look very good.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.980
Then my last little notes
about the dynamic player.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.700
We didn't get a chance to
get into this at this piece,

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:56.760
but I wish we would have.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.710
We did a little metrics collection,
so if these things

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:00.980
even got passed around,
they would call home just to let them

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.200
know that the film had been viewed,
and that's how we got an idea

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.230
of how many films were viewed.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.780
We didn't do any serial data collection,
so we don't really know who anybody was.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.090
Just kept track of the film views
and how long they had the player on,

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.970
which is some really interesting
information for you and your client.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.480
But you could have gone a lot farther.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.680
We could have gotten an
idea of who's watching it,

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.460
what time of day,
and what type of CPU they have.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.430
That's all the information
you can gather,

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.580
and I think it doesn't
have to be malicious.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.340
It just helps you build
a better piece next time,

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.730
knowing what these people
are using to view your stuff.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.700
The one piece that we did do
is we did do the help online,

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.900
which is kind of nice,
that we didn't have to worry

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.830
about updating our player,
although we could have,

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.090
but that was just a help page on a
website that we could update immediately.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.170
And we never got to streaming trailers,
but that would have been

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.210
another great use of this,
is to have the trailer stream in,

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.580
and each time a new
trailer would come online,

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.570
you could still have Season 1
or Season 2 skins and see a

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:52.500
trailer coming up for Season 3.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.040
I wish we had gotten that far.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.840
And then here's some URLs.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.100
EC Media, you can talk to Guy,
which is tremendously helpful.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.510
Lefevre Photography,
we had used to shoot all that

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.790
photography element music.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:11.760
and Chris Sheehan is the,
he's not really the,

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.530
he is a photographer,
but he was the piece,

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:14.840
he was the guy who helped build our skin.
