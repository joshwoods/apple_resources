WEBVTT

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.970
Oh, there you go.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.000
Okay.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.280
So for those of you who
saw the keynote yesterday,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320
you probably noticed that Apple's
been rather busy this year.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.270
And open source has certainly
been no exception for us.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.400
So there's going to be a
veritable cavalcade of speakers

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.010
coming up here after me to
describe their various projects.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.590
But I'll give sort of a general overview
and introduce the first of them.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.240
These are also some important resources.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.820
As always, you can find our most recent
Darwin sources and pointers

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.270
to other important open source
projects at developer.apple.com.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.680
OpenDarwin.org is another project we
launched about a year ago in cooperation

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.120
with the Internet Software Consortium.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.240
So you can get information
there at OpenDarwin.org,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.680
and that's been very successful for us.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.550
And then, of course,
we have our wonderful Fink brethren,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.820
who have a Fink.SourceForge.net address.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.900
And then, of course,
have to mention FreeBSD.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.860
Yay!

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.260
So let me talk a little
bit about OpenDarwin.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.390
They've started doing something we
really hoped could be done by an external

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.420
but yet loosely affiliated project,
which is producing their own

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.000
Darwin standalone releases.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.060
Those of you who ran the
Apple Darwin releases might

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.220
have noticed that they tended
to come out fairly seldom,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.920
and there were general issues
with them that we didn't always

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.720
have the engineering resources
to fix in a timely manner.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.340
So with the additional volunteer
resources that OpenDarwin.org

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.580
brings to the table,
they've been able to do some

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.380
very high quality releases of
Darwin for both the x86 and PowerPC.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.510
So we're very happy to see that.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.840
Another thing that they've been doing is
providing RPMs for all of the components.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.820
So you now have an RPM database
installed that you can query

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.260
to see where various components
belong or where they came from.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.000
Obviously updates and whatnot
are possible in the future.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.320
They're not doing that yet,
but that's certainly an option.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.650
They're doing that in conjunction now
with real package management behind the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.890
operating system and they're providing
SRPMs which correspond directly to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.770
what they use to build the binary bits.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.870
The Darwin Ports Project,
which you'll also hear quite a bit more

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.330
about in this chain of presentations,
has been doing what it can to bring more

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.760
third-party software to the platform.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.650
And they have a WebDAV mountable
packages collection already

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.140
at packages.opendarwin.org.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.590
So you can simply connect to that
in the finder and double-click on

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.620
one of the packages there and poof.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.230
Well,
I don't mean that the way it sounds.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.160
and many more.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.300
I mean, bingo.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.300
That's the word.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.700
So we've also changed the way
we do open source releases.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.800
In the past,
what we did was we essentially

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.820
just pushed out copies of our live
CVS repository at periodic intervals,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.220
and we had some stuff that was just live,
you know, on a minute-to-minute basis.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.110
And that was cool from the
perspective of being able to see

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.010
sort of the work in progress,
but what it really didn't do was

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.890
give you any directly correspondent
bits to Mac OS X or Darwin,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.310
e.g., you didn't know that what
you were looking at in CVS was

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.700
what you were actually running,
nor were those bits necessarily

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.260
compilable at any given time because
you were looking at top of tree.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.360
There might be works in progress.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.160
There were obviously synchronization
issues between different projects.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.540
One might be n steps ahead of another,
but there's interdependencies because

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.540
someone hasn't checked that stuff in yet.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.480
So we looked at that,
and what we started doing instead

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.060
is breaking our releases into what
we call on-cycle and off-cycle,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.120
which is on-cycle releases are
snapshots of the exact sources

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.080
that we use to build the product.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.730
So now when you get an on-cycle snapshot,
you know it corresponds to a

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.050
given release of Mac OS X or a
given software update of Mac OS X,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.750
and they're synchronized together because
we didn't have the tag information

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.980
exported before that would have let
you sort of read through the data.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.460
So we're able to sort of recreate
that state of affairs for yourself.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.770
And some stuff is still done off-cycle.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.180
Darwin streaming server, rendezvous, GDB,
GCC, various GPL projects,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.000
you can still get the
CVS top of tree for that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.600
So we're not doing it for
absolutely everything,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.730
but for the majority of the bits,
we're trying to move

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.000
to an on-cycle model.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.300
The source is now available
via web DAV as well as CVS,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.080
so you can mount the appropriate volume
and just drag the sources around.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.620
And we're continuously adding.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.620
So we're continuously adding.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.000
We're continuously adding to what we've
previously released as open source.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.800
There's a lot of new open
source initiatives at Apple.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.960
Some of those.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.900
You've probably heard the
announcements about WebCor.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.720
So the Safari folks have been working
very closely with the KHTML team,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.150
and you'll hear more about
that in this presentation,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.840
and the JavaScript stuff as well.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.840
Of course, there's also the X11
product now and the SDK.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.090
And we've been working all
over the map in the third-party

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.740
software and FreeBSD areas to
update components of Mac OS X.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.180
We have a new TCL, new Python, new Perl,
new Samba.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.820
We've synced up LibC with
FreeBSD 5.0 to bring in all the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.780
WCharty support and thread safety.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.480
So there's too many projects to mention
that we've synchronized for Panther.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.370
So coming up next,
we'll have someone from the

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.020
Open Darwin project talk a little bit
more about Open Darwin and Darwin ports.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.630
So let me introduce him now.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.230
Kevin Van Vechten of
the Open Darwin project

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.780
and recently of Apple.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.500
I'm here to talk a little bit
about the Open Darwin project.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.880
Open Darwin, as was mentioned,
was started about a year ago.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.300
And what it is, is a community supported
site outside of Apple.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.840
It's hosted by the
Internet Software Consortium.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.440
Neither the ISC nor Apple exercise
editorial control over Open Darwin.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.790
So what that means is Open Darwin is
free to explore technologies that maybe

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.110
Apple doesn't feel is very high priority,
but the developer community as a whole

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.080
would like to see incorporated in Darwin.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.710
And once it's working there,
we can advocate within

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.820
Apple incorporating those changes
into a future Mac OS X release.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.000
Open Darwin provides
support for Darwin users.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.820
It provides mailing lists,
how-to articles, documentation.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.840
It provides a lot of information
for using various Darwin commands,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.520
which of course are also
applicable to Mac OS X.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.110
And most importantly,
Open Darwin provides

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.880
resources for developers.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.520
We provide the same mailing lists
and documentation for information

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.220
relevant to porting third-party
open source Unix software to Darwin.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.700
And just kind of being a central point
for information about Darwin development.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.690
Which of course directly
applies to Open Darwin.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.460
And that's why we're so
excited to be here today.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.250
And we're excited to be here
today to talk about the Mac OS X,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.620
because a lot of key
Mac OS X technologies like I/O Kit and

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.370
Core Foundation are also part of Darwin.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:51.140
So one of our primary goals in OpenDarwin
is to stay synchronized with Mac OS X.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.680
We recognize there's a much larger
developer community around Mac OS X than

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.790
there is focused on pure Darwin.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.610
So as much as possible,
we want to make it easy to take

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:08.300
individual components of the
Darwin operating system from OpenDarwin.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.720
You could compile them on your
own and substitute a piece of

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.590
Mac OS X with the custom component.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.160
As part of that,
we provide binary releases of

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.540
Darwin and components of Darwin.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.890
So if you're interested in
playing with a particular version,

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.820
there's a place where you can go.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.540
It would be pre-built.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.440
You could download it, install from a CD.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.600
We also are working to provide an easy
build system for Darwin so that you

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.540
can look at any particular library,
command, build it quickly and easily,

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.620
modify it a little bit, rebuild it again,
install it on your system,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.280
and use that for debugging,
for development.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.180
And also, importantly,
is OpenDarwin's a staging

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.670
area for external development.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.790
So, for example,
in our current OpenDarwin sources,

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:04.050
we have some of OpenBSD's sys trace
work as an experiment for dealing with

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.680
access control on various sys calls.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.550
We also have FreeBSD commands brought
over from the FreeBSD project,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.870
integrated into OpenDarwin,
and we've also got some of the open

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.610
source projects that we've tested there,
and then they were able to bring some of

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:25.800
those in as part of Panther to keep us
up to speed and keep us synchronized with

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.000
the other open source projects out there.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.360
So OpenDarwin focuses a lot on
open collaboration for developing

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.980
software that pertains to Darwin and,
of course, Mac OS X as a whole.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.800
We host projects relevant to Darwin.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.680
For example,
KDE Darwin is currently hosted there.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.450
It's one of our larger
projects in terms of code base.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.490
DarwinPorts, as mentioned,
is another project hosted at OpenDarwin,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.740
which is one of our more active projects.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.740
We provide the infrastructure so that
people can create projects and allow

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.390
developers from the community to sign up,
get access to CVS.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.660
And we're also working to have a mirrored
version of a lot of the Apple projects,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.900
say Streaming Server or HeaderDoc.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.740
Eventually, we want to see some of those
in a repository at OpenDarwin.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:19.490
So third-party and community
contributions can be put into CVS there,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.660
tested, integrated,
and then advocated back at Apple.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.540
So that's a potential enhancement
or bug fix or whatever.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.410
So the Darwin Ports project,
being one of the most active

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:37.350
projects at OpenDarwin,
is a project designed to port

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.300
open source software to Darwin.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.620
Its main focus is the easy installation,
removal, and upgrading of software

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.990
from source or binaries.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.500
The binary support is
still a work in progress.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.080
One of the reasons why I'm mentioning
it here in OpenDarwin is there's

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.470
a fair chance that we'll be using
Darwin Ports as means of building the

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.220
individual components of the underlying
Darwin operating system at OpenDarwin,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.810
so that there would be a port for each,
not only third party and

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.830
open source Unix software,
but also for each of the

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.380
components of Darwin.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.920
So it would be as easy as saying,
you know,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.600
build and install a core foundation
on a single command line,

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.540
and it could do that for you.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.560
There's also a Cocoa user
interface to Darwin Ports.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.550
It lets you browse through all the
available software that currently

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.980
has a port file representation.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.320
You can choose what you want to build,
click on it, it'll build,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.760
install on your system.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.970
So the most important thing I want to
mention today is that OpenDarwin really

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:56.070
is a third party independent project and
it does need your help to be successful.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.340
And if everybody joins the
mailing list and discuss any

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.190
Darwin technical issues they have,
it can really be a good central

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.370
resource for development for Mac OS X,
for Darwin,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.620
for porting Unix applications.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.750
Also, we have a Bugzilla
database at OpenDarwin,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.790
so there's a good opportunity
to report any bugs with Darwin,

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.680
with any libraries or
commands there at OpenDarwin,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.330
as well as submitting a patch or at
least making a reference to saying,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.600
well, this isn't a problem in NetBSD or
this isn't a problem in FreeBSD.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.890
And then somebody at OpenDarwin
can take a look at that,

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.180
figure out what needs to change,
and we can incorporate

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.740
that back into Mac OS X.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.660
There's a couple mailing
lists at OpenDarwin.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.890
If you're interested in proposing
projects relevant to Darwin or

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.190
discussing new features or enhancements,
that would be appropriate for

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.900
the discuss list at OpenDarwin.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.860
If you're interested
in submitting patches,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.260
code, documentation,
that is appropriate for the

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.400
hackers list at OpenDarwin.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.750
and there's a couple interesting
other sections pertaining

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:14.140
to open source and Darwin,
QuickTime Streaming Server, Rendezvous,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:19.520
GCC, Unix sysadmin tools.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.030
And up next is Don Melton and he'll
be talking a bit about Safari.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.300
Hi, I'm Don Melton.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.450
I'm the Internet Technologies Manager at
Apple Computer,

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.280
and I'm here to talk to you today
about Safari and open source.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.770
And I'll give you a little
roadmap to some other sessions

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.010
here at the conference.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:51.000
[Transcript missing]

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.980
Why is Safari so successful?

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.710
I mean, because people are not
only downloading it,

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.320
I think 5 million so far,
something like that,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.030
they're actually also using it.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.190
Some of them are making it
their default web browser.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.700
I think of three reasons
why it's so popular.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.080
First off, innovative features.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.570
It's got a superior user experience.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.040
This is a full featured web browser.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.890
People take it seriously.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.730
It can do things for you.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.300
Secondly, solid quality.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.310
Real world compatibility with the web.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.120
By that I mean pages
look the way you expect,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.920
and they look the way web
designers expect them to look too,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.710
especially if they
write to web standards,

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.850
but hey, even if they don't.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.930
But most importantly,
impressive performance.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.260
It's the fastest browser on Mac OS X.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.550
We beat everybody not only
on the standard benchmarks,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.140
but we also beat them
in just real world use,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.300
loading pages, scrolling, reading.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.990
Resizing, launching especially.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.670
1.0 is faster.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:57.180
And now the underlying technology within
Safari is built right into Mac OS X.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.690
And it's this underlying technology that
I want to talk a little bit about today

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.800
because it's based on open standards.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:12.080
Firstly,
it's based on W3C standards like HTML4,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.400
XML, CSS, DOM, so on and so forth.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.780
But more importantly,
it's based on open source.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.910
And that's open source
from the KDE project.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.150
The KDE project,
as many of you might know,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:31.600
is an open source desktop available
on Linux and other Unix platforms.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.620
It has all sorts of applications
and utilities and libraries.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.710
And one of the big applications
is the Conqueror web browser.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.800
And the Conqueror web
browser uses two libraries.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.250
Thank you.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.430
Two libraries, KHTML and KJS.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.390
And we're using those same
libraries within Safari.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.450
First, we're using it in a
framework called WebCore,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:02.350
which is just an adapter
built on KHTML from KDE.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.420
It uses most of the KHTML sources,
about 95% of them.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.280
And it has glue code to
the rest of Mac OS X,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.830
which has also been open sourced.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.750
We also use JavaScript Core,
which is just a simple wrapper around

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.140
the KJS JavaScript interpreter,
also from KDE.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.490
But that's not all.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.010
Safari also contains other
open source components in

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:30.700
WebCor and in JavaScript Core,
such as the XPAT XML parser,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.100
the PCRE regular expression library,
and even, shock,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.670
portions of Mozilla code.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.300
I mean, a lot of people are actually
surprised at that when they

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.500
go perusing through WebCor.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.350
So why open source?

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.680
It's all about the technology.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.790
It's not just that it's
a good development model,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.460
but for us, it was a technology decision.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.020
KHTML and KGS are just
tremendous technologies.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.910
I'd like to tip my hat to KDE developers
for their fine work for that.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.700
And let me just go into
detail as exactly why.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.840
One, it's small.

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:13.150
KHTML and KGS together are
about 140,000 lines of code.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.730
That's almost an order of
magnitude smaller than some

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.430
other projects and web browsers.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.700
and it's fast because if
you have less source code,

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.210
you've got less binary code.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.470
Less binary code means
you execute things faster.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.340
It's also designed for speed.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.030
It's really designed well.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.160
and it's easy to modify.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.100
This is a fun source base to hack.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.660
It's just a hoot to get in
there and mess around with it.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.780
It's easy to understand.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.430
There's not layers and layers
of abstraction to figure out.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.680
It's very, very straightforward.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.460
And we've tried to maintain that
with the rest of our development.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.540
Okay,
what are we doing with the community?

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.380
First off,
we're working with the KDE team.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.200
These are great folks.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.930
We're on mailing lists with them.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.540
We've had at least one transatlantic
phone conference call with the KDE team,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.120
KHML and KJS developers.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.280
And Hari Porten, the lead on KJS,
has actually been out to the

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.990
Cupertino campus to visit with us.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.700
So they're great folks.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.360
We're giving back all of our
bug fixes and enhancements

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.460
in WebCor and JavaScriptCor.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:36.920
And we also send patches on the mailing
list to the development team at KDE.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:45.720
We're also taking in patches and
other changes from the community.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.660
In fact, just a few weeks before
Safari 1.0 went out,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.880
David Heitz snuck in another little
feature from the Tip a Tree KDE.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.200
and we're sharing ideas
and plans for the future.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.860
When we work on something and we know
we're gonna be down in section of code

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.050
base and we might be pulling it apart,
heads up guys,

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.970
we're gonna be redoing the plumbing
on this and the KDE folks have

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.780
done the same thing with us.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.580
When Lars Noll,
who's the lead on KHTML said,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.170
"I'm gonna be mucking
with the CSS parser,

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.330
stay out of that." We went, "Great,
just tell us when it lands so we

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.290
can take it." And that's one of the
things that went into our beta too.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.190
We're also planning,
now that we've survived our 1.0 release,

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.200
and boy am I glad that we did that,
we're going to have another

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.420
one of those Transatlantic
Conference calls with the folks there.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.450
But you can contribute too.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.440
And that's the other thing that
I wanted to talk about today.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.280
You can contribute not
only to our projects,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.220
WebCor and JavaScriptCor,
but you can also contribute

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.190
to KHTML and KJS because,
hey, it's the same code.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.020
I mean, it's just fine with us and we'll
get it from tip of tree and we'll

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.810
swap patches back and forth.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.700
We would love to get bug fixes,
enhancements,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.430
and even other ideas from the community.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.990
If you go to the Apple open source site,
you can find the mailing

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.520
list that you can join.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.310
You can get the tar balls of the
current versions of WebCor and

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.280
JavaScriptCor and jump in.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.450
We really look forward to that.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.390
Now I'd like to point out a couple of
other sessions here at the conference.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.470
I'd like to say I'll be here all week.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.560
Come at 2 o'clock to the Safari overview.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.700
It's upstairs in the Presidio room.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.600
And I'll be rambling on
there for about an hour.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.620
And then tomorrow,
Safari technology and web standards,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.970
if you care about web standards.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.760
Darren Adler will go into detail for it.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.960
We're going to be covering some of the
new APIs and foundation on Thursday.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.220
There's an overview of networking
that might be useful for some of you.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.120
And the marvelous web kit on Friday.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.660
And some lower level plumbing
that folks might be interested.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.880
CF network in depth also on Friday.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.360
Thanks so much.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.310
And I'd like to call
Richard Blanchard to the stage.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.800
And talk about it.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.610
printing.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.000
Hello.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.960
I'm Richard Blanchard.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.480
I'm the Apple engineering
manager for printing.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.960
And today I'm going to give
you a little bit of insight in

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.190
what we've been doing with our
printing projects inside of Darwin.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.500
A year ago in this exact session,
I was incredibly pleased and excited to

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.460
announce that we were including CUPS,
Common Unix Printing System,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.800
into Darwin and into Mac OS X.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.490
And that's the basis of our
Jaguar printing system and

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.240
our Panther printing system.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.140
Over the last year,
I spent a lot of time rolling

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.200
important fixes from the ongoing
CUPS mainline development.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.280
We used CUPS 1.1.15.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.440
CUPS since then has moved on to .16, .17,
.18.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.000
We've taken bug fixes from those
changes and security fixes and

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.890
rolled them back onto our .15 base.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.460
That's kept us pretty busy.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.210
Over that year,
I've been reading some postings

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.210
from people who were concerned,
maybe was the right word,

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.070
that we were maybe stagnating.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.310
Darwin and Mac OS X was
using this .15 base.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.820
Meanwhile, CUPS was running ahead and
was all the way up to .18.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.310
That's just not the case.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.260
As I said,
we've been moving these bug fixes back.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.450
But the reason I really bring
that up is not because I'm really

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.770
oversensitive to these posts.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.410
But instead, it's because there's an
important point there.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.130
One of the reasons we went to
CUPS to an open source printing

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.660
system was for transparency.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.090
It was so the developers could look,
see what we were doing,

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.230
give us feedback before we
actually made a major release.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.190
And in that same vein,
our CUPS repository,

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.820
our CVS repository is part of Darwin,
is live every day.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.890
So you can go on to Darwin and
see what we've done any given day.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.440
And we've had our
Panther CUPS development,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.680
which is based on 1.19,
up there for some time.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.020
So again, for Panther we're using 1.1.19.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.740
There are some important
changes in there,

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.900
important fixes, important features.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.750
There are some bindings
for new languages,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.180
so there are Java bindings now.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.680
That'll be in Panther.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.810
PHP and Perl bindings,
so you can actually make CUPS calls,

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.950
create printers,
and print directly without going through

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.210
the print system from those languages.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.800
There's fax support,
which is important if you saw the

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.980
keynote last night or yesterday morning.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.090
IPP collections,
which allows us to do some

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.780
better error handling,
and improved PPD support.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.910
The PPD parser in 1.1.19 is much
tighter than it was in earlier versions.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.580
It'll flag PPDs that are bad much
more easily or much more clearly.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.690
And it also allows access
to most of the PPD keywords,

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.410
whereas the earlier
PPD libraries did not.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.730
GIMP Print has been out there,
has been used by a lot of our users,

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.920
as has HPI.js.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.780
This is actually one of the most
exciting things about using CUPS,

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.090
is that the world of open source
printer drivers is available to

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.020
our users and to our developers.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.480
And this has really been
great over the years,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.490
supporting some older printers
that maybe the vendors haven't

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.760
gotten around to supporting.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.710
As you can see,
GIMP Print supports over 500 printers

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.490
from most of the major printer vendors.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.520
HPI.js supports a couple
hundred HP printer models.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.470
That's a lot of legacy printer support,
and it's been great for us.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.640
There's also been some important
support from some of our Linux cousins.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.630
If you go to linuxprinting.org,
you'll see some great Mac OS X printing

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.540
pages supporting these two packages.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.490
So I encourage you to go look at those.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.540
This wasn't stolen for the keynote,
and I'm very happy.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.010
I get to announce today that
GIMP Print's actually going to

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.480
be part of Darwin and Panther.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.960
So we'll have those drivers
in there by default.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.200
Ready?

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.800
There you go.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.550
But there's more.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.160
As you saw the keynote,
there's also Fax in Panther.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.660
And following our printing tradition,
what we wanted to do is

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.910
take an open source core,
put that into Darwin,

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.010
and then build on top of
it in our commercial OS.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.810
So we used eFax.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.880
If anybody knows the
Fax landscape out there,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.470
there's really two different
open source projects.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.640
There's eFax, which is very small.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.080
It's not an incredibly active project.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.820
And there's HiLiFax,
which will do everything

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.820
you'd ever want in faxing,
and it's a lot larger.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.030
We actually went with a smaller project.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.230
It seemed to fit our goals more cleanly.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.680
So we've got eFax.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.880
It's in the Darwin repository right now,
and it'll be in Panther,

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.180
and it's available for you.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:10.890
I'll be talking Thursday, much longer,
about printing in Mac OS X Panther,

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.630
but also going over some of
these Darwin printing projects.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.420
So again,
the most important message I have

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.650
for you today is we have three
projects now that are tied to

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.260
printing that are all in Darwin.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.340
We have CUPS, the print server.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.310
We have GIMP Print,
a set of printer drivers.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.960
And we have eFax for our fax port.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.680
All three of those projects
are live every day.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.210
I encourage you to,
if you're interested in any of those,

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.670
track our changes every day.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.660
Send us mail.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.360
Let us know, hey, this change was wrong.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.040
Hey, we should pick up this other change
that was coming from another project.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.210
We do this so we can be incredibly
transparent to you so you know what

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.160
we're doing for our OSes before
we have to release the GM version.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.740
So anything you do to help
us would be much appreciated.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.010
So I'm going to introduce Torrey Lyons.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.360
He's going to come up here
and talk about XFree86.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.620
So XFree86 has a fairly long
history on Mac OS X comparatively,

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.030
at least as far as this
operating system goes.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:11.860
The initial Darwin support was in
the late 2000 with XFree86 4.0.2.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.220
In this release,
you had to shut down core graphics.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.620
XFree86 would talk through the
IOCAD directly to the hardware.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.570
Then in subsequent releases,
we added the ability to

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.840
run in parallel with Aqua,
where you could have two separate virtual

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.480
screens and switch back and forth.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.300
And then we added a
rootless mode in early 2002,

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:37.320
and that's culminated in the 4.3 release,
which gives us faster 2D and

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.760
hardware-accelerated OpenGL.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.740
Now, of course,
the thing that's missing from here,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.750
or is yet to come,
is the 1.0 release of Apple's X11.app,

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.080
which is a very exciting
thing in this area.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:55.070
And as most of you probably know,
that's based on the XFree86 code base.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.640
At least their current beta is based
on XFree86 4.0 and Apple's X11.app.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.960
So, what are we planning to
do in the XFree86 project?

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.060
Of course,
the most important thing for us

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:10.860
is to get the lot of good changes
that Apple's made in releasing X11

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.930
merged into the XFree86 code base.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:21.220
There's a win-win situation if we can
get Apple's X11.app and the XFree86 open

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.420
source release tightly synchronized.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.490
And we're working hard on that.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.360
And what really makes that
possible is this XPlugin API,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:36.610
which allows open source developers to
really write high-performance X servers.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.300
The problem we had sort of at the
end of the 4.3 development is that

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.440
essentially what we're trying to do is
we're trying to write an XWindow server

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.840
on top of another Windows server,
which is Core Graphics.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.380
And there weren't existing public
APIs in Mac OS X that allowed us

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.370
low enough level access to get
the performance we really needed.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.860
So, in discussions with Apple,
what really emerged was that

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.410
actually Core Graphics has
all the capability we need,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:12.610
but that there aren't -- the APIs we
needed aren't private APIs that are

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.900
hidden and not exposed and therefore
not suitable for open source code.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.980
So, what XPlugin is,
is it's a library that is

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:26.290
exactly what you need to write an
X server on Mac OS X and no more.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.300
So, it's fairly easy for us to write an
X server on Mac OS X and no more.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.900
So, it's fairly easy for Apple to
maintain as they go forward.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.940
And it also allows open source
developers sort of a green

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.540
light to go ahead and write very
high-performance X servers on Mac OS X.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:45.220
And this is really the big news as
far as my part of the talk is that --

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.450
Apple's X11 we would think of as
the first implementation of an

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.400
X server using this X plugin API.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.170
And actually, if you check it out,
you can check out their

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:52.980
beta 3 source code.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.020
You'll see it's XFree86 with
acceleration features added in,

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.520
and they're just using OpenGeo,
Core Graphics, and this X plugin API.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.340
So we'd also,
in addition to making things go faster,

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.280
we'd also like to make them better.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.390
So we're working on adding multiple
visuals of various classes and depths.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.860
The common problem here is that you
want to display an 8-bit pseudocolor

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.640
visual and a 24-bit true color display.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.110
And actually,
beta 3 has a way of doing this.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.330
It has some problems.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.280
We think there's a slightly
more general implementation

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.920
that we're going to put in.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:33.200
And we also, of course, moving forward,
want to support new XFree86 standards.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.800
Of course,
the key reason to have a version of

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.200
X11 running on Mac OS X is it's an
essential compatibility environment for

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.980
scientific and Unix developers and users.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.790
And compatibility environment is
only so good as you stay compatible

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.300
with the latest stuff coming out
in the rest of the community.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.800
So I've listed some things
here that we're working on.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.070
R&R, XCursor,
ability to add cursors with alpha

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:04.440
channels that are coming out on other
platforms in the XFree86 project.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.640
And we'll be including those in
our Mac OS X support as well.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.300
The last thing we'd like to do,
now that the picture on Mac OS X for

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.990
X server is getting pretty robust,
we'd like to add,

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:20.060
or at least turn our eyes
back to I/O Kit mode.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.570
And the top of the tree already
has some improvement with this.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.610
This is of interest to those of you who
run Open Darwin or Pure Darwin without

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.460
the rest of the Mac OS X goodness.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.620
We'd like to get I/O Kit closer to the
kind of performance you'd expect in

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.070
other open source operating systems.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.160
And what's available,
if you build from the

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.040
top of the tree today,
I suggest you do if you're

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.000
running Pure Darwin,
you'll notice that the drawing

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.040
performance is much better.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.150
It uses shadow FB instead of trying
to draw directly to the frame buffer.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.720
And that's much better than
what you see in the 4.3 branch.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.920
So of course we always need help.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.450
And if you're interested in helping,
I'd suggest you stop

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.460
by devel@xfree86.org.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:05.700
That's the sort of central mailing
list for xFree86 development.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.710
And these are some talks that would
be useful to understand a little bit

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.200
the environment that we're working
in here to implement an X server.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:19.030
So next we're going to have Ed Peterlin
come up and talk about OpenOffice.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:33:24.300
[Transcript missing]

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.000
Today, it's really a lot of fun.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.950
I was here a year ago saying,
we got a compiling, we need your help.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.560
Yesterday, we went gold master.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:37.190
OpenOffice.org 1.0 is here.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.190
We support Mac OS X and we
finally refactored everything to

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.240
support Darwin PowerPC as well.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.700
So now you have a full office
productivity suite on Darwin.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.070
Truly amazing.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.900
It runs on Mac OS X with X11 graphics and
I'm actually pleased to say it does run

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.400
on Panther with the X11 on the second CD.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.050
Take the installer, it runs.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.380
It just runs.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:10.860
And yesterday,
another thing people may not be aware of,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.790
we released simultaneously in over
20 languages at the same time.

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.980
Italian, Greek, French, Dutch.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.740
All of these users now
have localized versions of

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.080
OpenOffice.org in their language.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.900
I was here one year ago as one person.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.310
Since then, I got another core developer,
a volunteer, of course.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.730
We all have real jobs and real lives.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:39.350
Two people, and we moved...

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:46.130
Two people, never more than six,
moved seven and a half million

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.010
lines of source code in only a year.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.010
This is an amazing operating
system and this would not be

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.000
possible without the synergy of open
source on this operating system.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.460
You know what?

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.790
It really is a thing of beauty.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.750
This is the X11 version.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:02.750
Full anti-aliasing.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.070
You have access to all
of your OS X fonts.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.000
It's really nice,
and you can go get it today.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.010
We're doing CDs here because she's
got a little around the edges.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.120
Just a little more than
the other platforms,

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.740
about 100 megs more than
the other platforms.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:26.240
But since we've given out CDs yesterday,
approximately 5% of everyone at

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.820
this conference now has it on CD.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.010
Okay.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.060
Yes,
you can see us in the exhibitors booth.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.420
A lot of heavy drinking
went into the CDs,

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:38.420
so appreciate them.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:40.050
But you know what?

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.060
This proves one thing.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.290
We're a great community and
we're a community of doers.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.750
But you know what?

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.530
We don't need doers.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.500
We need dreamers.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.110
We're not stopping here.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.070
This is the beginning.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.540
This is the beginning.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.270
You know what?

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.190
Guys, the hard stuff is done.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.750
It all works.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.010
We've got to move forward.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.970
We've got to plow forward.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.940
OpenOffice.org 1.1 is going live on other
platforms with some amazing features.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.500
Improved scriptability support
for writing full infrastructures

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.980
and middleware on this as a
cross-platform delivery solution.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.610
Mind-blowing.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.320
You can run your same middleware on OS X,
Windows, you can throw it back on

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.140
a Solaris box if you need,
or if you don't have a G5 or can't

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.780
afford it like me because I'm poor.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.200
And also vertical and
right-to-left languages.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.160
We're beginning to get CJK support,
Arabic, doing BIDI.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.420
But you know what?

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:33.970
That's not enough.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.360
So why don't we replace X11?

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.400
We're going to use core
graphics and quarts.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.720
And we're going to get
it running right on OS X.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.680
We're going to have tighter
Mac OS X integration.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.670
We have visions of integrating
with services so we can start

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.720
exchanging everything with
mail and other applications.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.590
Finally, getting the clipboard working.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:04.770
and of course, Aqua User Interface,
the one that everyone wants.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.370
That's not a mock-up.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.180
This is a prototype.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.200
This has been out there and
available for six months.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.570
Go out, get it, look at it.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.960
Help us try and find out how we can
do this properly and do it right.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.700
Now's the time for you to jump in.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.280
All you people who weren't
core hackers before,

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.330
who were afraid to touch make files,
now you can start.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.810
And today I'm also pretty
pleased to announce,

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.980
if you're not a core graphics developer,
if you're not a Node 10 developer,

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.040
there are Java guys out there too.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.970
We have a full Java prototype
project that is now up using

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.430
Java 2D only for the drawing.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.540
99% C++, Java 2D for the drawing.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.880
And the amazing thing,
it's only a week old,

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.260
but it supports Japanese text
input on Mac OS X in Unicode.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.570
That's phenomenal.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.160
Basically, come.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.610
Help us find out where we're going to go.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.290
This is everyone's thing.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.860
You can actually put part of you into it.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.980
We need UI design experts
trying to figure out how to

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.020
make this right for a Mac user.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.630
We need graphic artists who can actually
come and draw all new icons for us,

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.230
get the interface working.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.550
Cocoa developers,
help us find out how we can move

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.910
this to Interface Builder and all
these other great Apple technologies.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.850
We need courageous testers who aren't
afraid and don't get upset if we

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.140
happen to just lose that data file.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.660
And also, we need evangelists.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.460
Go out and just tell people about it.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.700
Be like, look, this exists.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.770
You can use all of your...

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.860
Office documents, won't say the word,
all of your office documents

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:45.660
right now for free.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.950
It's amazing.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:51.070
Stop by mac.openoffice.org,
take a look today,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.940
and help us out as you can.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:53.940
Thank you very much.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.880
And now I'd like,
it's my pleasure to introduce Lane Roath,

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.230
who's going to tell us about OpenPlay.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:35.800
[Transcript missing]

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.790
It's a cross-platform project.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.450
It's standards-based.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:45.340
It currently is running on Mac OS X.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.160
It has a classic build as well.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.860
It runs under Windows and Linux.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:58.690
And the Mac OS X build has both a
CFM-based and a Mac OS-based build.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:05.740
It's a modular build,
meaning that the underlying protocols,

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.330
like TCP and Apple Talk,
are plug-in modules.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:16.170
There's the flexibility to add
new protocols via that modularity.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.430
And in fact, this year,
that flexibility has been used.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:27.080
And the use has been to
add Rendezvous support.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:31.270
It's got a large adoption.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:35.070
A lot of titles are using it,
a lot more titles coming out.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.100
Most of these titles happen to be
games because of the NetSprocket API,

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.260
and that's what people know.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.940
But there's no reason that
it is a games-only API.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:48.730
You can use it for any kind of
quick networking that you'd like.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.520
It has a few simple layers.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.340
Your application can talk to
any of the layers directly.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:01.020
There's the game interface,
which is the NetSprocket API.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.750
It's very easy to use.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.620
It handles multiple users.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.240
You can group users.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.160
All that high level stuff is very
easy to do via that protocol.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.490
There's the protocol module,
which is the former OpenPlay,

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:20.300
and it deals directly with
the abstraction of the

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:25.580
modules that you deal with,
TCP, AppleTalk, and you can talk to those

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:30.490
modules directly as well,
whichever you would like.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.290
The game interface, like I said,
provides the easiest way

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.180
to add networking to your
game or other application.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:44.480
It has player management,
game management, packet management,

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:52.070
and again,
it runs on all the different platforms.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.940
The protocol interface
is fairly low level.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:01.300
It's much closer to like
a sockets based protocol.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.930
It has the protocol agnostic design
so that you can use one API and

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:10.860
you can talk over Apple Talk,
TCP IP, or Rendezvous.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.010
It has the IP module for all platforms.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.230
It has Apple Talk for
Mac OS and Mac OS X.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:26.920
And it has Rendezvous for Mac OS X.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:35.480
The next step, of course,
is the newest plug-in module

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:43.100
that was developed by Freeverse
Software and committed back to the

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.050
community for everybody to use.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:51.110
So that should give you an idea of
how easy it is to add a new networking

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:51.110
API if you happen to have the need.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:43:00.120
If you want to know more
about OpenPlay and everything

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:06.870
that's going on with that,
there's not an OpenPlay specific

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.540
session this year,
but you can learn more about

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.930
the general OS X networking,
the higher level CF networking,

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:21.290
and then just the general internet
technologies that are available.
