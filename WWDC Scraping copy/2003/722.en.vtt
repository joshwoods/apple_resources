WEBVTT

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.400
Hi, everybody.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.060
Let's get started.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.740
I'm Glenn Bulycz on the QuickTime team.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.810
You're in
Advanced QuickTime Interactivity.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.200
One note, a housekeeping note,
the feedback forum for QuickTime,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.970
ever popular, has been moved,
not to Cupertino, but to the Marina Room.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.730
So our speaker today really
doesn't need an introduction.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.520
In the QuickTime world,
Michael Shaff's done some amazing work

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.720
and is recognized as one of the leaders
in delivering and helping developers

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.600
create applications and then also
helping content folks put out the most

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.990
interesting interactive content there is.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.030
You know,
he's the only person here who got special

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.520
dispensation on the shoe requirement,
and so he's allowed to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.840
wear special sneakers.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.120
So I'll let him get started,
and if we could keep the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.850
questions till the end.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.610
And during the Q&A,
if you would please use the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.790
microphones and tell us,
you know,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.700
your name and what company you're with,
and speak really closely to the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.520
microphone so that the translators
can accurately translate your question

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.650
and Michael can answer appropriately.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.700
Thanks, Michael.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.000
Am I loud enough back there?

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.830
Good.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.570
Excellente.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.610
So we are going to be talking about
QuickTime Interactivity today,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.830
and what advanced means,
I've come to realize,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.040
is a bit of a range, shall we say.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.200
So I'm actually going to start
off maybe not quite advanced,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.770
and we're going to work
our way over to there.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.390
All right.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.450
So I'm going to start off with the tool.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.510
I use a whole set of tools, I should say.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.380
But the tool that I use to
integrate media is LiveStage Pro.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.280
The current version 4.1 is
a personal favorite of mine.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.770
And it's a personal favorite
of mine for many reasons,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.290
but I personally am somewhat lazy.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.750
So I really hate to work
hard on something that I've

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.680
done many times before.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.170
Probably many of you are the same way.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.560
And so Totally Hip got
together and they thought,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.170
well, how can we make developing
QuickTime Interactivity easier,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.250
but still let people like me do all
sorts of strange and crazy things to it?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.900
And the idea came about to
do what we call FastTracks.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.930
And FastTracks allow you to
create advanced interactivity,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.940
but not have to be a rocket scientist,
not have to be a gearhead

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.630
or a script monster.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.770
And let me show you some of this stuff.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.420
I'm going to start off by
creating a skin FastTrack.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.610
And I can do that a couple of ways.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.560
I can click on this bar right over
here that will bring up an editor

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.660
for doing work with skin FastTracks.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.470
And automatically, QuickTime, excuse me,
QuickTime, LiveStage Pro has already

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.170
put in some default media.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.630
Not some of my personal favorite media,
so I'm going to bring

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.420
in some other media.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.350
I've got special media
just for this event,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.940
the WWDC theme down here.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.130
And you'll notice I have a folder
down in my library window called Skin.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.070
Now,
there's a couple ways I could do this.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.450
I could bring in my media
one piece at a time,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.070
and I can say, well,
is this a window shape?

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.460
Nope.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.680
Is it a drag area?

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.230
Nope.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.660
Is it my skin background?

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.820
Yes, definitely.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.140
And right away it gets replaced.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.360
Or I could bring in the entire folder.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.880
FastTrack for Skins has a close button.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.890
It's very valuable to put a close
button if you're going to use a skin.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.940
No close button, confused users.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.060
Confused users are rarely happy.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.200
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to grab onto this whole skin folder.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.380
I'm going to bring it over here,
and I'm going to drop.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.860
And poof,
everything gets swapped out for me.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.540
I now have a new close button.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.440
I'll grab that and drop it over here.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.800
And I've got a new full screen button.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.340
I'll grab that.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.740
Notice the stage kind
of rolls around for me.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.840
And you'll notice that
as I move things around,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.830
there's a lot of information
about what's going on.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.700
And these are new features
to Live Stage Pro version 4.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.040
We thought, go figure,
designers would like to have this

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.350
information rather than have to
calculate it out on their calculator.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.820
So I'm going to zoom out.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.960
And a lot of these instructions are just
like you would expect from Photoshop.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.590
If I hold down my space bar,
I get this kind of what

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.830
I call an active scrubber.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.790
And just like in Photoshop,
if I hold down my option key,

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.930
I can do the toggle
between zoom in and out.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.020
We've tried to make the tool as
much like the tools that you're

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.140
already using as possible.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.240
Reason?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.850
We don't want you to work in the tool.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860
We want you to be able to
do the work in the tool.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.520
any harder than you have to.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.540
There's a lot of space in
QuickTime interactivity.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.900
Let's focus in on the things that
you bring to the table that are

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.500
unique and not have you jumping
through all types of new hoops.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.860
So once I've done this,
I can close that out and

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.860
I can see my stage over here.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.720
I'm going to zoom out
on that one as well.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.000
"Scrub around and zoom back out.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.870
Now that's good.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.000
That's a help.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.240
But what about the rest of the
stuff that I may want to do?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.270
Well, hey, someone took away my outline."

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.980
That's bad, because amongst the many
things that I am is forgetful.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:03.070
I'll be able to handle it,
but we might skip a point

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.600
and I might come back.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.990
What I'm going to do here is I'm
going to grab another FastTrack,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.960
this one dealing with
linear media control.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:21.440
I could either create it from here,
a menu, and I can come on here and say,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.370
it's going to let me do a
playback controls fast track.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.830
Believe it or not,
I have used the application,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.040
but we have built in a lot of redundancy.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.150
So there are different ways of
working with Live Stage Pro,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.320
just as there are different
ways of dealing with QuickTime.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.090
So I've created a linear control that has

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.300
has beginning, go back to the beginning,
rewind, stop, play, fast forward and end,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.430
and all those are pre-scripted for you.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.520
So if I look at my stage,
I can grab onto my linear

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.200
controller and drag it around.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.660
Or as I showed you somewhat prematurely,
I can just grab onto a control

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.250
and move it around in here,
and it will automatically

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.890
resize the track for me.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.990
Once I've done that,
I'm going to bring in some,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.470
not surprisingly,
some media that I'm able to play.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.580
So I'm going to find some video.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.070
And then I'm going to
bring out the HIP bot.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.590
He's brought out quite a lot.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.970
So I drag him on the stage.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.160
And again,
you can see all these annotations.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.100
Now,
I'm going to do something that I've done

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.650
myself accidentally a number of times.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.560
Are those my outlines?

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.390
Oh, Jim, you are a savior.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.520
Thank you very much.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.400
So I bring back in a close button
and I'm going to try this out.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:58.180
So I press the play, excuse me,
I press the preview, which does a preview

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.540
inside of Live Stage Pro.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.840
And you can see I can
drag this skin around.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.090
And now I go over and I click
on the close button and

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.100
Nothing is happening.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.140
And I've done this,
I can't tell you how many

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.410
times I've done this wrong.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.550
And the reason is that my drag region,
the region that allows

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.360
me to drag the window,
is a key component to a skin.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.410
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to turn on the stage,

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.440
show me where that drag area is.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.330
And you can see it's
right here at the top,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.140
right where I've put my close button.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.360
So first mistake that,
or first thing you want to check for is

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.860
when you're placing your controls is,
are they in an area that the

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.290
window is going to be dragged from?

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.030
If so, move them,
because they won't work.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.930
So I'm going to grab this,
I'm going to put this right

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.240
over here and drop it.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.480
I'm not going to do too much aligning
because I bet you folks believe

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.640
that I can align things and you
don't want to watch me doing it.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.200
So once I've done that,
let's do another preview.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.280
And it builds that back up again.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.800
And in a moment, I can both drag and,
of course, I can close.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.120
But I don't actually
want to close quite yet.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.980
I'm going to use these buttons
just to prove that it can be done.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.900
Sorry Ryan,
I didn't max that out before you told me.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.480
Okay, so I've got these all the way
up and you can see these work.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.230
Just like they should.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.240
And that close button works.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.410
Now that would be great,
except for one thing.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.230
Let's say that I was trying
to learn the product.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.820
I actually wanted to understand
not only how the product worked,

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.110
but I wanted to learn how
to do this stuff myself.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:53.200
What we've enabled you to do is click on
a fast track and ask it to be decompiled.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.000
Now no bits are going to
go flying off the screen,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.240
so no one has to go running in any panic.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.200
And notice it changed
my fast track down here.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.120
from one color to another.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.350
And it also changed its icon over here to
show me that this is now a sprite track.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.270
We'll be talking some more about
the timeline on the bottom.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.060
When I open that up,
I can see each one of these controls

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.080
and exactly how they were scripted.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.300
So, for instance,
if I want to know how we're

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.290
doing the fast-forward,
I can just click on it,

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.190
take a look at the script,
and find out that on mouse

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.960
down I'm doing this script.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.960
I'm not going to focus on this
particular script right now.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.310
I'm going to just focus on the fact
that you can use the product at a

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.130
high level for building fast tracks,
and we have a number of features

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.480
that can be built just in
this drag-and-drop fashion.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.350
And then once you get
comfortable with them,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.840
you can dive in and learn from them,
or you can also use them as the basis

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.880
for extensions that you're going to do.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:03.360
And far from just being
basics for beginners,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.960
these are great bases for cutting
down your time in production.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.490
And I'll be showing some other methods
that we've built into Live Stage Pro for

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.200
making things faster and easier.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.980
As I've oftentimes told Steve,
Steve Israelson being the lead

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.830
architect of Live Stage Pro,
we want Live Stage Pro to

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.520
drive like a sports car,
like that neat BMW car.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.160
We don't want it actually to drive
like one of those big diesel trucks.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.850
All right, so I've showed linear
media and fast tracks.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:46.440
A lot of new features
came in on Live Stage 4.1,

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.710
and I would be remiss if I did not
tell you that there is a special

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:56.000
discount for all of you folks out there
and any attendees of this session.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.840
Guy calculated it out.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.720
I think it's a 60% discount or
some odd from the list price.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.360
What I'm going to do is show some of the
new VR features inside of Live Stage Pro.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.840
I'm going to grab on to,
let's do this cubic right over here.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.040
I'm going to drag and drop that.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.780
Actually, I'm going to kill that,
and I'm going to turn off a fixed stage.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:24.460
There's two different ways of viewing
the stage in my mind in Live Stage Pro.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.630
You can have it as a fixed stage,
in which case if you have already

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.360
designed out your skin and you know
exactly what the sizing is going to be,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.280
you can enter that sizing right
in here and it's all locked down.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.520
Handy.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.830
But oftentimes you want the flexibility
of having a dynamic stage where you can

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.430
just move things around freely and the
stage will automatically adjust for you.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.030
I like dynamic things,
so I'm going to turn off fixed stage.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.770
So I've turned off fixed size,
and I don't want an

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.540
extra background put in,
so I'm going to turn that off as well.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.800
I'm going to grab on to this cubic,
and I'm going to drop it in there.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.820
Okay, we've got a cubic.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:09.360
It marks down in the timeline
that it is a... A VR,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.520
and I have one node in that,
and I can go out here

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.580
and stretch its duration.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.440
Which occasionally you want to do if
you're trying to match it up to audio

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.040
that's going to be in the background?

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:28.060
I'm going to open it up and we have a
brand new VR editor with more features

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.510
than I could tell you in several hours.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:37.320
So I'm going to focus in on some
of what I believe are the keys.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.860
I love a number of the
stitchers that are out there.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:46.090
However, when I create VR,
it's not always going to be used

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.060
the same way each and every project.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.430
Sometimes I'll want it to be one way on
one project and another way on another,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.170
but I'm not going to want
to go back to the original

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.300
stitcher and redo all that work.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.670
I love a number of the
stitchers that are out there.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.290
However, when I create VR,
it's not always going to be used

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.530
the same way each and every project.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.130
Sometimes I'll want it to be one way on
one project and another way on another,

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.010
but I'm not going to want
to go back to the original

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.410
stitcher and redo all that work.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.870
I love a number of the
stitchers that are out there.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.430
However, when I create VR,
it's not always going to be used

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.560
the same way each and every project.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.700
Sometimes I'll want it to be one way on
one project and another way on another,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.900
but I'm not going to want
to go back to the original

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.280
stitcher and redo all that work.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.000
even though the original stitcher
put it out in a very different view.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.180
The next thing that we wanted to
be able to do was create hotspots

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.440
inside a VR so that you could have a
beautiful stitching but you could put

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.500
new hot spots based on the particular
project that you needed to get done.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.770
So I'm going to switch over to hotspots.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.020
This particular VR already
has a number of hotspots,

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.780
and you can see them right up here.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.670
They have both IDs and names.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.960
The IDs can be very helpful
when you're scripting.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.950
You can enable and disable them.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.650
And the names,
I'm partial to words myself,

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:12.240
so I like to be able to see
that and work at that level.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.070
I can also set the cursors
that are associated with,

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.680
excuse me, the cursors that are set from
that hotspot when I mouse over.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.790
I'm going to do a turtle for mouse over.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.010
I'm going to leave the other two alone.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:32.530
So now I'm going to create a new hotspot.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.460
I'm going to look around over here.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.420
And I'm going to create my
hotspot right over here.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.500
I have different tools
that I can do that.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.810
I'm going to create
just a simple rectangle.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.900
That right there.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.370
And that pretty much obscured
whatever was behind it.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.750
So I'm going to actually
change the opacity so I can

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.030
see better my actual content.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:04.720
Once I've done that,
I'm going to change the type of

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.780
action associated with that hotspot.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.400
I've got different actions that I can do.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.720
I can link to another node.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.590
There's only one node
in this VR right now.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.980
So I'm not going to do that.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.400
I can do a go-to URL,
which will either trigger a

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.740
browser or trigger a new movie,
or the ever-favorite blob,

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:28.290
which is not a 1950s movie,
but rather the ability to have arbitrary

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.010
actions associated with a spot.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.020
I'm actually going to
do a go-to URL here.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.360
And notice, again, I guess we could call
LiveStage Pro the slacker aid,

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.230
codependent maybe.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.500
I hate to look things up,
but I oftentimes... forget syntax.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:53.220
So we've got all the different syntax
for go-to URL right here for you.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.800
And I'm going to choose
one for a browser.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.480
And I don't know,
does everybody want to watch me type?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.530
No raising hands.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.540
So I'm going to skip
actually typing in a URL.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:10.830
And you folks will all trust me that
that will actually do the right thing.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.360
I'm going to close that up for a moment.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.050
And then what I'm going to do, it,
whoops,

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.120
didn't actually mean to close that up.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.660
I'm going to do some fast
tracks associated with VR.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.020
Now this stuff, what I'm about to show,
these fast tracks, this,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.830
just probably eight months ago,
would have been advanced

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.900
QuickTime Interactivity.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.160
It would have been stuff that we would
have gotten deeply in the scripting of.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.650
How do you actually do that?

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.320
Not these first ones,
which are just controls.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.750
I'm going to say, yes,
I would like some new controls.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.590
Same type of thing here.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.190
I can get new controls.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.120
I'm going to bring in some new media.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.520
Again, the folders can be used in
order to get production.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.970
I'm going to grab onto a pan left folder.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.200
I can do them one at a time.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:09.200
Well, that's the down image.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.200
This is the up image.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.350
This is the over image.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:19.840
Or I can click on my control and I can
grab onto a folder full of images,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.040
in this case, Pan Right.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.320
Just drag it and drop it and it does
all three of them for me at once.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:33.000
So I've got those two out there,
and I'm going to turn off,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.700
actually I want tilt up
and down to be there.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.810
I actually want all of them to be there,
so I'll just leave them alone.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:43.020
Ordinarily in a real project course,
I would go through and replace all

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.430
these so they have the same media,
but I'm not going to do that right now.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:57.910
So at that point, I have my VR,
and I have my VR controls.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:57.910
So if I preview this.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.840
I can tilt up, I can pan around,
and of course I still

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.340
have my old controller.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.400
We have the ability to set
just about anything you could

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.980
ever want to set in QuickTime,
and then some.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.300
So I'm going to go through,
I'm going to say, okay,

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.100
leave that QTBR controller there.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.890
What I'm going to do is
grab that same skin track.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.490
Creating a new skin track.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.700
You can see my VR right there.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.560
I'm going to go grab it, drop it, poof.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:40.150
And now I can adjust my VR.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.060
I can grab onto my FastTracks.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.590
So I can use all of this.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.640
Notice I've done no scripting, which,
if you've been to some

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.700
of my previous talks,
is impressive.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.960
So I grabbed this and
I dragged this stuff around.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.030
Everything's been drag
and drop to this time.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.990
And now, because...

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.850
I'm doing a demo.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.790
I want to actually do something
a little bit beyond that.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.460
I'm going to go out and create a compass
that will follow my movements around.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.600
So I do that and it asks me quite
politely whether I really want to do

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.420
this and I feel certain that I do.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.230
And automatically I get a new compass.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.330
Now the reason why we're always
supplying default media is because we

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.810
want to encourage people to experiment.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.460
Interactive QuickTime has so many
different ways of doing things that

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.830
it's valuable to do experimentation.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.160
It is, shall we say,
a cultural experience to do

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.660
this kind of experimentation.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.270
And we don't want you to
have to go looking for media

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.220
just because you need media.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.000
We're going to pop it right in
there and then if you have media,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.610
you're certainly welcome to replace it.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.590
In this case,
I'm going to leave this media alone.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.360
The next piece of functionality

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.000
has been oftentimes requested by users.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.120
We want to make a map off
to the side of our VR,

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.920
and we want a few things.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.180
We want to be able to
put nodes on that map.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.300
So if you click on the map,
they'll go right to that node.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:23.140
And we also want to be able to have some
compass indication right on those nodes.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.330
Now, if I have one node,
I have a very boring map.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.180
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to bring in a second node,

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.460
and I'm going to actually
create a multi-node right

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.100
inside of Live Stage Pro.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.110
You were never able to do this before.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.300
Before,
if I wanted to create a multi-node,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.520
I had to go back to my
VR authoring environment,

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.480
create a multi-node, export it,
come back over to Live Stage Pro,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.750
look at it,
and see that everything works.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.450
Now that's gotten a lot easier.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.240
All I have to do is
come over to my library.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.890
This, by the way, is my library window.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.210
We'll be talking some more
about that a little bit later.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.290
And I'm going to grab an object movie.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.090
Now, an object movie is going to
be combined with a cubic movie

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.380
to create a heterogeneous

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:19.490
So I drag this over and it says,
"Can't drop it there.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:26.290
Nope, can't drop it there,
but there you can drop it." So I drop it.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.140
Notice that all of my fast tracks
automatically adjusted their

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.460
durations because I had added this in.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.570
It's a big drag for users when they
get everything set up and they have

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.260
their controller set at a duration
of one second and they bring in

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.440
their three-minute video and poof,
the controller lasts for one

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.500
second and then it's gone.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.980
Which is wonderful functionality
if you want to use it,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.060
but if you don't,
it can be awfully disconcerting

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.430
when your controller disappears.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.270
So I've brought that in.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.310
I'm going to open my window back up.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.500
Okay.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.780
And notice I was able to switch
between the different nodes.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.000
I can also do that with a menu.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.960
I'm going to switch back over to my cubic
and now back over to my object movie.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.350
I can switch back and
forth and work with cubics,

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.130
cylinders, or objects,
even multi-state objects,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:31.100
which we'll be talking about some,
all inside of the same editor

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.400
without any fuss or muss.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.990
Now,
you'll have to stretch your imagination

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.980
just slightly because I'm going
to be having a map which is going

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.410
to point off to this object movie.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:49.230
I'm going to create a new map fast track.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.100
This is okay.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.880
Once again,
we've popped in some media for you.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.100
I don't know where this actually is,
this map.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.570
It pops up often.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.000
I'm going to place it.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.410
Now again, much like Photoshop,
if I switch to my resize tool,

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:11.100
which Guy tells me is the letter T,
which matches up with the key

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.520
that would be used in Photoshop,
I don't actually use that

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.770
particular key in Photoshop,
so I never know that.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:22.840
And now if I hold down my Shift key,
it will constrain my aspect ratio.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.600
So I've adjusted my map.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.920
I'm going to place it.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.560
And now I've got two nodes.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:36.000
I have, and I click on it,
and drop this any place on my map.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.040
That node represents the node
associated with the cubic,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.660
and this node over here is
associated with my object.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.530
Ordinarily, of course,
if we were building a map like this,

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.420
they would all be
similar kinds of things.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.200
So you may ask,
why did you grab the hip-hot movie then?

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.850
And I wouldn't really have a good answer,
except I like the hip-hot object.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.900
All right.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:04.060
Now, those are both pretty cool
pieces of functionality.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.480
I've got my map.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.410
I've got a compass.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.540
Let's take a look at this.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.140
Drag that around.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.130
I look around.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.100
My compass is moving right over here.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.560
It looks like I should have set
the transparency mode on that.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.400
And you'll notice that also the
node right over here is indicating

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.580
where I'm looking as well.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:38.200
I can set the north spot on
this VR so that north is north.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:42.270
And now if I click on this node,
I automatically go to my object,

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:48.020
and now I have completely different
type of media in the same space.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.750
That's cool.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.340
I like that.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.200
Close that up.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.570
Sound, spatial sound.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.100
It's been done.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.590
It's somewhat tricky to do
strictly on a scripting basis.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.970
Pretty fun to decompile and
take a look at what we've done

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.000
to actually implement that.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.570
But we've wanted to make
spatial sound easy for you.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.930
Click on Sounds Fast Track.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.510
It's going to create a new one.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.880
It's done it.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.420
Now I don't have any sounds in
my sound list at this point,

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.330
so I'm going to use my
handy-dandy library.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.070
I'm going to close some of
these things out since I have

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.200
less screen space than usual.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.460
Here's my sound.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.190
And I'm going to bring in two
different kinds of sounds.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.640
The first kind of sound I'm
going to bring is actually

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.900
going to be a MIDI soundtrack,
and I'm going to use

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.190
that as my ambient sound.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200
So this is a sound that's
not gradual or sudden.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.170
It's non-directional.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.170
I always want it to be playing.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.200
I could adjust the volume if I wanted to.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.190
I'm going to drop it down a little bit
so it doesn't overpower everything.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.780
And plop that right there.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:08.390
And now since it's non-directional,
there are no spatial components to this.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.000
The next sound I'm going to want to do,
and all of your cell phones

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.270
are turned off right now,
right?

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:18.770
The next sound I'm going to want
to do is this cell phone ring.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:23.130
And cell phones can be non-directional
when you're at a place like this and

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.770
everybody's cell phone is going off,
but I actually want them

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.630
to be at a specific place.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.400
I'm going to pop over to my cubic,
and I want my cell phone to be

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:41.040
associated with this heavenly
statue right over here.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.250
My bad.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.720
I should have created my
soundtrack in my cubic,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.450
and I didn't do that.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:58.500
So, without further ado,
I'm going to use my timeline to kill.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.890
Remember,
no electrons were hurt while I do this.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:05.880
I'm now killing my soundtrack
and opening back up again.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.410
I wanted to be in my cubic when
I was having this experience,

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.670
so I created a new sound fast track.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.710
And yes, as you just saw,
you can have different sound,

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.540
spatial sound associated
with different media.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.240
Once I do that, I'm going to go back out
and grab my in-flight,

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.370
switch that back to non-directional,
come over to my cell phone,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.650
drag and drop.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.710
Now, I want to be right here
when this sound happens.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.440
So, I'm going to grab this.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.640
I'm going to turn it to
where I'm currently facing.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.130
This arrow indicates where I'm facing.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.170
And I'm going to spread this out.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.440
I can set the extent of the sound.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.860
When am I going to
start to hear the sound?

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.370
I can also set it how
much tilt do I need.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.420
Well, I want it to always happen,
so I'm going to stretch that tilt

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.900
over the entire extent of the movie.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.210
So once I've done that,
I'm going to change that

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:09.220
from gradual to sudden.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.080
And now I'm going to preview that.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:25.030
Okay, first we can hear the,
if you listen very closely, yes,

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.780
the MIDI that was non-directional.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:33.020
So as I look around here,
I'm getting this lovely media experience.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:38.200
I'm able to have my media map
show me where I'm pointing.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.140
And now when I come across here,
I can be interrupted by a cell

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.620
phone just like real life.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.680
You can't get any more
immersive than that.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.870
All right.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.240
Now, I could dive down into the debugger,
but that would be the old, brutal,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.110
advanced mic.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.340
But we're going to-- we'll get there.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.620
OK, so we're going to close that up.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.820
So we saw a lot of advanced
functionality in VR.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.220
And except for showing
that I could decompile,

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.700
I've done absolutely no scripting.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.400
That does not mean, however,
that Live Stage Pro doesn't

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.970
have scripting chops.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.940
It definitely does.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:30.240
And in our next couple of pieces,
I'm going to showcase a couple,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.580
you can see this.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.380
By the way, before I show those,
I wanted to show a really lovely piece.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.470
I just love this piece.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.300
Notice we have a skin.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.900
We have a cylinder VR that
we can look around.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:53.700
We've got controls that we're
able to roll over and move around.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:59.970
And we have a map that we're
able to check things out.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:06.500
All of this functionality is
now pretty much drag and drop.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.290
That's pretty impressive.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.600
Which goes to show that human beings are
getting caught up with sooner or later.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.680
I guess there's a new movie
coming out that's going to show us

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.460
that the machines will rise too.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:28.600
So I'm going to open up Superfluid and
we'll be talking more about this piece.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.020
We're actually in a few
moments going to start to look

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.600
underneath the hood of things.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:38.600
A little more detail at what is
involved in hardcore advanced.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.590
And when I pop in here,
we have really many of the same things.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.710
I've got a controller
that I can move around.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.250
I have a volume slider.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.740
We have behaviors that allow you
to create this kind of a slider

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.980
without any scripting knowledge.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:03.480
And if I click on one of these pieces...

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:10.600
It automatically loads in the
VR and now is panning around.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:17.090
This system is actually set up to pay
attention to how much activity I'm doing.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.800
Notice when I clicked on this,
the media stopped and

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.090
now I can control it.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:27.280
But the idea was that
if the user's not doing,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.050
the media gets progressively
more psychedelic.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.100
And that was the intention of the band.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:40.100
Sometimes you want to just sit
back and chill to what's going on.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:44.350
And as you can imagine,
if I go full screen on this,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.790
I put the wrong version on this one.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.940
A real full screen would
actually go full screen,

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.830
but this will do since I have
a very large monitor here.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:59.390
Notice that as I haven't done anything,
the media is now getting

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.660
more and more excited.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.840
It's adjusting the
FOV or the field of view.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.240
It's doing a pan.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.010
And as I move around,
it gives me control.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.740
A lot of what advanced
QuickTime Interactivity is about is

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.900
about paying attention to the user.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.440
If I switch over to the finder,
what happened to my movie?

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.490
It shrunk itself down.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:32.530
When I come back to the media, poof,
it brings itself back to life.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.960
See,
we were thinking about the doc and the

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.700
expose stuff just along with Steve.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:50.440
So the same type of control that you
would expect from a QuickTime experience.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.450
I can drag this around and play with it.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:59.930
Some things you might not expect from VR:
the ability to change its graphics mode.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.000
So now I have a somewhat
more psychedelic experience.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.070
Let's go see Hollywood Friends.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.560
We all have friends in Hollywood, right?

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.950
And I can, of course,
turn these things off.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.020
All of a sudden I went,
did I go to an X-rated one?

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.180
I was pretty sure I didn't,
but let's go to Monsoon because

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.600
that's a little less controversial.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:26.780
And the idea that the band really wanted
to get across here was this kind of

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.460
kaleidoscope between music and space.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.140
And one of the ways that we were
able to capture that was to use

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.790
cubics in order to encase this.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.760
Notice it's now realized that, hey,
Mike's talking, so it's going to go off

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.800
and start to entertain you.

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:47.710
But we also realized that we
could express some philosophical

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:52.730
points on this media,
such as the ability to feel fenced in.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:59.000
So you notice we've dropped
an overlay over the entire UI.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.210
Still working.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.250
And once again,
I can be in control or the

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.520
movie can be in control.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.700
And just in case you want to know
whether you can do two overlays at once,

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.990
yes, indeed you can.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:21.320
Or I can reset these.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:28.150
Now, overlays and all the rest
of this media is great,

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:32.100
but if you have to download all
of the media associated with

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:37.900
superfluid in one very long push,
it's going to be very unpleasant.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.070
So,
we've done a couple of things on this.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.720
One, those overlays,
and there are a number of them here,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.730
are all dynamically loaded.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.200
QuickTime, starting with version 6,
introduced the ability to

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.560
dynamically load sprite images.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.040
In addition to all the other
wonderful things that sprites could

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:02.690
already be getting their media from,
such as video tracks or flash tracks

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:06.530
or even URLs that you've hard-coded,
now we can actually

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.560
dynamically load those in.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:14.100
So, all of the media associated with the
overlays are loaded on user request only,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:20.040
and then cached so that...
if I ask for it once,

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.420
I don't have to go back and
reload it a second time.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:27.460
And...

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:33.040
I think that's all I want
to say about Superfluid.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.340
A very fun piece.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:36.340
Oh.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.120
One last thing I wanted to say.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.160
Now, Dee hates this feature,
so I will point that out right away,

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.420
but I happen to love it.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.150
The idea is that when
I am closing something,

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:54.030
I don't necessarily want,
as a content creator, just to let,

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.480
if you'll excuse the expression,
let the user just vanish.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.940
So in this case,
what we do is we fade out the music,

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.860
show a logo, and once the music is
all the way faded out,

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.290
poof, the movie goes away.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.740
All right, now this piece,
since I've been talking

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.390
about what Guy doesn't like,
this is some of the

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.370
stuff that Guy does like.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.200
Guy was very involved with this piece.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.700
I think this, I don't know,
it was obviously done for Acura,

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:34.830
but I don't know what

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.090
I'm going to show you how a
company actually did this.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.100
But you'll notice there's a
number of hot spots around.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.990
And as I move around,
I can select one of them.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:48.000
I'm going to select on the dashboard.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.990
I do a transition.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:51.990
I pop up new media.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:57.340
The Acura Bose music system in the
TL Type S includes AM/FM stereo,

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.800
a cassette player,
and a six-disc in-dash CD changer.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:07.130
The user is able to move things around,
still know where they come from.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.880
Notice the lines that are indicating
where this feature comes from.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:16.160
Select further points inside of my VR.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.620
Did I say this was all
created with Live Stage Pro,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:19.980
by the way?

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.020
I'm supposed to say that a certain
number of times per half an hour.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:28.200
And I can do all the types of
adjustments that you'd like to

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.250
do right as they are relevant.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.970
And there was a wonderful
talk given here yesterday by

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.430
Laurie Schwartz and Mark Sando.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.270
Mark pointed out that each of
these little details in and of

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.500
themselves is not rocket science.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.260
It's not incredible.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.620
But it's the attention to those details
that makes the experience down here

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.700
in the gut feel something immersive,
something unique, something that you want

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.200
to get involved with.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:02.030
And as an anecdotal evidence,
because I'm not actually able to

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:06.510
release the actual statistics,
we did a series of studies

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.170
for retention on these things.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.860
And I think that's what we're
going to see in the future.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.030
And I think it's going
to be a huge challenge.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.710
But we're going to see how much
activity did people do when they were

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:14.680
actually using these environments.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.680
And you would be staggered by
the amount of time that people

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.700
actually spend on these if they're
actually able to interact with them.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.460
And that includes straight-out video.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:30.480
Just putting it in a skin
already helped on user retention.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.540
Having all the branding be consistent
helped them keep on message.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.840
Then if they were able to look at
background information and other things,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.870
I think it's going to
be a huge challenge.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:46.970
But I think it's going
to be a huge challenge.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:40:02.100
[Transcript missing]

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.870
I mentioned that LiveStage
Pro now works with multi-state VR.

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.840
Does everybody know
what multi-state VR is?

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.140
You are so much ahead of me, John.

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.460
I didn't know what it was.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.650
I looked at this thing and went,
multi-state VR, that means what?

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:26.210
Well, let's take a look at what it means.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.500
Nice VR.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.080
Object movie,
I can roll it back and forth,

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.060
I can tilt it.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.300
That's nice.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.860
Ah, another state.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.210
Aha, a third state.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.070
A wonderful piece of functionality.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.690
All in the same space,
all in the same media container.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.100
The ability to have the same
object at different states.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.000
Not a big surprise.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.410
I don't know why I didn't figure it out.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:01.430
So how do we do that?

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.980
Let's go out and take a
look at what Guy has done.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.760
I have over here a Sprite track.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.780
And notice as I pull this up,
some people in the back of the

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.710
rows are happy and some people
who are worried that I'm going to

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.960
pull out the old scripting monster
start to lean back in their seats.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.920
And indeed, you're right.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.130
So I've clicked on this and I can see
the different tracks that I've got.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.600
This one here named Sprite
1 with an untitled sample,

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.380
shame on you, Guy.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:40.550
I'm going to open this up and I'm going
to first change this to be a nice name,

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.850
State Modifiers.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.500
Now, does anyone know why I am -- well,
actually,

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.340
I'm not allowed to ask you because
you have to go up to the microphone.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.340
The reason I am so fastidious
about naming these things with real

00:41:54.340 --> 00:42:00.280
names is because invariably some
amount of time goes by and then

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.760
the content owner either calls me
up or sends me an email and says,

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:10.290
"I want you to change or extend
or fix something that has a

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.590
bug." And I look at it and if
I haven't put in reasonable names,

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:21.020
then I have to hunt
around for what I've done.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.200
I don't like to do that.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.200
And I'm betting you don't
like to do that either.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.550
So I'm encouraging you all to
use names in order to make your

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.280
projects easier to understand.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:34.350
So what have we here?

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.560
We've got digits 1, digit 2, and digit 3.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.100
Very interestingly named.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:44.830
And if I look at mouse clicked, aha,
everybody knew I was going

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.510
to pull out the old script.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:53.230
Now notice some of the nice functionality
we've gotten for is the ability to get

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.970
more screen space when you need it.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.760
Right over here,
Guy hasn't put in any comments,

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.330
and I can bet that Guy's going
to punch me several times after

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.760
making fun of him so many times.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:17.680
But I'm going to put a comment over here,
and that is, if the state is not current,

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.510
and you'll notice that if
I had all of this typing...

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.240
You want me to change the color?

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.890
I will certainly do that,
but let me show you this first.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.770
If I had it in the original way,
I would not be able to see that content,

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.670
and I would get to get scrollbar happy.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.180
Now, I don't like scrollbar happy,
so I close these things

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.140
off as appropriate,
and then I'm able to not see it,

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:52.630
but I can because I can
go over to my preferences.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.010
It's just in like the last few
months that I don't do the old

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.900
OS 9 thing and come over here.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.970
And I can come over here and say Editor.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:07.580
And I can change all of these things.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.890
So that is Comments.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.140
And notice its color is gray.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:19.420
And I can come over here and say, well,
let's make it orange and kind of bright.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.140
And notice my, oh,
that's a bad choice because it happens

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.950
to also be similar to our constants.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.330
But I could change the color
of my constants as well.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.810
So once I've done that,
what he's doing here is he's

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.710
finding out the current view state.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:46.300
And then he is setting the image index.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.600
He's not doing it by name.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.500
He's setting the image index by number.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.800
And if this were me,

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.270
Boy, am I in trouble,
because he's bigger than me.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:05.720
I would say, view one on.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.780
And what I would do is come right
over here and put this dollar sign,

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.690
which indicates that it
is part of a definition.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.710
And I would say, view one--

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.460
View 1 underscore on.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:27.730
And now I would be using a
symbolic reference to my image.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.740
Now there's two advantages to this.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.730
The first advantage is the
one I've already mentioned,

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.450
that projects are easier to work with.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.530
The second advantage may be
a little less noticeable.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.100
Let's say that my graphic artist says,
you know, I don't like that background.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.420
I'm going to put in a new background
and I want you to put it right here.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.600
And I drop this in.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.060
And I drop this in.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:55.570
If I've hard-coded my index,
if these numbers change,

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.680
my project breaks.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:02.820
If, on the other hand, I do them by name,
then no matter if I take this one

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.440
and pull it all the way back here,
it still works.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.470
I like things that work.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:16.420
All right,
so we've taken a look at VR view states.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.400
Oh, I should mention one other thing.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:25.540
A common question that we get is,
are those actually variable at runtime,

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.810
those constants that we put out?

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:31.990
And as the word indicates, constant, no,
they're not.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.320
What happens is we take
a look at the name,

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.290
we find out what that number is,
and that's the actual

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.110
value that goes out there.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.870
I won't name any names,
but I did get a very amusing email

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:48.040
from somebody in New Zealand,
a former QuickTime engineer,

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.680
who couldn't understand why he was
not able to change this variable,

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.160
and I was amused.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.420
But I'm amused easily.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.640
Okay,
now I want to show the same persons,

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.390
to give you some indication
of who that might be,

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:08.940
a tool that I use a
lot with LiveStage Pro.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.910
Which is Deliverator.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.120
Deliverator.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.890
And what I use Deliverator
for is working with media that

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.120
I'm going to actually deploy.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.120
I'm going to take an original
exported from LiveStage movie,

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.910
I'm going to drop it on Deliverator,
and it opens up two windows.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.690
The first window is the
actual movie content.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:36.070
This piece, by the way, was shot,
the VR was shot by Janie Fitzgerald,

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.950
and the skin,
which ordinarily would be a skin.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.110
Except in this environment.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.120
Was done by Robert West.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:49.700
And in here, I am able to do a number
of amazing things.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.110
Useful amazing things.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.660
Time saving amazing things.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:02.040
What I'm able to do is simulate what the
different download rates would be like.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.250
Now, right now,
we've got a 100-base intranet,

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.340
and things are good.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:14.690
John Alper was downloading something,
and he said various expletives that I'm

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:19.090
not allowed to repeat on this microphone,
but they were all happy expletives.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:25.860
But most people still today
have this kind of experience.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.300
Remember, this was the original output
from Live Stage Pro Movie.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.810
Yes, that is a very nice blue cube.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.700
Yep, okay, we're loading.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.960
You'll notice it shows
the percent of the movie,

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.920
how much K has been downloaded,
and the number of seconds this

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:42.900
person has endured this experience.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.080
Ah, I have a blurry VR.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.730
Very nice.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:51.300
Okay, I've, oh, yeah,
I have a piece of good VR coming in here.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:56.070
I'm 93K into this,
and I'm seeing a lot of blur.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:58.640
I'm not a very happy user.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.690
This is not the kind of
QuickTime interactive experience

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.400
that we really want to have.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:08.990
What we want to have is an experience
in which the preview track comes in,

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.360
and that's the reason it's blurry.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.460
It's not because of QuickTime.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.720
It's that in order to
get a fast download,

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.460
QuickTime supports the ability to
have a preview track of your VR.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.720
Notice, I'm 190K into this thing,
and I'm still not seeing any

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.230
of those beautiful controls
that Robert West did for us.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.520
Where are they?

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:33.580
Well,
that brings us to our second window.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:39.180
This window over here is our media map.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:48.560
It shows every block of media out there.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:48.560
So I can come over here.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.440
I thought my machine crashed.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.080
I almost passed out.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.290
I see my movie resource up here.

00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:02.740
I see a whole lot of free space and
some very fine QuickTime engineer

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:06.600
is going to explain to me why that
free space is there and how I can

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.200
get rid of it totally someday.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.230
But that day is probably not right now.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.680
I can see that I'm getting
some VR samples out here and if

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:22.280
I come all the way down here,
why look, there are my controls.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.510
But they're at the very end of the file.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.660
Do I want them to be
at the end of the file?

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.770
No.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:33.270
I want them to be coming in
exactly when I want them to.

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:37.970
Now Flash supports the ability to say,
well, you can have it any way you

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.260
want as long as it's either
back to front or front to back.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.210
Which way do you want?

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.630
Not so in QuickTime.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:47.200
In QuickTime I can decide exactly
where I want that media to come in.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.130
I like to call it choreographing
the media arrival.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.710
Now there are a few things more
dull than watching Mike drag

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.430
around blocks of media.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440
But I'm going to show you.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.080
How I can do it.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:04.310
Yes, there is a block of media moving,
and now I'm going to drop

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.050
it right down over here.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.120
And it wouldn't let me.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.550
It actually showed me on the little hand,
but I was not paying attention.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.380
So the little hand's saying, yes,
I can drop it there, and once I do it,

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:14.370
it moves it for me.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.600
Now, that piece of media will be
loaded at that particular time,

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:22.860
excuse me, at that particular position
in the actual file.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.550
Rather than,
everybody want to see my address book?

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:31.970
I'm going to close that one out,
and I'm going to show what I did

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.700
in order to deploy this media.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.480
Pop it back over to the Deliverator.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:41.500
Again, I have the media open.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.940
I'm going to,
we'll leave it actually at a dual, no,

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.360
I'll put it back down onto 33 to be fair.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.110
And now I'm going to simulate
what that experience would be like

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.550
having moved my media blocks around.

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:58.470
After just 3.9% or so,
I get my preview track.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.760
I have now my skin.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.590
So I have my user only 8% into
the movie already has full

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:10.050
context as to what's going on,
and those things already work.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:12.480
That's pretty hot.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:18.680
In terms of control over
your deployment media,

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.050
Deliverator is an awesome tool.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:25.460
So if you haven't checked into it
and you have web-based delivery,

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:26.950
I highly recommend it.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.860
And one additional
feature I want to mention,

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:34.350
but I was too much of a coward to demo,
is the ability to work with locked

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:36.790
content across multiple people.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.440
So for instance,
Guy and I have done projects together,

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.660
and he's in Vancouver,
and I'm in Los Angeles.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.000
Los Angeles.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.550
Los Angeles.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:51.020
I'm in La Honda,
and if he wants to pass me

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.760
media that is copy-protected,
ordinarily that couldn't be done

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.220
because once it's copy-protected,
it's pow.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:03.240
Deliverator allows you to do a
challenge and response so that you can

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.760
actually work with that copy-protected
media across multiple people.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.500
Tremendous tool, doing a lot of things.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.970
If you use it,
please give John Summers feedback

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.900
on how to make it better.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.290
It is an onward and upward tool.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.840
Does anyone like that Deliverator tool?

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.170
I'm pretty damn impressed.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:34.950
Okay, so right down here I've got
Apple Scripts structure.

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:42.380
And what I want to show here is the
fact that Live Stage Pro in version 4

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:49.310
internalized the need for all of you to
be able to create automated projects.

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:52.610
In the boom days,
when all of us were making money,

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:56.240
in the boom days,
which will come back again someday,

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.670
I did what I called boutique wear.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.940
I could spend all the time I wanted
working on something because

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.180
it was supposed to be a one-of.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.240
Now,
when I actually need to make some money,

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:14.370
I need to be able to make something and
use that template over and over again.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.020
And we have the ability to do that.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:21.180
If you create... If you create
a project in Live Stage Pro,

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.400
you can record every step you do.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.130
You can then go back in and do
any editing that you want to do.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.480
And then you can create,
if you would like,

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.440
and I'm sure you'll want to,
you create a droplet that

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:36.440
will give you the ability.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.260
First, I need to locate this droplet.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.030
I only really need to do this once.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.140
And go to my desktop.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.260
There is my template.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.300
I choose that.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:55:01.940
And now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take some media

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.840
I'm going to do this from
media where I know where it is.

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.600
I'm going to grab a couple of videos.

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.600
I'll grab three videos.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.410
I'm going to drag it onto my droplet.

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:22.570
It goes off very dutifully.

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.150
Notice it's doing all
the adjustments for me.

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.440
It's processing that.

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.690
It's output it.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.000
It's doing the next piece.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.700
Cha-ching.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.690
Cha-ching.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.350
We like that.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.440
Less caffeine, more money.

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:51.390
Okay, and where did those things go?

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.160
Well, they're right over here.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:58.720
All in a folder, neatly output for me,
and ready to go.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:03.470
♪ ♪ That's cool.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:11.470
Zoom in right along.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:18.240
One of perhaps-- what time am I over?

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.790
I looked at that and said, "Uh-oh.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:24.750
If I have four minutes,
I'm in deep guano." One of my favorite

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:29.720
aspects of QuickTime is the fact that
it supports third-party components.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.790
And don't get me wrong,
the folks at Apple are some

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:36.200
of the brightest and most
enthusiastic that I've ever met.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:39.400
However,
they don't have every idea out there

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:45.160
and they don't have the ability to use
every engineering dollar that Apple has.

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:49.450
And that means that third parties
need a way of being able to

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:52.770
extend QuickTime in a nice,
robust way.

00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:53.890
Apple's done this.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.010
They've created a
component download program,

00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:00.590
and this allows somebody to
develop a component that does,

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:04.500
let's say, 3D,
and allows them to deploy this

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:09.260
actually on Apple's servers so
that when a user hits some of their

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:14.410
content in a QuickTime environment,
it will go out to the Apple server,

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:18.030
grab onto that component,
and download it.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.120
And then the media can be used.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.330
Now, I'd like to say that that's
a very easy thing to author.

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.680
And I would like to say that.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:30.680
And it is pretty easy,
but it's not super easy.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.270
And so I want to show actually
how that can be done because I was

00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:38.700
scratching my head for a while,
and I figured maybe you folks are too.

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:47.390
The first thing that I do is
I create what I call a gate movie.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:53.940
Let me first go cripple my player.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.670
So I need to quit out of this.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.650
I'm going to remove the component

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:27.600
[Transcript missing]

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.050
And now,
since my QuickTime has not been launched,

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:36.370
when I go back into it,
it won't know anything about Axel 3D.

00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:42.910
And when I launched this gate movie,
it says, hey, the component is missing.

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.010
Should I download it?

00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:45.840
By all means, please do.

00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:49.010
It goes out there and
after a moment or two,

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:51.300
thank goodness for networks.

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.530
Chugga chugga chugga.

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.630
Dave Singer pointed out the
value of watching progress

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:02.470
bars in a meditative way.

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:09.470
Now, being legalistic,
first they have to tell me about

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:14.050
all the things that I must accept,
and you must accept them too.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:17.600
And now, because they want to
scare the pants off me,

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.600
they put up a dialogue that says,
"You have installed software

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.970
that may not be available to
currently open movies." Now,

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.490
that would scare me,
because if I'm a user,

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.920
I want to go right on
through to my media.

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.030
I hate opening things up again.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:34.900
But I'm going to say okay.

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.540
And notice my movie down here said, hey,
don't worry.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.020
No need to close.

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.330
It's all handled.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:52.300
I click on this and in a moment
I have my actual 3D content.

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.330
I'll show how to do the
gated movie in a moment,

00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:57.800
but I want to show off a little bit
of Axel 3D because I don't know how

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.360
many of you folks have seen this stuff,
but it's way cool.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.460
So I can spray paint
particles in my world.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:09.260
I'm spray painting leaves,
very into leaves,

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.020
living in the woods myself.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.250
That's cool.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.360
I like that.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.350
I can also change those
leaves on the fly.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.400
I spray paint some
more in that rendering,

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.920
change some more.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.300
I can even see them in wireframe.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.210
I'm going to grab this.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.740
I'm going to give it some wind.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.350
So now those particles are being
affected by forces in the environment,

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:41.890
forces stronger than you or I,
and being blown away.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.400
Now, imagine trying to create
these with sprites.

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:50.250
Even Matthew Peterson would
quail at such a prospect.

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.090
But wait, there's more.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:57.990
I can also dynamically
change the color of things.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:02.760
And it's only because I'm lazy that
you can only change the background.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.880
We will, actually we've already posted,
no, no, that's false.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:13.480
We will be posting in tomorrow,
not only this project,

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.990
but we will also be posting
another project which gives

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:20.760
even more degrees of freedom.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.580
You can control more things.

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:28.500
And both the Axle project and
the Live Stage project will both

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.700
be available from Stage Door.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:40.190
And Stage Door is a fantastic resource
on the Totally Hip website where you

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:48.690
can get tech notes and sample projects
and inspiration and mailing list,

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.280
archives.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.990
So to show how nice that
Axle looks when it's larger,

01:01:55.210 --> 01:02:00.740
notice that I've increased the size of
my movie and everything still looks good.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:04.360
Now my bitmaps over here,
they don't look quite so good anymore

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.450
because I did that intentionally.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:13.010
But my Axle content, being vector-based,
looks great.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.500
I believe we have, yeah we do,
Justin is in the audience.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.410
I would like you to give a
hand if you would to Justin.

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:27.050
Justin created the media handler
for this and the OS X version of the

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:30.050
authoring environment and it is hot,
way hot.

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.310
That's from Mind Avenue.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.270
Okay, now I promised that I would show
how the Gate movie was done,

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:45.680
and true to my word,
I shall go into Live Stage Pro and

01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.690
pull out once again the script.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:58.800
Notice all of my tracks are named.

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:00.130
And so are my samples.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.480
So when I open this up,
I've got one thing, and it is the cover,

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.110
which is this track right here.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:11.240
All the rest of this is just
graphics to grab your attention.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:27.040
And once I do that, I look at the script,
and on frame loaded, what do I do?

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:27.040
Well,
the first thing I do is I go out and...

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:33.400
That was Steve Israelson
getting back at me.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.340
It's true, there are no comments,
but look how nicely

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.400
formatted that code is.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.000
Anyways,
what it's doing here is it's saying,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.800
"First, go out and check whether I've
got an importer for Axle." Now,

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.890
if you're wondering, "Well,
how do I know these names?"

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.540
Blood, Sweat, and Tears.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:56.380
No, actually,
you can get this stuff out on Stage Door.

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.700
I'd like to say there's a really easy
way to find out this information,

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:00.320
but I can't.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.340
Francesco's nodding his head,
there is an easy way.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.650
Oh, QScript, really?

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.650
Stylin'. I can show something else.

01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:18.890
The QScript reference, which I use a lot,
if I type in component,

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.020
If I would spell component correctly.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.160
No silent R in there, thank you.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.690
And we have load component.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.830
Oh,
I probably have to go up to the index.

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:33.040
But if I come into here and
I search down deep enough,

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.580
hence it's not easy,
I would be able to find it right

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.720
in this handy-dandy window.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.090
I use this a lot,
the ability to kind of look around.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.760
Let's see whether I can find Axel.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.310
No.

01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:48.160
Let's see if I can find video.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.180
Oh, so indeed they are, no?

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:53.960
Those are them?

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.700
Them or those?

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:56.700
Okay.

01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:00.020
If you're really interested in how
to see this in the reference guide,

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:01.280
hit me after and I'll show you.

01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:02.900
Don't actually hit me though.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:08.310
So after I've determined whether
or not the component is there,

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:13.300
I'm checking to see whether it has a
version number that's greater than zero.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:19.350
If it does,
then I flip the image that says, "Hey,

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.600
image is ready.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.870
Axle loaded and ready.

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:27.040
Quick to continue." If,
on the other hand, I don't,

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:31.700
then what I do is I flip the
image to "Need to load." Indeed.

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:32.610
Need to load.

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:33.950
Component missing.

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:35.220
Please download.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:38.620
Okay, then I do this down here.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.440
Set idle delay to 60.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.420
Now, what I'm doing there is I'm
saying to the environment,

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.530
hey, I'm going to want to check something
periodically to see whether

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:50.160
that download really happened.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:56.240
So if I pop over to my idle handler,
I can see the counterpoint to this.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.750
The idle handler, once a second,
goes out there and says, hey,

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.550
is that component there yet?

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:08.470
And once it is, then it turns around,
excuse me, if it's not there,

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.130
it invokes it directly and says,
load component,

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.440
go get the importer for Axle.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.660
If you were to ask me
about these two numbers,

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:20.480
I would have no really good answer,
so please don't.

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.270
It embarrasses me.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.230
Once I've done that,
that's going to actually pull up that

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:33.490
dialog that was doing the component
download and then away it goes.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.720
Once I've actually found it,
then it's--oops,

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.630
I didn't actually show that part.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.490
Once it's actually found it,

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.210
Then it is going to set
the image to loaded.

01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:54.860
And I've got my image.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:59.340
And away I would go
into the movie itself.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.640
That way the user is able to use
third-party components without having to

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.330
reload anything into their environment.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.460
So all of that, the component download
stuff and the actual stuff,

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.500
will all be on Stage Door tomorrow.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.040
Zoomify.

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:25.450
Zoomify is another third-party
component that we support

01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:28.930
directly in Live Stage Pro.

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:32.840
You're able in Zoomify
to have a VR environment,

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.060
a cubic environment, much like Qt VR.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:40.040
But notice as I look around,
things are a little blurry.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.840
Once I let go, things come into play.

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:48.360
Now, if this was all it would do, well,
I'd rather have Qt VR.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:54.200
However, what about if I wanted
to zoom in to my controls

01:07:55.990 --> 01:08:02.930
This media is being dynamically loaded
so that I get a higher resolution

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:06.290
as the user actually does it.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.120
Muy cool.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:27.900
[Transcript missing]

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:36.160
Including the ability to do some things
that you couldn't actually do in QTVR,

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.240
like roll the camera
right and roll it left.

01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:43.400
This is for the roller
coaster fans in all of you.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.910
And the reason it's able
to do that is there is an

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:50.900
actual OpenGL space behind it.

01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:57.000
So they're really knowing that there is
a 3D space that they're working with.

01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:58.840
Very cool plugin.

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:02.640
My hat's off to what they've
been able to do there.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:07.690
So is that really hard stuff to
code inside of Live Stage Pro?

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.780
Positively not.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:15.040
Those actions are very straightforward.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.660
I have a sprite check that has
two kinds of sprites in there.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:24.710
It has a monitor sprite,
which actually does all the updating

01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:30.090
of where things are in terms of
pan and tilt and roll and whatnot.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.320
And then I have an operator
that just pays attention to

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:37.350
which control was pressed,
and then it performs that action.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.500
So here we can see the kind of actions

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.600
The kind of actions that we have.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:56.870
It says, hey, if we're zooming in,
Zoomify Zoom in.

01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:59.100
Pretty straightforward stuff.

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:02.300
So if you've got VR that you
want to get one of these kind

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.810
of progressive environments,
Zoomify is something to

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.840
really take a look at.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:11.480
And Live Stage Pro is the environment for
integrating all of your QuickTime media.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.500
Yeah, I know,
I miss my calling in marketing.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.690
Okay.

01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:22.720
Now, all those things were pretty cool,
and we liked it, and we had fun,

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.180
but you're saying, come on, Mike,
that's not truly advanced.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.910
And I'll say, well, really?

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:30.630
Seems pretty advanced to me.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.270
But there's more.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.840
In some version of QuickTime,
which is eluding my brain at the moment,

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:48.650
five, thank you, QuickTime introduced the
ability to work with XML.

01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:52.850
Well, actually, introduced the wired
ability to work with XML,

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.330
more correctly put.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.700
And I got to tell you,
when I heard about this, well,

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.280
I started drooling and other things,
but I was pretty excited.

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:06.800
He's telling me,
"Get going." And what we're

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.200
able to do with that is actually
exchange to the server a lot of

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.670
information in a structured way.

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:15.670
So I've created a little skin here.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.090
Over here you can see a QT list.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.090
Notice it's structured data.

01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:22.990
I've got a list.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.100
I can drill down into this.

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.260
Over here I have the
representation of that list.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.620
I'm going to put in a little
chat program that basically

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:36.800
got written over a weekend.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.400
I'm going to put in a name.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.710
I'm going to put in a little message.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.280
And notice I put that
little apostrophe in there.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.890
Now when I actually send that,
I'm pressed Enter.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:02.690
You can see the XML that
was sent up to the server.

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:07.020
And right over here,
you'll notice that we're putting in

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.110
some... I guess it's not really a tag.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.540
I forgot what they call these things.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:15.180
What he said.

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.050
What was that again?

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:20.080
Entity.

01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:22.090
Well, that's a nice generic word.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:25.600
So I can put in entities that
represent some of the characters

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:33.080
that would confuse HTML,
excuse me, which would confuse HTTP GET,

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.990
which is the underlying mechanism
that is being used to pass

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:39.060
information back and forth.

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:45.120
I'm going to close that window up,
but there's more.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.460
One of the things that everyone
who's ever worked with QuickTime in

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:53.400
a serious way in a browser
environment has wanted to do is,

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.750
let me pass data into the movie.

01:12:58.190 --> 01:12:59.540
Please.

01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:01.180
You can do that now.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.780
First, let me show you what kind
of stuff I'm talking about.

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:08.160
Let's say I had a playlist
that I want-- playlist is kind

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.420
of a bad example in some ways,
but it's a good example for my purposes.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.140
I wanted to pass in something
that looked like this.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.100
From the browser,
maybe spit out from a database

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.560
dynamically into a web page,
and then passed into the movie.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.540
Beginning in QuickTime 6,
you have the ability to pass these in.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:35.340
So I've got a little text file out here,
which is an example that I wanted to use.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:38.140
And I'm going to use a
freeware application done

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.620
in France called Peugeot.

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:43.080
Did I mention it's free?

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.380
Wonderful program.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.990
And it allows me to build up
all of the information that

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.210
I would want to embed in a page.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:56.190
So if I go over to QT list, I can say,
yes, I want to pass a QT list in there.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.710
And I want to import a list.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400
There it is.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.160
Now it's in there.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.390
And now I can say show code.

01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:16.760
I'm missing that grow.

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:22.220
And now I can see all of
my object and embed tag.

01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:27.900
And you can see that I have a parameter
called Movie QT List that actually

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.400
allows me to pass structured data,
volumes of it if you want,

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.210
structured data into
your QuickTime movie.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.490
Tremendously helpful.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:41.470
And the last thing I wanted to show.

01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:44.300
And then I'm done.

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:51.040
Is a piece that myself, Janie Fitzgerald,
and Robert West did.

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:58.040
And it uses XML and
QTless quite extensively.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:05.380
It does a complete tour of the
Los Angeles Metro's red line.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.970
You have a flash track down
in here that I'm able to zoom

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:11.690
in on and move things around.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.530
Right now I'm in North Hollywood.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:17.230
I'm going to drop that
audio track down a bit.

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:21.650
Over here I have a hotspot.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:25.310
As I can see,
you can see up at the top right up here,

01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:27.300
it indicates what that hotspot is.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:29.420
That's a flash track actually.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.060
I click on that.

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.850
If you listen closely,
you can hear new audio being

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:37.820
associated with this particular node.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:45.100
Now there's, I think there's about 126
or 128 nodes in this piece.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.650
Now if I had to represent
all that hand-coded,

01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:53.300
I'd be very old, very frustrated,
and very bored.

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:55.170
Three things that I don't
want to be right now.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:00.950
Instead what we did was we created
an external representation,

01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:03.960
simple XML file, and we read that in.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:09.900
Not only that, so all the audio,
all these images down here,

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:15.050
even where on the map I am,
is all represented in that XML file.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.710
This also gives me the ability,
notice it says travel eastward.

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:21.200
If I click on this,
it reads in the other XML,

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.130
and now it's doing it in Spanish.

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.460
Notice it's going to adjust the map.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.740
It loaded in new images down here
and adjusted that map from reading,

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:38.620
actually having already read and cached,
the XML representation of where

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.990
on the map I would be moving to.

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:42.700
This is a very cool piece.

01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:45.640
I wish it was online and
I could show it around.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.330
It's not quite yet.

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:52.340
As soon as we're able to get it online,
we certainly will.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.820
But in case you're going to ask,
it's not.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.920
Notice it moved over here.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.210
I can also click on
the map and it will go,

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.920
instead of going from
platform to platform,

01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:07.690
it goes onto the street level.

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:12.600
So another thing that's represented
in the XML is the street level

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.500
and what is the platform level.

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:19.250
Some of these stations have four nodes.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.810
Some of them have seven nodes.

01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:22.100
Some of them have nine nodes.

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.380
Some of them have 13 nodes.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:28.350
So you can imagine I need a very
flexible way of representing data.

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:31.150
Structured data is well
represented in XML.

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:32.740
What a great match.

01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:37.970
One last thing I would like to show
about this is I've kind of moved around.

01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:40.790
I'm going to pop over to
Hollywood and Western.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:43.670
I'm going to turn off my hot spots.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.720
I'm actually doing a few
things behind the user's back.

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:50.130
First off,
I'm tracking everything you're doing.

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.420
Every control you're pressing,
every station you go to,

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.000
every node you're going to,
I'm tracking it all.

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.670
And I'm putting it all into a QT list.

01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:02.700
And no, I'm not sending it to the CIA.

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:06.510
But I do have the ability to
upload that and analyze it,

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.310
and that is very helpful
information for designers.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.990
But it also gives me the ability to say,
go back.

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:15.960
Uh-huh, it switched stations for
me and put me at that node.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:16.930
Go back again.

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.130
Yep, now I went to that other station.

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.110
Go back again.

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:24.990
It's back to Universal City now,
and now it's going to go from node to

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:28.100
node all the way back to where I started.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:32.600
So I'm going to make a definite
go back because I'm representing

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:34.680
it all as QTless internally.

01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:36.710
Thank you.
