WEBVTT

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.700
Thank you very much and
welcome to session 500,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.320
Wireless Directions.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.360
It's truly amazing how much wireless
has permeated our lives since

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.080
we introduced AirPort in 1999.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.580
In today's session,
we're going to hear from product

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.250
marketing going over the current state
of the union of where wireless is.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.470
We're then going to look at several
updates that have happened recently

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.560
with AirPort 3.1 and move into futures
that we'll be integrating with Panther.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.840
So with that,
I would like to introduce Lars Rehder,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.690
who is the product marketing manager
for wireless technologies at Apple.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.280
Thanks for coming today to the
Wireless Directions session.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.540
Hope everyone's having a good show.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.080
I think it was pretty amazing to be
able to get one of those cameras.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.950
I wish I could have one.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.760
A little envious.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.410
I'm a big chatter, and I want to get on
the video chat thing.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.400
About three months or so ago,
I was asked to put some slides together

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.620
to sort of capture what's happened over
the course of the last year in wireless

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.480
and extract from that some of the trends
or some key bits of information to pass

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.110
along to you as developers that you might
be able to use in your active wireless

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.320
solutions that you're working on today.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
Or if you're sitting on the fence
wondering whether or not you need to

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.010
make the investment in wireless or want
to make the investment in wireless,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.850
sort of a gentle nudge in the direction
of getting started with your solutions.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.260
The flow of the presentation
today is really to start talking

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.740
about 802.11 at a grander level,
if you will, or more broadly.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.440
Then, with the help of two of our
studly wireless engineers,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.940
Phil Kearney and Paul Rekieta,
we'll talk about some of the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.460
updates to AirPort Extreme.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.000
Then, I'll come back in and
talk about Bluetooth.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.590
Then, at the very end,
I'll actually begin a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.070
discussion or a dialogue about
where we could take wireless,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.670
how we can get it to the next level,
and some of the opportunities

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.140
that lie within that.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.220
Then, time permitting,
we'll have some questions

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.400
and answers at the end.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.990
Flickr doesn't want to work.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.960
Before we actually get into 802.11,
I want to talk a little

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.240
bit about the matrix,
the wired wireless matrix.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.470
This is a slide that we actually put up
last year at the Developers Conference to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.500
sort of really assist in clearly
positioning the wireless technologies

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.860
against their wired counterparts.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.160
And in the context of
the time it was done,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.070
it was actually a very useful
and important slide in that there

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.530
was a lot of sort of confusion,
particularly around

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.680
Bluetooth at the time.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.700
So with this simple slide,
we've actually done a lot for the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.010
industry to really focus folks
into the right general areas.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.200
This is also something that's
permeated not beyond Apple.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.130
There's folks,
other major players in the industry

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.040
that have adopted similar positioning,
as well as organizations.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.740
Like the Bluetooth SIG or
the Special Interest Group,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.400
which I'll come back to and
talk about a little bit later.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.400
The message here is
actually fairly simple,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.920
but it's extremely powerful.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.800
And here, really, as a developer,
what we suggest or recommend is

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.950
if you're working on a solution
that requires a lot of networking

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.510
or requires the transmission of
large amounts of data over the air,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.150
we really suggest that you
gravitate towards 802.11.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.690
If, however,
you're thinking about more peripherally

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.640
oriented solutions to a computer or are
not sending as much data over the air,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.660
and that data tends to
be very bursty in nature,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.950
then Bluetooth is probably more
appropriate for you to use.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.550
So let's jump into 802.11,
beginning with AirPorT Extreme.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.640
AirPorT Extreme is the
third-generation AirPorT product

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.620
that we introduced this year,
just January, at this very same facility,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.920
the Macworld San Francisco.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.420
And wandering around here today,
I've actually noticed quite a number

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.200
of folks who have actually picked up
an AirPorT Extreme-enabled system,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.530
which is really exciting to see.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.070
And whether you know it or not,
you're part of a very special statistic,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.940
which I'll come back to in a few minutes.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.310
And having had actually
those units there,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.500
I'm sure you've actually firsthand sort
of felt the power and the flexibility

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.420
of the AirPorT Extreme product.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.740
But I'm not sure if you're aware or not,
the actual design,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.110
the roots of the design
for AirPorT Extreme go

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.560
all the way back to 1999,
when we built our first AirPorT product.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.610
At the time, the design goals for that...
The design goals for that product

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.900
were essentially to make it fast,
affordable, and easy to use.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.380
That was the mantra for the
original AirPorT product,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.920
and packaging that all together was a
very successful wireless launch for us.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.740
As last year,
as we were looking at AirPorT Extreme,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.940
and coming up with our design
goals for this product,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.920
we kept those three things at heart.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.870
Those were still part of the
core aspects for AirPorT Extreme.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.920
But we didn't stop there.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.910
We actually went further.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.700
We've talked to a lot of customers,
whether they're consumers

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.410
or institutions,
and captured from them their

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.740
desires and their concerns as well.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.910
So we added in two more elements
to the design of the product.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.860
One is compatibility.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.800
This was a big message.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.520
Folks are telling us,
"No matter where you go with wireless,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.030
how you're taking it forward,
make sure you don't leave us behind,

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.720
who invested with you back in 1999,
when the first

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.650
AirPorT products came out."

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.170
So compatibility is an important
piece to the AirPort Extreme solution.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.880
The other is flexibility.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.450
We heard time and time again from
various folks different stories.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.740
Some that say, you know,
my Extreme network is great,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.490
but I can't quite reach out to the far
room in a house or across the pathway,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.040
if you will,
to another building on a college campus.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.740
Or we've heard folks talking about,
you know, I've got a lot of base stations

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.160
that are up and running.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.190
I want to be able to dial back some of
that power to prevent channel overlap.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.650
We did that.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.350
We provided those
features in there as well.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.840
We also heard from folks that said,
really, you know,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.420
it would be nice if we could
share some more resources that

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.540
were available then to all the
clients that were on the network.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.850
So we provided USB printing as well.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.740
One of the biggest changes
actually that we made to this

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.070
product was under the hood,
and the transition from

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.940
802.11b to 802.11g.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.960
Now if you remember,
or if you do a Google and go

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.320
back to about a year ago today,
and look at some of the

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.900
articles that were written,
it wasn't at all clear that folks

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.350
believed that 802.11g would even
come close to being finished.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.720
And at the beginning of this year,
as we were shipping

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.120
the first products out,
there were folks that were writing,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.270
saying, oh, you know, wait.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.140
Don't jump in just yet.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.120
You don't know if your manufacturer
of your product is going to leave

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.780
you behind and actually get you
up to the final specification.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.370
Well, as we know,
in the last week and a half,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.710
802.11g is now a standard.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.960
And we've also introduced,
a week after that, last Thursday,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.660
an AirPort 3.1 update that brings
all of our users up to 802.11g

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.560
compliancy in a free download.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.860
So for those of you not as
familiar with the A0211G,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.300
we really see this as our next
generation high speed wireless protocol.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.700
It's what's going to take
us to the next level.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.670
What it provides is 54
megabits per second speed,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.500
so data rates up to 54
megabits per second,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.370
which is nearly five times faster
than the older AirPorT products.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.140
And this is actually kind of interesting.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.730
This may be something of key
use for you as developers,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.930
because now we're talking about
bandwidth and data rates that will

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.820
support more intensive media types.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.740
And there's some interesting
solutions that could come out of that.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.840
Air2.11g, by its nature,
is also compatible with B.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.830
It runs in the same frequency band,
so it's available for use

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.180
in all the same countries.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.880
It's essentially platform agnostic.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.770
It'll work on a Mac, on a PC,
or even on a handheld.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.970
So I want to talk a little bit
about momentum in the 802.11 space.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.840
I think this is sort of a key
trend that's happened over

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.320
the course of the last year,
starting with--

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.240
the business.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.280
If we look here at this chart,
we see essentially from 2001 to 2002

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:38.040
roughly an 18% growth in the revenue
generated from 802.11 products.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.920
This is actually quite
phenomenal if you think about it.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.830
This would have happened in
a time when the technology

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.620
industry is sort of on a slump,
if you will.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.530
And actually some aspects of wireless
as well were struggling a little bit.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:57.230
But here, wireless land,
802.11 was actually on the rise.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:02.450
Last year,
11.6 million 802.11b clients were

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.270
actually shipped out into the market.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.370
This year, it's looking even better.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.200
So far, the first quarter,
so through the end of March this year,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.910
nearly 5 million products have been sold.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.990
And if that trend continues,
we're talking about 20

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.290
million products out there,
which is nearly doubling

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.300
what we had last year.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.560
The one thing you'll note actually
on the chart is how fast and

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.380
how impactful the introduction
of 802.11g was on the market.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.750
In the course of three months,
17% of the units that were

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.240
out there were 802.11g units.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.650
This is before the product was even
sort of at IEEE standard levels,

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.770
if you will.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.540
It's actually very phenomenal
to see an uptake that quickly

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.180
in a new wireless protocol.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.540
We were very bullish on 802.11g,
and we expect that to continue,

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.510
although 802.11b is also
sort of the mainstay,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.140
the workhorse of the 802.11 space.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.290
So they'll tend to coexist probably
for the next couple of years before

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.170
802.11g sort of becomes more dominant.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.780
So the other area of momentum
I wanted to talk about was just

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.380
product momentum in general.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.910
Historically,
802.11 has been something that has really

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.260
been driven by the computing space,
whether it's a notebook or,

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.380
in the case of our products, desktops.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.700
That will probably continue to
be the case for quite a while.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.060
But one of the things we've seen
over the course of the last year

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.850
or so is new product categories
coming online with 802.11.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:45.200
Whether they're handhelds or
Wi-Fi phones or appliances that are

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.290
as simple as allowing photographs
to be sort of generated over a sort

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.750
of picture frame type of a product
or having wireless projectors.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.970
So as developers,
you may think to yourselves, well,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.700
you know,
the computer space is kind of tight.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.060
There's not a lot from a
hardware perspective I can do.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.100
There is a lot of opportunity now
to expand 802.11 into new spaces

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.820
and actually get development efforts
going in different environments,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.330
different product categories
than we've ever done before.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.030
Let's talk a little bit about
the Macintosh user adoption.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.420
We've sold over 2 million AirPort
products since the inception in 1999.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.890
And in the first quarter of this year,
it was 150,000.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.960
And as we heard in the
keynote this morning,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.720
it's actually 300,000 as of today,
which is pretty phenomenal numbers.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.730
In fact,
our AirPort business is white hot.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.700
It's never been better.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.890
We're nearly doubling
our business every year.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.630
There's a lot of momentum generated
in people adopting wireless and

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.940
going wireless with their products.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.350
This is another one of those slides
that's actually very interesting.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.380
This is that special statistic
I was talking about earlier.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.680
If you take a look at all
the 802.11b products sold,

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.000
the 11.6 million that I had
in the previous slide,

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:13.150
we'll find that 10% of those
products sold were to Mac users.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.580
And 802.11g side,
18%. This is pretty phenomenal.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.170
This is actually very significant.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.120
If you think about that
from a computer perspective,

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.420
our users make up the top
5% of the computing market.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.410
We're talking about 10%
and 18% adoption rate here.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.830
So you're really seeing a user
group that is very pro wireless,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.440
willing to invest in wireless,
willing to try out new solutions and

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.400
actually get going in the wireless track.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.450
So hopefully,
this is something for you to take

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.190
away and really consider as you're
working on your business plans for your

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.360
solutions to really consider Mac first,
because it's the right user

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.240
group to really get you going.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.230
And then if you need to,
move on to another platform.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:10.030
So the other thing I want to talk about
is locations with respect to 802.11.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.310
Up to the end of last year,
maybe just before that,

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.750
when we talk about wireless locations,
it's always been sort of

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.280
those traditional buckets.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.300
It's the home.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.760
I can browse the internet from my couch.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.240
Or I can have multiple systems
in the home share a single

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.290
connection to the internet.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.790
In education,
I unwire a whole classroom and I allow

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.220
kids to really be able to work where
they feel most comfortable and still

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.630
be able to connect to the resources,
whether they're on a campus

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.300
network or on the internet.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.200
And from a business perspective,
it was about sort of extending

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.860
the wired connection wirelessly to
parts of their office environments.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.100
That's sort of been the
traditional view of locations.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.760
And something strange has happened,
something wonderful has happened

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.840
actually in the course of the last,
say, six to eight months.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.690
We're seeing more locations
coming online than ever before and

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.010
interesting in different places.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.380
We have cities.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.870
In this case, the example is Paris.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:16.720
This is an effort underway by the city
government in Paris to Wi-Fi enable,

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.420
ideally, I think the goal at the
end is the entire city,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.780
but starting with the metro lines.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.380
So as you're coming in
to work or going home,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.410
you'll be able to get online.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:26.800
Aircraft.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.800
The traditional, you know,
verboten as far as any kind of

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.830
wireless technology is concerned
is now opening up to 802.11.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.360
Lufthansa has announced that
they will be putting 802.11b

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.230
access into their 747 aircraft,
so as I'm cruising over

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.070
the Atlantic or Pacific,
whatever it might be,

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.570
I can actually get wireless connectivity
for $30 and be able to be productive

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.590
throughout the entire flight.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.910
We see in New York,
Verizon is unwiring their

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.970
payphones and providing hotspots
for users throughout the city.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.440
So if you're on your way
to work in the morning,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.840
if you happen to stop at the donut shop,
you probably can get online

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.040
if there's a payphone nearby.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:15.420
Same goes for coffee shops and bookstores
through operators like T-Mobile,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.370
which currently have about 2,300
hotspots lit up in the U.S.,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.800
where you can actually get on
and be able to communicate,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.880
be connected.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.050
So all these different pieces,
and kind of, well, where's it all going?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.790
What's going to happen
with all this 802.11 stuff?

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:39.000
Well, firstly,
let's review the 802.11 technologies.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.840
So we have 802.11b,
which I mentioned before,

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.070
is really the workhorse for 802.11.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:17:06.100
[Transcript missing]

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.740
Technology of choice,
or the standard of choice, if you will,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:14.330
for these public area hotspots,
since it ensures the broadest

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.500
range of compatibility.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.370
AirTuttle 11G,
fastest performing wireless,

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.630
out the gates, fastest adopting wireless
technology that's out there.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.650
There's really a lot of
excitement around this.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.910
The numbers are looking really good.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.380
People are actually
adopting it very quickly,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.520
and we expect it to be the next
generation of wireless technology

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.420
that will proliferate out.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.280
And finally, we have Air 2.11a, which,
you know,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.800
I was thinking about this last night.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.000
How do you kind of explain this without,
you know, you can't really sugarcoat it.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.490
It hasn't moved much.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.150
In fact, analysts have told us that last
year a grand total of 100,000

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.360
802.11a products were sold.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.960
So there's really not been
a lot of growth there.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.940
And I think they really missed
the compatibility message,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.590
and that's really hurt them in that camp.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.080
So there's really not a
lot of movement there.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.380
So what are the takeaways from AIDA 2011?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.930
First off, business is good.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.380
Money is there to be made in this space.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.330
It's clearly the case that
there's an upward trend while

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.210
the market is going down.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.550
There are new product
categories coming online.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.440
So again, if you're not particularly
interested in joining in on

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.080
the computing side of things,
there are opportunities to create

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.500
and work on solutions that sort
of peripherally work around the

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.190
computing environment that would
take advantage of this technology.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.390
Thank you.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.900
There are more places to
connect than ever before.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.210
So now you can actually work
on a solution and kind of be

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.540
assured that more often than not,
when you go out throughout your day,

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.060
your users go throughout their
day and wherever they sort of

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.710
stop and pause for a moment,
they will be able to get online.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.100
There's lots and lots of momentum,
so I would definitely encourage you

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:12.600
to really think strongly and go forth
into developing 802.11 solutions.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.230
So from here, I'm actually going to
hand it over to Paul.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.820
He's going to talk a little
bit about the actual updates

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.770
we did to AirPort last week.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.350
Thank you, Lars.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.680
Thank you for that studly introduction.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.100
I'll try to live up to
the reputation there.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.170
I want to talk a little bit about
the software update that we've

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.250
done and what we have planned for
coming up into Panther and beyond.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.790
As Lars mentioned,
it was a year and a month ago

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.420
last year when we first started
talking about 802.11g and we

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.530
delivered that to you in January.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.470
We did a software update in the
spring and did a pretty significant

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.300
software update just last week.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.910
And is everybody in here
who is running wireless,

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.650
have you updated to 3.1 yet?

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.280
Not had any troubles?

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.280
I hope so.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.460
So good,
that really helps the show network,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.950
and we'll talk a little bit about
some of that as we go through.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.740
So I mentioned the 3.1 update.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.300
The goals there were, first of all,
compliance with the IEEE spec,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.650
but once we get into the software,
we can't just leave one thing going,

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.650
so we have to work on multiple
things all at the same time.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.720
And so we kind of took the top half
dozen or so things that we heard back

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.480
from customers and feedback that we
got to try to address some of those.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.430
So with the draft specification that
we released that we had in January,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.600
there were some issues with
performance and robustness,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.000
so we addressed those.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.740
AirPort Extreme introduced
this concept of a WDS,

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.600
which is the ability to extend
your wireless network wirelessly,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.130
so people were asking for that.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.880
In large homes,
or especially in schools where you want

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.310
to go from a main campus to a remote
classroom without having to run a wire

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:09.120
across a parking lot or a baseball field,
WDS is ideal for that solution.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.390
But the first implementation was
somewhat complicated to set up

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.740
and generated a lot of questions,
so we tried to address that.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.280
The other thing that comes a
lot... from developers especially,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.500
are requests for SNMP support,
so SNMP to get information

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.030
about the network,
get statistics about the network.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.850
So we incorporated some of
that in the firmware update,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.220
and one thing that would come up
every now and then that we felt

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.310
like would be a good thing to
do is UTF-8 character support.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.410
So that's really helpful for
our non-US friends who want

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.870
to publish network names,
publish names of base stations

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.490
using their native language.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.380
And so... We allow you to do that
now and I'll show you some slides

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.690
about that as we go through.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.110
First was performance.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.000
So one of the advantages of
delivering a draft standard,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.570
if you will,
is it allows us to get the product

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.450
out into a real world situation
and see how it's really used,

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.750
how it's used beyond just the theoretical
specifications that engineers like to

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.080
talk about when they're in closed rooms.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.710
So we saw a lot of usage
patterns and scenarios

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.800
We addressed some of that.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.940
Early on, there were a couple of common
myths that we wanted to dispel.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.860
One was that a single 802.11b
client would drag the entire

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.100
network down to 802.11b speeds.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.090
We obviously didn't want that to happen.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.890
The other thing that people would
say is that a base station next door,

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.610
a base station down the hall,
who's an 802.11b base station would,

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.100
again, negatively impact the performance
of your G base station.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.720
We didn't want to do that either.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:47.440
A couple of technologies that our card
firmware vendor delivered to us is

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:54.810
directly directed at improving that
performance in this environment where

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.700
you have mixed B and G clients and
networks and lots of other interference.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.140
One is a technology
called frame bursting.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.300
Every vendor will call it something else.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.540
Some might call it Nitro
this or Turbo that.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.930
It's just really the ability to
take that amount of time that

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.160
you have able to send data.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.380
In the case of ADF11G,
since you're sending

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.650
it five times as fast,
you might as well just send

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.350
more packets during that time.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:24.780
That's kind of what frame bursting is and
the other RTS/CTS protection mechanisms.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.180
I always wonder what the translators
are going to do with that.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.430
But basically, that's again,
so you have a G-Bay station

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.700
in your house,
your neighbor has a B-Bay station,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.510
and you don't know,
you don't know who your neighbor is,

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.930
you suspect it's Linksys because his
network is called Default or whatever.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.670
But if you both happen to
be on the same channel,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.930
you're going to be interfering and you
don't want to go over to your neighbor.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.000
But you probably could,
you could probably just connect

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.830
to your neighbor's bay station
and type in "admin admin" and

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.180
I'm going to reconfigure it for him,
for his protection.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:01.190
But this protection mechanism is really
just a way for the two base stations to

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.680
cooperate and better share the bandwidth.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.040
So when our G-base station
wants to send some data,

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.820
they'll say, wait a minute,
I'm going to send some data.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.290
The V-base station says, okay,
go ahead and send it.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.180
And then when it's done,
things go back to normal.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.210
The other is improving the
robustness of the connections.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:23.070
So again, when NATO 211 first came out,
it was highly controlled,

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.290
and it would be in
these enterprise shops,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.560
and everybody would coordinate
what channels are being used,

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.020
and you wouldn't really have
problems with interference.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.680
But now that we're selling
into more and more homes and

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.520
classrooms and small offices,
well, there's not any kind of integrated,

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.840
coordinated effort.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.030
There's just no way to know what
the base station next to you,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.340
what channel number they're on,
what other kind of

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.060
parameters they're using.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.210
So we added the ability to
look for the best channel.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.920
So when the base station starts up,
it's going to look around,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.120
scan the network, and say, oh,
I'll operate today on channel four.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.600
So that's just one of the improvements
to simplify your connections.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.200
The other is kind of a more low level
thing that happens in the card firmware.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.360
So as you know in this 2.4 GHz space,
it's unlicensed, so there's a lot of

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.360
devices that operate there.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.550
802.11 networks are one,
cordless phones are another,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.140
video distribution systems,
so if you're beaming satellite something

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.330
from your living room to your bedroom,
all those things are going to

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.400
interfere with the network.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.370
one too many.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.460
So anyway, so at the card level, again,
we just look for sources

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.100
of that interference.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.010
And when we see that going on,
we tighten up some filters inside

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.300
to better determine whether
to accept or reject packets.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.940
And that's going to have a little
bit of impact on your performance.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.560
So when that source of noise goes away,
then we go up to a faster speed.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.690
And unfortunately,
in this particular software update,

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.490
we can't do that automatically.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.180
We do some things automatically,
but you as administrator or you as

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.900
a user will have to control whether
to use this interference robustness.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.230
So if you've gotten the
3.1 software update,

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:11.110
you would notice in the admin utility,
there is a checkbox to turn it on.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.240
And...

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.440
In the menu extra of the client software,
there is a menu item that says,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.430
"Use interference robustness."
Looking at some of the bulletin

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.260
board discussions over the past week,
there's a lot of confusion

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.660
about when to use that,
when not to use that.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.040
Basically, you shouldn't use that unless
you really need to use that.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.420
How do you know when to use that?

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.900
We don't know.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.280
You have to tell us.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.420
Generally, if you think that you have
this source of interference,

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.640
for sure if you have some kind of,
like I said,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.190
a video distribution system where
you're sending video around your house,

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.800
you almost certainly want to
use it in that environment.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.640
But in most other places,
you probably wouldn't.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.810
So it's going to reduce your range.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.220
It's going to reduce your throughput.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.240
So don't turn it on
unless you really need to.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.180
But if you're in a place where
you can't get to a network,

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.020
you might as well try to turn
it on and see if that helps.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.670
But just be aware of
what that control is for.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.830
The WDS setup was the
wireless distribution system,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.350
so I mentioned that was a
little bit complicated to

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.480
set up in our first release.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.380
Under the covers,
it's really very simple.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.230
It's just that the base stations
have to know the MAC address,

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.480
the AirPort ID,
of all the other base stations that

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.920
are participating in this network.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.860
So in the first release,
you probably saw,

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.550
if you tried to set this up yourself,
that you had to go around

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.960
to every base station,
pick it up, turn it over,

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.970
find out what its MAC address is,
go into configure one of them,

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.640
enter the MAC address, the channel,
the WEP key and everything,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.500
and then go to the other
one and do the same thing,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.410
and then go to the other
one and do the same thing,

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.660
and make sure that they were
all coordinated so that they

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.670
were all on the same channel,
all with the same WEP key.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.420
And we thought, well,
that's kind of silly, because if the base

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.820
stations are all there,
if the program can see them all,

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.350
if the network can see them all,
then why not just go ahead and

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.530
configure them all for you?

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.020
So that's kind of what this panel does,
is two things.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.000
One is that if you are connected to...
what is known as the main base station,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.300
which is the base station that's
connected to the internet,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:30:50.300
[Transcript missing]

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.950
You can tell who the
IT administrators are around here.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.850
So that gives you some
statistics about what clients are

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.850
connected to your base station,
and statistics on the

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.910
physical interfaces,
how much data is going through,

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.720
what kind of error rates are there.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.370
And we'll eventually expose that through
some tool with the admin utility,

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.070
but right now it's just
available through SNMP.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.300
And then the
International Character Support.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:20.270
So this is something new,
and we've been wanting

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.800
to do this for a while.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.940
We always had to worry about
some compatibility issues,

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.290
but we just decided just to kind
of bite the bullet and go with it.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.500
So 8.2.11 has this notion
of what is a network name,

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.430
or what we call an SSID,
which is just the name that

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.290
your network is known by.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.120
And in this particular slide,
we're showing Home Network,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.410
which is the U.S.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.730
version of that.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.340
And then we're also showing Home Network,
which I think is the

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.510
Korean version of that.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.940
So the radio doesn't care.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.580
The radio just cares that
there's 32 bytes of data that

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.090
says what my network name is.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.500
It's just how it gets presented
in these kind of user interface

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.840
elements where we have to decide
whether it's how to show it.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.080
In this case,
we're standardizing on UTF-8 everywhere.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.270
Just be aware if you do this that some
PC clients and other clients may not

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.240
be able to associate with your network
until they also update to do this.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.820
But that is an option.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:23.820
And I think finally,
how many people here were at wireless,

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.840
were using wireless at
last year's WWDC and using

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:33.080
wireless at WWDC before that,
and wireless at WWDC before that.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:38.130
And so maybe these guys are the ones
that are setting up these IBSS networks.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.660
So we talked about this for
the past couple of years,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.140
but finally with AirPorT Extreme,
we differentiate now between

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.660
an infrastructure network,
so in this case, home network,

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.140
which is kind of above the line,
or a computer-computer network,

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.140
which is showing home
network below the line.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.770
So in these kind of environments
where there are these mixture of

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:04.630
infrastructure and ad hoc networks,
an AirPorT Extreme user can choose which

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.140
one of those they want to associate with.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.140
And so that's a great way to do it.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.140
In some cases, you might want to do that.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.130
But I think before I go on,
just a note about that.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.380
So this is the first day of a big show,
and you probably had some good

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.060
experiences and some not good
experiences with the wireless network.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.750
And just be aware that there are
a lot of people working on it,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.030
working behind the scenes
to make all that happen.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.720
At one point this morning,
there were over 1,800

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.140
simultaneous users of the network.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.140
So that's putting a big strain
and stress on everything.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.140
And so I think that's
a great way to do it.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.100
And in particular,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.790
Everybody in this room can help.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.240
You can help with a bit
of social engineering,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.380
which is to, first of all,
not do this yourself,

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.640
but more importantly,
if you see other people,

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.820
ask them not to do this,
which is do not create,

00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:00.300
do not turn on internet sharing and
use the same name as the show network.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.850
That helps no one and
hurts almost everyone,

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.410
so don't do that.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.070
And likewise,
don't create a computer-to-computer

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.050
network with the same
name as a show network.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:13.050
If you want to do that,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:31.900
[Transcript missing]

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.680
So just be aware, and again,
so this is a couple things here.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.960
One is the international character set.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.240
The other is this differentiation
between infrastructure networks

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.740
and computer-to-computer networks.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:47.020
And this is the interference robustness
menu item that I was talking about.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.720
With that, oh, well, the one more thing.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.460
One more thing is the
Windows admin support.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.700
So we had a Windows admin utility that
worked for the original Snow Bay Station,

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.090
and now we've updated the Windows admin
utility for the Extreme Bay Station.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.260
So it's very similar to the
Mac utility in its usage.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.460
And again, just that's up on our website.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.660
It's not on the CD,
but if you go to apple.com/airport,

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.530
you will eventually find your way to it.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.380
And the last thing,
since all of you are developers here,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.640
what you're most interested in
is what kind of opportunities

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.020
there are for 802.11.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.370
We've talked about APIs off
and on through the years,

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.640
and we're starting to
expose some of those APIs.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.620
And we have available now under
NDA if you want to do anything that

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:41.080
adds value to the client support,
like turning power on and off,

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.660
looking for wireless networks,
choosing wireless networks,

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.020
getting status information.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.050
We have some APIs that
are available for that.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.620
But you have to go through DTS,
so just send a note to DTS at

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.390
Apple.com and tell them what
you want to do and why you think

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:59.390
this API would be useful to you,
and we'll see about getting it to you.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.140
And with that,
I want to introduce Phil Kearny,

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.410
who's going to talk a little
bit about AirPorT security and

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.440
some of the other things we have
planned for the next few months.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.640
Thank you very much.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.170
How's it going?

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.880
I seem to be always running up and
down the halls of Apple muttering

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.240
all these acronyms and things.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.720
And they said, "Hey,
nobody understands what

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.450
you're talking about,
so why don't you explain it to us

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.920
and explain it to the developers,
because this stuff is

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.980
coming down the pike,
and it'll be good if

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.910
everybody knows about it,
because there are some assumptions

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.290
that sometimes people make in their
networking applications that you can't

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:47.290
make when people secure the network."
So the first thing I'm going to talk

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:51.040
about is something that is near and dear
to everybody's heart who does IT and

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.290
wants to actually secure their network,
and that's 802.1X.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:01.660
802.1X is an IEEE standard
for Layer 2 network security.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.700
What that means is you can,
in a wireless access point,

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.210
and also on a wireless network,
you can do authentication on

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:12.700
that network before the person is
allowed to access network resources.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.920
Basically what 802.1X says is that,
restricting physical access to the

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.030
medium is not sufficient for security.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.570
So any of you who have worked in the
DoD or any other government sites

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.680
know that they've had 802.1X on
their wired networks for a long time,

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.620
and 802.1X has become the basis
for the new security infrastructure

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.230
of wireless networks that I'll
talk about in a little bit.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.480
As you can see here,
if you run your Panther CD,

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.440
you will find an 802.1X supplicant.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.240
As part of Internet Connect,
one of the tabs that

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.430
you'll see is 802.1X,
and you can do your configuration

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:57.730
either for a wireless -- the airport
interface or else for the wired network.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.880
We encourage you to try it out.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.740
We've tried it out
against servers from Funk,

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.980
Microsoft, Cisco, and others,
and it works for us,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.840
but we really would like your feedback
on what works and what doesn't work,

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.580
so that by the time we ship Panther,
we have a really good 802.1X supplicant

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.240
in there that everybody is happy about.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.190
about.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.260
As you can see,
doing 802.1X authentication,

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.800
you enter in what port you're doing,
your username, password,

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:31.180
or if you're doing an EAP type,
EAP is the Extensible

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.660
Authentication Protocol,
which is used in concert with 802.1X,

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.190
for what type of security you're doing.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.490
The supplicant that's in
Panther supports TTLS,

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.930
TLS, Leap, Peep, and MD5.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.910
If you don't know what those are
and want to know what they are,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.930
you can go look on the web or come
find me sometime during this week

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:55.760
and bend my ear and I'll explain
them in excruciating detail to

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.410
whoever wants to understand each one.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.210
For any of the authentication
types that don't use passwords,

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.450
stuff like TLS, there's full support,
keychain support for digital

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.800
certificates and stuff in there.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.810
So again,
I wholeheartedly encourage all of

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:16.220
you to try it and send us feedback
and let us know how it works for you.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.690
That leads me into a
thing that we call WPA.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.330
What is WPA?

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:30.140
Well, I call it a strong interoperable
replacement for WEP.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.440
Now, everybody here who's familiar with
wireless should know what WEP is.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.860
WEP stands for Wired Equivalency Privacy.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:40.610
It's the security,
and I use that term loosely,

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:44.800
that's on your wireless network today.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:49.000
The problem with WEP is it was originally
used just to secure the radio link

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.650
at a time when the only place that
they had wireless networking was on

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.320
machine shop floors and things like that,
and people weren't

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.420
actually using it for data.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:01.160
The problems are it uses
64-bit shared keys with only a

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.480
24-bit initialization vector.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.860
This means that as you've
read all the horror stories,

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.220
the keys are easily recovered.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.320
There's no forge re-protection,
there's no replay protection.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.200
The same key is shared by
everybody using that access point.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.980
So once the key is cracked,
they have access to everybody's

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.790
network traffic that's on
that base station or network.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:28.860
Access Point.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.260
So an industry consortium
called the Wi-Fi Alliance,

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.420
or Wi-Fi,
which is where the term Wi-Fi or

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.040
wireless fidelity comes from,
they got together and said, okay,

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:43.160
what we want to do is we want to
try and make things more secure.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.590
We need a software firmware fix
for existing devices out there

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:50.270
that's cross-vendor compatible
and operates in the enterprise,

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.810
the home, everywhere,
and can solve all these problems.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.000
So they came up with
this thing called WPA,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.620
or Wi-Fi Protected Access.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.800
It's actually a subset of 802.11i.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.590
I know there's every letter
in the alphabet for 802.11,

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.210
and it's hard to keep them straight,
but again, if you want to come

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.370
talk about all of them,
I'm more than happy to.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.540
The differences with WPA,
improved data encryption,

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.220
and it says TKIP there in parentheses,
basically what that means

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.720
is instead of a 24-bit,
it uses a 48-bit initialization vector.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.740
Now, 2 to the 48 is a big number.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.340
You know, that's like over 500 trillion.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.280
So it's a really good place to
start when doing your encryption.

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.180
It has user-based authentication,
so in enterprise and SOHO situations,

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:36.250
use 802.1X with the AP,
and you authenticate every user before

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:40.440
they get access to the access point,
and people who don't have authentication

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.560
can't get on the access point.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:48.640
It uses TKIP, which is the Temporal
Key Integrity Protocol,

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.440
to make per-packet keys.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:57.000
So unlike the static key that's in WEP,
it's generating new keys all the time.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.920
So every time it feels like,
what's going on?

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:57.920
It's generating new keys all the time.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:57.920
So every time it feels like,
what's going on?

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:57.920
It's generating new keys all the time.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:57.980
So every time it feels like,
what's going on?

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:57.980
It's generating new keys all the time.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.990
Well, things might be getting a little
bit insecure here because there's

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:04.390
about 20,000 packets or less.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.120
Maybe we'll change the key.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.740
All this 802.1X stuff
is all radius-based,

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.750
so if you have radius servers,
you can hook them up to whatever

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:17.890
directory system you want,
and it'll all just work great.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.280
Testing that I've done with
WPA has been wonderful.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.680
If you have any questions about WPA,
you know, because I know there were a lot

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.560
of people who were familiar in
the wireless industry saying,

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.800
"Hey, when is Apple going to make
a WPA announcement?" Well,

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.290
there you go.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.640
Panther will include WPA support
when it ships by the end of the year,

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.000
whenever Panther ships.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.470
Beyond that is 802.11i,
which is the future of wireless security.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.530
WPA, or Wi-Fi Protected Access,
is actually a subset of 802.11 that

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.610
they brought the pieces in that
they need for legacy equipment.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.610
802.11i is going to be an IEEE standard,
but it's not likely to

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.220
be ratified before 2004.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.770
The folks in Wi-Fi decided they
couldn't wait until 2004 with

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.400
everybody yelling and screaming
that their networks were insecure.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.040
So we've taken all the pieces.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.410
For those that didn't know,
Apple is a member of the Wi-Fi Alliance.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.150
We've taken all those pieces that are
there for legacy equipment to make

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:19.040
sure that everybody can have good
interoperable security in the home.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.750
In the home, there's a mode of
WPA called pre-shared key,

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.470
which is 400 million times
more secure than WEP.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:30.120
And for the enterprise,
you can use 802.1x with EAP.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.290
Wi-Fi is currently investigating
a thing called WPA2,

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.470
or Wi-Fi Protected Access.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.820
Which replaces the RC4
algorithm with AES.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.700
We don't know if we're going to get
there before 802.11i is ratified,

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.950
simply for two reasons.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.750
Currently, with WPA,
we do the best possible fix that

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.500
we can to minimize performance
degradation on existing equipment.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.720
And as everybody knows,
AES requires a little

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.220
more computing resources.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:06.390
Unless there is another flaw found
in this implementation of RC4 or

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:11.410
in one of the other pieces of WPA,
like TKIP or MIC,

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.540
they're probably not going
to do WPA2 anytime soon.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.750
So, you know, I'm just here to tell you,
don't worry.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.800
We're tracking all the security.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.040
We're tracking all the standards.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.900
We're implementing all
the standards for you.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.980
It's going to be part of Panther.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.770
There are developer opportunities
if you want to put this stuff

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.390
into legacy operating systems.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.870
I would encourage you to do so.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.910
There is a big push for people
who have Macs in the enterprise

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.960
to be able to support this stuff.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.700
And I think... I think it's a lot of fun.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.730
With that,
I'll turn it back over to Lars Rehder,

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:52.160
and he's going to talk about Bluetooth.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.790
Love my proximity detector.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:01.740
All right, let's transition out
of wireless Ethernet,

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:07.140
move over to wireless USB,
which is what we refer to as Bluetooth.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.860
Bluetooth, for us,
is really the peripheral

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.440
solution of choice.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.640
It's the way to unwire the peripherals
that connect to your computer.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.440
And it does so in a way
that's actually very powerful.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.570
I'll kind of go through some of that.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.210
It's very simple to use.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.500
We've made it very simple to
use for a user to be able to

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.020
connect to another device.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.080
There's security built
into Bluetooth as well,

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:35.170
so you can have an encrypted
connection between the two devices,

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.220
128-bit encryption.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.710
There's also the concept of pairing.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:44.830
So as an application developer,
you can decide what is appropriate for

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:47.300
whatever the task is the user is doing.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.440
You can limit what the user can
actually communicate with and

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.460
actually force a trusted connection.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:58.510
You can also have a lot of flexibility
there on the security side.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.820
Bluetooth is also extremely versatile.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:06.120
You have a core specification,
and around that,

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:09.800
and sort of what fans out from that,
are various profiles.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.070
And essentially,
the profiles sort of map to

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:17.900
different types of devices and
allows you to unwire various types

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.010
of peripherals around your computer.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.200
And the connections
are also very reliable.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.890
At the radio level,
you can always make a connection.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:27.340
It's always very reliable.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.340
There's no real issue
there as far as that goes.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:33.230
So these all sort of contribute to a very
good user experience around Bluetooth.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.190
Now,
as far as our development is concerned,

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.070
you probably remember from last
year when we first introduced

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.480
Bluetooth as part of Jaguar,
we introduced profiles

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.910
that supported serial,
so basically a serial cable,

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:52.580
virtual cable type of replacement,
object push, dial-up networking,

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.380
and synchronization.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.860
And since then,
we've added in two additional profiles,

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.200
FTP and HID support as well.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.280
Now, I'm not actually going to go
into those in detail here.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.440
But I would encourage you,
if you're all interested in this,

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.850
to join in the session tomorrow
morning where they're going to talk

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.040
about Bluetooth in much more detail.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.850
I've got a couple of guys from the
Bluetooth team on the engineering side

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:17.560
who really dive down in a lot of detail.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.920
What I want to focus on instead is
talking a little bit about where

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.240
Bluetooth has come and kind of where we
are today and how we're moving forward.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.410
Essentially, if we look at...

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.580
If we look at the years
from '98 to about 2002,

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:40.300
those are really the early adopter phase,
or the early years, if you will,

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.290
where there were fewer units sold.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:45.450
Last year, there was 20 million units
shipped out into the markets.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.300
There was a little bit of
momentum there at the very end,

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.180
but not a lot of initial movement.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.900
The solutions themselves were mainly
external in nature and some integrated,

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.700
the integration coming primarily
on the mobile phone side of things.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.580
From a software perspective,
the connections were pretty basic.

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.480
While the connections at the
radio level were pretty reliable,

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.530
I think they were still cutting
our teeth on UI in general.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.420
For any of you who've actually played
around with Bluetooth in those years,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.770
you probably remember a lot of fiddling
around and throwing switches and

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:24.830
levers to actually get a phone to talk
to a headset or a handheld to talk

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.740
to a phone to get to the Internet,
etc.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:30.930
Also, in this timeframe,
there was a lot of ups and downs in

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:33.430
terms of where Bluetooth was going.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:37.100
The original objective was to be
a cable replacement technology,

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.160
the premier wireless cable
replacement technology.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.550
That was all fine and good.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.310
Somewhere in there,
there was a bunch of folks that

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.910
came on board at the special
interest group level and decided

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.510
to move into networking as well,
and thereby causing this confusion

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.570
around what is the right thing.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.830
I mean,
is it Bluetooth networking technology

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:58.300
or is it cable replacement?

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:02.760
And that's one of the reasons
why we put up that matrix slide,

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.000
which is the first slide I showed you,
to sort of help clarify some of that.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.730
If we fast forward or come to this year,
essentially what we're seeing is

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.650
we're seeing some momentum now in
the number of units being shipped.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.920
We're probably not mainstream yet,
but we're getting really close to

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.440
sort of crossing that chasm and
getting to the point where we're

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.960
going to see Bluetooth in more and
more and more types of devices.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.630
From a hardware perspective,
it's much more integrated now from a

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:31.550
solutions perspective and less external
dongles that are connecting into devices.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.370
The UI, we sort of figured that out now,
I think, generally speaking.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.480
And it's much easier now,
much better integration across

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.780
the different devices in terms
of a user being able to engage

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.130
and find Bluetooth within
whatever it is they're doing.

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.480
And networking, thank God,
is gone as far as Bluetooth is concerned.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:52.920
It's strictly a cable
replacement technology,

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.380
which is what it should be.

00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:00.700
Now, if we project forward to next year,
we're in a position to really

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.440
dramatically increase the
number of units that are going

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.820
to ship out into the market.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.300
We'll most likely see only integrated
solutions and maybe onesies and

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:14.030
twosies in terms of sort of more
externally plug-in type of solutions.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.740
But the main transition I think
we're going to see or we need to see,

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.720
this is kind of where you guys all come
into play for any of the application

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.070
developers that are out there.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.850
So we need to achieve a level of
transparency in wireless that allows the

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:31.550
user to sort of engage with Bluetooth at
the task level within the application.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.260
So I wanted to sort of talk a little
bit about kind of some of our design

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.840
goals and show you some examples of
that from a Bluetooth perspective.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.210
We set out to really
make Bluetooth an easy,

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.540
elegant, useful solution for the user.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.420
I think we've done a pretty good job.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:52.580
What we've done is provided
a Bluetooth menu extra.

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.930
So this is something where, you know,
basically stealing a page out of the

00:50:55.930 --> 00:51:00.300
AirPort book and providing a one-click
access for the user to the most important

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.940
Bluetooth features that they need,
be it on-off, discoverability,

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.100
and being able to set up another device.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.940
This makes it much easier for
a user to actually approach

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.510
and engage with Bluetooth.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.390
We also added in a setup assistant.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.380
So one of the things that the
Bluetooth Special Interest Group still

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:22.380
is in the process of figuring
out is how to make the overall

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.220
pairing experience easier to use.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:27.620
And that's something that will take
a little bit longer as these sort

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.410
of larger bodies take their time
and sort through that kind of stuff.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:35.120
And in the interim,
what we've provided is a very

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:39.600
easy way for a user to be able
to set up a connection between a

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.730
computer and a peripheral device.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:45.720
Essentially what we've done is we've
broken up this series of steps into

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.440
much more sort of digestible pieces
for the user to be able to go through

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.280
and work their way through the process.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.830
And it's been tremendously helpful
for them to get started and get going.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:02.110
The other thing that we've provided,
which is actually also very

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.900
useful for the user from a
user experience perspective,

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.330
is device filtering.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.150
So if you were to go out
there and search for devices,

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:15.040
say you've got an application where you
want to send a message out and you want

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.750
to be able to do it through a phone,
that you can actually filter

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.270
by the type of device,
and the user is only exposed to the

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.470
things they really need to choose from.

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.460
They don't see other types of
devices pop up on the list.

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.880
This is particularly useful
at larger conferences.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.680
Granted, this is sort of extreme,
but last week I was at

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:35.230
the Bluetooth Congress,
and you do a discovery there and you come

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:39.780
back with 75 devices if you don't filter,
which is a bit extreme for a user to have

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.710
to go through and find the right one.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.120
We've also built
Bluetooth in to the hardware,

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.620
starting with the 12
and 17-inch PowerBooks,

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.570
which were introduced in January,
and shortly thereafter introduced

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:58.720
models of the iMac and PowerMac,
where you can get Bluetooth as well.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.980
So we're very bullish on Bluetooth as
a technology to really unwire your

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.880
desktop or from a travel mobility
perspective to be able to unwire

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.620
the cables that you normally have to
take with you when you're traveling.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:18.540
So now I want to talk or show
you actually some examples of

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:23.180
Bluetooth solutions that are out there
from a synchronization perspective,

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:27.830
messaging, remote control,
and basically turning your

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:29.810
mobile phone into a modem.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.530
And one of the things you'll notice
as we walk through these is sort of

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:36.680
the common denominator across all the
examples is the level of transparency

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:41.020
that exists so that the user is removed
from the complexity of Bluetooth and

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:44.950
is really just thinking about the
tasks that they're working with.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.500
The first one is iSync.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:53.480
iSync is the application
that we developed last year,

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.120
which allows you to take your most
important information with you,

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.200
be it calendar or contact information.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.280
It follows you around wherever you go,
across the different types of

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.590
devices you would carry with you.

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:09.010
One of the main benefits of this is
being able to send your contacts back and

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:11.240
forth from a computer to a mobile phone.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.830
The transport for that
is primarily Bluetooth.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.860
If you look at this
example of the screen,

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:22.330
as a user, all I really do is worry
about checking the phone,

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.910
selecting the phone,
and pushing the sync button.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.820
There's no Bluetooth engagement
beyond that.

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:31.160
We've actually built that into
the setup process so that when you

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.960
actually set up the mobile phone,
you can opt to have

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.780
synchronization as part of that.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:40.050
This is the address book.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.360
This is actually a really fun
application from a Bluetooth perspective.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.660
If you haven't used it,
I'd urge you to try it.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.740
It's really great.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:50.720
It actually allows you to
move forward some of the voice

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:54.820
applications that you'd find in a
mobile phone over to the computer.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.000
I could be working,
and when I have an inbound call,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.530
I could see a caller ID come up.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.540
If I need to send someone a message,
I can do that via SMS,

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.700
or I could dial from the address book.

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.670
These are all done over Bluetooth.

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:09.300
Again,
the level of Bluetooth complexity here

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:13.610
is limited to the one button that's there
in the upper left-hand corner as far

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.910
as the user being able to turn that on.

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.380
Beyond that, it's sort of handled.

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.500
This is also a great application,
a lot of fun.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.690
It essentially takes your
Sony Ericsson phone and turns it into

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.810
a remote control for your computer.

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.400
Extremely powerful in that
it's based on Apple scripts,

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.320
so you can extend it any
which way you'd like.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.310
It does come with a number of
scripts that allows you to navigate

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:42.170
through iTunes and different
songs and albums and so forth,

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:45.390
as well as DVDs,
or run a presentation from

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:46.740
Keynote or PowerPoint.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.710
But it's sort of, again,
if you look at the UI here,

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:55.080
the user is focused in on what the
remote control function should be,

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.840
what the action should be,
and there's really no reference

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.400
to Bluetooth in here at all,
which is the way it should be.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.520
Bluetooth should become transparent
to the user and very sort of

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.470
seamless in the overall experience.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.240
There's another solution that's
out there called Mobile High Speed.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:15.460
And this provides sort of,
if there's three elements to the phone,

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.390
one is synchronization,
the other is sort of voice-oriented

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.380
solutions for voice applications,
the other is data.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.600
And removing the complexity of
being able to get onto a 2.5G

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:30.290
or GPRS network from the user,
so it's a very seamless experience.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.770
This application actually
handles that and provides,

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.220
again,
that connection over a Bluetooth link

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.830
and makes all those levers and switches
that are sort of required vanish

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.250
from the user and they just get on,
which is great.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.450
So what I'd like to do is actually
provide you with some tips if

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:52.710
you're working on or thinking
about Bluetooth solutions.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.060
These are generated
from a low sleep cycle,

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.740
high caffeine sort of type of environment
that we're working in for a while.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:06.040
But I think they're pretty
useful to use as guidelines.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.180
One, the challenge has been is that
for a long period of time,

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.480
Bluetooth has been extremely
hard to find for a user.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.780
In fact,
if you go to some type of devices,

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.370
you could go five layers deep on
the UI before you even find any kind

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:20.750
of reference to Bluetooth at all.

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.830
And having this kind of barrier to
the user just sort of inhibits or

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.660
prevents users from actually engaging
with the technology and using it.

00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.220
So if you're working on a solution,
we really encourage you to

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.970
move Bluetooth way higher
up in the UI hierarchy,

00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:39.360
if you will, so the user can quickly
get to Bluetooth and at

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.280
least be able to turn it on.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.780
One of the other challenges is
that discovery is an easy concept.

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.240
People get that,
but it's not always straightforward.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.770
And again,
this goes back to the filtering.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.590
Show the user only the types of
devices that they really need for

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:57.570
the tasks that they're working on
and not a whole list of everything

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:59.170
that's out there in the room.

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:02.730
Pairing is difficult.

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.060
I mentioned this before.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.220
There's a lot of
different steps involved.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.990
They need to be done in a sequence.

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.900
And again, this is something that the
Bluetooth SIG is looking at

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.250
fixing in the longer term.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.250
In the shorter term,
what we really recommend if

00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:19.180
you're working on Bluetooth,
unless the data you're sending

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.440
absolutely needs to be secure,
avoid pairing.

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.890
Rather than doing pairing,
remember where you've been.

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:29.350
Allow connections,
remember that connection,

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:32.860
expose that to the user first so
they can choose off of a cache list,

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:34.990
and then they can get right
back into where they are.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.180
What we found is essentially that most
users will wind up connecting to about

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.530
the same six or seven types of devices.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.530
So there's a good chance that if they
go in and you remember that connection,

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.150
they'll go right to that same spot again,
and it'll make it a very easy experience.

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.890
Now, if you do need to pair
because the data is sensitive,

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:52.150
then go ahead and do that.

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.030
But again,
I wouldn't make that a default,

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:56.780
if at all possible.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:01.090
So the other sort of challenge
for Bluetooth is that there's

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:04.700
limited bandwidth available
over the Bluetooth link.

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:07.840
And you really need to be cognizant
of what you're sending over the air.

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.760
And think of Bluetooth as wireless USB.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.780
It's a small pipe.

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:13.450
Don't try to send large amounts
of information over that.

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.180
Be very selective of what you do with it.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.920
Otherwise,
the user experience will suffer,

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.060
and people will get a bad feeling
about the overall solution.

00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:23.400
You don't really want that to happen.

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:27.940
Okay, so on to the last section here.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:31.460
What I really want to talk
about is where we can,

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.580
or start a dialogue on,
is where we can take wireless from here.

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:39.860
I'd be interested to get your reactions
at the end in the Q&A process.

00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:45.440
So from a user perspective,
what we're seeing is that users

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.580
have more and more wireless
technologies that they're using,

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.620
whether it's a mobile
phone or cordless phone,

00:59:51.620 --> 01:00:02.450
Bluetooth in a computer or in a handheld,
all different types, whether it's 802.11,

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.610
et cetera.

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:02.610
And there's different things
that they can do with that.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.180
For them,
it's harder to keep it all straight.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.590
They're having a difficult time
now to remember which steps are

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.200
which for which wireless technology.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.790
Really, what they're after is, again,
a level of abstraction

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.030
from the technology.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.900
They want the applications or
the developers in their apps

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.610
to take care of that for them,
so it's a very seamless and

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.090
transparent experience for them.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.390
Okay.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:31.390
So what I think needs to happen next is
really we need to get to a stage where

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.280
applications take more control over
that experience and provide that level

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.960
of transparency so that connections
from a wireless perspective are done,

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.960
are sort of task-driven and done at that
level rather than at the system level.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.750
So the user can focus in on
what they're trying to do,

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.120
which is to create or
share or collaborate,

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.750
and not really worry about,
I've got to connect, I have to associate,

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.520
or I need to do some discovery
to be able to get this to work.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.510
The other thing, too,
that I think applications should

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:03.840
start to drive towards is being more
efficient about their bandwidth and

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:06.580
know what kind of connection they're on.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.770
And based off of that,
adjust their features accordingly.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.880
And the example I always
like to use is email.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.170
So if I'm on a pretty wide pipe,
whether it's a wired Ethernet

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.530
connection or an A0 to 11 connection,
I can probably bring down my attachments

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:21.760
and all that pretty straightforward,
easily.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.640
It's not really a bad
situation for the user.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.850
But if I try to emulate that
over a narrowband connection,

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.660
whether it's a Bluetooth to mobile
phone GPRS type of connection,

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.260
you kind of almost want to have the
attachments stay up on the server and the

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:38.840
user to bring those down as they choose.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.450
But this should be something that happens
transparently for the user and not

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:44.480
something they have to remember to go do.

01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:50.180
So one of the things I want
to talk about here was really,

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.960
or as an example,
is talk about the meeting place

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.590
and kind of what it represents
today from a wireless perspective,

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:01.800
and then perhaps some of the things
we could do going forward to really

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.510
take it up to the next level.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.180
If we think about the
meeting place today,

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.180
it's really about people
coming together where they can,

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.190
again, they can share,
they can collaborate,

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.000
they can create stuff,
and having come together,

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.440
they leave having done something
better at the end of that.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.340
And in that process, typically,
they'll wind up connecting to

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:25.300
different types of equipment or
networks and different devices that

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.010
they take with them into the meeting.

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:34.730
So I wanted to show you some
examples of what's available

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.910
today that sort of address that.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.520
Today you can actually go into
a meeting and wirelessly present

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.540
whatever slides you might have to an
audience using an 802.11 connection.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.160
In this case,
the example is from InFocus.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.200
You can also,
at the end of that presentation,

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.840
work on a whiteboard type of
environment and collaborate and

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.850
work on next steps and so forth,
and then wirelessly be able to move

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:08.280
that back over to a computer and then
have it distribute via email or whatnot.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.580
E-Beam is working on something like that.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:16.200
In a meeting room,
you'll typically find a lot of handhelds.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.540
This is something where you could
actually synchronize or send a business

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.480
card over a wireless connection.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.700
Even between handhelds,
they can actually communicate and chat.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.320
These are the types of activities
that typically go on in a meeting

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.210
with respect to handhelds.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:35.070
Then there's a mobile phone.

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:36.890
Most users will come
in with a mobile phone.

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:40.020
And here again, with using an application
like AddressBook,

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.900
you can filter the calls that come in,
respond via SMS,

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:47.580
and do some of those things as well
as any synchronization that needs to

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.770
happen while you're in that meeting.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.120
But if you really step
back and look at that,

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.180
these are different kinds of things
that are in that meeting room.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.650
It's really about connecting
my stuff to something.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:03.280
And I think that the next level of
wireless solutions really come from an

01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:07.840
environment where we have achieved sort
of this transparency and application

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:09.700
awareness of what you're connected to.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.340
And to transition that model
so it's not just about my

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:16.120
stuff connecting to something,
but I can connect my stuff to your stuff.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:20.360
So take that virtual cable
from a Bluetooth connection,

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:23.450
unplug it from my mobile phone,
and maybe I plug it

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.250
into your mobile phone,
and we can do something

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.940
interesting that way.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:29.400
But it's a whole other environment,
I think, that's sort of untapped at this

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:32.650
point that really allows and
fosters collaboration using wireless

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:36.070
connections in the various resources
that are available in that room.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.540
So I think this is something really to
think about and sort of drive towards

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.980
or work to in your plans as you're
working on your wireless solutions.

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:52.670
So in summary,
what have we learned over the

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.320
course of the last hour or so?

01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:57.000
Remember the matrix.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.180
So again,
this is probably one of the more

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.540
important positioning slides you'll
see from a wireless perspective.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.870
802.11 equals wireless Ethernet.

01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:09.060
Bluetooth equals wireless USB.

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:13.900
Mac users love wireless.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.120
We can see that from their early
adoption of 802.11g and from the

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:23.120
market share positions that they hold,
which is much larger than what we

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.750
have on the computer side of things.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:31.610
802.11 has a lot of momentum behind
it from a business perspective,

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.460
from a product perspective,
and from a connectivity perspective.

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.520
So it's a really good environment
to start working on solutions.

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.670
AirPort 3.1 is a great product,
great update to the

01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:48.330
AirPort Extreme platform.

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.210
Bluetooth is on the rise.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.040
It's getting wings.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.560
There's more and more
products going out there.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.000
It's getting easier and easier to use.

01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:01.360
And it's really a great environment
to start some development in

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:04.510
from a peripheral perspective
and following along the lines

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:07.990
of some of those examples I showed
you in the different applications

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.050
that are available via Bluetooth.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.370
I think longer-term wireless transparency
is the key to move the whole category

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:19.230
forward for the user and really
generate greater adoption and really

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:21.520
drive it beyond where it is today.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:30.300
So with that, there's a slide here that
shows the places you can go

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:33.000
to get additional information.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.360
There are three other sessions that
sort of are complementary to this

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:42.220
one that are available throughout the
course of this developers conference.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.560
We encourage you to go
to the one tomorrow.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.280
It is on Bluetooth,
one that I mentioned earlier.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.490
It will be very interesting for
those of you who want to get more

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:50.920
detail into the profiles and such.
