WEBVTT

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
Hello, I'm Rhonda Stratton,
and I'm your host for this session.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.840
I work in the QuickTime group,
and this session is Designing Distance

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.240
Learning Solutions with QuickTime.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.930
Now that we've gotten the
legal junk out of the way,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.350
I will be short and
introduce Steve Bannerman,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.190
who is the CEO of CashStream,
and his company has designed what

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.510
we think is a pretty interesting
distance learning solution,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.680
and he's going to talk about that,
and he's got some other

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.770
speakers to help him out.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100
We'll have questions
and answers at the end,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.750
so if you can hold your
questions to that point,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.360
and when you do have questions,
line up at the microphones.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.070
I think you guys know the drill by now.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.150
Line up at the microphones,
and we'll take those

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.390
questions at the end.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.110
Okay?

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.100
Thanks.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.350
Thanks.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.680
So first of all,
I have to point out that when

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.220
we turned our slides into Apple,
it actually said "Designing a

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.890
Distance Learning Solution with
QuickTime," and they changed it.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.070
So we can actually,
we know our grammar and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.560
we can actually write,
but for some reason it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.140
didn't show up that way.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.800
So we have a few speakers for you in
this hour and a half session today,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.500
because I really didn't think that
you wanted a marketing guy to get up

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.800
here and talk a lot about marketing,
so we're not going to do that.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.730
But I do want to sort of start off the
presentation by giving you a little

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.260
bit of context to sort of give you a
sense for why we are what we are and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.840
how we got to where we are right now.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440
Because you know,
you don't just sort of wake up

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.040
one day and decide you're going to
build a distance learning solution,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.240
you know,
and what the market requirements

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.700
are going to be and how you're
going to implement that.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.250
But we're going to spend most
of our time with Chris Kawalek,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.200
who is our CTO,
and he's going to talk about the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.100
product and the challenges and,
you know,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.800
the advantages and all those kinds
of things of using QuickTime.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.300
And then we're going
to have a lot of fun,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.770
because we've invited
one of our customers.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.810
A very distinguished customer, Dr.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.800
Steven Erte from
Cornell University's medical school,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.370
to give you a sense of how he
actually implemented our product in

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.740
his distance learning application.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.190
So we're going to spend a
lot of time in demo land.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.600
We've got a couple of demos.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.010
One of them is actually live,
so we did our sacrifice to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.900
the demo gods beforehand,
and we'll see how that goes.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.870
So when you look at the
e-learning market out there,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.070
e-learning takes place in a few areas,
not the least of which is the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.100
classic extend the classroom
distance learning applications.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.620
But e-learning also takes
place in corporate America in

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.790
corporate training applications,
and also really is extended

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.580
now into what we consider to
be corporate communications,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.360
where people are actually holding
internal meetings using these kinds

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.760
of products and stuff like that.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.110
And you can see that this
market is actually poised for

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.590
a tremendous amount of growth.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.390
So when we first started this product,
it was really born out of a request

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.680
that I got when I was working
on the QuickTime team from a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.700
friend of mine at the Mayo Clinic,
who said, you know,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.040
I've been trying to put presentations on
the Internet using this real producer.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.300
And I've been trying to put presentations
on the Internet using this real producer.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.320
And I've been trying to put presentations
on the Internet using this real producer.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.270
And it just doesn't work.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.260
It's just not reliable.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.870
Is there anything based on
QuickTime that I can use that's

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.700
more reliable and cross-platform?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.400
And unfortunately, at the time, I said,
well, no.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.040
So what do we do?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.020
So I decided that we were going to go
and I was going to join this company.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.900
We were going to build this thing.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.630
And so we built it to the requirements
that the Mayo Clinic gave us for how

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.800
they wanted to implement a solution.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.010
And we decided, all right,
do we productize this thing,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.370
or do we just treat it as a one-off?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.540
And when you look at the
landscape of this market,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.120
it became really obvious to us
that we wanted to productize.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.420
We wanted to productize it because there
were some tremendous opportunities.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.200
But the opportunities are not just
in sort of the growth of the market,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.610
but the way other people are
actually attacking that growth.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.350
So when you look at the growth
of the market and the way this

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.100
kind of a market has evolved,
people used to compare the sort of

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.340
cost of ownership advantages of these
kinds of products against travel.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.550
And it's like, okay, well,
it's a lot cheaper to do

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.950
this kind of stuff online
than it is to get on a plane.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.810
Well, that was sort of the first
generation of these kind of products.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.630
And then you're looking at the knee of
the curve where there's an opportunity

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.000
for second generation and third
generation products to come in and say,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.660
well, okay, you don't really measure
this against travel anymore.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.730
You measure this against the
total cost of ownership for

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.020
first generation products.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.400
And you realize you're spending
almost as much on those products

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.520
as you were on travel because
of the nature of the beast.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.260
And I'll talk more about
that in just a second.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.040
So really, we come in in that sort of
second generation where we have

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.660
an opportunity to take a market
that's already been validated,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.040
where some of our competitors
have already been validated.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.860
We've already gone in and said, okay,
people believe now that

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.940
this is a good idea.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.150
And how do we take that and make it a
cost-effective idea and really drive

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.800
the price down and the functionality up?

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.110
So, just to sort of prove that
this market has been seeded and

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.140
this market has been validated,
Forbes magazine just recently,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.830
like last month,
named WebEx the fastest growing

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.830
technology company in all of tech.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.710
And so, this is a company that throughout
the sort of dot-com bust has

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.760
really been growing very,
very rapidly.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.070
And so the whole category
is really starting to grow,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.180
but we think the explosive
growth is going to come from

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.360
these next generation products.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:09:23.900
[Transcript missing]

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.450
All right, so Castream Enterprise is
the name of our product,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.380
and I'm finished now
with the marketing stuff.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.120
I'm sure you're all glad to hear that.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.050
And so at this point,
what I'd like to do is

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.420
bring Chris Kawalek,
our CTU,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.220
up and have him sort of go in-depth into
how our product works and what it does.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.430
So thank you very much.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.000
Hello, everybody.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I hope you're enjoying the show so far.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.490
I know I have.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.820
As Steve said, my name is Chris Kawalek.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.860
I'm the CTO of Castream.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.040
And I'm going to talk to you today about
the challenges of designing a distance

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.210
learning solution and how QuickTime can
help you meet a lot of those challenges.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.360
What we're going to talk about
primarily is the basic goals

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.450
for distance learning projects.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.910
This will apply to any sort of
distance learning solution that you

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.410
may be designing or involved in,
and how QuickTime can

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.470
help you meet those goals.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.670
One of the interesting things about
Castream is that we rely very,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.080
very heavily on QuickTime.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.230
And I call QuickTime sort of
an off-the-shelf technology

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.790
because it's such a rich suite,
or it has such a rich ability

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.240
to do many different things,
that you can implement it very,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.010
very easily in your application
and get lots of functionality with

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.160
not a ton of work on your part.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.580
So in our case,
we're using QuickTime for both

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.000
the audio/video playback within
our distance learning solution,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.890
the still image playback, of course,
for the slides, and we're also using

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.130
QuickTime data handlers,
which I think people aren't really

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.700
using that often these days,
but we're using the QuickTime data

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.950
handlers to actually
download the slide media,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.240
and we'll talk some more
about that later on,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.210
specifically how we're doing that.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.110
So there's several design goals that
you need to be conscious of when you're

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.900
designing a distance learning solution.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.300
The most important thing is
you need to synchronize audio

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.900
and video with the slides.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.900
Now this doesn't seem like
it's that big of a deal,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.900
but it actually is,
because in any sort of

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.900
live Internet broadcasting,
there's some sort of inherent delay.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.900
Nothing you can really do about it.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.010
All the systems involve some sort of
buffering to deal with latency that

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:18.900
may come up and that sort of thing.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.810
And it really is a big deal when you're
doing a presentation when the slides

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.880
appear at slightly the wrong time.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.540
If they appear a couple seconds
before the video stream is

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.900
talking about that slide,
it really throws off the presentation

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.900
and ruins the cohesiveness of everything.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.040
So it's very important that you
can synchronize your audio and

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.900
video with the slides in a very,
very tight manner.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.440
That's something you absolutely
have to accomplish with a

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.900
distance learning solution.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.620
One of the things that we really
wanted to accomplish was the ability

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.720
to display rich media slides,
which include things

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.770
like Macromedia's Flash,
progressive QuickTime movies,

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.080
QuickTime VR, those sorts of things,
in addition to just your standard

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.900
still Keynote or PowerPoint.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.260
slide sort of thing.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.130
You need to be able to do both
real time and on demand video.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.930
It's fantastic to be able to have
a live tool so that people can

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.750
meet and watch the presentation,
but a lot of times, I mean,

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.820
in our global economy,
in our global world,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.450
it's not convenient for people
in other countries to view

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.280
the presentation in real time.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.150
So it's really nice to be able
to archive that presentation.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.870
It really opens up your audience
so that many more people can

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.300
experience it when they otherwise
wouldn't have an opportunity to.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.310
Obviously, it has to be easy to use.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.160
It's very important for the system
to not be an inhibitor for the

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.190
people that are trying to use it,
because a lot of times,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.450
these people don't really
care about the technology.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.040
They just want to give
their presentations.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.150
They want to disseminate
this information,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.490
and they don't want the
tool to get in their way.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.010
So they're used to working in Keynote,
and they're used to

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.830
working in PowerPoint,
and they don't want the actual broadcast

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.000
of that stuff to become something
that's terribly time-soaked for them,

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.170
really, because it takes them away
from their core competency,

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.180
which is designing the presentation.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.500
It has to be cross-platform, of course.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.980
Mac OS X, Mac OS 9,
and the last few versions of

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.670
Windows is very helpful for all the
different markets that you have to be

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.920
in for a distance learning solution.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.790
So on the multiple markets thing,
each market has sort of its

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.720
own requirements that you
need to be adaptable to.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.160
So for instance,
the K-12 market has lower

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.380
equipment budgets and access to
much lower bandwidth generally.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.140
So your system needs to be able
to scale down to handle that.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.810
That's where you're supporting things
like Mac OS 9 and older versions

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.180
of Windows and things like that.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.840
That's where it becomes very,
very important.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.150
It also becomes very,
very important to be able to

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.620
have very low bandwidth slides
by using things like Flash,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.290
which is a vector-based thing,
so you don't have these

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.270
gigantic QuickTime movies.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.720
You need to have the flexibility to be
able to still be a compelling solution

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.280
with very low bandwidth availability.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.860
Now, in higher education,
you do have great bandwidth,

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.440
and you tend to have newer equipment,
so there's less restrictions there.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.420
It's a really fun market to work in.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.220
So your system also needs
to be able to scale up.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.630
You need to be able to take advantage
of that higher bandwidth so that

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.680
you're not giving these people
who have access to huge pipes,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.200
giving them presentations
that they feel that they would

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.720
be getting on a 56K modem.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.540
Corporate training is
an interesting market.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.180
They generally have good
bandwidth for corporate training,

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.060
but one of the most important things
that corporate trainers need is

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.360
the ability to share their screen,
to be able to do real-time training.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.110
And that's something that you
need to adhere to or at least

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.500
come up with some sort of solution
for the people in that market.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.260
And for corporate communication...
You have varying bandwidth

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.760
and firewalls to deal with.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.280
And the main reason is that when
you're doing corporate communications,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.870
you have no idea where any of
the people are going to be who

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.580
are watching the presentation.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.120
They could be on the corporate land.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.110
They could be at home.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.580
They could be in a hotel room somewhere.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.490
So all these sorts of things
lead to vastly different firewall

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.090
configurations and vastly
different bandwidth availability.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.420
So you need to be scalable.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.110
You need to be scalable within
the context of a single broadcast.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.690
That's really important so that
you have multiple ways to view the

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.720
broadcast for people who might have
multiple different kinds of broadcasts.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:57.800
So you need to be scalable within
the context of a single broadcast.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:57.900
That's really important so that
you have multiple ways to view the

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.220
broadcast for people who might have
multiple different kinds of broadcasts.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:03.070
have multiple or different amounts
of bandwidth available to them.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.110
Some other requirements.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.020
People obviously need
some way to communicate,

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.480
whether that communication is back to
the presenter or amongst themselves,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.780
and we'll talk a little bit more about
how we handle it in Caststream later.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.940
And polling is a very,
very important thing.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.280
Being able to assess your audience,
get a sense of where they are,

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.280
or if you're doing a learning thing,
you can actually test them,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.720
get that information back,
and use it in some sort

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.700
of constructive way.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.130
It's very, very important to be able to
achieve those goals as well.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.720
So, of these things I just talked about,
we have a couple of boxes here.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.580
We have the stuff that
QuickTime can help you with Box,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.120
and the stuff that QuickTime can't
really help you that much with Box.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.680
So there's a lot of stuff in the stuff
that QuickTime can help you with Box,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.680
which is pretty cool.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.860
QuickTime can help you
display your audio and video.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.910
QuickTime can help you
display your rich media,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.700
and I should also have added in
there that you can use QuickTime to

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.350
display your still media as well,
JPEGs, GIFs, bitmaps,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.780
all those sorts of things.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.000
QuickTime has a great system for
handling live and on-demand content.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.760
QuickTime is, of course,
cross-platform and very,

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.940
very good in both cases
on Mac and the PC.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.870
And QuickTime has this media download
capability through the QuickTime data

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.910
handlers that I mentioned earlier.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.780
So there's a few other things that you
do need to achieve kind of on your own

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.580
where QuickTime isn't really helpful.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.400
Synchronization,
that's something that obviously

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.940
QuickTime does really well internally in
terms of synchronizing audio and video,

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.380
but you do need to come up with some sort
of system for synchronizing the slides.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.020
So that's something that
you need to come up with.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.020
Chat and polling are both things that you
probably need to implement on your own.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.880
I've seen some pretty clever wired sprite
movies that can do this sort of stuff,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.270
but generally it seems to be
better to handle that kind of

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.610
thing on the application level
instead of at the QuickTime level.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.620
So here's Castream.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.500
Here's the Castream UI.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.490
As you can see, our fearless leader,
Steve, is in the video window there.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.900
So what if we had to design
Castream without QuickTime?

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.970
What would we be left with?

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.640
It's kind of an interesting question.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.120
Well, first of all, here's the Castream
UI as it stands today.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.620
First off,
we'd of course lose the video window.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.250
That's the most important thing
that we're using QuickTime for.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.450
It's handling the live streaming
and the on-demand streaming.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.090
So that would be gone,
as you might expect.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.500
But we also lose our slide window,
because the slide window is

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.090
also handled by QuickTime.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.600
This is where we display our JPEGs,
our GIFs, our bitmaps,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.220
our progressive QuickTime movies,
our QuickTime VR movies.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.590
All those things are handled through
QuickTime in that slide window.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.160
And the last thing that you might
not have expected is our banner

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.400
area is also handled by QuickTime.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.450
So we're utilizing QuickTime there
as well to be able to support any

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.410
number of media types that you might
want to put into the banner area.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.950
Generally,
people tend to put animated GIFs there,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.440
sort of like a web banner kind of thing.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.760
But you have the flexibility
to use Flash or whatever you

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.210
want in that banner area.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.650
All those things are
handled by QuickTime.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.890
Fortunately, we do have QuickTime,
so we have a UI that looks a little

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.410
better than on the last slide.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.470
So why do we choose to use QuickTime?

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.430
Well, as I'm sure everybody here knows,
QuickTime is a very high

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.600
performance video architecture.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.530
If you have a machine that's
playing back video and you're

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.830
playing it back with QuickTime,
you can be guaranteed it's playing

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.300
back as good as it can on that machine.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.530
QuickTime has the ability to
do scaling on the fly very,

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.570
very well, which is really important in
a distance learning solution,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.360
because the types of media that
you end up with that you want to

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.400
broadcast to people aren't necessarily
designed for the presentation.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.260
You could be pulling a QuickTime movie
from here and a Flash thing

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.470
from here and slides from here,
and you need to be able to scale those

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.390
things in real time so that you get a
cohesive experience on the player side,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.390
and QuickTime does an
excellent job of doing that.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.430
QuickTime supports a wide
variety of media types,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.920
as we all know, just all kinds of things.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.610
Of course, Flash, JPEG, GIF,
all the things that I've been

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.740
talking about over and over again.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.180
It's well supported
and marketed by Apple,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.080
which is a fantastic thing.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.510
For instance, a lot of times,
Apple will do revisions to QuickTime that

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:09.760
don't necessarily require changes in
our app for us to utilize those changes.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.000
Obviously, whenever a new version
of QuickTime comes out,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.660
you have to do some sort of QA to make
sure that everything's working properly.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.720
But a lot of times,
you just get stuff for free.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.020
And that's a really,
really exciting thing to be

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.610
able to base your product on.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.700
Of course,
QuickTime is completely cross-platform.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.710
It works fantastic on the
PC and fantastic on the Mac.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.420
And data handlers for media download,
that was a no-brainer for us to be

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:35.320
able to use the same code to do file
downloading on both the Mac and the PC.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.940
Why wouldn't you want to use QuickTime?

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.640
Well, basically the biggest concern we
get is that some Windows users

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.560
will need to do an install.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.820
And this is not such a huge thing.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.660
Most Windows users are used to
doing some sort of installation

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.100
for any sort of product,
as opposed to on the Mac.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.720
Most people are more accustomed
to the drag installs.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.690
So as part of the PC install,
you can easily throw up a dialog and tell

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.080
people they need to install QuickTime and
run the QuickTime installer.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.670
It's not a huge issue,
but there are some people who do complain

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.860
about that every once in a while.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.850
And it is unfortunately the
cost of being able to utilize

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.480
this fantastic architecture.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.020
So I'm going to talk one by one about
the various portions of the Castream UI.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.750
First,
we're going to talk about the video area.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.040
So what can you display
in the video area?

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.280
Well, you can display any movie
that's accessible via a URL.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.490
So this includes all the standard
media types I've been talking about,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.280
JPEGs, GIFs, and those sorts of things.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.470
But it also includes
things like ref movies,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.330
which is kind of convenient,
multi-data rate ref movies,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.720
which allows you to have, say,
two different live streams going on,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.880
one for 56K modem users and
one for broadband users.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.490
There's also lots of really clever things
you can do with ref movies as well.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.970
You can do audio-only movies, of course.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.700
You can do audio movies
with picture tracks,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.880
which is very convenient.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.040
So if you want a really,
really low bandwidth sort of way

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.090
to do your live presentation,
you can have an audio-only feed and stick

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.580
in a picture track of the presenter.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.010
So even maybe users on even 288
modems could be able to view

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.020
a presentation utilizing that.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.890
And then you pair that with
multi-data rate movies,

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.680
and you don't have everybody sitting
at the lowest common denominator.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.180
You have everybody having a customized.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.400
experience based on the level of
bandwidth that they have access to.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.220
And of course it can handle streaming,
RTSP or HTTP, or progressive,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.390
which is interesting.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.680
A lot of people tend to forget that
the QuickTime progressive download

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.900
fast start feature is a really,
really fantastic alternative to

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.770
doing a full-blown RTSP stream.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.050
So you could certainly use a progressive
QuickTime movie in the slide area,

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.040
or in the video area in CastStream,
and it's a very useful thing to

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.810
be able to do if you don't have
access to say a QuickTime streaming

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.600
server when you're doing your
on-demand archived presentations.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.190
So some of the common
issues for the video area,

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.940
firewalls are obviously something
that you have to be concerned of.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:58.340
QuickTime handles that very elegantly
with an HTTP fallback feature.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.040
New in QuickTime 6.3,
just within the last couple weeks,

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.340
is the ability to automatically
set up the transport,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.990
which is handled by this
new sheet in QuickTime 6.3.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.300
Some other common issues in the
video area are lack of bandwidth.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.300
That's obviously something
that does come up a bit.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.280
You can deal with that by doing
things like audio-only feeds,

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.300
audio with picture tracks,
like I mentioned,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.370
and using multi-data rate ref
movies to help you customize

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.290
that experience for each user.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.720
So the Cash Stream slide area,
also based on QuickTime,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.230
allows you to display any
QuickTime compatible file

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.430
accessible via a URL.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.560
So this is all sorts of still images,
JPEG, GIF, PNG, PICT, BMP,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.220
every obscure format
that you can think of.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.160
All different kinds of video,
RTSP and progressive.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.480
So most people tend to do progressive
videos in the video window.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.640
They'll take some sort of video that
they use in the classroom or whatever

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.540
and encode it and display it as a slide.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.400
But you could also do another
live RTSP stream in the

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.230
video window if you wanted.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.740
So that allows you to set up, say,
multiple cameras at an event

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.180
and have a camera on something
and a camera on something here.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.150
And you can switch between them through
the course of your presentation,

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.950
insert those slides wherever you want.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.120
And it's a very convenient,
cool thing to be able to do.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.470
You can use some of the
specialty media types,

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.220
of course.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.930
QuickTime VR, Wired Sprite, and Flash.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.130
There's all kinds of things you
can do with those technologies.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.980
And, of course, everything scales on the
fly in the slide area.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.160
So if you have slides
that are 640 by 480,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.720
they will automatically be
scaled down to the proper size

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.360
or scaled up if necessary.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.460
Obviously, bandwidth is a concern.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.860
So we do recommend if your slides
are too large that you actually

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.270
do scale them yourself ahead
of time just to save the bits.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.840
But if you're less concerned
about bandwidth and more concerned

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.640
about just getting your stuff
done as quickly as possible,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.060
then scaling on the fly is
certainly an adequate solution.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.400
And lastly,
we have the Casting Banner area,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.680
which is very similar to the Slide area,
actually.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.230
It also can display any
QuickTime compatible

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.620
file accessible via URL.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.800
It can do all the still
image types as well,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.790
video, both RTSP and progressive as well.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.800
Specialty, QuickTime VR, Wired, Sprite,
and Flash.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.790
And it's often used for animated GIFs.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.400
A lot of times we do have people also
doing Flash in this area because it's

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.810
such a lightweight media type and you
can do so much more than you would

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.590
be able to do with an animated GIF.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.320
So we're also using the
QuickTime data handlers in Castream.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.170
We're using both the HTTP and
the FTP data handlers for

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.600
downloading slide media,
which allows you to place

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.340
your slide media either on an
HTTP server or an FTP server,

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.300
whichever you'd prefer.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.750
It's cross-platform,
and it's sort of a browser paradigm.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.640
You pass off the URL to QuickTime,
QuickTime returns you a file,

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.330
and then you can do
whatever you want with it.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.840
It's very, very convenient.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:44.380
Here's a URL to some sample code about
the QuickTime file transfer protocol.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.360
So we're going to move
over to the demo machine.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.780
I think I'm still wired over here.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.210
Yes, I am, which is fantastic.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:25:01.290
And we're going to show
you CastStream here.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.600
I'm just going to adjust something here.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.980
See if this works.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.440
So this is our vice
president of operations,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.680
is that correct?

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.480
Jeff Jameson,
who's going to be talking to you for

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.640
a little bit about some of the rich
media content that Castream can display.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.540
Okay, Jeff, we're ready to go.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.900
I'm just going to send
him a message here.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:41.900
[Transcript missing]

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.840
All right,
so just let me know real quickly, Chris,

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.640
that you can actually
see and hear me okay,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.680
and we'll go ahead and get started.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.940
Okay, great.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.780
Alright, well hi everybody.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.840
My name is Jeff Jameson.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.180
I'm the Vice President of
Operations here at Cashdream.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.050
Hope everybody is enjoying
the show today so far.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.870
Wish I could be there myself,
but as it turns out,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.180
Chris and Steve need some help with
a live demonstration here today,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.150
so here I am.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.590
So, real briefly here,
I'm going to spend about 15 minutes.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.630
I'm going to talk about
what exactly Cashstream is.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.180
And then I'm going to show you
some rich media examples and how

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.850
we utilize QuickTime inside our
distance learning application.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.880
So let me jump right into things here.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.000
So you know, before I get started,
I want to apologize for

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.200
any redundant information.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.390
I'm sure Chris and Steve have kind of
talked a little bit about this already,

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.000
but flare with me and I'll
just go through it for those

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.510
folks who might have missed it.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.530
So what exactly is Cashstream?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.880
Well, Cashstream is a QuickTime-based
enterprise solution for e-learning.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.000
We synchronize live audio and
video in this window here,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.690
with rich media presentations
in this window over here.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.710
Cashstream supports both live
and on-demand broadcasts,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.370
which means while you're
seeing me here live today,

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.700
I could just as easily be recording this
and archiving for later on-demand use.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.930
Cashstream is also scalable from
almost all Internet connections,

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.700
from 56k modem all the way
up through Internet LAN.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.680
And most importantly,
Cashstream is completely cross-platform.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.700
Again, because we leverage QuickTime,
we're able to display a various amount

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.700
of types of media to the viewers,
regardless of what platform they're on,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.610
whether that be Mac OS 9, OS X,
or of course all the

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.570
iterations of Windows,
98 NT, 2000, etc.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.020
So how do you create your media for
use with presentations inside Castream?

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.800
Well,
the good news is that you don't have

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.790
to learn any new tools for Castream.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.990
You can already continue to use
the same authoring environment

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.140
that you're already familiar with,
whether that's Keynote or

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.430
PowerPoint or even Photoshop.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.050
And again,
because we're leveraging QuickTime,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.590
we're able to display some more
exotic media types like QuickTime VR,

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.040
interactive movies, and Mac Media Flash.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:06.000
So let's jump right into some
examples here of what we can

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.060
do inside the Media Window.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.130
First thing I want to
talk about is Flash.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.900
Flash is a very popular media
type these days in the web,

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.700
and it's popular because
it's not just a static slide.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.690
It's not just a bunch
of graphics and text.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.890
It actually has motion.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.680
It typically has animation of
some kind and moves around,

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.650
and that just generally
grabs your attention.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.430
And of course, you know,
being vector-based and whatnot,

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.640
it makes for very low file size,
so it's great for low-end use,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.180
for low bandwidth users.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.290
So let me show you an example
of Flash real quickly.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.520
This is a depiction of
Hurricane Floyd moving up

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.040
the eastern seaboard here.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.740
As you can see,
this slide already is much more

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.000
compelling than the slide before it.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.290
It doesn't just have text and
typical graphics and whatnot,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.090
it has animation to it.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.100
You can see the hurricane that's
moving up the eastern seaboard here.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.880
But we decided to take
that one step further,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.090
and Chris, if you haven't already,
take a look in the upper

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.000
right hand corner and you can
see some buttons up there.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.100
There's a stop and a play button.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.010
And we've added some
interactivity for the users.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.480
So go ahead and play with those
buttons and you'll be able to see

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.100
that you can manipulate this animation
and move the hurricane up the coast.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.080
Now this is a really powerful thing.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.210
You know, it's great to see the animation
and have control over this,

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.100
but inside an e-learning space like this,
this is a really great thing.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.130
Because, you know,
due to cash stream technology here,

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.100
this actual slide is cached
locally on your machine.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.840
So you're able to manipulate this
slide and click on the buttons

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.100
completely independent and free of
any viewer or moderator control.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.100
And, you know,
that's a really important thing.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.030
You can learn at your own pace.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.100
It's something that's very easy to do.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.910
You know,
and you're able to play with this

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.050
button in any kind of environment.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.190
So, you know,
a great example for use of Flash in

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.370
an e-learning tool like this would be,
for example, specifically if we were

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.760
to utilize this slide,
perhaps I would be a

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.180
senior meteorologist,
and you guys are all a

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.920
bunch of meteorologists,
or maybe I'm the

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.140
National Weather Service of some kind,
and I want to give a demonstration on,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.350
you know, the latest hurricane update,
or maybe this already happened,

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.850
and the hurricanes passed through,
and I kind of wanted to

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.680
talk to you guys about,
you know, what exactly happened.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.200
And because you have
independent control over this,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.570
you can actually manipulate this slide,
you can stop,

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.940
you can play it while I'm talking to
you and describing things along the way,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.500
you can make notes if necessary,
and that type of thing.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.760
You know, another great use of Flash is
some type of tutorial.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.730
I had seen this really great interactive
piece on an electronics company website,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.950
similar to that of
Good Guys and Circuit City.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.030
And this was a tutorial that was really
designed to help folks learn how to

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.100
set up their surround sound speakers.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.170
And they were able to simply
log onto this interactive piece,

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.090
and it showed a depiction of
a living room environment.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.100
You can click on the front of the room,
and it zooms in,

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.100
and it shows you the front
speakers and that type of thing.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.520
And then you can zoom to the
rear and learn about the rear

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.100
speakers and that kind of thing.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.040
And that's a really compelling
interactive piece in its own.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.200
But now take that piece and bring it
inside an e-learning tool like this one,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.050
and now suddenly it's a
whole lot more compelling.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.100
You've got me sitting here
actually talking to you live.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.440
So not only could you be actually
manipulating and playing and

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.920
interacting with this flash piece,
but you also have me here.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.100
I could be talking you through it.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.170
You could actually be
asking me questions live,

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.100
and I could be addressing those
questions as such if need be.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.100
So that's the first part
of the presentation.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.360
And that's a couple of really good
examples of how to utilize flash inside

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.100
an e-learning tool like this one.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.700
Okay, so the next media type I want
to talk about is QuickTime.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.610
You know,
because we're leveraging QuickTime,

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.770
we're able to display nearly all the
media types that QuickTime displays,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.260
and that's over 80 different media types.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.040
From simple, you know,
still graphics like GIFs, JPEGs,

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.320
and TIFFs,
similar to the one you're seeing now,

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.920
to a little more interactive stuff
like the flash piece you just saw.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.450
But specifically,
I want to discuss some more

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.480
proprietary technologies to QuickTime.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.960
Things that are really
more exotic media types,

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.160
like, you know, interactive movies,
QuickTime VR panoramas,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.520
and object movies.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.270
So let me show you this of an
example of one of those right now.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.540
So while this appears to
be a simple photograph of,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.320
you know, a beautiful shot of a boat
on the water here in Bermuda,

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.640
this is actually a QuickTime VR panorama.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.990
So Chris, if you would,
go ahead and grab that with your

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.990
mouse and move it around and you can,
you know,

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.840
take a look at the environment there.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.970
Now, you know,
I'm sure all of us have seen

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.930
QuickTime VR panoramas before,
but this is probably the first

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.940
time you're seeing it actually
working inside an e-learning tool.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.800
And again, because it's actually
here in the media window,

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.900
you actually have me
here to talk about it.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.790
And, you know,
a great example of use like this might

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.080
be that I'm actually a travel consultant,
and you've come to my website

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.420
to attend a travel seminar
specifically on maybe Bermuda.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.560
And I want to teach you about Bermuda,
and, you know,

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.120
I could talk to you over the phone.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.740
I could even send you some brochures.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.070
But really, by immersing yourself inside
this actual application,

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.680
you've got me here live talking to you.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.860
I can address your questions.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.630
I can tell you, hey,
I recommend a specific hotel, because,

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.530
you know, you come out the door of the
hotel and there's a dock.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.420
You walk right out,
and it's a beautiful view.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.870
And you're like, well,
I can actually share that with you.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.990
I can have you and allow you to immerse
yourself inside this whole scene.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.560
And so, you know,
the opposite end of utilizing

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.820
QuickTime VR panorama might
be to use an object movie.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.340
For example,
let's say I'm a sales manager

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.310
of a sports equipment company.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.560
And, you know,
we've got a new line of shoes coming out,

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.910
and, you know, it hasn't been released
to the public yet,

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.660
but we really want you guys,
the sales reps,

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.540
to get out there and start selling it.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.770
Well, you're going to need to see it.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.820
You're going to need to look at it.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.390
You're going to need to
hold it kind of a thing.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.660
So with a QuickTime VR object movie,
I can actually show you the shoe.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.500
I can let you spin it around,
look at it from various angles,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.800
maybe look at the tread.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.120
You know, you're going to have to answer
questions for the resellers

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.260
who are going to want to,
you know, know specific things.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.310
And maybe even I can do some really
interesting things like throw in

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.640
some wired sprite layers and maybe
have some buttons there that allows

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.890
you to show the different types
of colors that the shoe comes in.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.160
So those are a few examples of some
really neat ways of utilizing some

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.910
more exotic QuickTime types inside
an e-learning space like Cash Dream.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.530
Alright, so the next thing I want
to talk about is video.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.530
You know,
video is becoming one of the most popular

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.200
media types on the web these days.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.570
Nearly every website you go to,
you see some type of link somewhere

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:17.310
that has some kind of video to display.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.430
And with Castream,
you're able to display and show some

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:24.360
really high quality video images in
the media window here to my right.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.020
You know, video is so immersive,
it's so exciting and enthralling.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.000
It really grabs people's attention.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.240
Every time you go see
a movie at the theater,

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.740
you just sit in there and you're
really immersed and you find yourself

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.400
just getting into this movie and
you feel like you're a part of it.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.400
Well, we really wanted to bring
that kind of feeling into an

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.200
e-learning space with Castream.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.280
So, what we've done is we've, again,
leveraged QuickTime to be able to display

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.210
some really high quality videos here.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.400
Now, you know, we're on the Internet now.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.400
We're streaming.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.980
And, you know, in actually using video
for this live feed,

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.400
it's a really simple thing.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.350
It's a really great thing.

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.400
You're seeing me here at
about 100 kilobits or so.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.400
And that works great for a talking
headshot like you're seeing me in now.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.010
Of course, if I move around a lot,
that kind of thing,

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.240
it might get a lot more
pixelated and choppy.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.410
But fortunately,
because we have this e-learning space,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.530
because we have, we leverage QuickTime in
the media window,

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.400
I can show some much more high quality,
CD-ROM quality videos in here.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.970
So let me give you a demonstration
of one of those right now.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.720
My name is Steven Chase,
and we are at the Townhouse

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.200
Studios in West London.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:54.250
♪ ♪ All right.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.720
So that was a really good example
of some really high quality video,

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.140
much more compelling than the
video you're seeing me in here,

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:04.110
again constrained by the Internet and the
amount of connection that the viewer has.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.120
So, you know,
a great example of using that video,

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.800
if you've noticed,
that this video window here

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.260
continued to play simultaneously
with the video stream,

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.580
with the other video you
just saw in the media window.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.820
And I could have done some
really interesting things there.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.790
I could have turned down
the volume of that video and

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.030
maybe walked you through it.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.840
Perhaps I was, you know,
an audio engineer of some kind

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.800
and I wanted to share with you,
you know,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.400
when I went to West London to see
the townhouse studios and I met

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.360
this particular audio engineer
or that audio engineer and etc.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.310
That type of thing.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.020
And that's a really compelling way
because I can show you some really

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.210
high quality video there without having
to worry about the constraints of being

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.960
on the Internet and streaming to you.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.750
Another great example
of video use might be,

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.620
let's go back to the
travel agent scenario.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.850
You know,
I showed you the great immersive VR,

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.020
but you know, you're still not certain.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.780
So maybe I can show you some actual
video that I've taken from the hotel.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.810
I can walk you through it step by step.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.160
You know, this is the lobby.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.780
This is the the rooms look
like that type of thing.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.450
And even take you into some
testimonials from particular folks

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.180
who might have stayed at that hotel.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.110
So you can see that's a
really powerful way to utilize

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.980
video in an e-learning space.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.900
So the next thing I want to
talk about is assessment.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.710
And you know,
assessment is probably the most critical

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.100
function in any e-learning environment.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:29.100
With Castream, you're able to integrate
real-time live audience polls.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.210
You can ask either single
question polls or tests,

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:37.410
or you can actually string together
multiple questions to ask a multi-choice

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.100
test or survey type of thing.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.100
So let me show you how easy
this really is to do right now.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.100
I'm going to pull up my
poll control window here.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.230
And you know,
I can either take the time here to do

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.620
this the night before and prepare a
whole set of questions and then load

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.090
them in for my presentation today.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.100
But I actually didn't do that today.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.660
And I'm going to put Chris on the
spot here because I really wanted

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:02.040
to show an example of how easy
this is to submit a question.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.860
So Chris, if you would,
simply type me in any kind of question

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.460
that you can think of on the fly here,
and I will enter it in, repurpose it,

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.100
and follow it.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.240
to use to go back and
question the audience here.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.870
So go ahead and type in
any question that you can.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.750
Give me something here.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.200
What is the name?

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.400
Computer.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.510
Okay,
I'm just typing in my question here.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:41.800
Yesterday.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.390
Alright.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.000
So I'm going to set up a
couple of answers here.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.600
And again, I'm doing this on fire.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.470
And, uh, alright.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.600
So I put in a few different questions.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.700
I'm going to choose to
show the results to you,

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.600
and I'll explain that in just a moment.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.600
I simply update that question,
I highlight that question,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.600
and I turn around and
I ask it to the audience.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.550
Now you'll notice that a new window
just popped up above your player.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.980
That's a really subtle thing,
but I'd like to really kind of point

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.600
out something particular with that.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.090
We chose to do that intentionally,
because if this really was

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.090
a true testing environment,
I might have wanted to test you on,

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.600
you know, one of the slides that's in
the media window right now.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:28.160
And I wouldn't want to have to take that,
uh, media away in order to ask a

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.540
question to the audience here.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.600
So Chris, if you would,
go ahead and click on an answer.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.540
Um, choose any answer just so, uh,
you know, whatever.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.010
Okay, don't know I'm sleeping, of course.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.370
I'm sure everybody's sleeping there,
right.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.300
But as you can see,
as soon as Chris answered,

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.700
it updated in real time back,
showing 100% of the people here answered,

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.640
don't know I'm sleeping.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.960
And of course,
you guys are the only folks connected.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.970
If we did have some
other folks connected,

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.480
you'd see that what happens is,
is as people connect,

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.680
as people answer the question, the, uh,
the, uh, the results are updated in

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.500
real time in a percentage,
it's running constantly as people, uh,

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.170
you know,
sit there and submit their answer,

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:10.080
and it would show, as it shows now,
100% don't know I'm sleeping,

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.910
it would show, you know, 50% here,
50% there, that kind of thing,

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:13.870
and so forth.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.300
So,

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:19.660
And again, just as well,
because I asked a single question,

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.920
if this really was a
true testing environment,

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.220
I could have chosen to check,
uncheck the show poll results,

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.560
and I would have presented
the question to you again.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.480
It simply would have
asked you the question,

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.490
you would have selected an answer,
and it would have said thank you very

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.450
much and closed the window and goodbye.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.090
And the next thing would have
been a series of questions

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.840
where I could take a series of,
say,

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.340
let's say 10 multiple choice questions,
string those together, and, you know,

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.060
go ahead and present that to you.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.020
And you'd go through a similar
UI where it says question 1 through 10,

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.320
2 through 10, etc.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.030
So what do we do with all the
information that you actually,

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.280
when people submit answers,
what do we do with all that stuff?

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.400
Well, the good news is that there's
no big server on the back end.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.900
You don't need SQL Server or
anything else to manage this.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.340
All the information is submitted back to
the moderator here at my local machine.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.560
We capture things like the name
and location that you entered,

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.320
as well as the IP address of the
machine that you're connecting from.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.810
And all this information is saved
into a simple tab-delimited format

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.270
spreadsheet that you can easily
export either on the fly during your

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.060
presentation or when you're done.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.910
And bring it into any one of your
favorite spreadsheet applications

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.020
like Excel and whatnot.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.940
All right, so that is polling.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.030
So Chris,
if you'll go ahead and close that window.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:35.010
Let me go ahead and let's move on.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:41.490
All right, so we just recently announced
version 2 of Castream,

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.960
and I just want to touch on a few
of the highlight features here

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.420
and go through that real briefly.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.450
The first thing is that we now
support up to 500 concurrent users.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.330
Each iteration of the server will
support up to 5 simultaneous broadcasts,

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.420
and now up to 500 users concurrently.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.770
That means, for example,
I could be giving a presentation

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:04.190
to 250 people on this server,
as well as someone else connected

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.460
on the same server could be giving
another presentation to 250 people,

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.110
and so forth.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:13.410
We now offer a choice of window
size of the media window.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.070
The media that you're seeing
here to my right is 480x360,

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.950
and we also have a
smaller size at 320x240,

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.780
which just helps reduce the
ones and zeros for those folks

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.610
on lower bandwidth connections.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.230
We now support a great,
great feature for some

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.120
folks with disabilities.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.200
We have a slide text captioning feature.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.310
We recognize that there are
some people out there that

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:38.150
may have hearing disabilities,
and so we allow up to 1,024 characters

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.190
to be associated with each slide.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:42.520
Chris, if you haven't already,
go ahead and open up your slide

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:45.110
text captioning window using
Command-T on your keyboard there.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.510
And you can see as that window pops up,
there's a couple buttons

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.750
there to increase or decrease
the size of the font because,

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.080
again, we recognize there are some
other folks that might have

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.200
additional disabilities as well.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.360
So with CAST Stream 2,
we also support now multiple moderators,

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.240
which means that we
can have actually two,

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.000
three, or multiple different moderators
at different locations physically.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.400
You know,
I might have set up a presentation

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.400
where I've got 20 slides,
and maybe one through ten are my slides,

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.950
and I'd like to pass it off
at slide 11 to someone else,

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:17.620
say, in Boston on the East Coast.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.170
And what I can do is simply highlight
that person in my user list,

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.270
I select him, I grant him control,
and let him go through the slides.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.970
And as the master moderator,
I can simply take that

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.040
control back when he's done.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.370
And finally, CastStream has a really
powerful URL linking feature,

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:38.810
which means that you can basically
associate any URL with any slide.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.260
And it's as simple as setting
this up in the slide properties

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.400
in the moderator here.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.670
I simply type in the URL I want,
and it makes it so easy so

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:49.740
that when I get to this slide,
a user can simply click on this slide,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.940
and it will open their default browser
and take them to the associated URL.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.350
So Chris, again, if you would,
please just click on the slide,

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.020
and you can see it will open up his
default browser and take you to,

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.550
which is of course Safari,
and take you to the associated

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.280
site that I've set with this slide.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.030
Now you'll notice that, you know,
as the browser opens,

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.200
you can still hear me in the background.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.560
I still continue to run flawlessly
and seamlessly here with the browser

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.900
as it searches out for the website.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:19.890
And this is a really great way to get
people to kind of share some other

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.890
materials that you might have for
your presentation that's kind of out

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:27.980
there on the web without them actually
leaving the learning environment here.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.030
Alright, so those are the cash
stream 2 highlights.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.910
And that basically wraps it up for me,
Chris.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.160
Unless there's something else
specifically that you want

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.360
me to go back and review,
let me know.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.250
Otherwise, I will happily sign off.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.290
So is there anything you'd like me
to go back to review specifically?

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.290
No, we're good.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.140
All right.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:51.300
Well, thank you very much, everybody.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.300
Take care and enjoy the show.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.420
All right.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.530
So there's an example of our
distance learning solution.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.210
Obviously,
if you're designing your own solution,

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.260
you're going to have many similar goals
that you're going to want to achieve.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.750
We have to be most familiar with cashier,
of course, which is why it's easy

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:11.950
for us to talk about it.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:14.500
But Jeff did cover a lot
in his presentation there,

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:16.550
and some of the things
I was going to cover,

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.080
too.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.280
So I'm going to go a little
bit quickly through some of

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.640
my last remaining slides here,
and then we'll get Dr.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.340
Steven Erde up here to show you some cool
applications he's doing with Cash Dream.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.100
So can we go back to slides, please?

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.000
Thank you.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.590
So,
what sorts of things do you need to be

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:38.610
concerned about when you're designing
your distance learning solution,

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.500
other than the obvious things
with audio and video and whatnot?

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.500
So, you need to be concerned
about slide creation.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.660
You need to be able to create
slides in a variety of applications

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:48.480
so that people can work in tools
that they're already familiar with,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.410
supporting tools like Keynote,
PowerPoint, Flash, Photoshop,

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.680
Illustrator, Appworks.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.400
Those things are very important.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.670
Utilizing QuickTime allows you
to basically have support for

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.660
any application that can produce
something that QuickTime can display.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.750
So, anything that can be played
back in QuickTime Player,

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:06.050
you can play back within CashRamen
as part of your presentation.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.800
In our case,
we happen to have some actual

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.600
integration with Keynote that
we've done using AppleScript.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.830
So you export your Keynote presentation,
and then you process it with an

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.320
AppleScript and QuickTime Player Pro,
which then prepares the

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.760
slides for use with Castream.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.650
This is very convenient for
people who do use Keynote.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.380
It allows them to retain the
transitions and all sorts of

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:29.750
cool things that you have as part
of your Keynote presentations.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.460
You need to be concerned
about slide synchronization.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.380
As I mentioned before,
the video is delayed by

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.580
the live broadcaster.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.440
In our case,
we came up with a technology called

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.550
SyncSure to make certain that the
slides and the video did remain

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.300
in sync throughout a broadcast.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.200
That's something that you'll
also need to sort out.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:50.000
And here's our SyncSure slide delay
slider in the broadcast setup.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.490
You can set it anywhere from 0 to
30 seconds to compensate for the

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.190
latency in your streaming connection.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.270
There's also an additional SyncSure slide
delay compensation in the player.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.000
This is really convenient for people
who happen to be much further away

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.930
from your broadcast point than others.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.740
So if you set, say, a four-second delay,
which is good for most people,

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.880
some people, say,
in Australia might actually be

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.170
experiencing a six-second delay.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.730
So they can actually add on
to the delay if they want to

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.250
keep their slides in sync.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.600
Chat is very important because
users need a way to communicate

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.530
with the presenter or the moderator,
to ask them questions and

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.420
provide them feedback,
that sort of thing.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.120
They generally need a way to
communicate with each other.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.280
This is useful up to a
certain number of people.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.040
It can certainly get out of hand
if you have too many people.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.000
But if you have a moderately sized group,
allowing the group to chat amongst

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.500
themselves is certainly something
that is an option for you to do.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.860
It is nice to be able to turn that off,
though.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.070
There are situations where you don't
want people jabbering amongst themselves

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:47.780
while you're giving a presentation.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.990
So you can actually turn
that off as a moderator.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.150
You have the control to do that.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.610
So in that case,
the chat with the presenter

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.760
becomes sort of a one-way thing,
where you're typing in questions,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.160
it's showing up to the presenter,
and nobody else is

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.560
seeing those questions.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.500
It's also really convenient for the
presenter if you want to pick and choose

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.100
which questions you want to answer.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.340
It allows you some level
of editorial control.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.920
Chat can be globally
disabled per broadcast,

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.270
or individual users can close the chat
window if it's distracting to them.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.420
So if you're not interested in
being part of the conversation,

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.000
you can just click that
disclosure triangle.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.500
and close up the chat window and
you don't have to see any of it.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.570
And polling is very important,
as Jeff spent some time talking about.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.110
Presenters need a way to poll
the audience to perform tests,

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.700
to assess interest,
and to guide the presentation,

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.090
which is an interesting thing.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.440
A lot of our users tend to create
presentations that are much

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.050
larger than the presentation
they actually end up giving.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.390
And they ask the audience in
the middle of the presentation

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.700
how they want to proceed.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.560
They get a sense of where
they're at with the content,

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.100
and they get a sense of what
they really are interested in,

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.260
and they go to that portion
of their presentation.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.650
They have basically branching
points that can go to.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.420
So that's a convenient use
of the polling architecture.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.600
So here's an example
of a CastStream poll.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.200
In this case,
we're talking about widgets, as you do.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.850
And I'm buying a wacky Widget Pro there,
I guess.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.540
The polling system has
no back-end database.

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.130
The results are stored directly
in the moderator application.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:12.320
This is really key because it's a
little daunting for most people to set

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.570
up some sort of back-end SQL database
and all those sorts of things.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.910
In our case, the data is stored
directly in the moderator,

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.860
and it can be exported
as tab-delimited text.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.360
It's very, very simple for the user.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.760
You don't have to write a
single SQL SELECT statement.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.740
And that data can be imported
then into Excel or FileMaker,

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:32.090
AppleWorks,
or various learning management systems.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.910
So, the last thing you probably really
need to be most concerned about is

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:38.240
your cross-platform considerations.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.690
Various markets need support
for various platforms.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.200
Mac OS X obviously is
incredibly important.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.440
Various versions of Windows is important.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.930
But if you're targeting education,
you also do need to consider

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:50.770
Mac OS 9 because there's still a
lot of Mac OS 9 machines out there.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.970
QuickTime supports the vast
majority of desktops in the world,

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:55.970
so obviously you can't go wrong there.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.610
In our case,
Castrium is developed with Real Basic,

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.520
which allows for Carbon and Win32
compilation from a common code base,

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.260
which is an incredible time saver
when you're trying to ship for six or

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.600
seven different platforms at one time.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.840
So here's some links to some
documentation about the sorts

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.600
of things we talked about.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.240
Obviously,
the basic QuickTime documentation

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:16.320
can be found there.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:21.060
QuickTime data handlers can
also be found at this next URL.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.260
And there's an example file
that I mentioned earlier,

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.140
but here's that URL again.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.930
And an excellent page about
AppleScript and QuickTime Player Pro,

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:30.290
if you're interested in utilizing
the AppleScript architecture

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:34.880
to do some sort of integration
of your app with another app.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:37.600
And that's it for me.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.190
Do you want to come up and introduce Dr.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.570
Erde?

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.570
Thank you.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:47.800
Thanks, Chris.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.070
And I want to say also thanks to Jeff.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:52.400
Jeff doesn't do demos every day,
and we sort of put him on

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.300
the spot to do this one.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.090
And I think he did a great job.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.590
So thanks, Jeff.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.170
So the next speaker that I'd
like to introduce is someone that

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.480
I consider to be very lucky to know.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.400
He's a very distinguished presenter.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:04.610
Dr.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:08.530
Steven Erde is the Senior Director of the
Office of Academic Computing at the Weill

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.580
Medical School at Cornell University.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.640
He's also the Chief Security Officer.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.310
He's also an Associate Professor.

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:15.050
He's an M.D.

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:17.830
and a Ph.D., one of the
smartest people I've ever met,

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:20.720
and also one of our first customers.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.090
And I thought it would be
really cool to invite Dr.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.620
Erde to the stage to have him
give you a sense of how he's

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.180
doing this in the real world.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.790
You know, we can do demos,
and we can talk about

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:32.200
how this stuff works,
but he had real problems

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.620
to solve and real resources
to apply to those problems.

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.730
And I'd like for him to sort of give
us a sense for how he's doing it.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:39.280
So, Dr.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:39.820
Erde.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.560
Thanks a lot, Steve.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:41.980
Thank you.

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:49.300
It's fun to be part of the
Castream advertising team here.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.550
Well, just let me tell you a little
bit about where I come from.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:57.140
Basically, the Weill Medical College is
located in New York City.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.590
The rest of Cornell is in Ithaca,
in case you guys know that.

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.810
We have had a computer-assisted
problem-based curriculum,

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:06.810
which means that the medical students
are actually challenged with problems

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:08.740
as opposed to getting lectures.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.710
There are very,
very few lectures going forward.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.980
I don't know what's sort of
the makeup of this audience.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.060
How many of you are sort of higher-ed
educators versus computer geeks?

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:16.960
Any higher-ed people?

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.390
Oh, good.

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.740
Okay.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:23.180
So, this curriculum change was a
major shift in medical education,

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.620
and it's happened in quite a few
schools in the last 10 years.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.220
Cornell had been
Macintosh-based since 1984.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:35.450
We actually started doing interactive
video disks with Mac Pluses,

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:39.570
and that was through a grant with Apple,
and it was a lot of fun.

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.610
One of the things that has recently
happened is that we've opened a

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:47.500
branch of the medical school in Qatar,
and I have a few of my colleagues

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.650
here from Qatar in the audience.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:53.080
It's going to be a combined
undergraduate-graduate program,

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.540
so the first two years
are going to be taught by

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:59.250
Cornell University faculty in Ithaca,
and the medical school

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:02.870
faculty in New York City,
as well as faculty in Qatar,

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:06.040
are going to be teaching
the last four years.

00:53:07.700 --> 00:56:11.100
[Transcript missing]

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.500
Can you bring up the demo machine?

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.500
All right.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.980
Actually, I wanted to do that.

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:26.250
I apologize, this is a canned demo,
but the bandwidth over the

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.980
Internet wasn't as secure
as I would have liked.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.970
Today we're going to
talk about narcolepsy,

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:34.670
one of the most dramatic
of all the sleep disorders.

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:39.700
250,000 Americans have this
rather debilitating disorder,

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.980
whose primary symptom,
besides excessive daytime sleepiness,

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.040
is cataplexy.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.080
So this is his PowerPoint slides
that we basically took.

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:52.570
That's right, we took offline,
and you notice that the slide changes

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:54.440
are going on as he's giving the lecture.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.380
When he clicks his synchronization,
we can remotely change the slide.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:03.280
It's a really interesting topic,
and the reason I want to show

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:07.660
this is because the extra media
that we have really makes the

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.280
point of why this is important.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.880
It's an attack of REM sleep
right during the daytime.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.160
So you're not going from
slow-wave sleep into REM sleep.

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.320
But in this case,
you're going directly from

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.290
wakefulness into REM sleep,
and it's rather frightening.

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.820
Now these attacks are self-limiting.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.840
After they're over,
the patient will get up and resume life,

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.850
just as it were,
before you told the funny joke

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.030
and he or she got stimulated.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:38.040
I'm going to talk about two
case histories with narcolepsy,

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.200
people who have these cataplexic attacks.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.770
Most of you are probably not narcoleptic,
I hope, but you're probably

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:44.860
very tired after lunch.

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:50.260
I have a senior citizen golfer who,
in his retirement, loves to play golf.

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:55.110
But he says to me, "I've got one problem,
Jim, and that is every time

00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:57.840
I get a great shot,
I get so excited I have

00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:01.350
cataplexy and I collapse right
in the middle of the fairway.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.360
It's a darn good thing
I'm not a great golfer.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.440
I never finish 18 holes."
Types of things that bring on

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:12.840
cataplexy are not only laughter,
but surprise, anger, fear, sexual orgasm.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.680
So you can begin to fall.

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:17.780
Think about some of the problems
that these people encounter.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.220
This is what you get
when you go to Cornell.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.260
No matter how many hours
they spend the night before,

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.920
within two or three hours of
them getting up in the morning,

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.530
they feel as if they had been
up for 48 straight hours.

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:31.140
It is very, very debilitating.

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:34.760
The other person I'm going to
introduce you to is a woman who calls

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.660
herself the laughing joke meter.

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:42.020
She works on the assembly line at the
Henry Ford Automobile plant in Dearborn,

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.770
Michigan, and she has cataplexy.

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.240
It's one of her symptoms.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.080
And she says, "Every time I come to
work on Monday morning,

00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.940
everybody on my assembly line
tells me the funniest joke that

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.230
they've heard over the weekend.

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.500
And the one who makes me collapse
the longest is the one who wins the

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:01.810
assembly line pool for the week."
She has a very good sense of humor

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:04.850
about this very debilitating disorder.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.500
Dogs also have narcolepsy.

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.530
In fact, we breed dogs for narcolepsy.

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:14.740
It's a genetically linked disorder
so that we can study those things.

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:18.480
And we can study the things in the
dog that cause narcolepsy so we can

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:24.740
perhaps isolate the brain structures
in the human and hopefully treat them

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.350
so that they no longer have narcolepsy.

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:28.400
That's a plug for our vet school,
by the way.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.400
Here is my colleague out at Stanford,
Bill Demet, holding a dog, Ginger.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400
The dog is not dead.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.400
It's sleeping.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.310
It's having a narcoleptic attack.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.480
Ginger has narcolepsy, has cataplexy,
has excessive daytime sleepiness.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.700
Now, you can't interview the dog to say,
"How tired are you?"

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:46.700
You can certainly see this.

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.670
We have a movie of the dog you can see.

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.090
And just like the humans, laughter,
surprise, sex,

00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:54.700
fear will bring on cataplectic attacks.

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.700
In fact,
here Bill is holding Ginger the cockapoo.

00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.700
And she was licking his
chin and being very happy,

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.700
now being held and cuddled
as a laboratory animal.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.630
And she got so excited that the
minute the shutter was snapped,

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:10.700
down Ginger went,
as you can see Bill holding her,

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.620
in a cataplexic state.

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.660
Now, if you didn't know that,
you'd be very upset about that.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660
So, here's a film clip now.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.660
First of the dogs.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.620
Now, these dogs haven't been
fed for about six hours.

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.750
And the mere sight of
food gets them so excited,

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:25.660
they have cataplexy and they
can't make it to the food dish.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.510
Then you'll see the golfer
and then the woman who calls

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.660
herself the laughing joke-meeter.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.200
You notice we've got to have
the Apple logo in there.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:42.560
... narcoleptic dogs have a tremendously
exaggerated tendency to fall asleep.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.350
A golfer excited by a successful
golf stroke falls victim to a

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:01.820
sudden attack of narcolepsy.

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:08.340
He loses all muscle control
and instantly enters REM sleep.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:08.770
Dr.

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:12.440
Martin Scharf protects
him from injuring himself.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.190
Narcolepsy is a lifelong sleep disorder
whose symptoms are excessive daytime

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.800
sleepiness and sudden sleep paralysis.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.800
Although there are medicines
to affect temporary relief,

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.800
there is no known cure for the disease.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.670
After a brief time, the golfer awakes.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.500
Now the quality of the
compression here is not what's

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.930
causing this to be bad media.

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:34.940
It's the original film.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.490
It's very old.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.180
...who are familiar with her
condition has an arcolytic attack

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:42.390
brought about by an amusing story.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:10.100
[Transcript missing]

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:18.910
I think I'll stop it now,
since then you'll have to

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:18.910
pay for a Cornell education.

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.790
So, you know,
this was a tough course for us.

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.410
This is a really dynamic course.

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:24.970
The guy's got media all the time.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.710
So we did a bunch of things.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.450
One is we convinced him to move
his entire lecture to Keynote,

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:31.730
which was a real tough,
because he was a PC guy.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:34.490
But once he saw the rotating cubes,
that was it.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.340
He was sold.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.330
That's all that mattered.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.550
But by converting all
of his media to digital,

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:41.570
we did a lot of things.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.500
First of all, we preserved his archive,
which is incredible.

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:47.110
Second is we basically allowed
him to give his entire lecture

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.940
live from a single laptop,
which is really also amazing.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.250
But we had the ability
then to capture this.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.040
We videotaped the lectures,
and they're compressed.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.160
My project manager sitting in the front,
John Ruffing, you know,

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.300
he basically did his demo very quickly.

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.480
We just got a hold of
the 2.0 version recently.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.460
We needed the bigger window.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.280
We couldn't go with the
smaller version originally.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.440
And it's a really tough course.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.680
I think it's very effective.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.310
I mean, I could see everybody in
the audience was not bored.

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:13.720
Everybody was watching it.

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:16.390
So it's a pretty good way to
present this material in a fashion

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:18.040
that we could not do otherwise.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.750
So as I said, I think it was a good
solution to a problem.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:21.690
So that's it.

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.530
Thank you.
