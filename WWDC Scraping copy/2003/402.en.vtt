WEBVTT

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.800
So we're going to talk about the
OS X Speech Technologies today.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
To introduce myself, as you just heard,
I am Principal Research Scientist

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.270
and Manager of the Spoken
Language Technologies.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.630
Spoken Language Technologies means the
speech technologies that you've heard of,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.960
the speech recognition
and the speech synthesis.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.860
And also we have language technologies
because we believe you can't deal with

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.040
speech without dealing with language.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.580
So for example,
the junk mail filter is one of

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.680
our spoken language technologies.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.190
And if you heard the State of
the Union address about OS X,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.440
the Japanese input method is now
using our speech technologies.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.910
And that's why they're doing so much
better than Windows at the moment.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.000
So before we start,
I think I'd go straight into a demo.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.890
I'm going to show you some of the
way speech is usable in Panther,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.290
and you guys being developers,
I'm allowed to give you the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.430
caveat-- this is beta software,
right?

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.130
So I've been through
this demo lots of times,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.860
and it always works.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.940
But because the speech sits on
top of every other component

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.520
of the operating system,
it means that if anything goes wrong,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.720
something could break here.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.370
So I have to ask you to bear with me.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.380
The first thing you should do when
turning on speech recognition is let

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.940
the machine adjust to the acoustic
environment in which it's being used.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.600
We have speaker independent recognizer.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.370
I'll talk about what that
means a bit more later.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.780
But even though it's
independent of who you are,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.550
it does need to adapt, sample,
and adapt the acoustic environment.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.950
We have made it track the
acoustic characteristics of most

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.070
places where people would use it.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.110
But this is outside of the parameters
for which we've developed it.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.850
The distance between these walls combined
with the positions of the PA system

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.680
speakers mean the durations of the
echoes are a little bit outside of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.850
the spectral range that we're looking at.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.280
So I'm going to need to adapt it.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.070
So what you do, any time you use speech
recognition in a new place,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.580
is go to the speech preferences,
to the speech recognition tab, listening,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.140
and click on.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.760
And then you can go to the volume.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.840
This ostensibly lets you set the volume
on the microphone and also gives you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.800
a chance to make sure that you've
got the right microphone connected.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.430
Our speech recognition works
with a far-field microphone.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.940
That means a desktop microphone
that's about this far from you.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.720
In this particular situation,
because of these echoes,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.740
I'm going to use the alternative,
which is a headset microphone,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.740
which I'll put on now.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.970
You can purchase these.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.090
Pretty cheaply from the Apple stores,
there are a few brands.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.200
This particular one is by VXI.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.800
Your task is just to read
down this list of commands.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.700
As each command is recognized,
it will flash.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.000
If it doesn't flash,
you just repeat it until it is.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.060
If it doesn't flash after
one or two repetitions,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.400
go on.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.560
So I'll do that now.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.300
It's actually sampling my voice in this
environment while I'm talking right now.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.220
What time is it?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.840
Quit this application.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.940
Quit this--there we go.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.480
Quit this application.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.740
Open a document.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.930
Show me what to say.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.100
Make this page speakable.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.900
Move page down.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.150
Move page down.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.440
Hide this application.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.510
Switch to Finder.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.160
I'll go through that again.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.340
What time is it?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.560
Quit this application?

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.300
Open a document.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.240
Show me what to say.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.730
Make this page speakable.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.000
Move page down.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.520
Hide this application.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.500
Switch to finder.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.770
Good.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.020
So let's try it.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.850
What time is it?

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.890
The audio is not plugged in.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.500
Just a moment while I plug the audio in.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.770
Guys, this might go bang.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.040
I'm still here even though
you can't see my face.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.830
Okay, audio is plugged in.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.000
Let's try that again.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.440
What time is it?

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.480
. What day is it?

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.480
Quit this application.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.000
Quit this application.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.000
Open my browser.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.500
Close this window.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.440
Close this window.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.240
Go to Google News.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.040
Go to Google News.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.900
Go to Google News.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.940
You can set up any web
page to be speakable.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.280
Quit this application.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.820
Quit this application.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.720
Get my mail.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.420
So suppose I've got a message
here and I see some text that I'd

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.280
like to send to somebody else.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.140
I can do that by speech and we do that
by integrating with the address book

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.100
to find out the person's email address.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.390
The whole address book is speakable.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.750
So I can say, for example,
"Send this to speech dude."

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.710
Send.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.400
Send.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.980
And this should complain.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.360
Ooh, I love that sound.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.210
OK.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.200
Hide this application.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.580
Hide this application.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.380
Switch to chess.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.380
Open chess.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.480
He's the man down there, Matthias.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.800
Pawn D2 to D4.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:50.030
Pawn D2 to D4.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:02.190
Knight B1 to C3 Knight B1 to C3
Knight G8 to R6 You see these

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.200
ghost pieces wandering around,
it's great.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.200
Quit this application.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.700
Phone for Tom Bonura.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.700
Phone for Tom Bonura.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.180
Thanks.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.500
OK, so for those of you who
know about our speech,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.070
there's some stuff that
you've seen before and there's

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.180
some stuff that's new there.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.590
Can I ask how many people have
not sat down and used speakable

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.010
items on the OS X before?

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.820
Okay, so if you guys--I'll walk through
quickly what we've done here.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.240
What we've seen is a
bunch of different things.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.590
We have a speech recognition engine,
which has a robust API.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.320
You can call that API from
your applications.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.040
Many of you do already,
and more are all the time.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.280
In addition,
we ship a couple of applications

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.220
that also use that API.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.940
One of those is called Speakable Items,
and that's largely what

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.600
I've been showing you now.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.560
You turn that on from
the system preferences,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.200
from the speech preferences,
speech recognition in

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.330
the on/off window pane.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.180
Speakable Items is a very simple idea
that's been developing over the years,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.300
and it's turning out
to be quite powerful.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.290
When you turn it on--

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:38.720
We create a folder in your home directory
called the Speakable Items folder.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.120
Open the Speakable Items folder.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.240
Anything that's in that folder
can be launched by speaking it.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.900
It's just the same as
double-clicking on it.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:09:00.060
Applications, documents, templates,
aliases, stationary,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.070
URLs--anything that you can launch
in the Finder by double-clicking,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.760
you can launch by speech just
by putting it into that folder.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.670
Most of the commands that
I use now are part of a kind

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.180
of a starter kit that we ship.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.340
We pre-populate that folder with a few
items that do generally useful things,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.730
and that's what I've been using.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.750
So for example, there's "What day is it?"

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.190
The real power of this is that you
can add your own items to that folder

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:41.000
and make your own things speakable,
so you can customize the speech

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.000
recognition according to the kinds of
things that you do and how you work.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.500
Within that folder,
the Speakable Items folder,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.530
there is itself another folder
called Application Speakable Items.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.500
That folder contains folders
named by applications.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:10:01.210
The items in those folders
are only speakable when that

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.210
application is in the foreground.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.610
That provides a framework where you
developers can ship commands that

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.300
are specific to your applications,
and you don't have to worry

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.550
about accidentally using the
same wording as somebody else

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.500
with a different application,
because if you put them

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.040
into that framework,
that folder,

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.610
then they'll only be speakable when
your application is in the foreground.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.270
And in fact, you don't need to install
them into this folder.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.250
You can put them into your
own application bundle,

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.450
and speakable items will find them.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.210
We have documentation on how to do that.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.880
So the kinds of things you can
put in here are scripts that

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.230
send Apple script commands,
Apple events to your application,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.260
or other keyboard shortcuts.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.860
What do I mean by that?

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.340
What I mean is that anything
that is speakable as--sorry,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.020
anything that's a menu item with
a keyboard shortcut can have a

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.860
spoken command associated with it.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.780
So let me give you an example of that.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.790
First of all, we'll go back to the web.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.380
Open my browser.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.800
What have we got here?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.100
I'm looking for a picture.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.840
Of course, the web is slow.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.660
One of the accessibility features is
that you can zoom in on the screen,

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.400
and that's a keyboard shortcut.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:25.310
So I've attached a
spoken command to that,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.040
so now I can say, "Zoom in." Zoom in.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.040
Zoom out a bit.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.200
So anything that has a keyboard
shortcut you can attach speech to,

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.190
and that's one easy way that you can
have speech control of your application

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.100
without doing a lot of extra work.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:51.100
Speech is really important
for disability solutions.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.240
Let me just give you a story.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.680
I just heard this just as I was
sitting up here--I kid you not,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.050
this is absolutely true--just as I was
sitting up here about half an hour ago,

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.480
I think his name's Bill.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.240
Bill, was it you?

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.400
A guy from the projection
behind came out and said,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.290
look, I've just got to tell you,
excuse me,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.100
he interrupted me while I was setting up.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.100
He said,
I saw you give a demo of this stuff

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.230
a couple of years ago at Macworld,
and so I showed it to a blind friend.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.400
I turned on his machine, and I said,
open my browser, and the browser opened,

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.250
and we got his mail,
and we got it to read

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.170
his mail out to him.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.900
He said he was just blown away.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.620
Well,
it turns out that this guy teaches an

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.270
exercise class full of blind people.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.560
And so they were doing
their exercise class,

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.950
and they had an iMac over on the side,
and then they would go over to

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.760
the iMac after their exercise
class and surf the web,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.240
a bunch of blind people.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.020
And they do this every Monday,
have their exercise,

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.210
and then go and surf the web
by voice using just the things.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.280
that you're seeing here.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.160
Yeah, I was touched, really.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.220
I wanted to share that with you
because that means that you can

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.350
make your applications available
to folk with disabilities

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.600
through technologies like this.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.540
The Section 508 rule, as I understand it,
of the American Disabilities Act,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:13.290
is that everything that can be done
with your application must be possible

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:18.350
to do without requiring the keyboard or
the mouse or that you see the screen.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.720
And we have an accessibility
API that lets you get at screen

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.920
controls and provide alternative
ways of controlling those things.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.000
We ship one method already built in,
and that's speech.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.510
So with very little effort,
you can have stories like that

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.240
circulating about your applications,
too.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.280
Within the speakable items framework,
you can choose what kinds

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.360
of commands you can give.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.160
This is controlled by
the Commands tab here.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.900
And the reason I want to tell you about
this is because of this particular guy,

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.240
who's off by default,
which is front window commands.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.560
This lets you speak any of the controls
in the front-most window of whatever

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.120
application's in the foreground.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.670
So with this on,
I can navigate the preferences here.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.740
For example, speech recognition.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.060
Speech recognition.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.340
Well, we're already there,
so that doesn't show much.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.280
Default voice.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.870
Default voice.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.000
Spoken user interface.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.200
Speak the phrase.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.200
Speak the phrase.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.200
See, I'm going down the check boxes here.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.510
Speak the alert text.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.800
Speech Recognition.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.220
We did not build this specially
into the speech preferences.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.300
This is just the general accessibility
features that use speech.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.300
So as long as you use
standard Apple controls,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.510
you get that for free.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.760
In addition,
you can have the computer read out

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.880
text that appears on the screen,
and there are a few

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.340
different ways of doing this.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.600
One that I just turned
on is talking alerts.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.100
Here's the mentality we have here.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.520
The philosophy is when you're
interacting with a computer,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.340
sometimes the computer
needs to tell you things,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.890
and the standard way that we'll do
that is by putting up a sheet or

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.900
an alert dialogue in front of you.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.980
You should be able to read that,
think about it, and respond to it.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.620
But sometimes your
attention is elsewhere.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.070
I'm typing on my machine, I type quit,
I turn around and have a

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.340
conversation with somebody,
and I don't realise that there's

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.520
an alert saying that I need to
save my changes before quitting.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.800
Perhaps I go away to lunch and I come
back and I find that my work wasn't

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.130
saved and somebody couldn't get at it.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.280
So what happens is if the alert has
been up for a certain amount of time

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.350
and you haven't responded to it,
then we read it out to you in

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.420
order to get your attention back.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.110
So let me demonstrate that.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.560
Switch to TextEdit.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.160
So I'll type something here
and then try to quit from it,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.440
close it.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.830
Oh, before I do,
we ship it with a delay of about

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.520
20 seconds by default between the
alert appearing and it being spoken.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.990
I'll put that back to zero
for now so that you guys don't

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.360
have to wait around so long.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.390
So now we'll quit or close this document.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.260
So that's Talking Alerts.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.100
People tell us that they love it.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.540
The kinds of scenarios I hear
feedback from users are,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:33.540
um...

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.690
Some guy said to me he was crawling
around on his hands and knees under

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.040
his computer--under his desk and
accidentally kicked out the ethernet

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.830
cable and he didn't know that he
had done that and then he heard this

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.700
voice come from his computer saying,
"The network has been disconnected."

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.370
And he turned around and thought,
"Oh, yes, indeed it has."

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.140
I was giving a keynote at an
international conference in Berlin.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.340
I arrived the night before.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.470
Actually,
I wrote my talk in the flight lounge

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.230
in Heathrow on the way over there.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.380
And when I arrived,
I thought I'd better get my presentation

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.620
printed out on transparencies
just in case my computer won't

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.520
plug into their projection system.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.960
So I went to a print shop that had maybe
two dozen different kinds of printers.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.980
They had big printers and
little slide printers,

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.900
high-quality stuff,
kind of like Kinko's on steroids.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.910
And we started printing these things off.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.960
And while we were doing that,
I demoed this to them,

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.040
and they were delighted.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.020
So they had two dozen Power Macs.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.150
They put talking alerts onto each of
their Power Macs because their typical

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.870
business model is somebody arrives at
about 9 o'clock in the morning with a

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.320
CD containing a large image that needs
to be printed out on a large poster,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.040
camera-ready,
and it will take about two hours.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.180
So they put it onto an appropriate
machine and start printing.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.240
And then at about 11 o'clock,
they go to make sure

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.880
it has finished okay.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.710
And there's a message on the screen
that came up five minutes into

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.560
the printing saying that there
was some problem with the cyan ink.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.680
And so they lose the business because
they don't have it done in time.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.400
And they found that this was great.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.370
With 24 machines going all the time,
there were voices coming up

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.580
from all over the place saying
the printer's out of paper,

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.980
the network is down.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.570
And this saved them a lot of time.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.250
But there was a problem.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.500
They all had the same voice.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.240
So a voice would come out of
this massive machine saying,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.570
the printer is out of paper.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.150
And who said that?

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:30.660
Who said that?

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.390
You can set the default voice.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.620
So they put a different
voice onto each machine.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:41.220
And you can set what phrase is
spoken before the alert is read out.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.400
By default, we choose stepping through a
small list that we have here.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.650
And so they made each machine
announce itself by name.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.460
So we think talking alerts is useful.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.000
I'll put this delay back so it doesn't
keep talking all the time here.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.970
Another disability feature that
we have is the ability to speak

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.580
any text that's under the mouse.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.000
This again uses the accessibility API.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.830
So if I turn this on and slide the
mouse around-- - Slide the mouse.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.840
- Yep.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.340
So if I--as I slide the mouse around,
you'll hear text being read out.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.080
- Announcement of an application
requires your attention.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.310
- I'm not clicking here.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.820
Okay, so if you use standard controls,
you'll get that for free as well.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.800
Okay, so let's go back and talk
a bit more about what we've

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.200
actually been seeing here.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.490
We'll go back to the main machine now.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.680
So I want to talk a little bit
about why you should adopt speech,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.260
things to think about about the
reasons for putting it in there

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.950
rather than just being a novelty.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.970
First of all,
speech gives you a way to get beyond the

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.120
limits of a graphical user interface.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.720
Graphical user interfaces are mature,
and they present well the

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.580
information that they can present,
but there are limits to what they can do.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.940
Screen real estate is at a premium,
and so we have all sorts of technologies

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.760
to try to squeeze a little bit more
power out of our screen real estate,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.680
but no matter how big my screen,
no matter how many monitors

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.390
I have in front of them,
there are always things that

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.110
I need to get to or see that
are behind other things,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.240
and I can't see them.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.410
And, of course,
there's always the issue of what

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.640
happens when the user's not attending.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.860
No matter how cool the graphics are,
the user just might be

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.860
staring out the window.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.580
Speech gives you an extra modality.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.620
It gives your user more choices about
ways of interacting with a computer.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.440
It's more natural.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.160
That is,
we've all been speaking and listening

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.760
since we were about two years old,
and it's something that comes

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.370
to us without too much thinking,
whereas working through a

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.900
typical computer user interface
requires some training.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.480
So if you put speech into
your applications as an

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.680
alternative control modality,
you'll find that some users who

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.620
are new to computing will be more
likely to try out your application.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.300
It's particularly
appropriate in an eyes busy,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.480
hands busy scenario.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.070
So think about your application.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.030
Think if there's any time where the
user is looking at something on the

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.400
screen and their hands are busy.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.580
For example, they're drawing something,
and they need to control the computer.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.060
For example, I'm drawing a line,
and I want to change the brush size

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.760
or increase the amount of blur.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.010
Normally,
with our graphical user interfaces,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.140
I'd have to stop drawing,
go up to a menu, pull up a dialog,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.220
set some settings,
and then click out of that,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.520
then return to drawing.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.740
So speech is good when the
hands and the eyes need to keep

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.720
busy with what they're doing.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.070
Think about that in your applications.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.530
And finally, speech gives us a way to
move out of the 1980s.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.300
Back in the 1980s,
computers had a little weak speaker,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.800
sold it onto the motherboard,
and all it could do was go beep.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.590
And so we got into the habit
of writing our programs with

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.360
a beep written into them.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.980
Whenever we needed to
get the user's attention,

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.740
we put up an alert, we go beep.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.080
Well, I like to think that life has
moved forward somewhat since then.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.960
Of course, now,
instead of just going beep,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.400
we play lots of different sounds,
but the burden is still on the user to

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.870
understand what all those sounds mean.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.250
So, for example,
if we want to let the user

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.520
know that mail has been sent,
we play one sound.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.550
If we want to let the user know that
somebody has logged on to iChat,

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.750
we play a different sound.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.300
It seems to me we should be
able to do better than that.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:52.020
The application developer who is
playing a sound knows the meaning,

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.010
knows what information he's
trying to convey to the user,

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.800
so why not just say it?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.200
And think about the mouse.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:06.970
The mouse is essentially the
equivalent of doing this.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.770
It's such a narrow, I guess,
1.2-bit interface.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.440
We should be able to do better than that.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:22.420
If I want to do something
with a computer,

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:22.420
rather than just poking and grunting,
I should be able to

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:22.420
say what I want to do.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.180
So we have a couple of engines that
I've mentioned and shown you already.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.040
The speech recognition
is speaker independent.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.220
That means you don't have
to train it to your voice.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.310
There are speaker dependent speech
recognizers around that have

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.300
got different characteristics.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.120
And one of those characteristics is that
you need to spend at least four hours

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.870
of speaking to train it to your voice,
which takes more than four hours,

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.360
and you get tired at the end of it.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.180
Then at the end of that four hours,
you've still got to use them for a

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.640
month or two before they can finally
adapt to your particular voice.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.920
We think that the kinds of users
that buy Macintoshes expect to just

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.920
walk up to it and have it work.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.390
So we make it speaker-independent.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.220
It works with a far-field microphone.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.180
We have layers of software
that are tracking,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.420
adapting to, and compensating for the
background acoustics and the

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.520
microphone characteristics.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.200
You can also use it with
a head-mounted microphone,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.880
as you just saw me do over there.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.960
It's robust against background noise.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.280
I use it now at Apple at
the cafeteria at lunchtime,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.000
and to my delight, it works.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.130
The secret there is that the kind of
noise that's easiest to compensate

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.100
for is noise that's steady-state.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.300
So in the cafeteria,
when there are hundreds

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.380
of people talking,
the overall spectrum tends

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.700
to be fairly constant.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.720
What's a situation that we have
not solved is if I'm in front of

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.700
the computer trying to talk to it,
and right next to me there's

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.460
somebody else talking,
because then there's two voices at once,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.340
and the spectrum of the distracting
voice is changing all the time.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.290
So we don't claim to
have solved that one yet.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.340
It's a large vocabulary
speech recognizer.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.210
We have over 121,000
words in the dictionary,

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.220
and we have layers of software to
figure out how to pronounce words

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.920
that aren't in the dictionary.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.690
And it's a continuous speech recognizer.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:20.290
You don't have to pause between words,
which is a great relief.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.590
It's driven by a finite state grammar.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.790
That's how your application tells
the recognizer what to listen for.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.530
Why you should use speech recognition?

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.830
Well, as I've mentioned,
speech is a very natural way

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.660
of controlling a computer.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:40.310
It gets you beyond the limits of point
and click because you can't click

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.170
on what you can't see to point to.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.370
And conversation is a particularly
appropriate modality for

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.260
delegating goals to a computer.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.800
You can tell a computer
what you want to do.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.540
If you haven't specified enough,
it can then come back and ask you

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.320
questions to refine the nature of the
goal and can then do what it's good at,

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.850
which is figuring out the steps
necessary along the way to get there.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:06.550
And of course, speech recognition is
great for accessibility,

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.040
the latest story being that
one that's only 30 minutes old.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.010
Okay, we have speech synthesis in there.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.620
It takes any text and converts
it into American English speech.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.710
I have to say that because I'm getting
requests all the time for other

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.820
varieties of English and other languages.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.520
There's a range of different voices.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:29.910
You can control the speaking rate,
and that is important because

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:29.910
there is no correct answer.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.240
or no single answer to the question,
"What's the appropriate speaking rate

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.410
for speech synthesizer?" The rate at
which the speech synthesizer speaks

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.480
should depend on why it is speaking.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.430
We'll talk more about that later.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.810
I do want to let you know that we
are working steadily all the time

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.810
on improving the quality and the
naturalness of the speech synthesis.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.280
We did a lot going from Puma to
Jaguar and we got good feedback from

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.800
folks who listened to it and said,
"Oh, wow,

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.600
that's a lot better now." And we're
still doing a lot more work.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.140
So when should you use speech synthesis?

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.550
There's a bunch of different areas.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.940
I won't go through all of these now,
but one thing that I think is useful

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.670
is when something happens inside
the computer that's outside of

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:21.520
the user's control or not directly
relevant to the current task at hand,

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.600
then speech is an appropriate
modality for letting them know.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.870
For example, you have new mail from your
boss or your compile failed.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.190
Another area is proofreading.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.090
Creation of documents
used to be an art form,

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.520
and people would spend a
lot of time crafting them,

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.860
but the world's got too busy for that.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:39.640
We don't have the time.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.010
So we have tools like
spellcheckers and grammar checkers.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.640
Well,
grammar checkers don't do very well.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.080
Often they don't catch
awkward constructs,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.590
and the constructs that they do catch,
we don't always agree

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.260
with them or incorrect.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.660
And spellcheckers can only find a
word that is not in the dictionary.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.670
Often when we make typing mistakes,
the psychologists will tell us

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.860
there is good evidence on this,
when we make a typing mistake,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.980
we are much more likely to transpose
letters if it creates another real word.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.720
And spellingcheckers
can never catch that.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.670
But if you have text read out to you,
you immediately spot it.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.940
It just becomes so painfully obvious.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:30.610
People have asked me to talk a little
bit about why should I use speech

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:34.140
synthesis versus recorded speech.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.100
There are a few reasons.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.510
If you only have a small amount of
things that you need to say to your user,

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.000
then I'd say go ahead and record them.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.620
Get your voice talent.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.970
But sometimes recording is
impractical; for example,

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.170
if you have a huge amount to
read out or to say to your users,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:55.320
then it takes ages to record it and
it takes a huge amount of storage.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.820
The average CD is about 640
megabytes and usually about

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.030
two-thirds of that are media content.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.940
So if you can reduce the audio by a
factor of typically about 80 by going

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.350
from audio recordings down to text,
then you have much more space

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.040
for real content on your titles,
on your CDs.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.270
You also get a consistent voice.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.370
If you record voice talent,
then later on you bring them

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:27.430
back to record some more or
even from one day to another,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.840
their voices tend to become inconsistent.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.820
They're speaking louder one day,
they're a bit more relaxed the next day,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.420
and then in the user interaction the
voice sounds like it's going up and down.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.280
With speech synthesis you
get a consistent voice.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.790
You can save costs because you
don't have to hire a voice talent,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.220
you don't have to hire
a recording studio.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.220
It's flexible.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.320
I don't know whether this
has ever happened before.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.320
I don't know if it's
ever happened before.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.250
I don't know if it's
ever happened before.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.260
It's never happened to you.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.230
It's happened to me a lot.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.850
You're working on an application,
you're about to ship it,

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.610
and just as you're about to go GM,
somebody says, "Oh,

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.420
we have to change some of the strings."
So you have to call up the voice

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.900
talent to get them back into the
studio to record something different,

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.500
but no, they're on vacation in Brazil now
or they've got a sore throat.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.820
It's real pain.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.230
With speech synthesis,
you just type in the new

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.690
strings and you're done.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.330
Another important reason for using
speech synthesis is if the things

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.000
that you're saying to your users are
longer than a single short sentence,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.630
then you need to control the intonation
to make sure they're spoken in

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:30.210
a way that people can track the
meaning across the longer sentences.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.630
And you can't do that if you're
piecing together sentences that were

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:39.680
recorded at different times and you're
just concatenating them together.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:40.290
And you get lip synchronization for free.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:46.070
All right, at this stage,
I want to invite up Jack Minsky,

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.790
who is the president
of Software Mac Kiev.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.410
Jack has--his company
has produced World Book,

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:57.070
which, as you may have seen,
is this wonderful application.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:02.220
I think it's about the best OS X UI on
any application that I've seen.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.390
He'll show it to you.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.840
It's gorgeous.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:11.900
And these guys have been using speech,
and he's going to tell you about it.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:11.900
Can you swap my headphones?

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:11.900
Yes, I'll swap the headphones.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:11.900
Thank you.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.980
Good morning.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.030
We had a pretty simple goal in
mind at the Creative Labs of

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:25.030
Software McKiev when we set out to
build a World Book speech edition,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.000
and that's that we wanted virtually
impaired users or even blind users

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.160
to be able to use the World Book,
to be able to search all 22 volumes,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.400
18,000 articles,
on their own without assistance.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.090
And that meant we really
had to be kind of creative,

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.620
not just have text be able to
be read by passing a cursor over

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.470
it or highlighting something,
but build in the kind of interaction

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.840
that would allow a user really to
be able to do this on their own.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.810
And I'd like to show it to you.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:02.560
First, I'm going to do as Kim did
to adjust the speech here.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:10.970
I'm going to let this Mac adjust
to my voice in this room.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.270
What time is it?

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.660
Quit this application.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.610
Open a document.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.040
Open a document.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.840
Show me what to say.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.800
Make this page speakable.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.370
Move page down.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.220
Hide this application.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.220
Switch to finder.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.600
So that's done.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:43.260
And then just to get started,
we wanted the user even to be able

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.440
to launch this from the Finder.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.730
And we were thinking launch, start.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.650
And we were going to use
something even friendlier.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.040
So we chose Hello World Book as
our starting one.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.160
Let's try and see if that works.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.130
Hello World Book.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.710
And immediately they get the feedback
of the music of World Book starting up,

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:07.500
so a blind person
already knows they're in.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:13.480
We'll let this go by just for a second.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.090
And then the next step
would be to go and--

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.870
So you can see there's all kinds of
sounds and things built in there,

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.260
so even someone who can't
actually see the screen can hear

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.200
some of the things going on.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.940
So the next step was to be able to
get them to be able to search through

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:41.360
the encyclopedia for a particular
article that they're looking for.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.550
And here you're going to hear me say,
"Search, please.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.320
A window will open,
and blind users can touch type

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.740
things in." So let's see that work.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.650
Search, please.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.470
So now I have a window open.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.270
And if you heard that, it said,
ready to search, letting the user, again,

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.500
have feedback to know
that the thing is working.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.540
I'm going to type in a simple word here,
horse.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.410
Picking horse in particular,
a whole bunch of articles,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.390
what we've done is to embed
sounds at the top of the articles.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.360
Again, oral feedback so they know
when they reach that article,

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.270
they'll actually hear the animal
noise or whatever that's going on.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.060
You'll also hear more feedback.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.060
When I hit return,
because we're dealing with a blind

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.700
user who might not be able to type
in successfully the right word,

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.210
we wanted to give them feedback.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.930
So it will actually say,
searching for horse.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.020
And then at the end,
if the horse article is found,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.300
it will say, search complete.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.100
So let's try that.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.990
When the horse stops running,
they can now simply again ask

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:54.690
the computer to read to them.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:54.690
So I say, "Read to me."

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.380
So in this way,
assuming they've typed incorrectly,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.210
they can get to any article that
they can think of the name for.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.520
Now, of course,
we thought people aren't going to be

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.420
able to necessarily type incorrectly.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.180
I know I mistype all the time,
and I can see just fine.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:30.080
So what we did was to
build in a catch for that.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.260
So I'm going to type in and
misspell Apple Computer here.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.120
And you're going to see on this one
that it's going to come up with a

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.220
series of suggested alternative words.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.100
And we thought even beyond that,
as you'll see from this example,

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.240
it will read through the
instructions first once and then

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.160
go through the list one by one,
pronouncing the alternatives

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.600
that the user might have meant
to type in the first place.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.060
It will then pause briefly
at the end of the list,

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.640
assume that the user didn't
hear what they wanted,

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.580
or maybe they did and weren't sure,
start the list again,

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.660
but without that long intro introduction
of explanation of what they need to do,

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.450
simply repeat the words again.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.390
So let's try that.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.530
And there I go,
and I've got my Apple computer article,

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.640
so the user can do that quite nicely.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.140
We also built in a lot of other speech
technologies to try and go to the

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.330
maximum of what Mac OS X has to offer.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.230
Kim showed the speech on the mouse,
so I won't show that,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.650
but we have custom controls
in some places here.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.740
It comes for free if you simply
enable that for all the dialogues

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.540
with normal tabs and so forth.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.600
But if you build custom controls,
you can go the extra step of

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.570
making sure those will also
work with text under mouse.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.480
And then we've done one more thing.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.610
I'm going to pull up another page here.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.390
It's already set up.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.330
And that's to take a bunch
of the abbreviations that are

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:30.930
very common in an encyclopedia,
which won't mean anything

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.490
to a blind person.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:36.330
For example, population is a very common
thing in an article about cities.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:39.280
So what we've done here is
made it so that population

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.180
will not read as "pop" here,
but read out the word,

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.100
and I'll just show you that.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:55.100
Let's try that again with that on.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.100
Or something like this.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.950
instead of food.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:05.590
So all of those things have been, for us,
the way that you can see

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.580
someone who is unsighted could
navigate this encyclopedia,

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.610
really use it on their
own without assistance,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.390
without someone standing
over their shoulder.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.940
We've gotten a lot of
recognition for this.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.310
This is the first encyclopedia,
and only one, that's fully ADA compliant

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.160
with section 508,
and that's resulted in a number of

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.040
magazine articles written in the
education space about this application.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.360
Also, just three weeks ago,
we had the great honor of

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.150
the American Association of
Education Publishers voted

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:40.280
this one the best children's
software of the past year.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.770
That's the first time that
a Mac-only application has

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.940
ever been nominated for this.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.280
This is Windows cross-platform
everything for the prize,

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.450
but a Macintosh-only
product won that category.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.140
And also,
another great reason to do this,

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.810
Apple has put this
application on every eMac,

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.600
iMac, and iBook they sell.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.110
And probably the best thing of all
is that we know at Software Mechia,

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:07.520
because of the work we did in
implementing the speech technologies,

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.510
which were already set up for us with all
the things that are built into Mac OS X,

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.760
that there are literally tens of
thousands of visually impaired users

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.600
and even blind people out there who
now have a whole new world opened up to

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.020
them to be able to explore independently
the World Book Encyclopedia,

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.060
and we feel really great about that.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:25.900
- Thanks, Jeff.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.890
Thank you.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.200
Thank you.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.130
You can purchase World Book on
the Apple Store online

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.130
or in the retail stores.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.130
Check it out.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.480
Alright, so now it's your turn.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.150
We want to talk to you a little bit
about what you can do to incorporate

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.300
speech into your applications.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.800
And we'll start with talking about
customizing speech synthesis.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:56.590
What I mean by this is that when we
send text to a speech synthesizer,

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.690
the speech synthesizer
looks at each sentence,

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:02.300
scratches its head, and says, hmm,
how should I speak this?

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.620
The answer is,
the way a sentence is spoken depends on

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:12.110
why it's being spoken and the intention
of what it's conveying to the user.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.020
The problem is difficult
in the general case,

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.400
but you guys have an advantage.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.840
Your application knows a lot more
about how things should be spoken

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.700
than the text-to-speech engine does.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.590
For example,
Jack's application knew that pop,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.370
when it was in brackets
followed by digits,

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.910
should not be spoken as pop,
but should be expanded to population.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.640
The speech synthesizer could
never figure that out by itself.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.440
So there are three
things that you can do.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:41.720
One is filter the text the
way the Matkiew guys did.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.430
Another example would be
stock quote abbreviations.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.420
Then you can customize
the pronunciations,

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.400
and you can customize the intonation.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.560
Let's talk about that in
a little bit more detail.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.810
To customize the pronunciation,
you're dealing with the problem that the

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:00.780
way the synthesizer pronounces a word is
not the way that you want it pronounced.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:07.720
This is most often a problem with
names or invented names of characters,

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.170
if you have a fantasy game,
I'm sure you've got some character

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:14.730
names in there that are written
to be difficult to pronounce.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.840
Some developers send special
strings to the synthesizer

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.300
that just use funny spelling.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.060
We don't recommend that,
because the way we pronounce

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.570
unorthodox spelling might
change from version to version.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:30.030
Instead, we recommend that you use
what we call phoneme input,

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.100
which looks obscure,
but is actually very quick to learn,

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.080
as a totally precise,
unambiguous way to specify how

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.060
words ought to be pronounced.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.600
You can embed phonemes
like this into the text,

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.100
or you can load a custom dictionary
to the synthesizer that has

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.620
these mappings already in it.

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.840
Then you should customize the intonation.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.200
The intonation is the pitch and the
timing that we use when we speak.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:00.020
It's not what we say,
it's the way that we say it.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.150
And the problem is that once
you've synthesized the words

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.020
so that they are clear,
you've not synthesized enough.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.020
Consider the sentence,
"John only introduced Mary to

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:15.200
Bill." Now if I say it like that,
it means he didn't introduce

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.240
Mary to anybody else.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.700
John only introduced Mary to Bill.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.330
But suppose I say,
"John only introduced Mary to

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:28.370
Bill." Then he might have introduced
her to other people as well,

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.610
but to Bill, he only introduced Mary.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:31.430
Quite a different meaning.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.600
And if I say,
"John only introduced Mary to Bill,"

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:39.490
then it means he didn't encourage them to
go off and form a partnership together.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.940
So the problem is the
meaning of a sentence depends

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.280
crucially on the intonation.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.690
It's difficult to generate in the
general case because we need to

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.110
know what's the intended meaning.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.800
But your application often knows that.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.400
And so your developers can employ
your domain knowledge within your

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.190
application to do a better job.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.560
Let me work through an example.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:10.500
So here is a text from an application
that people are using to book flights.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:15.000
And here's the confirmation
that's being sent to the user.

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.700
I will read this out first by just
passing the text as you see it

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.950
directly to the speech synthesizer.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:26.140
And it will sort of do OK,
but it won't sound all that great.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:26.140
Here we go.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.980
Oh, the audio is not coming
out from your demo machine.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.900
Is there a reason for that?

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:40.800
All right.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.590
Well, what can you do?

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:48.390
Can you put a microphone on it?

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.490
Yeah.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.090
Is this mic working?

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.500
This is high tech.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:02.400
Let's see if this works.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:10.280
Your first flight is with
Alaska Airlines flight 2762

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.450
departing from San Jose on Monday,
May 24th at 6:10 PM,

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.290
landing in San Francisco at 7:10 PM.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.400
Thank you for choosing TTS Travel.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.390
Whoa.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:22.400
Okay.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.480
Was that hearable?

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.260
I bet it didn't sound that good.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.800
So let's talk about what
you can do about that.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.910
There are commands that you
can embed into the text that

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.300
you send to the synthesizer.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.670
You can embed those commands by rule,
and they'll give the synthesizer

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:43.750
hints about how to speak the text.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:47.900
Last year,
in prior developers' conferences,

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.760
we've given some instruction on
how to use some of these commands,

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.940
and according to those,
this would be the kind of

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.140
way that you would annotate
the text to that synthesizer.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.140
I've put the embedded commands into a
smaller font so that you can see them.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.270
But we've been working on the
front end of the synthesizer,

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:08.260
and some of this information we
can now infer because we're now

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.540
tracking the topic as we go through
texts and modifying the way we

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.140
say it according to the topic
structure and the block structure.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.350
That means that some of
these are no longer needed.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:20.890
So those ones you get for free.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.540
But there are others here
that I've left behind which

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.190
do depend on domain knowledge.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.660
Let's take some examples.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:33.070
I'm going to go through these by laying
out some simple principles you can use.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.450
The first one is I'm calling
let the user catch up.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.380
What you should do is add pauses at
major sense units where pieces of

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.310
information that seem to cohere together
make sure that they are separated

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.920
from other pieces of information.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.020
And you can do that just by
sprinkling punctuation around there.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.970
If you want to increase a pause longer,
you can add the embedded

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.880
command I've got there,
slnc, which means add, in this case,

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.690
500 milliseconds of silence.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.030
You can also adjust the speaking
rate to be appropriate for

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.520
the purpose of the speech.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.660
In this particular case,
the user needs to

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:12.950
transcribe the information,
and so you want to read it

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:14.450
out a little more slowly.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.840
If the user already knew that
information and you were just

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.030
reading it back for confirmation,
then he would read it back more quickly.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.250
So here, for example,
is one of those sentences.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.180
With just the plain text,
it sounds like this.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.990
I'll play this out through
the demo machine again.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.440
Oh, hang on, it didn't play.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.240
All right.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:39.210
So what I've done here is added a
command to slow down the rate a little

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.150
bit and added some colons and commas
that you can see at the ends of those

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.120
lines and a little bit of extra silence.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.590
Let's see if this one will play out.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.560
That's unadorned text.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.300
Now with those commands that you can see,
it sounds like this.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:14.910
Do you hear a difference?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.690
Okay, let's go on.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.160
Second principle is familiar
things go in the background.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.790
When we speak,
we don't equally highlight every word.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.640
We mark for our listeners which things,
what we're saying that's referring to

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:31.710
what they already know and what things
that we're saying are new and important.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:35.320
And the way we do that is by
reducing the emphasis on things

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.880
that listeners already know.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.460
So you can do that by
de-emphasizing repeated words.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:44.610
For example, departing at 6.10,
landing at 7.10.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.710
But that one you now get for free
because we're tracking things

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.100
like that in the synthesizer.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.300
But in addition,
you can de-emphasize words

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.970
that could be inferred from the
overall application scenario.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:02.520
So for example, in this case,
the text started with "Your first

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:08.370
flight is..." but the user already
knows that it's talking about flights,

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:12.010
and so it's appropriate
to de-emphasize flight.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:14.130
So it should be spoken as
"Your first flight is..."

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.250
I'll play that first of all
without that embedded command,

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.640
and you'll hear there's equal emphasis
on the words "first" and "flight."

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.360
Then I'll play it immediately
afterwards with this embedded command,

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.590
which takes the emphasis off the word
"flight." See if you hear a difference.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.840
Did you, uh, was the audio off again?

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.700
Could we have the audio on?

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.250
All right,
we'll have to go through this again.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.050
Go on.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:48.510
Okay, first without that embedded
command and then with.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.500
Your first flight.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:51.430
Then with.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.670
Your first flight.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.410
Do you hear a difference?

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.870
Okay.

00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:59.540
Third principle is liven it up.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.700
If you add an exclamation
mark at the end of a sentence,

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.120
then that stops us from gradually
rolling the pitch off all

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.500
the way through the sentence,
and it makes it sound a

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.060
little bit more involved,
a little bit more lively.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:17.780
So if you're hearing your synthesizer
having a kind of a bored sound,

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.450
this is one way that you can reduce that.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.450
Don't use it everywhere.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.450
Use it judiciously.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.810
Then you can focus the user's attention
on what's important by adding extra

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:30.920
emphasis on the most important words
by embedding "Enf+" just before them.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:35.200
And finally, we suggest using what we
call paragraph intonation.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.920
When we speak, we don't string all of our
sentences together into one long,

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.550
undifferentiated stream of speech,
but rather we group our sentences

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.870
together into larger units that
span multiple sentences that

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.060
relate to the topic structure,
and we mark that for our users.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.890
For example,
when I start talking about a new topic,

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.570
I raise my voice just a little bit,
and then as I talk about that topic,

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.100
I lower my voice down to
its normal voice range,

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:04.300
And then towards the end of that topic,
I kind of roll my voice off.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.740
Then for the next topic,
I raise my voice again.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.450
You hear that?

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.170
We all do this.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.200
Listen to people at lunchtime.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.400
You'll hear it's going up and down all
the time to signal the topic structure.

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.930
So you can do that.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:19.820
We have told people that you can--you--

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.590
should raise the pitch range at the
first sentence of a paragraph by

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.600
some embedded commands and then lower
the pitch range at each subsequent

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.710
sentence and then put extra silence in.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.170
Well, now you get all that for free.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:36.740
So what you need to do is put in
a blank line between sentences

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.180
and we will do the rest.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.700
So in this particular case,
the last sentence,

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.860
thank you for choosing TTS travel,
is not related to the topic

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:45.680
of the previous information.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.340
And so we can separate
it just by a blank line.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.780
And that now sounds like this.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:01.660
Alaska Airlines, flight 2762 departing
from San Jose on Monday,

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:08.700
May 24th at 6:10 PM,
landing in San Francisco at 7:10 PM.

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:12.690
Thank you for choosing TTS Travel.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:15.650
For comparison,
I'll just play that text again unadorned

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:20.280
so you can see where we've come by
accumulating all these commands.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.080
Oh no, I went flat.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.900
All right, we'll go on.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.310
All right, enough of this.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:31.540
So to summarize,
customize the pronunciations when

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:37.860
you're using speech synthesis,
customize the intonation

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:37.860
using those principles,
and together those things will help you

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:37.860
to give your users a better experience.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.040
Now I'd like to introduce a new
tool that we're making available

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:47.200
to you guys starting today to
further customize the intonation.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.660
I'd like to go back over
to the demo machine,

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:50.330
please.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:56.870
The problem that we're
addressing is that sometimes,

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.870
no matter

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.510
How many embedded commands
you put in the text,

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:04.000
you can't quite get it to be spoken
the way you want it to be spoken,

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.360
with the personality or
the emotion that you want.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:12.620
Wouldn't it be great if you could
just record yourself saying a sentence

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:18.530
the way you'd like the synthesizer
to say it and have it copy you?

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.780
Well, that's what this tool does.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.200
Let's start up over here.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.690
Oh, it's not there.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:25.690
All right.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.640
are called Repeat After Me.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.010
This tool we've had going in the
lab for quite some time and was an

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.760
internal tool that ran on Mac OS 9.

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:46.350
It has been ported to Mac OS X and
a new user interface has been put

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:51.120
onto it to make it easier to use
and more consistent with Mac OS X.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.570
And this work was done for us by
the folk at Software Mac Kiev,

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:56.580
and so we're very grateful to Jack.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:56.580
Let's give him a hand for doing this.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.460
and Sainz down here who did the work.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.950
So you can type in some text.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:08.760
We are at WWDC.

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.000
And this will tell you, first of all,
the phonemes that the

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.780
synthesizer used to pronounce it.

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:17.690
There's the "we," here's
the "are." Then down here,

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:21.510
it plots, with time going this way
and pitch going this way,

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.690
the fundamental frequency,
the tune that's generated by the

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:27.200
synthesizer for that sentence.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.040
So if I speak it,
it will sound like this.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.950
Is this machine going
through the sound system now?

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.880
Okay, here we go.

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.700
I'll play that again.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.700
We are on a double-double UDC.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.700
Now suppose I think that that's
all spoken a little bit too quickly

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:46.650
and I'd like to slow it down,
perhaps to time it with

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.070
an animation that I have.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.740
Well,
I can just click on the end up here and

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:53.210
drag it out and make it take longer.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.290
We are on a double-double UDC.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.360
Or if my animation is really quick,
so I can have it quite short.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.570
We are going to put you
to put you to sleep.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.200
Let's go back to the default.

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:10.190
If I want to emphasize the
"we," which is--here's the W and

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:13.200
here's the E of "we." Let's zoom
in on that a little bit more.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.510
Then I can just raise the pitch.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:22.200
[Transcript missing]

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:27.390
And make it take longer.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:30.630
And now that will sound like this.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.900
[Transcript missing]

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:53.000
and have it give me a recording.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.570
All right, let's try this.

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:56.020
Hello?

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.480
Hello?

00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:59.240
Is the audio input working?

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.100
One, two, three.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.330
Let's check the sound preferences.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:08.160
Sound, ta-da.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.150
Sound input.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:17.300
Let's plug this microphone
into the correct computer.

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.440
I'm going to disappear again,
but I'm actually still here.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:23.590
So you can't escape yet.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.830
and the connection.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.930
Aha.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.240
All right.

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.940
Oh, there it is.

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:45.670
See, sound input works on OS X.

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.300
Hello, there we go.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.220
We at--oh, let's try that again.

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:57.290
We are at WWDC.

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:02.800
You save that.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.600
My audio file comes up.

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:07.420
Where is it?

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.140
All right,
audio isn't completely working.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.040
As I said, this is Panther, bear with it.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.080
But I've got some pre-prepared ones here
to show you just in case that happened.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:19.320
So my recording--my sound wave
should have come up down here.

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:25.090
So we'll show you one that
I've previously prepared,

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.920
which is--

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.020
Here we go.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.100
So here's the original signal.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.100
I'm sorry, Dave.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.100
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.030
And here's Victoria now copying that.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.810
I'm sorry, Dave.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:57.850
We're going to make this
available to developers.

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:02.120
Watch the speech developers mailing
list to find out the method by

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.270
which you can get hold of this.

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:06.360
We're also planning on
running a kitchen on it.

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:11.720
Can I see a show of hands of people
who would be interested in coming to

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:11.720
a kitchen to learn how to use this?

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:13.930
Define Kitchen.

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.800
A bunch of developers--that's
a good question.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.540
A bunch of you come along to
Apple as our guests and sit there

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.460
and we teach you how to use it.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:29.420
You bring along text from your
application and sit down with some

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:29.560
machines and we sit with you all
day and teach you how to use it.

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:29.560
So who would like to
come along and do that?

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:30.920
Quite a number of you.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.600
Okay, cool.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:35.940
Let me just give you a couple of
examples of what you can do with this.

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:40.140
I've queued these up in iTunes.

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:46.360
Well, our buddies in World Book used
this for the speech that you heard,

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.200
although it wasn't very loud,
that's spoken back while

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.840
you're doing a search.

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:56.660
For example, you type in "panther" and
the computer will say,

00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:01.660
"Searching for panther." If you just
send the text to the synthesizer,

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:03.320
it sounds like this.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.070
But with customization using this tool,
they got it to sound like this.

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:13.300
Searching for panther.

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.300
Do you hear the difference?

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:19.410
When the search is complete,
it would say... Search complete.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.980
which didn't sound that natural,
so they used this tool and

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:27.380
now it sounds like this.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.560
Search complete.

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:28.560
Yeah.

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:39.000
I had an application where people
would call up an information system,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.870
type in their ID number,
and it would then read out news

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.440
and email and so on to them,
and it would greet them by name.

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.630
The developers of this system got
a voice talent to record greetings

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:54.540
to about 5,000 different names,
and they found to their dismay that

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:57.380
this has very little coverage for names.

00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.740
We have actually 65,000
names in our dictionary.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.350
That gives us about 80%
coverage of English names.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.860
If we increase it by another 65,000,
that would put it up

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.400
to about 89% coverage.

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.390
So names are difficult.

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:10.500
Right, right.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.690
That's the statistics of names.

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.150
So they used our speech synthesizer,
and when they would pass

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:18.960
text to the synthesizer,
it didn't sound the way

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.620
they wanted it to sound.

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:24.410
Here's an example of some names
being spoken just from text.

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.950
Dr.

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:36.280
Scott, Kai Jin, Kai Junet

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.300
and Robin Lewis.

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.080
Good afternoon, Dr.

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:42.710
Livingston.

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.360
A bit tedious.

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:48.890
So, using this tool,
we've got it to now sound like this.

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.310
and Dr.

00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:58.990
Lippen's tool.

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:01.540
So that's the tool that you guys can use.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:05.570
Okay, let's go back to the main machine.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:17.790
Another thing we want to introduce
for you today is Cocoa classes.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.700
And our philosophy here is that
they should be simple to use.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:28.080
Inspired by Alan Kay,
we think simple things should be simple,

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.100
and complex things should be possible.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.670
And so here to tell you
about them is Kevin Aiitken,

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:37.940
who is the author, and you can blame him.

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:46.340
And yes, feel free.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.280
There's definitely a lot of
people who contributed to this,

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.890
but I'm willing to take the blame,
I guess.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.920
So let me get started into this.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.440
First of all,
we've worked really hard on this.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:03.520
Panther now offers Cocoa developers
the ability to easily access the most

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.290
popular features of our speech engines.

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.610
So over the next few slides,
I'm going to take you through

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:12.440
the NS Speech Recognizer class,
which allows you to listen to and

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.690
respond to the user's spoken commands.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.500
And then the NS Speech Synthesizer class,
which will allow you to generate

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.650
synthesized speech either through
the computer speaker or to a file.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.340
So let's get started with the
NS Speech Recognizer class.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:28.700
So first of all,
we designed this to be really easy.

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:32.040
So all you do virtually,
you just give it a list of strings

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.990
and tell it to start speaking.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:37.030
That means that you don't need
to understand concepts like

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:41.000
language models and recognition
results just to get started.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.660
But we've made sure that it's dynamic,
that you can change it on the fly,

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:48.470
and you can have several recognition
objects running at the same time.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:50.410
So it's very flexible.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:55.210
So what I'm going to take you through
is a couple of coding examples for

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.710
this example with NS Speech Recognizer.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.620
Think of your writing application,
a game that allows the user to move

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:08.240
through a maze using four commands:
north, south, east, and west.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.220
And so let's get started.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.150
So I've broken these in
kind of two sections.

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:16.520
First section will just get us listening,
and the second section

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.100
will handle the result.

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:23.980
So first thing we're going to do is we're
going to create a Recognizer object.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.180
And then we're going to set the delegate.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.520
Remember, a delegate object is
just a helper object.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.450
In this case, it's going to receive the
message when the Recognizer

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.910
system has heard something.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:38.800
Then we're going to set the commands.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.880
And as I said before,
this is just a simple array of strings,

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.090
in this case, north, south, east, west.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.310
And then we're going to start listening.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.000
So now your application is
listening for those four commands.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.200
So the user starts using your
navigating through that maze.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.890
And so they say one of those.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.710
So what happens?

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.700
So what's going to happen is your
delegate object is going to receive

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:03.070
a did recognize command message.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.340
And as the command parameter,
you're just going to receive one of those

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.880
strings that you originally gave it.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.680
So you can use that string to
compare to one of your known strings.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.840
I've just used a simple if then else.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.130
I'm sure there's much more efficient,
more exciting ways to do it.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.440
And then it converts
that into some action.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.680
Okay.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.450
So that's pretty easy.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:29.080
So let's go on and talk
about NSSpeechSynthesizer.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.730
So it's going to allow you to
speak asynchronously either to the

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:36.100
computer's speaker or to a file.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:45.140
Because it's speaking asynchronously,
you can handle certain events during

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.300
the speech generation process.

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.740
Specifically, you can get notification
when the speech is finished.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:57.490
You can get notification when a
phoneme is about to be spoken and

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:57.490
when a word is about to be spoken.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.160
We give you access to all the voices
that are installed in the system,

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.910
so you can get information about
each one of those and create a

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.390
pop-up for the user to select one.

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:10.970
And finally, you can combine both the
NSSpeechSynthesizer and

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:15.460
NSSpeechRecognizer class to
create spoken user interactions.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.470
Those are kind of dialogues between
your application and the user.

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:21.740
So let's look at a
coding example of that.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.740
We're just going to instantiate
our synthesizer object using

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:27.930
the default initializer here.

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:32.540
So it's going to use the default
voice the user has chosen in

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.200
the speech preference panel.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.900
We're going to set that delegate object,
and then we're going to start speaking

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.300
by calling startSpeakingString.

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:42.950
Now, alternatively,
this is going to be coming out

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:44.550
of the default output device.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.700
Alternatively,
we can call startSpeakingString to

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.960
URL to have it written to a file.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.840
And then now your
application is speaking away,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.250
you can handle some of those events.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:02.860
So we can implement the didFinishSpeaking
method in our delegate object so we

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.100
know when it's finished speaking.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:09.350
So you could, say,
update your user interface.

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:15.160
You can be notified when it's about to
speak a word so that you could follow the

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.780
bouncing ball on the screen or highlight
a word on screen as it's being spoken.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.810
And you can also find out when
it's about to speak a phoneme,

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.780
so you can animate a mouth
on screen or avatar or some

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.900
character or whatever you like.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.510
So anyway,
that's a wrap-up of the speech classes.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:44.480
I'm going to go over to the demo machine
really quick and show you the example.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:44.480
Is this guy up and going?

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:44.480
Oops.

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.850
Everyone?

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.200
All right.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:55.280
So let me quickly take you
and show you where this is.

01:05:55.350 --> 01:06:00.120
So we have example applications in here.

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:04.190
Under Speech,
we've added some for recognition,

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:08.550
and we've added the
NS Speech Synthesizer example here.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.290
So let me show you what
we built with this.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:15.380
So using most of the callbacks.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.770
So let me choose a voice
here and start him speaking.

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:29.050
So that's what we created using
the NS Speech Synthesizer class,

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:35.380
and it was really fast, really easy,
and hopefully you'll find that as well.

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:39.660
So that example is on your Panther CD,
and there's some other examples in there,

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:40.740
so go take a look.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.690
Do you want to finish that?

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.690
Okay, good.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.210
So that brings us to the end of the
material we've prepared for you today.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.620
To summarize, we've introduced the speech
technologies for those who

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:57.940
aren't quite familiar with them.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.110
We've introduced a tool for
customizing speech synthesis,

01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:04.680
which we're going to make
available to all developers.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.760
We've introduced Cocoa classes,
and we have given some guidelines

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.800
about when you should use speech
and what kinds of principles

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.480
are behind your adoption of it.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:22.400
For those that are interested in more
background information about this,

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.790
you might want to look at the
introduction to developing

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.390
applications with Cocoa to find
out about Cocoa programming.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.390
Or you might want to see
the AppleScript update,

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:36.050
because speech and AppleScript have
such a strong synergy that many folk at

01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:40.680
Apple say those two together are the two
most strategic technologies at Apple.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.290
And you can find out more about
the accessibility API at the

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.760
Mac OS X accessibility session.

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:52.460
We don't have time for questions now,
but we, the team,

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:55.680
will be gathered just outside there
and happy to stay as long as any of

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.000
you would like to answer any questions.

01:07:58.010 --> 01:08:01.840
If you have any questions subsequently,
we suggest you contact John Galenze.

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:10.020
He's the manager of software evangelism,
and his email address is up there.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:14.170
If it's hard to read, it's galenze,
G-E-L-E-Y-N-S-E, at apple.com.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.370
and go to the speech web page to
find out about the speech developers

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.100
list and documentation of all the
things that we've shown you and more.

01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:25.600
The URL is up there.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.430
Thanks a lot.
