00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.300
Hi everybody.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.780
Thanks for coming out
so early this morning.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.040
We've got quite a treat for you.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.360
We're going to kick it off
first by introducing my mate,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.700
Anthony Rogers from Tomato,
who's going to kick off the session.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.690
How many have heard of Underworld,
the band?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.170
All right,
they're pretty much responsible

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.920
for everything they do.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.820
Well, when you see some of the stuff
that he's going to be showing,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.340
you're going to know who Underworld is.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.760
So he's going to first kick it off with
some interactive stuff to give you an

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.360
idea of what's possible with QuickTime.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.020
He's going to show an Underworld video.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.500
Then everyone's in for a real treat,
because I'm here to show some future

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.920
technology that I'm working on at Adobe.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.240
And well, I won't give it away.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.030
I'll leave it at that.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.610
So Anthony, would you come on up?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.000
We're going to give Anthony a
nice round of applause.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600
Hello everybody.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.290
All the way from the UK.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.400
Thanks a lot.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.200
How do I do that?

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.560
Hello, I'm Anthony from Tamade.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.350
We do a lot of design and
interactive and video and film,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.470
and generally lots of things.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.200
Can I have demo two?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.460
We're just going to go straight in.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.830
We're not going to give
you lots of coverage.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
That's one.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.760
This is two.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.740
Can I have the other one?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.870
No.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:58.200
[Transcript missing]

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.960
Right, we do stuff for lots of museums.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.520
We do installations, even buildings,
interior design.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.510
This is an interior we did.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.110
I'm the director of the
design of a restaurant with

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.540
all the whole design layout,
everything,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.900
and this is like all the floors,
people having to go there.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.850
There's a big store in
London called Selfridges,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.370
which is, we designed the 22 windows,
which is like the actual

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.950
stuff in the windows.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.900
But instead of just doing
pictures and graphics,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.900
we...

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.050
These big fellas here,
these are inflatables.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.540
Underneath this floor,
there is a set of fans,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.650
and it pushes the inflatables up.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.060
If you can just see here,
the people walking

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.500
past actually generate,
activate the fans.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.640
This pushes the floor up,
so as you walk past it,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.540
The individual little people
all fly up off the screen.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.500
If you see at the top here,
these are all ultrasounds,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.380
so it bounces off the
tops of people's heads,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.230
and then it triggers them.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.930
Instead of just doing
just a simple front cover,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.640
this is the same thing with shutters.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.400
These all open as you walk past.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.040
We built all this stuff.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.640
And these are special
lights we had commissioned,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.300
which are fluorescent lights, very hot.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.380
So if you put your hand in front of it,
you'll burn yourself.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.040
It has to be specially covered.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.980
But these lights aren't.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.700
You can actually pick them up,
you can lay them out,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.730
they're ultra bright.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.740
So we had these all the
way across the shop front.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.800
Small light panels.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.820
We also made a thing called the
Connected Identity for Sony.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.960
This is their full identity and branding.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.160
It was all coded on the Mac.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.700
There's also a server that comes with it.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.100
What it does is the individual
clients connect to the server.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.930
And then the server then
distributes to the client sensors

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.140
data from loads of sensors,
which are scattered all over the world.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.720
This sensor data is
relayed to the client,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.400
and then it changes the
visual look of the identity.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.470
Well, this actually gives Sony the
ability to say that they are

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.950
listening back to the world.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.840
And if you change the identity
with one of the sensors,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.720
you change their logo.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.120
So you're giving back as a user.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.480
And it looks like this.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.600
We did a kiosk to prove that
it was actually working.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.280
We did a kiosk.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.180
This one's in Tokyo in the Sony Tower.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.520
We designed the whole box, layout,
all the screens, all the buttons,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.900
all the electronics.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.040
This is a theremin,
which is one of those things

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.700
where you put your hand in front.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.990
And it goes, wah, wah, wah,
as you get closer to it.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.160
It screams.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.020
You put your hand in the box,
and the visual changes to that.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.420
And it changes everywhere
else in the world,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.940
online.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.100
We did it for mobile phones.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.720
We did it for post-production.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.640
And what this does is
when you press the button,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.050
it renders out a post-production
quality piece of TGAs for film.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.240
And then it renders a quick timeout,
and then you can send it to yourself.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.200
And it also renders a bigger
movie out for us to put online.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.270
It dynamically puts all this
stuff all over the place.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.120
It sends a copy of this
video to this computer here.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.000
And this is in Osaka.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.660
And you can view all the videos from
Tokyo on Osaka and Osaka on Sokyo.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.370
But once you interact
with the one in Tokyo,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.760
the one in Osaka changes
to your interaction.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.170
And we have a little camera here.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.760
And it looks at the color and
changes the visual with the color.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.940
And you can send an email of it to
yourself and to friends and stuff.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.920
It's just crazy stuff.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.760
Here it is moving.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.820
This is all done in OpenGL on the Mac,
so... And it's all

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.720
written in Java as well,
so we used GL for Java and OpenGL.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.860
It was very simple.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.640
'Cause they wanted a Mac version
and a Windows version,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.910
it was just simpler, quicker for us.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.190
This is a sound reactive curtain,
a bit more of a crazy thing.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.890
These are loads of plastic little balls,
and it's silicone going

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.000
down the side of the screen.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.640
And we project onto the
silicone with a projector.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.410
And then from there,
every time you walk through the curtain,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.540
from the projection,
we've got an infrared camera,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.730
and it looks at people.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.460
So these squares will jump out
the way as you get close to it.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.700
So as you walk through it,
you get these really crazy--

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:21.300
[Transcript missing]

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.390
This is a reactive floor for the
Shaker Qatar with Ron Arid Studios,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.940
a big design company,
a really good designer in London,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.620
worldwide.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.010
Now these are special little...

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.000
It's a bit weird this one,
it's actually... These cylinders

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.390
move up and down,
and what you can do on your

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.880
phone or on your computer is
you can draw on the interface,

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.480
and it will move these panels
in real time under you.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.670
So it lifts you off the floor.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.520
This guy is just really cool.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.960
He wanted this, so he went, yeah,
definitely, got to do this.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.470
This is it, there's a picture we
sort of did a mock-up of.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.490
And this is his palace,
which is having designed by Ron Arid.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.140
And this is the floor.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.040
So you walk down the corridor here,
you go into the room

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.270
and all this can move.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.980
But you can draw on here like furniture,
and then it will pull the

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.300
cams up and you can sit down.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.280
Or you could have a
laugh and I draw nothing.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.060
When someone is sitting down,
they'll fall over.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.160
So we're doing all of this.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.590
Nice bit of 3D modeling there, Mayo.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.780
Strange music.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.520
We can do random floors,
so it doesn't have to

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.880
be just waves and stuff.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.000
And it's this fast that the floor
actually moves really quickly,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.100
so we can do nice waves.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.940
And all the floors and designs are done.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.160
This is a light cube idea for Japan.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.720
We did this in La Forêt.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.700
It was just like a big tub of water,
and then when you put some

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.600
sort of white paint in it,
it will make the water a bit more grey.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.600
And you put a projector under it,
and you get these nice little light

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.170
effects coming through the water.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.710
And if you shouted at it and stuff,
it would wobble and

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.950
all that sort of stuff.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.160
We did another one.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.880
It's sort of words,
which was quite nice to mess around with.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.410
Of course, you always have to have three.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.900
And this is,
you could actually put your hand over,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.500
and we had a camera in it,
and it actually projected the difference,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.860
and drew the difference into the water.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.600
We also did a menu for High Street.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.620
All this stuff is all different.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.600
We did a menu for High Street,
which is called Busaba.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600
It's a Thai restaurant.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.600
And it was a sound reactive thing.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.100
It was on the street,
and you could shout it in.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.600
It would all bounce around.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.520
Some shots of it.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.920
Composition Station,
this is a set of music

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.800
software that we built.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.320
And what it does is you can
click these squares here,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.230
and then you can mix,
and these are all different instruments,

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.840
so as you're standing around it,
you're all playing different things,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.540
and they all perfectly go back in time.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.600
It's a nice bit of a design of the...

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.520
This is a strange one,
which we did for Absolute.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.650
And it's outdoors,
and it's a very large scale.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.940
Do you see what I mean now?

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.380
These here are buildings.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.340
See all these?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.560
These are all buildings,
and this is lights on a

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.350
scaffold that we built.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.900
And as you fly over on a plane,
you see the Absolute vodka logo,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.300
which is quite a lot of fun to do.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.400
You don't get offered things
to do like that every day,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.400
but... What are those?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.210
This is more of an arty
sort of installation.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.870
These are big blackboards,
and this here is a box of chalk.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.520
A little closer for my box of chalk.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.440
These are all chalk, and you go up to it,
and you pick it up,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.120
and you can draw on the thing.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.070
And over the day,
these things start to look quite

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.400
interesting from the public.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.770
This is in the Ginza,
we have glass screens with

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.010
lots of stories and stuff on,
nice to walk around.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.020
It's on our website front page,
or was until I changed it.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.940
And of course,
you have to do mobile phone applications,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.960
because there's always a
bit of fun there to be had.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.920
So we did this for IAPLI in Japan.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.920
These are clocks.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.770
They're just wobbly clocks,
we just did some mad things just

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.730
to try out the jarveness of it all.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.740
This one just ticks.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.860
This one's a quite funky one.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.480
I like this one a lot.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.970
This is like a tub of water.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.520
And as the ball falls down,
it falls down every second.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.400
And as the thing fills up, it's an hour.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.500
And then it starts all over again.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.380
It's like a cycle.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.720
Sort of just a simple, normal clock.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.120
Okay, that's just the general
stuff we do at Tomorrow,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.040
the everyday thing.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.230
But we also do video,
and it would be wrong

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.400
not to show some video.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.600
Right, this is Demo 1.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.850
Can we have Demo 1, please?

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.270
This time.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.620
Thank you.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.780
I can go away.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.120
Demo 1?

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.100
Hello, can I have demo machine one,
please?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.970
Yeah.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.580
That's it, cool, excellent.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:28.020
I'm going to show you a short film now to
put some shock into you in the morning.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:12:32.700
[Transcript missing]

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.900
If you liked that,
I'll hand you back to the man from,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.900
good man from Adobe.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.900
Thank you very much.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.460
Thanks a lot, Anthony.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.600
So it's a little bit
difficult following Tomato,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.330
but what I have in store for
everyone in the room this morning

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.700
is going to be pretty interesting.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.470
How many in the room,
as we sort of speak about

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.020
QuickTime Interactivity-- Anthony is
showing you some of the really innovative

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.860
things that you can do if you combine
Apple technologies with QuickTime--

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:27.920
how many in the room actually are aware
of Adobe Go-- is aware of Adobe Go Live?

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.960
Can you raise your hand?

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.700
Everybody, great.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.450
How many in the room is using
Adobe Go Live's QuickTime interactive

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.060
authoring capabilities
for their projects today?

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.090
Okay, great.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.600
So now there are not very many people.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:46.410
So I will show you a brief introduction
on what Adobe Go Live 6 is,

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.170
and what its QuickTime authoring
capabilities are in the

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.160
current instantiation.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.470
Then we'll dive into a little
bit of a future technology sneak

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.340
peek that we're working on in
conjunction with our other partners.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.660
So if I can have, actually, not yet.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.240
Let me just talk a little bit about this.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.060
So let me give some brief
history on Adobe Go Live.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.470
Adobe Go Live was an acquired
technology back in 1999,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.300
actually December of 98.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.360
It is one of the premier design
development management solutions,

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.860
not only for web content
or interactive QuickTime,

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:18.720
but also mobile.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.710
So whether you're working with
W3C or 3GPP specifications,

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.600
and you're dealing with
mobile CSS or XHTML,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.220
Go Live is the solution that helps make
you more productive and more creative.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.470
Adobe Go Live has been a
long time supporter of the

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.840
Apple QuickTime specification.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.040
One of our engineers,
actually our only engineer,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.210
who's a madman, he does a lot of this
stuff just by himself,

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.350
works very closely with
the QuickTime team.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.560
His name is Sonka, and he was not able to
come out with me today.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.660
He wanted to be here,
but he's with me in spirit.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.680
And he's based in Hamburg, Germany.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.960
Again, the first implementation of
QuickTime was implemented in Go Live 4.0,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.420
which was the first
Adobe release of Go Live.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.260
And then since then,
this one individual recently,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.090
with the help of one more individual,
has really been cranking away

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.410
at some really incredible stuff.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.600
So what I'm going to show you right
now is an introduction to Go Live 6,

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.810
explain its site and project
management capabilities,

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.690
talk about the interface,
talk about some QuickTime web authoring.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.570
And then I'm going to talk a
little bit about using Go Live in

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.850
conjunction with QuickTime,
how you can export your content

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.680
out for a mobile device.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.700
So let's dive into this.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.700
If I can have my laptop, please.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.490
All righty.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.050
I'm working with tight spaces here.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.400
But before I get going,
let's go ahead and launch in.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.560
So this is the interface for Go Live.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.100
It's really kind of
constrained right now,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.780
considering the resolution
I'm having to project out.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.300
But you first start off with a project,
and we always encourage this.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.190
Rather than working on a
one-off individual file,

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.680
which you can do,
but we encourage you to work with

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.400
our site management capabilities.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.200
And with that, it brings the capability
of doing href parsing.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.670
So we will parse everything
that's in your site to make sure

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.000
none of your links are broken.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.930
Your links can be embedded
inside of a QuickTime file.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.200
It can be embedded inside
of a Macromedia Flash file.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.500
It can be embedded inside
of JavaScript or PHP code.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.500
Doesn't matter.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.500
We'll parse that code,
and we will actually let you

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.060
know when things are updated.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.970
So if I, as an example,
let me go ahead and

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.190
open up this file here.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.000
And within our various
inspectors that we have,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.700
you can see what content
is actually linked.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.100
So it's saying that this QuickTime movie
is linked to the WWDC demo.html file.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.220
So if I take this movie file and
I drag it into a different folder,

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.740
it's going to warn me,
do you want to update all the links

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.900
interactively without just changing that?

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.620
Or if you move the file,
then you have to manually go back into

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.870
that actual file and change the linkage,
change the source code by hand.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.900
And that's not necessarily
an optimal workflow,

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.730
especially given today's economy,
post.com bust.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.490
You know,
all of us are having to do a lot

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.780
more with a lot less money and a
lot less resources available to us.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.860
So I'm going to go ahead
and cancel out of that.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.700
So to show you a little
bit about Go Live 6,

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.320
which is currently shipping,
let me first start off

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.300
with the interface.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.100
So when you're working with a project,
this is your site window.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.920
We maintain all of your external links,
your diagrams,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.290
which is actually-- you can map out how
your project's going to flow together.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.400
It's similar to what you'd be using,
like OmniGraph A or Microsoft Visio.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.900
It's our information
architecture diagramming tool.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.550
So you can use this to build out
the interactivity with the user

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.000
or the technologies that will
be used within your project.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.900
Colors-- we maintain all.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.500
The colors that are in your site, fonts,
and then any shared library components.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.900
But what I'm going to show you next is,
within your site,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.960
you can actually preview your assets
without even having to open them.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.240
And again, being that we're Adobe,
we support all the native

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.500
Adobe file formats.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.800
So if it's a PSD file,
if it's an AI Illustrator file,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.360
it doesn't matter.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.800
You could preview this content
without having to open it.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.160
So what I'm going to introduce
you now-- not the object

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.400
spot-- the inspector palette.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.790
This is an inspector that's contextual.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.940
Everything you work with within Go Live,
you will use the inspector palette to get

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.300
a snapshot of what type of content you're
working with-- name of the content,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.380
the page, and get a thumbnail.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:17.700
open it.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.700
So there's a thumbnail on my HTML page
without having to open my file.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.600
So you can imagine if you have
a site with tens of thousands

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.540
of assets inside of it,
it's not optimal to go

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.250
hunting and pecking,
trying to find particular

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.700
assets you're looking for.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.750
Use the Inspector,
use the Inspector's Content tab to

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.700
easily and quickly navigate to the
content you're actually looking for.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.700
If you're working with QuickTime,
as an example, natively,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.700
built into the Inspector,
you can actually preview QuickTime,

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.700
Flash, SVG, etc.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.700
It's very powerful and very flexible.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.700
Native PSD file.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.550
Here's a native PSD file,
which I'll be talking

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.700
about a little bit later.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.700
This is the control bar that
is a layered Photoshop file,

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.700
and we'll be showing how you can simply
bring that in and immediately wire it

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.700
up using QuickTime interactivity to
present your content out to the web.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.700
So with that said,
let me go ahead and close that and open

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.690
up the Objects palette and explain a
little bit about how this actually works.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.700
When you're working with Go Live and
you're working with a file,

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.700
whether it be QuickTime or HTML,
the Objects palette is where all your

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.700
elements are that you would drag and
drop into your layout window or into

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.700
your timeline to start authoring content.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.640
You want to work with QuickTime,
you've got your QuickTime object.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.700
You want to work with HTML,
you've got your HTML elements.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.700
But we're going to be
talking about QuickTime.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.160
To talk about what objects
we support within the

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.030
QuickTime authoring environment,
let's start off just by

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.700
going over one by one.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.660
So we have a movie track,
Sprite movie track,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.700
there's a video track,
generic filter track,

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.700
which is really cool if you want to do
flames and different kinematic effects.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:23:00.700
One source filter track, transitions,
three source filter track, MPEG track,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.700
little penguin there
for the Sprite track,

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.700
little lightning bolt for the
Macromedia Flash Swift track,

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:14.700
Ahrefs track, chapter track, text track,
soundtrack, MIDI track,

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.700
instrumental track, streaming track,
and then a folder track for sort

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.700
of collecting and managing your
content within the timeline itself.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.700
When you use these elements
in conjunction with QuickTime,

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.700
in conjunction with the Go Live's
HTML and XHTML authoring capabilities,

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.670
you can use QuickTime now to
control the elements of the page

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.700
that the user is experiencing.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.390
So as an example,
if you had a frame and you had

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.680
QuickTime embedded in one aspect of
it and you wanted to have subtitling

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.130
or product information appear in
the second frame as the timeline

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.700
plays within the QuickTime movie,
you can control the

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.700
elements of the frame,
control the elements of external

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.700
or linked parent and child windows.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.700
It's relatively straightforward
and very simple.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.180
One quick note,
Go Live 6 as you're seeing it

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.720
today is available on Adobe.com,
try out version, have at it,

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.700
it's a lot of fun.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.700
So let's go ahead and
open up this file here.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.700
This is a file that Sonka, my engineer,
put together really quickly.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.970
And because the screen is so tiny,
I'm going to shrink the

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:14.700
window down if I can here.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.700
Ugh, this is going to be difficult.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:24.700
... ... ... Ooh,
now I can't even grab it.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.580
Let's try that again.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:36.210
I did not open this file
before I changed resolutions.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.000
Um, okay.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.960
So let me go ahead and
click on the QuickTime bit.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.240
So let me explain what you're
seeing and what you're not seeing.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.640
It's an HTML file.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.900
The background imagery and
the sort of slicing within the

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.920
table that the QuickTime movie
is embedded in is a PSD file.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.060
It was comped up in Photoshop.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.060
It was then sliced and image ready,
and then brought in to

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.390
go live just natively,
just dragging and dropping that file,

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.470
and we immediately build
out the aspects of the site.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.900
We can read it and again parse
native Adobe file formats

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.160
and do the translation.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.320
So what this file consists of is a
one single frame QuickTime movie,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.150
and then a sprite track that controls
the interactivity of the movie.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.040
So let's go ahead and
let me close the file,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.850
and let's preview it inside of Safari.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.170
Hopefully Safari's
window won't be gigantic.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.180
Oh, better.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.490
So here's the file.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.300
We're going to go ahead
and play the movie.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.370
And then we're going to dissect it.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:49.040
So, what you're seeing here,
you've got an external audio track,

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.350
a single QuickTime container track,
and there's a bunch of

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.800
JPEG stills that he had taken.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.590
This is outside the offices of
GoLive R&D facility in Hamburg,

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.400
Germany.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.020
Very beautiful town, love the city.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:06.710
And he's brought in and imported
all the external JPEGs that he

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.460
had and immediately compiled this
QuickTime movie with transition effects.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.400
Turns out this, my engineer,
he's also a composer,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.600
I did not know that,
so this music he wrote himself.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.550
Classical, piano, did not know that,
he's a man of many trades.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.900
Again, it's hard to follow tomato.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.200
I've got some cool
stuff coming up though.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.080
There you go.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.500
Fairly straightforward, very simple.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:46.810
Let's go ahead and open up that
movie and inspect its properties.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.660
Okay, here we go.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.700
I'm going to take this window and
for the sake of space constraints,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.530
I'm going to just shrink
it down a little bit.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.770
And then open up my timeline,
and this is kind of gigantic too.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.250
Let's shrink that down.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.000
All right.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.500
A bit more manageable.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.470
And then I'm gonna shrink
down the viewable aspect here.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.500
Let's see here.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:15.500
Okay.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.500
And then let's expect-- let's
go ahead and inspect this movie.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.500
So you can see here,
the picture track was brought in,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.500
and then a filter was set up so
that you have transitional wipes.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.500
Within the inspector, how that was done,
you have images,

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.490
import the images automatically,
loads them into the track,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.500
and then you have the option of setting
the parameters of the slideshow,

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.500
the duration of the fade in and fade out.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.500
This is very straightforward,
basic QuickTime Interactivity

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.490
that you're seeing here.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.500
It's all visual.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.660
Very easy to do.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.160
Talk a little bit about the control
palette that made up the movie.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.140
And by doing that, let me come in,
jump into Photoshop really quickly,

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.420
and let me show you what we did here.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.660
So here you have the PSD file.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.520
Let me blow it up a little bit.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:06.050
And let me go ahead and
turn the palettes on.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.330
And you can see that each
one of these components,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.300
you have an on and off state.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:51.200
[Transcript missing]

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.080
And then bring open the timeline again.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.580
Because it's a different timeline,
I need to resize this one as well.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.100
OK.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.520
So we're going to inspect
the sprite track here.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.480
And by doing so,
I'm going to come into layout.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.640
And this is where you actually go ahead
and you lay out your various elements.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.480
So the PSD file has been imported.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.520
And you can see here that
when we go into the sprites,

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.900
you set up your characteristics here.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.800
You want to do auto resizing,
importing the background layer,

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.500
which is the actual PSD file.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.380
And then you have main, over, and click.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.580
This sets up the states
for the interactivity.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.920
Now with that done,
you can notice if we preview the file,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.790
the on and over states are active.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.240
This is just one of the many
enhanced productivity functionality

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.200
features within Go Live that help
you be more productive within your

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.900
QuickTime interactive design efforts.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:47.400
And if you play the movie,
it plays again.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.160
Kind of enough about Go Live 6.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.400
I mean, it's pretty straightforward.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.200
Site management,
maintain all your link references.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.490
We parse everything for you
to make sure nothing breaks,

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.050
and we update everything
automatically if you choose to do so.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.060
Full QuickTime,
six related authoring capabilities.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.900
Let me go ahead and
open up a file I have,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.610
and then I'll talk a little
bit about exporting for a

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.210
mobile device out of Go Live 6.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.440
We're going to take a move source
file that I have created here that

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.790
was for a concert in Tokyo for
an artist named Susumu that

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.160
actually my daughter was filmed in.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.080
So, let's see here.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.070
Where did I save it?

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.070
It's on here.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.890
So we're going to go ahead
and open up this file here.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:52.150
And go live, we'll crash.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.500
That is a feature.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:55.160
Thank you very much.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.720
Let's go ahead and try
that one last time.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.450
All right, when this happens, move on.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.370
I'll be showing that file again in just
a second with the sort of technology,

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.690
future technology preview,
which will work.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.680
So let me go ahead and close out.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.080
Actually,
I'll leave Photoshop open because

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.120
we do want to come back to this.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.500
I won't save this file here though.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.760
All right,
so with the release of QuickTime 6.3,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.240
there's a lot of additional
enhanced functionality.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.420
MPEG-4 support, 3GP support,
QuickTime scripting,

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.620
which a lot of people are
having difficulty with,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.650
especially if you want to set
something up where it's a sophisticated

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:58.320
movie that supports media scans,
and has an XML database

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.410
that can read in movies,
and change the movies that are playing

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:05.020
dynamically and get database records
without having to visually create that.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.560
You can actually script that out now.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.270
I'll give you an example of that
by playing this file I have here.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.030
So what you're seeing here is an
element that was created inside of

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.810
this future technology with Sneak Peek.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.490
It consists of media skin that
you're seeing here knocked out with

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.280
the alpha channels that's fully
transparent and supports shadows.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:27.560
You can see the shadows
underneath this area here.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.960
Background image,
there's a little animated

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.500
sprite track here.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:36.850
There's a text track,
a sprite track that's controlling the

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.700
XML database that I'll be showing you.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.460
And then down below here,
there actually will be dynamic

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.940
records that will be taken out of the
database that will show you how many

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.040
movies you have in your database,
what movie you're on, et cetera.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.120
And that information will be
then displayed in this area here,

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.740
giving a little explanation
of what the actual movie is.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.670
So let's go ahead and check it out.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:09.190
Description out of the XML,
records being dynamically generated.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.370
Let's go to the next track.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:49.400
[Transcript missing]

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.260
So I'm going to go ahead and click
on this other wired sprite here

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.780
that will shut my movie down.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:58.170
Jumping into Future Technology.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.260
All right.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.570
Again, similar to the way you're used
to working with Go Live 6,

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.660
site window manages your project.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:14.180
We have the objects palette up here,
and the inspector palette down here for

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.220
your content that you'll be inspecting.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:17.720
So same objects.

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:22.640
Actually, there are a couple additional
ones that have been added here.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.040
So let's go ahead and start
looking at this content.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:29.110
So let's open up the source file.

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.840
Scale that out and bring up my timeline,
just so we can see

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.340
everything that's going on.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.690
Again, by selecting these elements here,
so...

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.850
Animated sprite, text track.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.820
Let me jump into here.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:53.790
You'll notice in the timeline,
though-- let's see here.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.160
Record info,
which is being taken out of the database.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:59.670
The timeline is very familiar.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.660
It is based on After Effects and
the Live Motion timeline here.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.920
So we're going to go
ahead and inspect this.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.420
Notice that there's no
XML list that's attached to it,

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.200
so it's dynamic.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.180
And how is that dynamic
content being generated?

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.920
Well, inside of this new technology
that we've been working on,

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:23.430
you now have the ability to-- actually,
let me go back in, reopen that file.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:34.270
QuickTime Script Manager work with
QuickTime scripting inside of our

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:37.800
environments and let me go ahead and
open up a bit more complicated file.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:44.000
So you can see here there's some
content going on you've got functions,

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.220
variable functions and this is content
that you can either write by hand

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:54.000
or you could use the application to
develop out this content visually and

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.210
how you would go about doing that as
an example oops did not want to do that

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:07.940
undo uh... we have an XML database that
allows you to set this information up.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.380
So we're gonna go in here and we're
gonna say uh... just to show you

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.730
really quickly uh... make this movie
and then an interface will come up

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.480
and this will allow you to it take in
the information again similar to what

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.530
you saw in Go Live 6 you have a file
that's set up with different states,

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.510
we're on and over states and it
sucks that native PSD information

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.940
into the application splits it
out and then here you can actually

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:33.990
assign what what do I want this to
actually do very straightforward

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.280
Let me go ahead and click back into here.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.510
And then again, this is also being taken
out of an XML record.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.630
Let me go ahead and open
up that XML record so you

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.780
can see how that's set up.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:57.200
So you can see here that it's calling
out to where the movie file is located.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:01.760
So inside the movies folder,
atomic.mpeg4, movies, slideshow, mpeg4,

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.060
movies, destination, mpeg4.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.850
The information in the
XML database is here.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.600
One thing to note about dealing
with this XML database is that

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.000
not only can you deal with a flat
database such as this that's local,

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.540
or could be on a server someplace,
you can also link this up to any

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.620
ODBC or JDBC-compliant database,
where you can suck data out of a

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.760
content management system as well.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.610
Key note.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.280
Something I want to talk a
little about as you're coding,

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:33.220
to help you develop content like
that within this future technology,

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.680
we've enabled some designer and
developer friendly functionality

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.340
into this new technology.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.280
Let me go off and start
by showing some of that.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.470
Let's see here.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.070
Let's talk a little bit about
debugging when you're dealing

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.000
with QuickTime scripting.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.340
So what I'm going to go ahead and do
now is I'm going to-- let's see here.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:05.440
I'm going to go ahead and
open up the script file.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.560
So this is a very simple file.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:13.440
It contains basically a background
and this little Adobe logo.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.770
I'm going to go ahead and just show
you the timeline really quickly so

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.160
you can see what I'm talking about.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.130
So there's a variables track here,
and inside the variables

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:25.900
track it has a sprite element,
which is the actual image.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.760
and a sprite track as well.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.510
So what we've done with this is
I've added some code to this.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.880
I'm going to go ahead and open that
code up and show you what's going on.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.980
I've added some functions.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.460
So you can test out your interactivity as
you're coding it or you're designing it.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.470
So we have a function onMouseClick,
debugString.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.040
I've clicked the Adobe logo.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:50.240
OnMouseEnter,
I have entered the Adobe logo.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.400
And then I have exited the Adobe logo.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:59.980
You'll notice here though,
as you're coding your content,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.520
Code completion,
all based on the QuickTime syntax DTD.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:13.160
So the nice thing about that is
if Apple decides to update the

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.070
interactivity specification for
QuickTime without having to wait

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.340
for Adobe to release an update,
you can simply take those parameters,

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.780
throw that into the DTD,
update the DTD visually

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.360
within our application,
and voila,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.390
you've got your code completion
going immediately that

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.940
supports the latest standards.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.590
So I'm going to go ahead
and close this file down.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.680
Actually,
what I'll do is I'll just kind of

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.510
shrink it and move it over here.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.690
And then I'm going to open
up the debugger window.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:44.100
That's QuickTime Script Manager.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.250
Let's save.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:55.800
Oh, that's right.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.140
Let me just recompile all my scripts.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.800
And--

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.150
All right, this isn't doing-- oh,
it's at the bottom of this.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:04.980
Sorry about that.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.610
There we go.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.740
Okay,
so we have the debugger window open now.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.160
And to preview your content,
this test that you're

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.300
scripting is working,
we're just going to do some simple tests.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.780
Over, down.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.410
So this is pretty handy,
especially when you're dealing with

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:31.960
development tools and you're doing some
really sophisticated QuickTime scripting.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.640
This is pretty handy so you know
what's actually going on with

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.140
your code that you're writing.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.780
So let me go ahead and close that down.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.960
And I'm going to show you
some other new capabilities.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.210
So let's talk about animating
your various sprites.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:45.840
Here's a very simple animation.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.260
Let's preview it.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:51.350
It's CW logo bouncing from the
foreground into the background,

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:56.450
and then bouncing around in
different areas of the screen.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:02.640
Again, using the After Effects timeline,

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.390
Let's go ahead and open my timeline here.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.950
And I'm going to go ahead
and select that sprite track.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.560
Scroll down.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.140
I can actually see where
it's actually animating.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.080
It can change the path
of this interactively.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.110
So if I come down here,
and let's say that on

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:33.140
this key frame here,
I want the scale to actually be bigger,

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:38.510
and then I want the spin to be-- let's
put the spin a little bit faster.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:41.530
And then come over to the next key frame,
which I didn't-- actually,

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.940
I didn't select the key frame.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.240
Select the key frame here,
change some of these attributes.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.400
And now if we come
back and we preview it,

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.900
we're going to get a different effect.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.000
It's a little bit out of control,
but hopefully you get the point.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.530
I mean,
you don't have to be a programmer to

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.530
really write this sophisticated code.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.520
You don't have to be a
designer necessarily to set

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.290
a lot of this information up.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.520
It's very visual,
just like the rest of Adobe applications.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.870
So you shouldn't have any
difficulty at all getting up to

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:13.750
speed and actually developing out
some of this really cool content.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.370
So I'm going to close this down,
and let's dive into another

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.560
example that I have.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.700
So, Media Skin.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:27.580
So, here's a movie that's been created,
and you'll notice there's

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.370
some animation going on,
some type, and we're going to apply

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.130
Media Skin to this.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.780
Let's preview the MediaSkins movie.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.880
So it's got the Adobe logo here.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.620
Now, what I'm going to do is we're
going to open that up in QuickTime,

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.930
and take a look and see how that looks.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.390
What you've done is,
let's go ahead and open

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.630
up the Adobe PSD file,
and we'll show you the alpha

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.490
channels that are in that.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:14.300
It's simply setting up the alpha
channels inside of Photoshop.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.950
I don't have the fonts installed,
that's fine.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.700
And then bringing it in
into the application.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.600
And Go Live will actually knock
out that background for you.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.670
Hence, you'll get that effect.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.810
There aren't any handles on this movie,
so I really can't move it around,

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:38.200
but that is a media skin element
inside of Go Live Future technology.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.230
So, the last movie I want to show you
guys is some content that another

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.200
individual in the room here,
George Williams, has put together.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.100
Also using QuickTime scripting.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.200
Let's go ahead and preview this.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.110
So, question to the crowd.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.440
can go live preview a 40
megabyte QuickTime movie.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:07.480
Why would you want to put a 40
megabyte QuickTime movie onto the web?

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.840
Yes or no?

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.380
Anybody?

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.080
Yes?

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.880
Wrong.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.600
So this is just some really
simple game-like interactivity.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.190
Yes.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.790
Now the interesting thing
about this movie is that,

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:23.170
again, you have a larger
QuickTime Move container

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.700
inside of the timeline.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.010
Let me go ahead and shrink this
down and explain what's going on.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:32.660
Come back into layout,
bring up my timeline.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.800
So you've got a sort of
like the Uber container.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:37.820
Inside of the Uber container,
we've got different attributes to play,

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.550
the choice.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:40.080
These are actually,
think of them as markers

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.900
within the actual movie itself.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.760
That allow you to go through the
different phases of the interactivity.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:49.420
Down below here, in each one of these
sub-phases are containers,

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.970
so.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:45:01.100
The first step is to
update the movie file.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.100
Instead of having to go
back into this interface,

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:07.650
all you would need to do is
export the movie and put it into

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.100
the folder that it's linked to.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.960
Then it automatically will
be sucked into the file,

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.520
sucked into the movie
and then played back.

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:17.200
Let's go ahead and show some
more of the functionality here.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.280
So come down,
it's got the interactive menu.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.600
You can jump between the storyline,
between some of the actors.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.250
Come back to this area.

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:30.290
So this is a movie,
and then it's going to jump into

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.370
another movie shortly thereafter that,
and you'll see it jump

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:34.710
within the timeline.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.390
It's back to the game portion.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:52.410
So that does it for the interactivity
portion of the future technology demo

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.940
I wanted to do for this afternoon.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.200
What I want to show you next is
working with some mobile content.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.540
You may or may not be
aware of that 3G is here,

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.070
and they're already working on 4G,
which is kind of quite scary

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:05.020
considering America is so far behind.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.860
But I spent a lot of time in Japan.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.240
I've spent a lot of time in Europe.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.270
And Europe is now moving into
a 3G infrastructure that was

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.950
just recently rolled out.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.240
And with that,
you now have the ability to play back

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.150
SVG QuickTime within your handsets.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.740
And one of the big benefits of that
is that you can now add-- for example,

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.820
if it's a live news feed
from the BBC or something,

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.920
you can add a tell-up track within
your authoring environment that

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.820
could have text that's scrolling,
that's pertinent to the

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.960
actual video that's being
broadcasted onto your handset.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.140
But then you can level
interactivity to that as well.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:39.730
You can have hyperlinks off to
XHTML pages that were created around

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.770
that content that's being broadcasted.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.270
I'm going to show you a really
quick bit on that right now.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.360
Using that same file
I tried to open earlier.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.260
There you go, it opened.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.320
Don't know why it didn't open before.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.110
Let's go ahead and preview
this track really quickly.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.540
I'm going to subject you
to a little bit here.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.300
That's my daughter.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.790
It was done for a music video in Japan.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.800
So I'm going to add a text track to this.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.740
So let me go back and scroll back
to the beginning of this file here.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.790
Open up my timeline.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:24.800
I'm going to open up my objects palette,
and then I'm going to now add an element.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.800
We're going to go ahead
and add a text track.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.800
I'm dragging and dropping my
text track into the movie.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.800
I'm then going to select it,
and then we're going to position it.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.650
Let's say I'm going to
move this down here,

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:43.990
scale this out, push this down,
and come down to the actual text track.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.300
Bring up the inspector palette,
and let's add some text.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.920
This is like firewire cables.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.520
Select all, copy it,
paste it in a few times.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.940
We're going to apply it.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.940
Now we're going to add
some properties to it.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.680
So let's see here.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.660
So we want to scroll in and scroll out.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.880
On a horizontal scroll.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.680
Text color's fine.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.180
Let's see here.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.520
Let's see what it looks like.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:47.530
Let's rewind it.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.650
Let's add a couple more effects to this,
because we want to see the

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.700
background that's actually happening.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:49:00.900
So let's go into... let's see here...
Let's come back down and select that.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:07.770
Let's add...

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.180
A blend mode to it.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.470
So you'll see some transparency
going on in the background as well.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.970
Now if this was exported in MPEG-4,
you'd actually get that blend mode,

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:34.130
but we're going to be exporting for
the NTT DOCOMO FOMA file format.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.390
And by the way,
Go Live is fully double byte enabled,

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:42.700
so whether you're doing Arabic, Cyrillic,
Japanese, Korean, Chinese, or Hangul,

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.890
you're pretty much good to go,
especially considering those

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:48.280
markets are so much more evolved
than the United States market.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.570
So we have this completed.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.030
We're going to take this movie.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.660
We're going to export it.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.900
The little gumdrop comes up.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.900
And move this over here.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.900
Let's check our 3GP export options.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.900
Epic 4, Textract 3GP.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.900
Let me just make sure that's Unicode.

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.900
It's Unicode, okay.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.900
And we're going to click OK.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.900
And let's save it down to the desktop.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.790
Exporting the movie.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.440
I have to apologize,
we actually had some really

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.710
cool phone demos we wanted to
show everyone this afternoon,

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:34.600
but both my phone battery and Anthony's
phone battery are completely dead.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.180
Because everyone was just
like so enthused about it

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:40.450
and wanted to play with it,
so again, apologies for that.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.600
But, this is the next best thing.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.600
I actually wanted to show you
this video file on the phone.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.600
And, let's play it back.

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.170
Through wonderful QuickTime.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.450
Now if we wanted to add one last thing,
if we wanted to add a really

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:04.850
quick interactive bit to this,
let's jump back into this.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.600
Open that file up one more time.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.590
Bring open the timeline one more time.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:14.460
And let's scroll back
down to the text bit.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.390
Go into My Inspector.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.730
And let's just say--

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:43.200
[Transcript missing]

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.820
I'm getting, this is, by the way,
this is development,

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.350
so I'm getting some weird funkiness here.

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.080
Cable.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:59.450
I'm just going to disconnect this,
hopefully not crash.

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:05.500
I did not sacrifice my
demo chicken this morning.

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.600
Always a necessity.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:13.960
All right, and then, actually,
you know what, just so we have... Apple,

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:20.790
let's go down to the very
end and make it all a link.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:53:01.000
[Transcript missing]

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:16.540
Play it.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:16.680
Oh!

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.700
It's broken.

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:22.800
Alright, what would have happened is you
would have had a hyperlink there.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.700
It would have been interactive.

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.700
And it would have opened the
web browser Safari to Apple.com.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.700
But there you have it.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:33.700
So you can see that with some of this
new technology that we're developing,

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.910
we have some very robust
interactive authoring and designing

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:41.700
capabilities that build upon what's
currently existing in Go Live 6.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:44.660
And we have advanced support
for mobile authoring.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.700
Not just what you see
here with 3GP or MPEG-4,

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.700
but whether you're
dealing with CSS level 2,

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:51.930
you're dealing with mobile CSS,
you're going to see some really

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:53.620
interesting stuff coming out of Adobe.
