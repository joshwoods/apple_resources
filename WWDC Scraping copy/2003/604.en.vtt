WEBVTT

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.770
Welcome.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.680
Welcome to session 604.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.300
Today we're going to be talking a
little bit about Mac OS X Server.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.660
In Steve's keynote
presentation yesterday,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.330
he discussed a lot about Panther and
some of the new features that

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.500
we've introduced in the desktop.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.320
Today we're going to be talking
about Mac OS X Server Panther,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.890
give you a little bit of an
overview of what the product is,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.690
some of the new features that are in it.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.900
We understand that many
of you in the audience,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.970
some of you are using
Mac OS X Server today.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.940
For others,
this is the first chance you've

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.550
had to take a look at the product.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.320
So we're going to kind of try
and have a session here that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.680
can cover both audiences.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.230
What we're doing is we're
building a server operating

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.110
system that is really innovative.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.300
It's really the easiest way to
deploy open-source server solutions.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.520
As you'll see in this presentation,
there's a lot of open-source

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.870
software that we've taken built
into the server operating system.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.030
But our goal here, again,
is to make these open-source

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.220
server solutions very easy to use.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710
So let's take a step back and look
at what Apple's been doing in the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.360
past with our server products.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.440
In May of 2001, we introduced
Mac OS X Server version 10.0.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.640
That was really the first new version
in our server operating system line.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.430
And then in September,
we came out with a new version

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.120
that was the 10.1 version.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.210
And that was pretty similar
to the previous product,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.310
just some performance improvements
and stability improvements.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.070
About this time last year
at the developer conference,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.060
if any of you were here,
we kind of let out a little secret

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.590
that we were working on a new machine.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.000
We talked about a rack-mount server.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.410
And we announced that in June and
shipped it shortly thereafter.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.250
So XServe was a major accomplishment
for Apple and really marked a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.780
hallmark in our history of really
going after the server marketplace.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.260
And then in September,
just a couple months after,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.040
we introduced Mac OS X Server Jaguar,
the version 10.2.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.240
And that was really a radical
improvement for us with regards

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.120
to the server operating system.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.750
A lot of performance improvements,
many new features, a lot of new desktop

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.600
management enhancements.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.770
Again, earlier this year,
moving forward to earlier

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.800
this year in February,
we updated the X Serves again.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.240
Came out with a brand new X Serve,
an X Serve cluster node version,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.000
and then the wonderful X Serve RAID,
which just has a massive amount of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.070
storage for an unbelievable price.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.810
And then our next version,
our next big server accomplishment that

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.740
we're working on right now is Panther,
or Panther Server.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.960
And Steve mentioned that's scheduled
to be available later this year.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.960
Hopefully all of you have had a
chance to take a look at the software

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.840
that we distributed to you yesterday.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.600
In that packet there is
a copy of Panther Server.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.540
And I know from me talking to
some of you in the audience that

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.890
many of you have already installed
it and been playing with it.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.490
So I encourage you to do that.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.150
There's a lot of new features in there,
new enhancements that you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.490
won't find in the desktop.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.780
Thank you.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.050
So really,
what is Apple's server strategy?

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.900
This was discussed a little
bit in Bud Tribble's keynote

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.780
presentation yesterday,
but Apple's really striving to

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.060
bring innovation to the data center.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.000
We think that there's a lot of
innovative new technologies,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.030
simplifications that we can
bring back to the data center.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.780
So what we're doing is, as we mentioned,
we're building this industrial-strength

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.500
server operating system.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.660
We are leveraging the capabilities
of the open-source groups.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.220
We're building upon the projects
that they've provided for us.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.010
And we're also focusing on standards,
and standards, as you know, is very key,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.200
because it doesn't lock you as a
customer into one particular vendor.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.700
It allows you to pick the best
solution for what you're deploying.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.130
We're also trying to build a product that
has a lot of different services built in.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.800
We want this product to be very flexible,
fit into different environments.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.250
So there's a lot of different
services in the product,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.110
everything from file and print
services and internet and web,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.870
desktop management technologies,
media streaming.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.220
There's a whole wealth of
services that are built in.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.980
But again, our goal here is to really
lower the cost of ownership.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.900
Lower the cost of
ownership for our servers,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.110
but also for our desktop systems with
our desktop management technologies

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.210
that we've built into the product.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.060
So what's new in Panther?

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.780
Well, there's a wonderful
array of new features,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.360
and this is just some of them.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.440
We've got a really new,
improved Darwin core operating system,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.740
the BSD layer of the operating system.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.440
As you'll find in some
of the presentations,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.510
there's a lot of new enhancements there.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.220
We've got a new automatic
server setup feature,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.430
making it very easy to configure
an entire rack of X Servers

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.360
or just a single server,
all from a configuration file.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.400
We'll be talking about that more later
today in some of the other sessions.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.450
We've listened to your feedback.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.900
We've improved our
administration software,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.930
have a new server admin application.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.040
We've built in Samba 3.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.200
Apple's Mac OS X Server is really
going to be the first commercial

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.500
operating system to ship with Samba 3.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.300
And Samba 3 gives us
a lot of new features,

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.820
the ability to support PDCs so we
can host Windows Home directories,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.080
have a single account for
a login and authentication.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.510
Open Directory.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.360
We have a new version of Open Directory.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.670
Again,
not only LDAP-based directory services,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.400
but also Kerberos for authentication.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.180
Single Sign-On goes along with Kerberos,
so the user only has to

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.660
enter a single password,
and they can access other

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.810
services on their network.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.610
A complete end-to-end VPN solution.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.450
We have a VPN client in the
desktop operating system and now

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.540
a VPN server in Mac OS X Server.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.260
JBoss application servers for
hosting J2EE-based applications.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.940
And then also the new
Postfix mail server,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.730
having a really industrial-strength
mail server finally on our server.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.080
So now I'd like to turn the
presentation over to Greg Burns.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.840
Greg is the engineering manager for
all of the Mac OS X Server project.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.340
And Greg will give you an
overview of some of the features

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.320
that are in Panther Server.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.870
Greg?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.960
Thank you, Eric.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.070
Thank you.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.270
So now we're going to take a tour through
some of the features in Panther Server,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.530
and specifically we're going
to focus on some of the things

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.590
that are new in this release,
but we'll cover all of it,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.420
as Eric mentioned,
for those of you who maybe are

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.850
not so familiar with the product.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.430
And as many of you heard yesterday,
underlying Mac OS X Server is

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.030
a Unix foundation.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.050
It's based on open source, based on BSD,
and it provides the scalability

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.820
and the reliability you need for
a competitive server platform.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.140
We've upgraded this to
BSD 5 in Panther Server,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.920
and with this we get
a lot of improvements.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.280
One of them is we've improved
performance in this release.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.690
We've improved the raw throughput,
and in addition,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.520
we've added POSIX asynchronous I.O.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.340
support, which has been a popular request
from our database developers.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.700
We've also enhanced the
scalability of the file system.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.500
We now support up to 16
terabyte file systems.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.270
Journaling is something that
was introduced for the server

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.860
in HFS in an update for 10.2.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.080
And we've now integrated that into HFS,
and it is the default

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.260
for all HFS in Mac OS X,
journaling file system.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.420
And finally, another popular request,
case sensitive HFS Plus for people that

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:07.920
are sharing file systems out to Unix
clients using XSERVs as NFS servers.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.450
Case sensitivity has been
a very popular request,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.080
so you now have that as
an option in the server.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.890
With BSD networking also comes
advanced features like IPv6 and IPsec,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.130
as well as multi-homing for
hosting multiple web domains.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.240
For capable Ethernet interfaces,
we support Gigabit JumboFrame support.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.410
And we also have IP over Firewire,
which makes a great back-channel

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.730
networking interface for IP failover.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.800
IP Failover provides high
availability in the server.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.500
It allows you to set up a pair
of servers that are clustered

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.690
and can support failover.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.330
Each one can monitor the other and
pick up its IP addresses and its

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.710
services in case the other one fails
and then relinquish them when the

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.660
second server comes back online.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.620
We also support automatic restart,
which allows any service to

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.450
be restarted should it fail.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.880
It also will restart the whole
system in the event of a system hang.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.120
And finally,
software RAID provides reliability

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.800
and performance in the storage layer.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.210
And of course,
there's hardware RAID as well

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.290
from the XSERV RAID product line.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.460
And for anybody that's
familiar with Unix,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.390
of course, with BSD comes all the
familiar networking and

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.770
system administration tools,
secure login through SSH,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.550
a variety of shells,
all the BSD commands.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.110
It's very familiar to anybody that's
administered a BSD or a Linux server,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.710
so you'll feel right at home.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.900
Now we could stop there and just
take all the open source foundation

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.420
and throw the services on it,
but we didn't.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.280
And we've put a lot of effort into making
sure that it's all integrated and making

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.370
sure that the management tools that
we provide make the whole system very

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.220
easy to set up and very easy to use.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.530
And so what we've done is we've
added tools for automatic setup,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.100
automatic configuration.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.420
We've provided a wide suite
of server management tools for

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.020
ongoing day-to-day management,
and we've provided directory

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.090
management tools for the directory.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.600
Automatic server setup allows you to take
a server right out of the box and set it

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.460
up very simply in a matter of seconds.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.300
You can take a server configuration
for things like IP address,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.890
domain names, service setup,
and you can save that into a

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.670
file and put it on a portable
device like a FireWire drive,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.330
an iPod, or a USB keychain drive.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.390
And then when you take a
server right out of the box,

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.510
brand new, turn it on,
plug it in to the network,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.460
you can just plug that
drive into the server.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.410
It will recognize the configuration
file and configure itself

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.860
automatically in a matter of seconds.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.060
Now, that works great if you have
one or two or three servers,

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.940
but if you have a whole rack of servers,
even just moving the drive around

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.220
can get kind of cumbersome.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.900
So what we've also done
is allow you to store this

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.090
configuration out on the network.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.950
So you can take a rack of
servers that are brand new,

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.390
never been touched,
plug them into the network,

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.320
turn them all on,
and have them all grab their

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.300
configuration directly and be up
and running in a matter of seconds.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.300
So you can't get much simpler than that.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.340
So let's move over to a quick demo here,
and we'll have Eric come up and

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.660
just do a quick demonstration to
show you how simple this really is.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.920
Okay,
so we're going to go to slide number one,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.170
or machine number one here.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.240
Normally when you set up the server,
you have the setup assistant

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.090
that comes up and walks you
through configuring of the server.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.320
What we've done is we've
walked through that process,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.790
but saved all those settings into a
file that I have here on this iPod.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.000
And so I'm going to take the iPod,
and I'm going to plug it in here.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.650
And if all goes well,
what Panther Server is going

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.500
to do is it's going to see
that this iPod is connected,

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.470
that it mounts.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.170
And in a couple seconds,
we'll see a barber pole come up.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.580
It's going to configure the
server and get the services up and

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.360
running for that configuration,
and then it's going to

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.180
automatically restart the machine.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.420
So it's a little -- oh,
someone stole their IP.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420
I don't know the address.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.300
We didn't even know that.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.410
But this configuration file,
it sets it up,

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.390
and it just automatically restarts,
and then you're set to go.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.900
All right, thanks, Eric.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.680
So in your networks,
you all have better control of your

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.500
IP addresses than we do here at Moscone,
but it is very simple.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.570
So let's move on back to the slides here.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.840
So another area that we've
improved in Panther Server is

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.420
the administration tools.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.530
We've taken all of the
administration tools and

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.980
integrated them into a single app,
which allows you to set up and monitor

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.340
your services on a day-to-day basis.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.700
It runs as XML over HTTP,
so you can monitor and configure

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.280
your services remotely.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.480
You can configure and monitor
multiple services from within the app.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.840
And one cool feature we've added in
Panther Server is the ability to easily

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.680
replicate configurations between servers.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.960
So for instance,
if you have a server configuration,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.600
like a file server or a web server,
and you've set it up,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.280
and you want to replicate
that across a bank of servers,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.860
you can now just take that configuration
and drag it from one service to another,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.260
and it will automatically
configure the second server,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.460
or the third, or the fourth.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.370
So it makes it very easy in a single
step to configure multiple servers and

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.990
to change your configurations across
multiple servers on an ongoing basis.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.100
Again, very simple,
a very cool feature that's

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.940
new in Panther Server.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.950
So again-- we'll have Eric come up,
and we'll do a quick

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.550
demo of Server Admin.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.800
So we'll move to
computer number two here.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.680
And so the Server Admin application,
like I said, is a great new application

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.760
that's in Panther Server.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.580
It allows you to take a look at all
the services that you have running.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.200
So in this list here on the left,
we have two servers

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.720
that I'm connected to.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.000
I'm watching the servers,
and I can connect through here.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.190
I can see their network traffic
and the CPU usage and get some

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.020
of the various information.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.800
One of the really neat features--
this is the ability to actually

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.900
take the settings from one
service and apply that to another.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.560
So I'm actually going to open
up a new server window here.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.240
And in this interface,
I'm going to go to my Apple File Server,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.560
and I'm going to make some
changes to the configuration.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.110
So I'm going to say,
welcome to my server.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.230
Server Rocks.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.260
And I can go in here and change,
you know, configuration methods.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.470
You know, that's great.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.160
Any method.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.180
I can set it to only, you know,
support 200 connections.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.000
I can hit save here.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.610
Oops.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.740
I can go, okay, we're going to go back.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.030
I can go to logging.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.620
I can set different logging options,
even control different settings.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.650
Now, when I save this,
I can take this configuration just

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.280
by holding down this little checkbox,
this checkbox.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.300
This is the check mark that we have here.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.800
I can drag that to another
server in the list.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.700
So over here,
I'm dragging this to the other server,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.880
and it'll take that setting and
apply that to this other server.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.620
So it's a really easy way
of taking the services,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.160
the configuration that you have
from one machine and applying it

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.720
to other machines on your network.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.240
Thanks, Eric.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.080
Lastly,
Workgroup Manager allows you to manage

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.740
the directory in Mac OS X Server.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.140
All of Mac OS X Server is
based on directory system,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.380
open directory that underlies it.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.570
And all of the information
about accounts,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.580
authentication, service configuration is
stored in the directory.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.340
And Workgroup Manager lets
you easily manage accounts,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.620
account settings,
as well as preferences and

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.840
other things that can be
configured through the directory.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.630
Eric Zelenkka, Greg Burns,
Francois Jouaux

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.400
Because Mac OS X Server is based on LDAP,
this actually works

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.820
with any LDAP v3 server,
the one that comes with Mac OS X Server,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.960
as well as if you're using a third-party
LDAP server for your environment,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.430
it'll work with those as well.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.810
Another new feature we've added for
Panther Server is a directory inspector,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.530
which is a very cool feature for
power users that actually allows

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.380
you to go in and edit the raw
records in the directory server.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.570
So it's not something you
need on an everyday basis,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.050
but it's a powerful feature
for people that need it.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.250
So open directory is an area
that we've made a lot of

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.120
improvements in Panther Server.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.740
Open directory is Mac OS X's
framework for accessing directory

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.580
and authentication information.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.940
All of the services in the client
and the server use open directory.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.910
And open directory allows us
to integrate with the native

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:31.100
services in Mac OS X Server,
LDAP and Kerberos,

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.100
as well as a variety of other services,
NIS for Unix environments,

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.810
Active Directory, NetInfo, BSD files.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.820
So you have a wide variety of
choices for configuration and for

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.500
storing directory and authentication
information for your Mac OS X systems.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.120
So in Mac OS X Server,
we provide the services themselves.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.180
LDAP is now based on OpenLDAP,
and Kerberos is based on MIT's Kerberos.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.860
And Kerberos provides
us with single sign-on,

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.520
which is new to
Panther and Panther Server.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.400
This allows you to log in once securely
at login time at the login window,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.590
and then access all of your services
with a secure Kerberos ticket.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.020
So file services, email,
you don't have to store passwords

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.150
separately for each service now.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.620
And also, for those of you that are
familiar with Mac OS X Server,

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.800
this also gives us
authenticated automounts.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.720
So this is another important security
improvement in Mac OS X Server.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.720
We know that not all of the
services are going to be Kerberized,

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.450
that some of you will always need
to access legacy services that

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.580
use standard password encryption.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.380
And so for that, we have Password Server,
which provides legacy encryption methods.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.300
So Single Server,
Single Sidon is based on Kerberos.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.280
We are adopting MIT Kerberos for this.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.970
It's based on V5.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.480
We're not changing the
Kerberos protocol in any way.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.760
And so because of that,
our implementation, our server,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.620
our client can be used with
any deployment of MIT Kerberos.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:11.090
So whether you choose to use Mac OS X as
your KDC or whether you choose to use

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.420
your own residing on another platform,
our services will work.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.380
Now, of course,
we provide KDC and Mac OS X Server to

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.280
make it really simple out of the box to
set up and configure and have a complete

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.230
authentication and directory environment.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.000
Another improvement we've made in
Open Directory is to improve the

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.760
scalability of the directory services.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.520
LDAP is now hosted on
Berkeley DB for scalability.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.900
For those of you
familiar with the server,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.640
in the past it was hosted
on a NetInfo backend.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.260
We still have NetInfo in the system
for those of you that want to use

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.380
it for legacy support reasons,
but for Mac OS X Server, Panther Server,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.260
and beyond, all of the default directory
services are based on LDAP,

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.180
on Open LDAP on Berkeley DB.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.540
This gives us the capability
of hot backup for greater

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.870
availability and scalability to
over 100,000 records per server.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.480
Of course, if you need more than that,
you can also replicate your services.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.030
We provide replication locally that
allows you to have greater availability

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.080
or to have multiple servers serving
the same directory information,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.460
and you can also replicate remotely for
greater availability for remote sites.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.100
And another thing we've done, again,
to further improve the overall

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.180
usability of the system out of the box,
is to have a more secure system.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.750
The overall usability of the system
out of the box is we've integrated

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.830
the Kerberos KDC backend with password
server and with the LDAP server so

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.110
that all the replication happens simply
and automatically out of the box.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.820
You don't have to worry
about wiring this up.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.740
It's all connected and integrated fully.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.190
And so with that,
we'll bring up Eric just to

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.390
show you how simple it is to
set up Open Directory services

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.700
in Panther Server.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.600
Okay, so we'll go back to
computer number two here.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.820
So on the screen, you'll see that we have
an open directory service.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.700
Remember, it's the LDAP, the Kerberos,
the Sassl password authentication server.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.300
So I can go and I can set a couple
of different settings for this.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.730
First of all,
I can see an overview of what's

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.040
actually running on the system.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.240
I can look at the logs and then
make configuration changes.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.300
So this server is currently set
up to be a standalone server.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.320
It's an isolated server.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.360
But I can promote it to be
an open directory master.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.350
This is going to turn on the
LDAP services and the Kerberos KDC,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.380
et cetera.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.680
I can also have a replica on my network.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.040
A replica is a machine
that's bound to the master.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.850
And I can also have this server connected
to an existing directory system.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.220
So we've done a lot of work in the user
interface here to really improve this,

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.260
make it easy to understand.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.600
You can also go through and
configure the different protocols,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.580
search bases, set up SSL authentication.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.950
And you can also define password
policies for your network.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.690
So if I wanted to say that all my
passwords on the network have to

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.650
be at least a certain number of
characters long or differ from the

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.560
last four passwords that you've used,
I can make that change and impose that

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.340
upon all the users in the network.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.660
All right.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.110
Thanks, Eric.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.480
Let's go back to presentation.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.540
So that's open directory two.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.700
So one of the most popular
services for any server,

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.200
obviously, is workgroup services,
file and print for the local intranet.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.120
And of course,
we provide a wide variety of services

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.480
there for both file and print.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.800
Looking specifically at
the file sharing side,

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.880
we provide native
services for Mac clients,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.690
AFP, SMB Sys for Windows clients,
and NFS for Unix.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.230
We've improved the
performance in this release.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.020
As before,
we provide support for multiple

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.630
protocols on any SharePoint so all
clients can share the same data.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.510
All the authentication is unified
through the LDAP backend with

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.600
the same account information.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:47.060
And we have disk quota support so you
can control the use of server resources.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.390
We made some improvements
to NFS in this release.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:58.940
One popular use of NFS in the server
is to reshare the NFS volumes via AFP.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.030
NFS has some security compromises
when you use that as a sharing method.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.890
And so a lot of people like
to take a bank of X Serves and

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.570
use them to reshare enterprise
storage via AFP to their clients.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.580
And another area we've improved NFS is

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.380
Greater performance and also
improving the reliability in

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.100
this release and adding NFS file
locking support for data integrity.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.710
We've added Samba 3 for Windows client
support and integrated PDC or

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.820
primary domain controller
support directly into the server.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.400
So that's all configured directly
out of the box very simply and easily

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.910
through the administration tools.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.480
And what this means is now that
when you log into a Windows client

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.830
at the Windows login window,
you can use the same authentication

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.540
data from Mac OS X Server that's
hosted in LDAP that your Mac clients

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.190
use or that any other client uses.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.900
You can share a home directory
with your Mac client,

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.080
whether you're accessing
it from Windows or Mac,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.000
and you can host your roaming
profiles on the server.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.710
That's all built into the system,
and it's configured through the GUI.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.000
And finally,
we've added Active Directory integration.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.100
This is native integration that's new
to Panther for both client and server.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.200
And what this means is that there
are no schema changes required in

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.370
Active Directory to support Mac OS X.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.350
It integrates with the Kerberos
authentication and Active Directory.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.080
And for large installations
that have multiple domains in

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.280
their Active Directory forest,
we support automatic

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.520
multi-domain authentication.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.250
So it's all very simple to use,
very simple to configure out of the box.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.790
And all of the services
in Mac OS X Server can use

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.550
Active Directory for storage
of their directory accounts.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.900
Another area that's important
in workgroup services

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.660
is workgroup management.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.520
We spend a lot of effort at
Apple making Mac OS X very

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.910
simple and easy to configure,
easy to set up and use.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.230
And that's great if you have one system.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.300
But, you know,
you might have more than one.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.220
You might have, you know, a hundred,
a thousand.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.890
And then, you know, what do you do then?

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.330
Well, we have a set of products
in Mac OS X Server that make

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.060
this very easy to manage.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.870
You can install systems on a large
number of desktops on the network.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.020
You can set them up.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.380
You can configure them and manage
them on a day-to-day basis.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.100
These are workgroup management
services in Mac OS X Server.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.890
It's all directory-based,
so all of this system configuration

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.670
is stored in the directory.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.820
We provide services that allow
you to control preferences,

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.910
to set preferences on these systems,
to control their use of resources

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.330
both on the system and on the network.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:48.400
And we provide tools to allow network
installation and setup of these systems.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.530
Something that's new in
Panther Server also is the ability

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.400
to do this on mobile systems.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.190
So if you have mobile computers,
Power Books, iBooks,

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.080
you can manage their accounts.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.750
You can manage the
authentication information,

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:04.010
the account information,
and all of the preferences and everything

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.200
else that you set through the directory.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.640
And that will be synchronized
automatically when your

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.190
system comes onto the network.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.190
And so even mobile computers now
can be managed using these tools.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:24.920
And finally, two tools for installing and
managing images on the network,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.960
NetBoot and NetInstall.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.360
NetBoot obviously allows
you to boot a system,

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.550
a desktop, or a server over the network.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.720
And two things that we've added in
Panther Server are the ability to

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.950
NetBoot over HTTP as well as NFS,
and also the ability to do

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.310
a fully diskless NetBoot,
which is very handy if you have an

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.540
image of network diagnostic tools
where you want to debug a problem.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:51.250
You can NetBoot completely
independently of any disk that's running

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.040
remotely or locally on the desktop.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.000
For network install,
this allows you to install systems

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.140
over the network using Netboot.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.340
And you can use it to
distribute software images,

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.020
distribute software updates.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.300
And we've made a couple improvements
to this in Panther Server.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.350
One is we've redesigned the tool
that you use to create the images,

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.010
the network image utility,
to make it simpler to use and

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.980
add a lot more options to it,
more powerful.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.670
And another option that we've added--
it's been a big request-- is the

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.420
ability to do full image installs.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.940
So now you can take a volume
that hosts system software,

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.680
has applications installed,
it's fully configured,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.980
and you can clone that and do network
installs of system or volume images,

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.290
as well as packages or
clean system installs.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.290
So that covers the workgroup
services built into Mac OS X Server.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.270
So now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to bring Chris LeCroy and

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.620
then Francois Jouaux up on stage.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.500
And they're going to talk more about
some of the services that allow

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.390
you to host web services as well as
network services in Mac OS X Server.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.000
So Chris?

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.110
Looks great.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.200
All right,
so internet networking services.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.800
We've seen a bunch of the directory
services and file services.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.600
Mac OS X Server also includes a good
number of internet network services.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.800
So let me start that off.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.660
The first one is media streaming.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:21.740
So Mac OS X Server has always
included QuickTime Streaming Server,

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.950
which is an extremely powerful
media streaming server.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.950
It's like

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.280
Extremely powerful for
streaming on the LAN.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.220
You can do extremely high
quality across the LAN.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.210
It supports multicast.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.630
You can send extremely high
bitrate content over your

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.940
network using multicast.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.720
It supports MPEG-4,
all the QuickTime content, MP3.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.980
It's compatible with
Windows and Macintosh players.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.620
It's also a server that is
powerful enough to be used for

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.400
streaming across the internet.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.040
So a lot of the big content
distribution networks that you see,

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.520
including the ones that Apple uses,
are using QuickTime streaming

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.080
server as their streaming server for
serving MPEG-4 and QuickTime content.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.270
And then with the advent of
802.11 and a PowerBook in the

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.020
QuickTime broadcaster application,
you can actually have a

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.110
completely mobile solution.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.430
So you can actually take
a PowerBook wirelessly,

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:18.560
walk around the room.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.850
Stream broadcast, send it up to a server,
and stream that out over the internet.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.110
We've seen that done quite a few times.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:32.040
So new with Panther Server is
QuickTime Streaming Server 5.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.640
It's got all the same
features that it's always had.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.200
It has no license fees.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.520
We don't charge per stream.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.920
Supports Mac, Windows, and Linux clients.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.680
It supports Linux clients
through its MPEG-4 compatibility.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.900
And it supports Instant On technology,
which basically eliminates all of

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.070
the buffering messages you would
see normally when you're streaming.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.580
It starts up as fast as if it's playing
locally on a good broadband connection.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.990
Skip protection,
which is our technology for guaranteeing

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.050
quality of service across the internet.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.140
As we know,
there are always blips in the internet.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:06.350
Skip protection is the technology
that basically eliminates those

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.960
blips when you're watching content.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.800
And the servers perform extremely well.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:16.080
They can, off of a single machine,
stream up to 4,000 concurrent streams.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.080
And if you want to do more than that,
it's really just a matter of

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.590
buying a few more experts.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.310
Also new with Panther Server is
QTSS Publisher.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.300
So this is a new application
that provides a way to remotely

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:33.580
manage your QuickTime content.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.690
For putting up on the internet.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.060
So it automatically takes
care of things like hinting or

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.950
preparing it for the web servers.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.120
It'll automatically create web galleries.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.320
It's tightly integrated with the
Apache web server on Mac OS X Server.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.580
It has all of the UI for
creating playlists,

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.700
managing the order of playlists,
scheduling playlists,

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.680
and doing all of those things.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.540
MP3 playlists as well as
QuickTime content playlists.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.320
It allows you to edit annotations.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.140
And behind the scenes,
all of this is happening with some Unix

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.340
tools that we wrote for Panther Server.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.020
So you can now, from the command line,
do things like hint movies,

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.960
change annotations,
all of that from the shell,

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.900
if that's the way you'd
like to do things.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.400
QuickTime Broadcaster is a product
we shipped about a year ago.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.420
It allows you to take
any FireWire camera,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.980
plug it in,
and do a broadcast from your computer.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.680
It supports all of the QuickTime codecs,
and of course,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.160
it supports the standard MPEG-4.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.990
It's got a...

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.960
A bit of functionality we
call reliable transport.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.800
And what that is,
is a guarantee that the stream

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.920
from the broadcaster to the server
is going to be a solid stream.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.490
And that's really important,
because if you lose packets between

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.330
the broadcaster and the server,
every single client sees that loss.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.340
So we've got a way to guarantee
that all the packets get there.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.180
It supports unicast
and multicast as well.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.680
And it delivers ISO-compliant streams.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.220
So those are MPEG-4 streams
to any standard player.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.130
So it'll play on Linux for
any player that supports the

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.990
standard ISO MPEG-4 player.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.200
So networking services.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.620
Got both some old stuff and
some new stuff in Panther.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.750
I shouldn't say old,
I mean it was available

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.720
in Jaguar's server.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.210
I'm going to go through both of those.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.080
We have an entire slew
of networking services.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.220
I'm not going to go through all of these.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.850
DNS, DHCP,
we've got a network time server,

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:28.960
firewall.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.660
We've added VPN, which is new,
authentication.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.150
And it's all standard.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:38.130
So you can connect Macintoshes,
you can connect Windows machines,

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.340
Linux machines.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.380
It's all completely standard.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.230
We don't believe in proprietary
technologies where we can help it.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.280
So, dynamic host configuration.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.200
We've had DHCP in Jaguar's server.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.070
We've added a couple of
things to the Panther server.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:55.720
DHCP, as you know, provides automatic
doling out of addresses.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.420
We've added the ability to specify
LDAP directories for those machines.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.830
We've also added the ability in the
UI to bind a specific Ethernet address

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:07.060
to the IP address of any machine.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.120
So, you've got machines that want
to have a permanent IP address

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.640
but have it served up via DHCP.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.240
You can do that now through
our admin application.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.490
And, of course,
you can control IP address ranges,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.040
the lease times, and network routing,
things like that.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.640
Next, some networking,
network routing technologies.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.740
So we've had NAT on the
desktop for Mac OS X Server.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.780
We've now moved that
functionality into the server.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.460
So in the server admin,
you can now configure NAT.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:38.690
We've also added a VPN server,
and that's all configurable in

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.520
the new server admin as well.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.670
It works with all standards.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.550
It also works with Windows technologies
so that you can use things like

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.240
MS-CHAP and PPTP as well as L2TP.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.870
So DNS.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.930
So we've bumped the
version of Bind up to nine.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.950
So good, like that.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.110
So you're going to get dynamic DNS,
things like that.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.880
And as everyone knows,
it's the most widely deployed

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.240
DNS server on the internet.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.860
For those of you who really
like to configure Bind files,

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:20.670
your job security is kind of limited now,
because we've added UI to the admin.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.980
And if you get a chance to look at it,
it's actually pretty slick.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.110
I think we did a good job
on the UI on this one.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.100
And Firewall.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.680
This isn't new,
but we have redone the UI on this.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.760
It's really simple to set
up kind of basic rules.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.700
It's using the standard Berkeley IPFW.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.280
We also have some UI that will allow
the more advanced people to set up

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.320
basically any rule that IPFW can handle.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.730
Something we didn't have in the past,
all of the configuration for Firewall was

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.260
actually stored up in a NetInfo database.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.130
We've moved that down into a config file.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.780
Although you can do everything in the UI,
if you need to SSH into a machine,

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.830
if you're on a non-Macintosh machine,
you can always get in there and

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.600
change those configurations that way.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.890
And next is mail services.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.240
So Mac OS X Server.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.370
Prior to Panther,
we had a proprietary mail server.

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:20.960
It was a standard server.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.740
It supported all of the
normal internet standards.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:26.620
We also had a web mail
server through Squirrel Mail.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.740
It allows connectivity because
it's all standard to any platform

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.840
that supports standard mail.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.540
We've made a couple of changes.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.950
We no longer have a
proprietary mail server.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:40.760
We've moved to Postfix for the MTA.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.250
And we did that for a lot of reasons.

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.530
It scales well.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.440
It's very secure.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.440
It was written by a security expert.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.930
It's easy to configure in terms
of the configuration files.

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.720
If you've ever seen
send mail configuration,

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.000
you know what I'm talking about.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.020
And then we've all, for IMAP and POP,
we've moved to Cyrus,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.640
and there were a few
reasons for doing that,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:03.920
too.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.900
So Cyrus is a proven IMAP server.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.620
It supports clustering,
so it's easy to scale it.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.480
You can configure it to
work with multiple machines.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.180
And it also supports the ability
to store your mail for different

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.560
accounts on any variety of machines.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.480
So if you want to segment up your email
users to different back-end stores,

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.820
you can do that,
and it's not a problem at all with Cyrus.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.830
And we are, of course, Kerberizing it,
so it'll work properly

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.680
with single sign-on.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:38.680
And it also will support,
we will support SSL on our mail servers.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.690
So on top of mailing lists...

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.880
With the mail server we had in the past,
in Jaguar,

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:53.200
it had a feature that would allow you
to take any group in the directory

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.340
and treat that as a mailing list.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.840
Well, we're losing that because
of the new mail servers,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.940
but what we've decided to do to kind
of replace that functionality is

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.640
to add a real mailing list server.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.600
So we've added the Mailman
mailing list server.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.510
Mailman's extremely powerful.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.980
It's actually the one,
if you go to lists.apple.com,

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.260
it's the one Apple uses for its
mailing lists for the public.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.460
We've built some UI into the
server admin to actually create

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.940
mailing lists in the admin.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.780
Mailman, as you know,
has web-based tools as well,

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.910
so for your end users,
they can go in and they can change

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.840
their options if they want digest mode.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.720
If they don't want digest mode,
they can go to a web page

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.770
and set all of that stuff up.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.010
It supports all kinds of features,
such as mailed-in-mail-to-news gateways,

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.300
bounce handling, spam prevention,
and it's also got email-based

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.820
administration commands,
as most good mailing lists do.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:46.970
Webmail.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.890
So we have revved the version of webmail
that we're using in Panther Server.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.620
Webmail is a standards-based
webmail package written in PHP.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.450
There are some really
good things about it.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.560
One is that it's pure HTML.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.170
It's not using any JavaScript.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.550
It's compatible with
basically any browser,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.080
so you don't have to worry
about compatibility there.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.680
Works with any SMTP or IMAP mail server.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.690
I see no reason why you would
need to use it with anything

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.740
other than the Panther server.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.140
Supports MIME encoding.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.700
Address books now, which is new.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.940
We didn't have that in the prior version.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.790
Folder manipulation.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.290
You can host this mail via SSL,
so you can have completely

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.040
secure mail over the web.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.070
And we've gone,
the version that we've moved

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.710
up to now supports Japanese,
so we've got Japanese support

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.380
for Squirrel Mill.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.930
And Eric's going to come up
and demo some mail for you.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.300
Okay, so we'll go back to
computer number two here.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.660
And our mail server in the PostMix mail
server is a really great mail server,

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.000
so we're really happy to provide a
really good user interface for it.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.800
So here in the user interface,
the administrator can go in,

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.490
they can enable and disable SMTP,
set up their IMAP,

00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:02.260
even have messages sent to
Postmaster at apple.com or whatever.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.760
I can go in and I can
configure the mailing list,

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.740
as Chris showed,
in the user interface here.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.730
You can enable them.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.360
I can add new ones to it.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.610
I can set up filters.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.060
Spam prevention is very key,
very important.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.320
This user interface here allows
us to have a real rich set

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.270
of spam filtering options.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.430
And then also, control many log levels.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.810
And then the last screen here allows
you to configure the authentication

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.420
options in some of the hosts.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.850
So this is really important if you are
in secure environments or you want to use

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.500
Kerberos only for your authentication.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.130
Nice feature down here is
the ability to use SSL.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:44.440
So I can say, you have to use SSL,
or I can use SSL if it's available,

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.020
or I can require SSL.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.980
So if you want to implement
secure email on your network,

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.830
you can do that and enforce it in
requirement for all your clients.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.970
Great.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.080
Thanks, Eric.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.090
So back to the slides.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.920
- Do you have slides?

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.680
So next is web services.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.660
In Panther Server,
we're once again including

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.680
the Apache web server.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.320
We have performance-optimized
Apache web server.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.100
We're able to do far more
connections than a typical Apache web

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.320
server would be able to do.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.620
It's even a little faster in Panther.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.710
We ship 1.3 as the default web server,
and that's actually the one

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.420
that you'd be configuring when
you're in the server admin.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.070
But we do include 2.0,
so people who do want to use that,

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.630
it's there.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.400
You can use it.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:43.660
Part of the problem we've seen is that
the adoption hasn't really happened yet.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.330
There are a lot of modules that
haven't been ported over to 2.0 yet,

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.100
and so Apache 1.3 is what we
decided to stick with for Panther.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.070
We greatly improved the
administration interface.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:56.170
You may have seen Bud Tribble
demo a little bit of it yesterday.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.030
It's really,
really easy to set up sites and

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.380
realms and things like that now.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.340
We've included WebDAV for web publishing.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.500
We have bumped the
version of MySQL to 4.0,

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.060
so for those of you waiting for that,
that's there.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:17.920
The server has all kinds of support for
server-side scripting architectures,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.090
SSI, Perl, Ruby, PHP.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:25.340
We're changing the build style of PHP,
so we're actually including more

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:30.440
of the development functions that
people needed in our PHP module.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.920
So that'll be good for development.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.470
developers.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.570
So basically taking all of
these things-- I don't know if

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:39.570
you guys can read all of that.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.060
Mac OS X Server basically has everything
needed to create three-tier websites

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.920
or entire websites on Mac OS X Server.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.080
We include a bunch of
stuff to do your own thing.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.580
If you've got third-party products,
you can grab as well 4D, Oracle.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:58.030
So it's a great development
platform for web development.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.290
And Francois is going to come
up and talk to you a little bit

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.670
more about those technologies.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:02.200
Thanks.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.530
Thanks.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.200
Okay, to wake up the audience,
let's have a little show of hands.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.400
How many sysadmins are among us today?

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.800
How many developers
sitting in for sysadmins?

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.010
Also, these people must be a little
way above our head right now.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.700
And for them, it's time to take out your
notebooks and to remember the few

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.150
slides that are going to come up.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:39.500
So in Mac OS X Server,
we are leveraging the best standards

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.040
and the best technologies to bring
you the best application servers.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.960
But first, there is Java.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.320
Java has evolved as an
OS on top of the OS.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:58.700
Nowadays, application servers are huge,
multi-threaded beasts.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.290
They are all implemented in Java.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.600
They spawn thousands of
simultaneous threads.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.320
They open and close
thousands of I/O connections.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:12.580
And they necessitate an enterprise-grade
Java VM underneath them.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:18.460
That's what we are providing with a
JDK 1.4 and a JDK 1.3 implementation.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.740
Now the big news today is JBoss.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.210
JBoss is very popular out there.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.550
It is popular for three reasons.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.120
It's free, it's free, and it's free.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:45.000
How do you bundle free software
and do not show up as a freeloader?

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.170
You add value.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.380
And we believe we are adding
tremendous value on top of JBoss.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.550
The real three reasons for
JBoss being popular are its

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.280
unbeatable quality for the price,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.720
I'm going to improve.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.640
The next one is its
perceived ease of use.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.080
And the third one is its modular design.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:18.330
It is perceived ease of use,
but as Marc Fleury, the JBoss founder,

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:23.550
says, they are pushing the envelope
at the container level,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:29.800
which means that they are not really
investing in the deployment ease of use.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.150
Developers love JBoss.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.150
Deployers hate it.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:40.180
If you're a sysadmin, to use JBoss,
you'll have to speak XML in your dreams.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.910
Now,
this is going to be a dream come true.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.260
We are introducing tools to enable you to
deploy JBoss easily on Mac OS X Server.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.240
Our goal is to make
Mac OS X Server the best platform

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.510
to deploy J2EE applications.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:04.320
We are doing this in three steps.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:08.610
First, JBoss is integrated in
the server admin plugin.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:12.280
Second,
there is a JBoss deployment tool that

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:16.650
lets you take J2E applications from

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:22.670
IDEs and package them,
talking to the JBoss server,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.200
prepackage them to deploy them.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.020
And third,
there is a JBoss management console

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.560
that lets you manage the JBoss server,
start and stop services,

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:39.390
look at its statistics, and so on,
and manage the lifecycle

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.390
of your applications.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.770
Now, this is all nice,
but where is the modular design?

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:50.210
I'm going to give you a few examples of
services that we are bundling with JBoss.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.240
The first one is Tomcat.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.950
So you're all familiar with Tomcat.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.750
We've been shipping it for a while.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.370
We're revving the version to 4.1.x
because it's always evolving.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.090
And we integrated it in JBoss.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:09.700
So now Tomcat lives inside JBoss and
can be managed by the same tools that

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.200
I talked about in the previous slides.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.220
And the servlet on GSP applications can
be prepackaged by the deployment tool.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:22.810
The WebObjects application server.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:29.110
WebObjects has been improved and will
be shipped as version 5.2.2 with a

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:33.620
much better J2EE packaging process.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:39.150
You now have true WAR packaging
for WebObjects and also true

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:43.900
GNDI configuration for WebObjects.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:53.710
Another example is, again from Apache,
it's the Axis Web Service project.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:58.050
We're bringing version 1.1,
and it is integrated,

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:03.480
it benefits from JBoss,
and also is leveraged by WebObjects

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.600
for our direct web services solution.

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.580
This will be session 6.24, I believe,
on Friday.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:19.270
So these are all but a few examples of
services that are bundled with JBoss,

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:29.640
and they enabled us to bring
to Mac OS X Server the best in

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:29.810
J2EE application deployment.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.960
So as you can see,
whether you're hosting a single website

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.760
or whether you have a sophisticated
three-tier Java application architecture,

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.670
Mac OS X Server has all of the
services that you need built right in.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.400
Finally, last but not least,
documentation.

00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.360
So we currently ship
Mac OS X Server with two manuals,

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.830
and we've got lots of
requests to improve that,

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.610
and so we've answered those requests.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:11.930
And we are going to be upping that
count to 12 manuals in this release.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.090
We'll have over 1,000
pages of online help,

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:20.250
and we've added or updated over 100
man pages to better document the Unix

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.980
underpinnings of Mac OS X Server.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.000
So we've really made some
big improvements there.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:29.890
So to wrap it all up,
so Mac OS X Server is built

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.620
on a strong Unix foundation.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.700
We have a broad array of services.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:35.830
These are some of the highlights.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.500
They won't even all fit on one slide.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.370
But we've taken all of those.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:41.960
We've integrated them.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.940
We've put administration tools on top
of them to make it easy to set up and

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.620
use and manage on a day-to-day basis.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.860
And for Panther Server,
the items up in blue are services

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.140
that have either been added or had
major enhancements in this release.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.920
So BSD5, automatic setup,
major improvements to

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.260
the management tools,
Open Directory 2, Samba 3, VPN,

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:11.470
Postfix mail server,
JBoss application server.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.480
So we've made a lot of
changes in Panther Server,

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.730
and it's going to be a great product.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.390
So we also have a lot of
sessions that are coming up

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.310
here if you want to learn more.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.260
This gives you an
overview of the product,

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.820
kind of lets you know
what's in Mac OS X Server.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.180
There's an in-depth session that's
coming up after this over in the marina

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.620
that's going to go into more detail
about APIs and underpinnings of the

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.740
server if you want more information.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:39.490
We have sessions on authentication
and directory services this

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:41.580
afternoon and tomorrow.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.700
And for those of you that are
interested in desktop management,

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.780
we have sessions on those tomorrow and
Thursday that will tell you more about

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:53.060
the services and also for developers
tell you about building applications

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.710
that work well in those environments.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.820
Now, one thing, if you're interested
in giving us feedback,

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.400
we have a feedback forum today.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.390
It's at 5 o'clock.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.700
But unfortunately,
due to scheduling conflicts,

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:06.350
it's also at the same time as
the authentication session.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.830
So we hope you'll come to one of those.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.650
Either come to the authentication
session to learn about authentication

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:12.870
or come to the feedback forum
where we'll be there to answer

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.620
your questions or take your feedback.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.940
But we hope to see you at one of those.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.260
Tomorrow, we have a, well, sorry.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.130
Actually,
there are several WebObject sessions

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.010
going on throughout the conference,
but here are a few that we've

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:27.820
called out of major interest.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.940
But check your books for the others,
as well as several sessions on

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.520
QuickTime streaming as well.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:38.420
So if you have any more questions,
you'd like to contact somebody,

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:42.460
Skip Levins in developer relations
or Eric Zelenk in product marketing

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.160
are the contacts for Mac OS X Server.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.250
And with that, I'd like to bring the
speakers back up on stage.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.000
We have a bit of time for Q&A.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.320
If anybody has any questions,
please step up to the mic and

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.650
we'll take your questions.
