WEBVTT

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.770
Welcome to our VR double feature,
the second half of that.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.550
I'm Rhonda Straatton
from the QuickTime team,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.310
and I'm here to introduce to you our
second VR session featuring Dennis Biela,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.980
who has been working on some just
amazing projects with QuickTime VR.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.800
In the last session,
we heard about a lot of new tools and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.610
ways to make VR and ways to get into it.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.180
In this session,
we're going to hear about some

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.080
really amazing projects that
Dennis has been working on.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.130
And a lot of guys have been
working on some cool things,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.280
but Dennis has just really impressed me
with some of the things he's been doing.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.080
So, no further ado.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.080
Oh, I do have to make one sort
of administrative thing.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.020
As far as Q&A,
we try to keep that to the end.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.580
If you've got a really burning question,
okay.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.780
But please make sure you have a question.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.540
Please make sure you always speak
into the mic when you have a question

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.430
so the translators can get it so
that everyone can hear the question.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.930
But I'll come back up at the end
and host the majority of the Q&A,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.580
okay?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.320
Thanks.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.160
So, good morning.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.260
You can all hear me okay?

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.800
Everything's working in the back there?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.650
I get the thumbs up, I love it.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.120
Okay.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.810
So, a little bit about myself,
since I don't think many

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.780
of you have taken any of my
sessions before or whatever.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.680
So I'm that VR guy.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.780
You know, when people say, you know,
that VR guy, that's me.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.840
That's right here.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.090
So, my company's called Lightspeed Media.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.570
I also have another company
called The Way Ahead Group,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.000
because if you're not way ahead,
you must be far behind.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.740
And Dennis Biela Photography.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.840
And basically, I'm just a photographer.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.430
I tell people that all the time.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.700
I'm just a photographer.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.540
Please don't.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.560
Don't give me all this information.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.790
So, I've been doing photography
for a long time.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.810
I started in photojournalism.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.580
I became a photographer because stick
people are tough for me to draw.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.750
You know, the little one-line things.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.460
So, I got involved in taking pictures.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.110
And I found at an early age
in high school that it was a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.900
great way for meeting girls,
you know, take their pictures.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.350
So, I got wrapped up into photography.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.070
And after a little while
in photojournalism,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.480
I started doing a lot of commercial work.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.380
And I specialized in
the automotive industry.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.610
For those of you who do not know,
the automotive industry is an $8

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.900
billion a year in advertising.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.480
So, I tend to be very, you know,
watch them a lot.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.880
So, I started doing work
for like GM and Jaguar.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.000
If I say them correctly three times,
they promise me more work.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.680
And I got involved in digital imaging.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.420
In fact,
I was doing digital quite a long time.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.030
I'm a beta tester for Kodak
and Canon on digital cameras.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.190
So, about six or seven years ago,
I heard about this thing on the web.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.460
You know, you could take your pictures
and you could put together

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.340
this thing called QuickTime VR.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.900
At that time, it was a free set of tools
just to play with it,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.440
to experiment with.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.460
So, I started downloading it.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.890
And if you were in the earlier session,
you heard that the automotive industry

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.900
is one of the largest users of VR.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.860
So, I started doing a lot of
QuickTime VR for automotive use.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.120
I've done some stuff for GMs.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.340
I have a project coming up for GM.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.820
I'm doing some work for a BMW.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.150
So, I've been in it quite a long time.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.600
For those of you who may
not have seen VR before,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.900
it's basically a series of still images.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.790
We can use a lot of
different capture devices,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.720
but it's a series of still images,
whether we're looking out,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.920
which would be a panoramic,
or we're looking in,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.400
which would be an object movie.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.170
And we have a lot of
different techniques.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.320
We'll talk about that.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.640
I'm going to switch to the laptop one.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.660
Thank you.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.110
And just show you really quick
two samples of what a VR is.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.540
The first one here I'm going
to show you is a cubic movie.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.640
So this is a full 360 environment
that I can look around in.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.910
I did this quite some time ago when
Apple was just playing with cubics.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.300
It's in Chicago.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.260
It's at Christmastime.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.480
And I just wanted to show, you know,
a nice wintry scene.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.490
When I travel around,
I do a lot of traveling in Asia,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.000
the kids are like, is that snow?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.480
So, yeah.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.760
We'll close that one out,
and then I'll show you an object movie.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.950
We'll talk more about this later,
but I'll show you an object movie.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.280
And this is an actual aircraft
that we shot at the Smithsonian.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.430
We'll get into that later.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.340
But it's 36 shots,
and I can move my cursor.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.650
I can see all the different
sides of the airplane.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.690
In our Smithsonian project,
we'll actually have text and

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.860
other information and links.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.260
So it will be a very interactive piece.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.660
But we'll take a look.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.880
Thank you.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.100
Thank you.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.160
Thank you.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.250
Thank you.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.040
We'll talk about that later.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.570
If I can go back to my presentation.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.180
So I'm going to talk to you a little
bit about three projects that we've

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.720
done in the last eight months.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.400
I'm going to give you a
little bit of overview.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.260
I'm going to talk you through
the process that we go through.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.520
I'm not really here to talk to
you about developing new tools,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.700
though.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.580
I'm going to show you a lot of really
cool stuff and give you some ideas.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.200
But I'm going to talk to you
more about what we go through

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.730
on our different projects.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.410
I found at an early age in photography
that it was just as easy to go after

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.380
big work as it was for small work.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.240
You know, that old additive about,
you know, big jobs are just as much

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.980
as little jobs is true.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.600
So I tend to concentrate on, like,
major projects.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.910
The other thing that you may be
interested in knowing is that most of

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.660
these projects were ones that I created.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.270
You know,
I went and talked to somebody and showed

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.620
them concepts and came up with the idea.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.860
Very little of our work
is somebody picking up the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.910
phone and calling me saying,
would you do this for us?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.140
We have a lot of projects.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.350
But most of them were
created by ourselves.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.830
I have an associate I work with,
and we would talk about different

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.470
ideas and start looking for
clients that we maybe work for.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.340
The first one is the
Esplanade in Singapore.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.490
We have some people from
Singapore in the crowd.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.130
This is like their Sydney Opera House.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.910
It's a huge facility.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.990
It's shaped like a durian fruit.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.410
And none of you know
what that looks like,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.440
but it's kind of like a pineapple.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.360
Cut in half, lay it on both sides,
and that's their facilities.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.440
And they had some interesting ideas for
what possibly they could do with VR.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.930
We went in there and we started talking
to them about the concept of what

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.440
possibly they may be using the VR for.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.940
There's always expectations
on the client side.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.440
You know, they think that, you know,
you should be able to do this, right?

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.060
And you're like,
there's no technology for that yet,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.180
but I'll think about it.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.440
And then, you know, they're like, well,
I'm going to do this.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.440
And then, you know,
the client's concerns.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.440
Oh, my God, will you be able to do this?

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.310
And, you know,
you have to sit there and go through it.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.440
Mac versus PC.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.410
This was my only client
that had just some concerns.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.680
There were no concerns after
the fact that QuickTime played

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.440
no problem in their system.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.850
We went in,
we loaded up QuickTime on all their

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.400
machines because they're mostly PC-based.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.440
They ran all the VR.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.190
It ran fine,
and then it was never a concern again.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.410
For those of you that may be working with
QuickTime or developing in QuickTime,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.440
I can tell you that
the tides have changed.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.440
I have very little issues now with
any major corporations in QuickTime.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.430
Before, it used to be like, well,
that's an Apple thing.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.440
You know, we're IBM.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.350
We can't use an Apple thing.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.440
So now it's more along the lines of, oh,
yeah, QuickTime, I've heard about that.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440
That's just a download, right?

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.350
It doesn't cost us now, does it?

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.430
I'm like, no, no, it's a free download.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.440
You can go to Apple's
website and pick it up.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.440
So the tides have turned,
and a lot of people are

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:20.440
trying to get out of it.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.380
And a lot of people
are adopting QuickTime.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.270
It became very important to us in a
couple of slides that are coming up.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.440
One of the things that is also
important is pre-planning.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.380
I think a lot of people
just come in and they think,

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.440
we'll shoot pictures.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.440
We'll just shoot the pictures,
and then we'll author the materials,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.440
and we'll put the VR together,
and they'll be happy.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.400
And you've already built in
problem points if you do that.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.380
We do a lot of pre-planning.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.440
We go through.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440
We take pictures of all
the different areas.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.420
We then put together
storyboards for video work.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.250
We put together real storyboards,
and we get the clients to

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.440
sign off on the storyboards.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.550
Because guaranteed, guaranteed,
the first time you start shooting,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.440
they're going to be like,
could you shoot an extra picture here?

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440
It's only a few minutes, right?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.440
Just a few extra snaps right here.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440
And you do that.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440
And then you go,
and you get to the next spot,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.440
and it's like, oh, just another couple
quick pictures over here.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440
It's not a big deal.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.790
And then the next thing you
know is that they have the only

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.440
marble toilet in Singapore.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.350
And Michael Jordan sat on this.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.430
Could you shoot a quick VR for us?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.440
It's one here and one there
and one in the washroom.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.940
And next thing you know,
it's like you've got a

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.440
whole new project going on,
and who's going to pay for it?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.990
So one of the things that we make
sure of is that we have everything

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.440
approved as to what we're going to do.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.440
Now, there's a thing out
there called value added.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.440
We're very big in value adding.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.440
So I may not charge
you for the extra work,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.340
but I want you to know that I'm doing it.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.360
You know,
it wasn't something that we agreed to.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.770
So you can see what other things
that I may be throwing into the

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.440
project because I want you happy.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.200
Remember,
your happiness is my foremost concern.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.440
And if I say that really well,
they really believe me too.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.080
So this one was a different project.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.260
I'm going to show you
some VRs in a little bit.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.400
This was for Zephyr 3 Partners.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.470
It's an agency.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.360
They specialize in doing
web content for agencies,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.620
and they wanted to shoot or
wanted to do some things for VR.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.160
And they came to us and they said,
you know, could we do some interior?

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.140
So we had to do concepting with them.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.160
We did a lot of concepting,
a lot of thinking about what they wanted.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.780
And then...

00:10:38.300 --> 00:15:19.300
[Transcript missing]

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.700
It only works in 9,
which is a big problem for me

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.870
because everything I have is in 10,
so I have to jump back and forth.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.020
But anyway, it allows me to output
these linear movies.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.500
So we are outputting these
broadcast-quality linear movies

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.810
so that they could have plasma
display screens like you see

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.020
throughout the conference here.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.950
They also had those at the
theater so that you could see

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.070
different spots of the theater,
like the library.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.360
You could go see where the
library is on the big screens,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.780
just as rolling video,
to entice you to go visit the library.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.840
All right,
let me get back to... So Citation Shares,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.330
and I need to launch... Oh,
we need to go to... Yeah, thank you,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.160
you're way ahead of me.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.350
Every once in a while that happens.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:18.180
So I'll be there in just a second.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.280
We need to get to my bookmark.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.040
Can we switch to the laptop now?

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.230
I think it's working.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:26.840
There we go.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.000
I just love it when this stuff works.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:36.990
So this is Citation Shares,
and I'll need to take you to an aircraft.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.160
So we're live.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.800
This is not on my hard drive
trying to get you there.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.040
And you can see that, you know,
the different sizes.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:52.040
And for $359,000,
you can go ahead and buy that, you know,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.030
share that jet.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.100
So they have different, like, cabins,
stuff like that.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.510
And then we can have VR of the interior.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:07.860
So here's a cubic VR that we shot
just showing the inside of the cabin.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:14.360
We used a 3D rendering program
called Bryce to create the exterior.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.810
So it looks like you're
flying outside the windows.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.990
And the first thing that
the company told us was,

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.960
"We're too low."

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.720
Of all the problems I faced,
I had it were too low.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.090
So I was like, is it really important?

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.820
So they're like, well, you know,
we don't want people to

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.220
think we fly recklessly.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.100
Okay, no problem.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.120
I'll work on that.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.980
So it kind of has a distorted view.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.160
The client wanted to show like
the entire cabin right away,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.640
so not particularly how I would
normally like to show it.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:56.420
I'd rather have it so it's zoomed in
a bit so that we could look around.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.250
But it's a way for people to see it.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.550
Their clientele, you know,
is Fortune 500 companies.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.450
Broadband is not the issue.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:08.720
In fact, some of these people have
like T3 lines to their homes.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.050
So, you know,
as big of files as we wanted to make,

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.800
they were fine with that.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.410
Interiors, the animations that
we were talking about.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.020
So like the seat, I can rotate, you know,
show different accessories.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.310
This seat doesn't do much.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.240
It's a lame seat.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.240
We have, you know,
but we have other seats.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.790
We have other seats where they
actually unfold and there's like

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.260
a little place for your drinks.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.200
We had to animate the drinks coming in.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.200
You know, all that good stuff.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.180
So tables, table on there.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.200
So again, showing that, you know,
you can -- okay, come on.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.200
We can get there.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:44.810
There we go.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.190
We can -- we show that, you know,
you have these fold-out tables,

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.700
that type of thing.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.290
So their big thing was to animate
showing the clients or prospective

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.200
clients all the possibilities that if
they rented this jet for only $359,000,

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.940
$359,000 per year,
that they could open up a folding table.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.020
So --

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.100
But actually, they have found that this
technology has improved sales.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.400
They did a little demo CD.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:18.360
They sent out demo CDs with PDFs to,
I think, about 1,000 prospective clients.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.010
And out of those 1,000
prospective clients,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.570
they had a response of 30.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.020
Now, you may say, well, 30 people.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.290
Yeah, but 30 people at 300,000.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.450
I'll take 30 people at
300,000 every day of the week.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.050
So if we can go back to my demo machine,
please.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.980
So that was a really good project
for us and it started us thinking.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.800
This is the National Air and
Space Museum,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.950
part of the Smithsonian.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.970
It's my current project right now.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.610
It's rather a huge project.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.000
We're shooting over 200 aircraft
and 144 space artifacts.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.920
The original project was
going to go for eight months.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.000
We're now up to two years.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
There are a guesstimate that we'll be
working on the project for two years.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.430
I got an email saying, "Oh my God,
you won't believe it.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.000
We may have more work." I'm like,
"Two years?"

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.240
You know, there's only so much I can
love airplanes after two years.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:21.910
But anyway,
so we're shooting a lot of stuff.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.930
We're creating a lot of QuickTime VR,
and we're doing a lot of really cool,

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.210
cutting-edge stuff.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.260
So let's talk about some of the
things leading up to the project.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.920
So my initial contact with the museum,
people want to know, like,

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.290
how do you get this work?

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.900
So I was doing work for another museum,
and somebody told me that

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.700
the Smithsonian was thinking
of doing something similar,

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.260
and this museum was so proud that
they were ahead of the Smithsonian.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.590
So as soon as I heard that,
I picked up the phone and

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.640
started calling the Smithsonian,
saying, "I hear you want some

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.890
VR shot." And they were like,
"VR what?" You know, so I had to, like,

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.440
find the right people.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.100
This project took me two years
just to get it moving forward.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.840
I've been working on it for two years,
talking to curators,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.410
talking to different departments,
at the Smithsonian, going through a whole

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.680
bunch of issues with them.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.910
My biggest thing is my
contract is 35 pages long,

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.570
and 20 pages relate to insurance.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.560
You know, like, there's no way I could
insure the right flyer.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.740
You know, I just don't,
I can't get a policy big enough.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.630
So there's these new things I keep
having to learn as we go through.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.620
Prototyping.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.280
Prototyping became really big
when I started working with the

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.380
Smithsonian and other larger museums,
because for a visual thing, you know,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.660
they're not visual.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.570
You know, I tell them, "Well, here,
we can do this,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.420
we can do that," and I show that to them,
and they, like, don't get it.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.700
So I have to use their actual pieces.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.170
There's a joke in Chicago that, you know,
if you shoot an apple pie,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.670
a peach pie won't do.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.710
You have to shoot an apple pie, you know,
to show to an art director.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.540
So, anyway, so same thing with this.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.420
I had to actually go in and
start shooting aircraft.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.820
I had to go in and start shooting
aircraft and build prototypes

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.360
with their stuff before they could
visualize what they wanted to do.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.020
Expectations.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.360
They had very low expectations.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.560
We were actually in
there showing them stuff,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.860
and they were like,
"I never knew I could do this.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.730
This is so cool." You know,
does it cost much?

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.240
That's a byword, funding.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.220
Funding is always a big
byword at the Smithsonian.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.460
Clients' concerns.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.680
We had a lot of concerns in the
very beginning when we started

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.770
shooting because there was
like touching the artifacts.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.140
They have very specific rules
about touching a 50-year-old

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.560
airplane or an 80-year-old aircraft.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.440
Mac versus PC.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:56.580
I was really concerned about this because
the Smithsonian has an IT department

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.810
that's the IT department from hell?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.220
You know, they're like, "Apple?

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.740
No, we can't do that." You know,
I'm like, "No, no, it's easy.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.690
It's QuickTime.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.350
You know, take the Apple part out.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.950
Just think QuickTime." "But
that's an Apple product.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.440
It won't run on our servers." No,
it's not an issue, believe me.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.110
So I spend -- it took two weeks for
them to hook up an airport extreme.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.560
They had two people at the facility
to hook up the extreme because they

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.570
weren't sure how well it would go,
and they dedicated all day.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.380
So, it took 30 seconds to
plug in the Ethernet.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.190
It's a government job.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.950
Remember,
two people plug in that Ethernet cable.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.360
And then I'm on the Mac and I say, "Okay,
I have Signal." And they're like, "No,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.140
you can't.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.350
It can't be that easy." "No, no,
it's a Mac thing."

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.780
So, it took me two weeks to get that 30
seconds for them to plug that in.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.280
So, dealing a lot with convincing
them that the Mac is the way

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.560
to go as far as easeability,
but on QuickTime, no issues.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:04.000
Showed them running QuickTime on Windows,
showed them QuickTime streaming server,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.450
showed them all the stuff that
they could do without changing

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.790
the way they're working,
and they were very impressed.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.770
They were impressed
that it doesn't break,

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.770
they were impressed
that it actually works,

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.190
they were impressed that they
wouldn't have to hire extra

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.690
people to make it happen.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.830
So, it was a good thing for us.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.100
Hardware,
Apple Computer and Rhonda Strahton,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.220
they've been very good to us and
they've loaned us some computers to use.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.430
So we're using Nikon and
Canon digital cameras.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.740
Remember,
I'm that digital guy in the other world.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:43.010
So we shoot with the Nikon
D1Xs and on the Canon side,

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.140
the Canon D1S.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.720
Make really high meg files,
we'll talk about that later.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.450
Bogan Lighting, Kydan VR heads, Dr.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.820
Lewis has made us that
specialized motorized head,

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:03.800
Lexar Media with the CF memory cards,
and GreyTag Macbeth for color.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.310
I've now served my country
and God because I've got

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.790
all my sponsors out there.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.270
Thank you.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.400
So lots of hardware.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.000
Oh, let's go back for one quick thing.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.240
We, oops, I'm going the wrong way here.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.940
I hate when that happens.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.030
We have these rolling carts.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.680
So there's an aircraft in the background.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.470
We have the Canon 1DS,
and we fire the cameras right

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.700
through firewire into the computers.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.390
We've had a host of special applications,
not a host, a few special applications

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.510
written for us,
but basically we've found it's

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.840
very expedient to shoot right to
the hard drives of the computers,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.820
saves us time downloading,
and we can also visually

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.540
see the images right away.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.310
We're using five computers, two laptops.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.730
There's two photographers.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.210
We have volunteers.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.060
We actually have more volunteers now.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.300
The Smithsonian has
dedicated staff to us,

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.000
and we have one dedicated
janitorial staff.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.680
That's what CES is.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.650
It's our janitor.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.920
We have our own project.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.000
We have a private janitor
because photographers are messy.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.790
So...

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.200
This is the interior of the new museum.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.380
It's called the Hasi Center.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.050
It's 200 feet wide and 1,000 feet long.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:21.330
And museums,
the reason why we got involved,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.050
or one of the reasons we got
involved with them is there's

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.800
a love-hate thing at museums.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.360
We want you to come and see
all of our great artifacts.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.750
And you get there,
and don't get too close.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.480
Back up.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.990
Don't touch that.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.900
So it's this thing of,
they want you to come and see everything,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.840
but they don't want
you to touch anything.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.870
And then the other issue is that a lot
of the airplanes are now hanging so that

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.110
you couldn't even get up close to them.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.620
So one of the reasons that
QuickTime VR is a major asset to

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.670
them is that there'll be 100 kiosks
spread out throughout the museum.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.890
And as you go through the museum,
you'll start to see

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.770
groupings of aircraft.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.180
That aircraft will be on the kiosk,
and now you can start seeing up

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.340
close what you're seeing from afar.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:10.300
And I'll show you some
samples in just a minute.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.710
Color management was a
very big deal for us.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.200
Besides the fact that Smithsonian has
exacting standards on,

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.820
like, if something is printed,
it has to be reproduced faithfully,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.800
just managing all these
different cameras.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.000
We found out that the different cameras
shoot color a little differently.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.990
So Apple has this really cool
technology called ColorSync,

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.480
and now QuickTime is
supported by ColorSync,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.500
so my life is so much easier.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.240
And Apple was nice enough to fly out.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.200
Kevin O'Connor, he's a color specialist
that teaches for Apple,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.280
and Gray Tag Macbeth loaned the
calibrator so we could calibrate

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.870
all our LCDs and come up with the
look-up tables for the cameras

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.520
so that everything matches.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:00.140
I can shoot any camera that we have,
even going across brands, you know,

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:05.380
whether it's Nikon or Canon,
and I can match within 5% the color

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.700
using ColorSync and ColorSync.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.660
So we have a couple of tools
out there from Gray Tag Macbeth.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:16.370
So it became a very good thing because
nothing's worse than going through a VR,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.990
especially a multiple-row VR,
and seeing that the

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.750
color shifts for one row,
right?

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.150
Just, you notice it right away,
it's not a good thing,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.320
don't want to go there.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.000
Okay.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.390
So color.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.950
Next thing is custom hardware.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.180
No one airplane is alike.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.530
You know, there are always, you know,
variations and stuff.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.920
And people were asking, like,
how do you rotate that, you know?

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.040
You know, do you walk around it?

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.700
Well, if you walk around,
if you do the marking, you know,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.980
every 10 degrees around the
facility and walk around,

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.750
then the plane starts to look jerky.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.000
It doesn't come out as smooth as
if you rotate the aircraft itself.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.060
So, you know,
I'm always fighting budgets, you know,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.840
just like any government institution.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.030
I'm just a contractor.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.580
I'm not even the photographer anymore.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.700
I'm just a contractor.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.010
And so we're always fighting budgets,
and I've come up with all

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.840
the hardware we could buy.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.040
I could buy commercially to do that,
and they were like, great,

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.120
we have no money for that.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.410
Okay, well, let me think about it.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.080
So there's these things called baskets,
and the baskets are what they

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.480
move the aircraft around.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.160
They actually use them on
aircraft carriers to move fighters

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.630
into tight corners and stuff.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.960
So we bought a bunch of these baskets.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.290
This is two-inch steel pipe,
and we have special fittings made

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:35.910
so we can slide the airplane into
wherever we need to get so it's

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.920
centered over its rotation point.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.180
Okay.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:44.100
So we have these, and there's about 150
to 200 pounds of weight.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.520
There's a steel plate.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.920
There's a piece of plywood and duct tape,
because no good project can

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.150
survive without duct tape.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.640
And that's put on the floor,
and that's our center point,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.500
and then two people at both ends
of the airplane start pushing it.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.840
And every 10 degrees
that's marked on the floor,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.600
they know they should stop,
and then we shoot another picture.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.760
Now, on occasion,
I found out that the floor

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.400
in our first location,
it wasn't level.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.130
You know, you get 10,000 pounds rolling,
and the mast wants to

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.200
get to that low point.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.680
It's pretty tough to stop it.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.100
So another one of those
things that we learned.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.290
Lighting.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.440
We had a lot of issues with lighting.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.540
How do you get light into these cockpits?

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.200
How can you get into tight places?

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.300
Again, lots of ideas.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.100
We ended up buying $7 fluorescent bulbs.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.700
Digital cameras have great
capabilities to white balance in

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.630
multiple color spectrum settings.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.480
We used these fluorescent bulbs.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.120
We went out and tested a bunch
of them and found a particular

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.720
brand that was pretty consistent.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.770
We used those on stands.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.500
We hang them.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.840
They actually now have
battery-operated fluorescent bulbs,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:04.300
where it takes about 5 to 10 AA batteries
so we can hide AA batteries within

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.580
the airplane to light it up so
we can shoot VR on the inside.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.080
Again, we have a lot of hardware
we had to come up with.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:17.470
That's Jim's rig on the left,
a Kydan spherical head.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.330
We have a special -- the
government must assume that

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.450
butts are always 28 inches wide,
because all military

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.150
seats are 28 inches wide.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.060
So we have a special stand
that the VR head clamps to,

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:38.090
and then we can put the VR head into
the seat so we can give that view as

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:41.680
if you're sitting in the aircraft.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:41.680
We also have what's
called a Bogan Superclamp.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.180
And that hangs on pipes above so that
we can see around inside the cockpit.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.940
Now, on the other side,
I have my own little VR head that

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.440
I made out of wood for fisheye lenses.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.020
So I could do four shots with a fisheye.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.420
It has a little pin that stops it.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.240
Because that cockpit is
molded to somebody's head.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.900
The shield that comes around
is only 6 inches wide.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.180
You know, they made it as streamlined
as they could in 1932.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.680
So there I had some new issues
for placement and stuff.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:19.210
Lewis's -- I'll just move this
a little bit more forward.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.210
And I'll just start this.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.560
There it goes.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.860
So on the jet aircraft
that we have to shoot,

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.400
they have like prototype jets,
and they have like F-4 fighters,

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.760
and a whole bunch of really
interesting fighters.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.290
It takes 15 minutes to open up the
canopy because they have no power source,

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:44.650
so they have to crank the hydraulics.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.780
So with these types of assemblies,
we have to open a window, click,

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.900
and then close the
window 15 seconds later.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.180
The camera fires, open up the window,
move it to the next position, click,

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.440
close the window, get out of the way.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.840
So can you imagine 15
minutes between the click?

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.380
So we were thinking about the issue.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.410
I had talked to Louis.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:14.800
So he came up with this automated VR head
for us so that we can mount this inside.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.860
The jets,
we can then press the button to start it,

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.320
close the canopy,
and then it'll start shooting.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.670
It'll do its whole roll.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.970
It takes about six minutes for
it to shoot the entire interior,

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.280
and then we can open up the canopy again.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.570
So within 45 minutes,
we're done entirely with the

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:37.500
aircraft as opposed to 15
minutes cranking and closing.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.500
So a lot of problem
solving in our projects.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.800
A lot of issues that
we have to think about.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.460
This is the view from above.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:53.250
So you can see underneath the airplane
are little marks every 10 degrees,

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.960
duct tape.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.340
No good project can
live without duct tape.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:04.180
So, and on the other side,
that's the bomb site to the B-29.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.460
Now,
the Smithsonian is putting every aircraft

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.420
in the museum back to flying condition.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.260
If you could add gas to it,
you could turn the key, it would fly.

00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:17.690
So that's the level of restoration
that they're going through.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.080
Well, the problem for them is that
all the things that go inside

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.900
the airplane will disappear.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.110
You'll never get to see it.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.090
So, like, this is the first non-optical
weapon system the U.S.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:29.570
government ever had.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.880
It was a simple radar bombing site.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.620
So they yanked it out of the
airplane and we had to photograph it.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.420
Again, we didn't have a turntable
that could take it,

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.420
so we just slapped a
piece of plywood on it.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:45.340
And there's a little piece of PVC pipe
shooting off the side and this guy

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.140
sits on this little roller and he lines
it up and then he pushes himself off.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.740
I take the picture, he rolls back up,
moves it over.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.580
You know, it's cheap automation.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.780
So, and then we take the actual images
and then we'll drop out backgrounds.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:05.580
So like you see on the Steven's Acro,
that's the monoplane on the bottom there.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:11.540
You know, we're always dropping out
backgrounds for all the different VR.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.970
So I'm going now show you
a whole bunch of samples.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:18.380
We could go to the laptop.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.090
And I want to launch

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.800
So I'll show you the first sample.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.800
So this is a standard VR,
and the problem that we run into

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.880
is until you blow in the text
and all the other information,

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.320
people look at it and
think it's just a toy,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.700
right?

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.320
It's a model.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.380
Here we are pushing these big aircraft,
and they think it's a rendering,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.630
but I can look at all
the different sides.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:49.560
Okay, so I can see all the different
parts of the aircraft.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.300
How do I shoot it, though?

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.480
There's the airplane
sitting on the baskets.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.140
There's our weights in the middle.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.500
We have these big blue tarps.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.880
So we have two areas in the museum.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.860
We have two studios set up with
these hundred-foot-long blue tarps,

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.710
and then I can click and
I can rotate the aircraft.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.220
And then we bring in the volunteers,
and they sit there for days on end,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.290
you know, cutting, pasting,
dropping out backgrounds.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.710
So this is how we start it.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.370
I'll show you the radar unit.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.750
This is the final piece for
the radar that you saw sitting.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.850
So this will be on the computer kiosk.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.010
We'll talk about the
kiosk in just a minute.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:45.090
And the idea is information
would be showing up around it.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.900
So here's the monocoop that we did,
the exterior.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.140
Again, one shot every 10 degrees.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.400
We now have an assembly.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.440
We haven't authored anything yet,
but we have an assembly like a

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.240
big arc that they're welding,
and we're going to be placing it above

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.810
the aircraft so we can do multiple row,
so that you'll be able to

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.610
rotate the plane down and see
it like a god's eye from above.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.570
The Smithsonian VR is really cool,
but what they really

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.600
love are the interiors.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.170
So this is a cubic of an
interior of that same aircraft.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.600
We haven't put in a rendered sky yet.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.040
I can go right.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.310
I can go left.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.170
Just like the car, I can go above.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.480
Come back around.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.800
and go down below.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.040
So a full 360 environment.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.500
So this is the big thing for the museum.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.750
You come through, you go to a kiosk,
and now you can start

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.850
looking at the kiosk,
start learning more about that aircraft.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.020
So earlier I talked to
you about prototyping.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.820
Oh, I have to show you this one.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.140
You know, remember the wheels
and the tires and the,

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.910
you know, the spinning it all?

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.460
So this is a float plane.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.850
They put it together on mattresses,
so there's no wheels.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:07.930
So my volunteer that works directly
with me is a retired neurologist.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.420
So he's 82 years old, Doc Harvey.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.840
I love the man dearly.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.300
And we never have challenges,
we never have problems.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.140
We're building new pathways.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.970
So I have a lot of pathways on this one.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:26.160
So how we made this work
was we have a crane,

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.940
and I don't have the shot handy.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.720
If I find it later,
I'll pull it up for you.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:30.720
We have a crane.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.630
We brought a crane over,
and there's a cable holding the airplane.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.100
It's suspended on one cable.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.230
And you know how it is.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.550
If you tell a person that they have
to sit in the same space every shot,

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.920
they'll never do it for you.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.870
They'll be all over the gamut.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.950
So I didn't say anything,
and watch the girl.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.190
This is my big kick.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.650
She's staying in the airplane as
we rotate it every 10 degrees,

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.520
and she's always in the perfect,
you know, like she's just looking ahead.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.120
I thought we should put water
and make her look like a mermaid.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.190
Okay.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.700
Going through.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.000
So here we are.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.620
We're rotating.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.240
This is an N3N.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.000
I know way more about these aircraft now
than I ever really knew about aircraft.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.320
This particular N3N was hanging at
Annapolis over their ice skating rink.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.300
And the Smithsonian was
given the aircraft,

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.620
and they had to go in and
pick it up and disassemble it.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.930
And the people who restore the aircraft,
it's like they're children.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:27.940
And they hover.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.840
And while they're hovering
over you while you're shooting,

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.680
they're telling you more and more.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.560
And they're telling you more
information about the aircraft.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:40.700
So I know who flew the airplane
and all its significance.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.700
So let me show you prototyping.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.690
We'll do that really quick.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.690
So I have a folder.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.510
And I want to show you,
so this was one of my early concepts.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.760
When they would call me in and say,
could you show us some samples, you know,

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.140
possibilities for kiosks,
one of the things that I said is, well,

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.560
we'll have a QuickTime movie.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.630
We'll shoot a video of, say,
like John Glenn, which we have,

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.500
we've already done that.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.610
And then somebody could click and
then they would be listening to

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.480
him talk about what it was like
to fly in the Mercury capsule,

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:12.950
right?

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.640
You know, that type of stuff.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:20.580
The Smithsonian, it's really cool,
they have 28,000 movie-tone newsreels.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:26.250
You know, old vintage movies from the,
you know, like 1900s and stuff like that.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.430
They're kept in a room
like this called the vault.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.340
And the room's air-conditioned and stuff,
but the stuff's deteriorating anyway.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.780
There's no way to protect it.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.510
So we've started taking on
digitizing these old vintage

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:41.500
movies with their staff,
because we can't touch this stuff,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.420
which is really funny.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.680
So anyway.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.620
So there's all this vintage
footage that we're running into.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.560
So part of my job now is
not only shooting VR and

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.060
keeping records and all that,
but digitizing in movies.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.910
And now they hit me with this,
which is the best codec to use if

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.500
we want to come back in 20 years?

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.890
You know, 20 years, I'm like,
I don't even know what the

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:08.690
operating system will be.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.250
So it's kind of,
it's cool and it's frightening

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.090
in the same effect because
I'm writing the standards for

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:18.170
the rest of the Smithsonian,
and the Smithsonian is writing the

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.050
standards for 30 other museums,
and everybody holds up

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.750
the National Air and
Space Museum as the reference.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:29.070
The National Air and Space Museum has
11 million visitors per year.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.490
It's the most visited
museum in the world.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:37.090
Just as a sidebar, the National Air and
Space Museum generates 40% of the

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.700
entire budget for the Smithsonian.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.080
I don't mean budget as
in like operating budget.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.700
I mean that 40% of the entire
Smithsonian's budget is funded

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.320
just by the Air and Space Museum.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.710
So that's how much visitors they have.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.770
So prototyping.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.660
So I showed them that and they were like,
"Yeah, that's cool.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.530
What else could you do?"
So we had to come back.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.360
We had to think.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.280
Something that I tried to avoid,
thinking.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:11.500
So QuickTime and QuickTime VR is
a really marvelous technology.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.750
You know,
QuickTime I correlate to being a bucket,

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.500
and everything I can fit
in that bucket I can show.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:20.430
So not only can I show the visual,
not only can I show sound,

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.500
but I can put in programming, right?

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.500
I can make QuickTime movies
control other applications.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.500
I can make QuickTime movies
that control the whole computer.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.310
So this is an early sample,
and I'll click,

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:35.850
and I can look around right
here in standard VR movie,

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.480
right?

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.850
Notice that the QuickTime bar
goes all the way across,

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:41.500
so this is one big movie.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.290
So I want to see the Gemini spacecraft,
I want to see the X-1,

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.500
I want to see the Wright Flyer.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.720
Think of kiosks.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.380
Always think of kiosks.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.500
Internal display is
showing you this stuff.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.900
Somebody comes up,
they see a grouping of planes,

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.500
they see a grouping of
planes in my QuickTime movie.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:58.500
They want to do that.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.500
But now we want to have more information.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.670
So you click on the X-15,
now I'm pulling, retrieving text in

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.500
other QuickTime movies.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.480
I'm doing that with all in that VR shell.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.500
So controlling all the
other applications.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.500
I showed this to the Smithsonian,
and they were drool.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.500
All over.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.420
It was disgusting.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:19.770
.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:21.720
We love this stuff.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.350
This is exactly what we're looking for.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.750
I was like, why didn't you tell
me that two years ago?

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:33.620
So I show them all the capabilities,
but there's always the but, right?

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.500
You have to wait.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.260
You know it's coming, so you get quiet,
and they're like,

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:41.140
but we have 11 million visitors per year.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.560
How will we make this work on 100 kiosks?

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.250
You know,
people want to spend their time there.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.220
So we had to think about it.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.010
We came up, and there's a technology
out there called SmartCard.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.120
And SmartCard technology
is basically a credit card.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.420
One of the things that we're working,
and they have USB card readers,

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.370
but there's not enough drivers
out there for those card readers.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.370
Just putting it out there.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:10.090
So, the thing now is that you'll
go to Smithsonian and you'll

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.730
buy like a credit card.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.260
It'll have a picture of an airplane.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.080
Marketing, right?

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.180
We're going to do 20 different pictures,
20 different cards.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.070
Buy all 20.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.140
$2 a piece.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.350
So, funding.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.510
It's always about funding.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.560
Remember that.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:28.620
So, on the back of the magnetic stripe,
they'll encode your name,

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.400
your email address,
and your mailing address.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.860
You'll now go through the museum.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.890
You'll start looking at stuff
and you'll get to some point,

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.200
either time or amount of information.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.490
And all of a sudden,
you'll get into a certain depth.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.630
You'll drill down and then
a shield will show up,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.400
you know, the Smithsonian shield.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.090
And it'll say, "Thank you very much,
but your visitation with

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.880
this kiosk has now ended.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.770
Please swipe your card."
You'll swipe your card and the

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.020
servers will automatically know
where you're at on the URL.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:02.150
And it'll email you a picture
of the corresponding aircraft

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:05.850
so that when you get home,
you can now open up that email,

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:10.860
see the picture of the Apollo or Gemini,
whatever, click on the URLs and now go to

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.400
a website with even more content.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.470
The Smithsonian is now growing
outside of the brick and mortar,

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.750
right?

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.360
There -- before when
I would talk to them,

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.680
they were like, you know,
we'll get to that in five or six years.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.520
You know, and I'm like,
we should do this now.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.220
You know, five or six years.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:32.460
I don't even know what the operating
system will be in five or six years.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.960
So, we didn't love that.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.360
But then we showed them something else.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.100
Besides being a revenue
generating stream,

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.760
we went a little bit farther.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.840
Now, think about it.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.700
If all you're doing is looking at jets
and you're swiping your card for jets,

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.820
obviously, the odds are, I would think,
that you're interested in jets.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.980
So, when I did this demo,
I did the shield and I showed

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.820
the card swiping and did
all that stuff in QuickTime,

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:02.260
you know, drool, again, the whole bit,
but there was this little oriental guy

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.200
in the back of the room and he's like,
this is great.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.440
I just love -- you're a beautiful person.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.500
So, hence the reason why
I picked up that line.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.910
So,
I was like -- I thought he was a curator,

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:14.500
right?

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.980
I thought he was like some
bigwig that I hadn't met,

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.480
you know, like some director or whatever.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.950
And, well,
thank you very much and who are you?

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.420
And he's like, I'm the store manager.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:27.920
Think of all those emails I can send
out to people who are interested in.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:32.060
So, the idea is now building a database
of what you're interested in.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.100
That's the most important thing.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.860
I can show you lots of content.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.060
I can show you a lot of stuff,
but if I show you what

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.500
you're interested in,
you're more likely to buy, right?

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.890
You're more likely to buy if you looked
at 100 jet URLs buying a book on jets

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.300
than buying a book on the right flyer.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.390
So now,
we're starting to create the databases

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:55.820
so that the store or the Smithsonian will
know what you're interested in.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.600
So a big goal.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.100
So, one of the things that I like telling
people is always think outside the box,

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:01.860
always think of what the
other person is interested in.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:02.860
Think of what the other avenues are.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.260
You know, I started my career as
just a photographer.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.600
Now I'm creating VR content.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.340
Now I'm creating kiosk content.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.980
Now we're starting looking at
like how to accumulate all this

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.400
information to help the client,
to help them sell or to help them

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.320
get involved with more stuff.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:26.710
I'm going to close this and close that,
I think.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:35.340
I wanted to show you
one other... Hold on.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:39.090
. There it is.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.340
I just saw it.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.740
Sorry, having user interface error.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.680
Because I can't find--
did I open up that file?

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.980
Did I put that-- oh, there we go.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.990
Must be under VR under NASA.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.020
So we were talking about
high-res stuff earlier.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.540
We shoot with these very
high-resolution digital cameras.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:06.000
My Canon can make a 32-megabyte file.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.790
Every file,
every image is 4,000 by 2,000 pixels,

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.670
approximately.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.820
I can create tremendous
amount of information.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:23.450
So this particular VR is eight
30 meg files authored together.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:26.640
It's a little chunky when
I start to move around.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:31.700
This is a 95 megabyte file,
but compressed down through JPEG,

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:35.200
it's about a 2 and 1/2 meg VR.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:38.270
But what the museum loves is this.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.200
I can keep coming down looking at detail.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:45.390
So my project,
even though I have a lot of attributes,

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:50.480
even though I'm doing a lot of things,
my real project is archiving history.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:55.720
The entire project is based on shooting
all this imagery so that 50 years from

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.390
now somebody can come back and see
what the details were on that aircraft.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.210
When the aircraft are hung,
they're not scheduled to

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:03.860
come down for 60 years.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.910
So we're creating a lot
of information for them,

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:10.100
for researchers, for students,
for schools.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:14.600
I'm very big into education.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.600
So, you know,
we can start taking a look at, you know,

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.270
lots of information
that's all the way back.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.110
From like here.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.000
So a lot of information
that they can use.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.760
I just want to open up one or two shots.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:35.320
We tend to make screen savers
of everything we shoot.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:41.960
I will launch... I'll
just pick a picture.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:41.960
So let me grab this one here.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.900
Photoshop 7, latest, greatest thing.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.940
Runs faster on a G5.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.110
I could use a G5.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.440
Just in case anybody wants to donate.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:01.890
So let's go here and I'll just
zoom in and let's get to 100%.

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:03.950
So I have a wealth of information.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.140
So Smithsonian loves the VR.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.960
They love what we're doing with the VR.

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:13.430
But what they're really excited
about is that 144 pictures every

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.650
10 degrees of every aircraft.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.040
That's what they're really excited
about because now they have a

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:23.660
wealth of information that any
researcher can come back in 100 years,

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.370
50 years, 10 weeks even,
and start looking at what

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:30.610
that was on that airplane and
what the interior looks like.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.520
In two weeks I start
shooting the Enola Gay,

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.300
a very historic aircraft.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.050
Not so much what it did,
but it was also the

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:40.100
forefront of technology.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:45.640
And they're having us shoot everything,
the interior, the exterior.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.630
It's going to be interesting rotating it.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:52.640
I'll have a lot of
pathways after that one.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.370
So if we could go back to my demo.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.540
Demo machine, sorry.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.160
So we'll move on.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:06.830
So software we're using,
Canon has a product called

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.510
Remote Capture for their cameras.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.840
Nikon has a similar product.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:17.890
So we're feeding the cameras through
FireWire right to the computers.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.320
We're using iMacs.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.210
iMacs are great little
imaging stations for capture.

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:26.650
And then they've been,
the screens have been color calibrated.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.120
Photoshop 7 with the RAW Acquire module.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.370
Apple Computer.

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.600
Sounds like I'm doing an ad,
but we use a lot of their products.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.800
Preview is a very big thing.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.560
Preview allows us to grab these
RAW files and just look at

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.100
them right away on the screen.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:47.880
We don't have to spend time going through
like an import or opening up Photoshop.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:48.610
iPhoto.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.880
A lot of my friends give me a hard time,
how can you say you're a

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.830
professional and you use iPhoto?

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.050
But iPhoto has a lot of great features.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:59.690
I have a lot of people who need
to present on what our project is,

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:03.280
and I put together little slide
shows in iPhoto with music,

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.420
and then I'll put a QuickTime movie.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.430
If it's a more impressive
piece that they need,

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:12.100
I use Final Cut Express,
QuickTime VR authoring studio,

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.300
and then Mail.

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.290
The government loves email.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.160
And, and, you know,
I think they learned a lot from this.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.340
And then we have a lot of people
who are interested in the project.

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:17.400
So we're going to be doing
a lot of these projects.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.400
I think they learned that from Apple.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:24.200
So, because I get an average of 30
to 40 emails just from different

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.680
departments at the government
checking on what's going on.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.740
And could you email me that?

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.380
You know?

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:30.260
So that type of thing.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:34.280
RealVis Stitcher for doing the cubics,
also for doing cylinders,

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.520
and then VR Toolbox that works.

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:38.380
And that's actually wrong.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.100
I use 2.1, which runs native in OS X.

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.320
So a lot of software stuff there.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:46.760
Content display use.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.180
Now, if you thought I knew
a lot about airplanes,

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.130
I know a lot about displays now.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.970
So, kiosks.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:59.300
Kiosks is the idea that the kiosks will
be throughout the museum as you come in.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.990
You would learn about
the different aircraft.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.020
Kind of like that interface
I showed you earlier.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.180
But the other thing is, remember,
you know, 8 million people per year.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:13.350
So we're talking about plasma displays,
like 54-inch Pioneer displays

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.120
on both sides of the kiosks
being driven by the kiosks.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:20.460
Color management is a big issue.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.720
Getting color to match on LCDs,
matching a computer display

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.280
is not an easy thing.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.740
So doing a lot of stuff with color.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.350
And then handhelds.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:36.290
So starting -- that's a big bug thing,
buzzword for museums and handhelds.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.770
I'm going to show you this.

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:46.200
This is a Palm OS,
and this is a Sony Clia, outdated,

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:49.260
as of a couple days ago.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:55.600
So let me go back to Moonsuit.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.640
So here's a VR running on Palm OS.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:03.060
Think about renting-- instead
of renting the headsets,

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:06.540
$10 for a pair of headsets,
listening to a cassette,

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.240
think about renting this for $10.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:14.190
And as you get close to a kiosk,
the infrared transmitter triggers content

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:17.240
down here that's not on the kiosk.

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:22.140
So now, besides being a revenue
stream-- always think revenue--

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.740
You also have different
ways to display the content.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.110
You can give the visitors
more information.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.650
And two weeks ago, the Smithsonian,
it was really funny.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.500
discovered... Oh, you can do sound files,
you can put together really cool stuff.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.700
There's some beta programs out there.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.540
Let me do this.

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.670
So, a few weeks ago,
the Smithsonian discovered that

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.960
the Cliés had a built-in camera.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:53.380
Right?

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.390
I could take your picture.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.000
Thank you for smiling.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:58.840
So, and they've already figured out,
well, if we rent these out and

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.150
then we have the cameras,
when we hook them up to the iMac,

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:06.230
iPhoto launches and they could print
it out and we could charge them for it.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.400
Did I tell you that they
always think revenue?

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:16.150
Okay, so handheld devices,
we're doing a lot of research

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:17.730
and development on handhelds.

00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:21.640
Sony's been very nice to the
Smithsonian and our company.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.180
They've loaned us several of these units.

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.120
They're sending a whole
box load of these,

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:31.270
and we're starting to work on
prototyping for rentals and

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:33.620
information on the kiosks.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.010
The other big thing is education.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.670
Smithsonian is putting in,
or the National Air and Space Museum is

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:44.010
actually putting in classrooms
that will be wired with cameras.

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:48.540
I was real excited about iChat,
besides QuickTime broadcasting

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:49.660
and all that.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.620
We have a lot of capabilities.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.920
So they'll be bringing in guest
lecturers doing the remote

00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.310
learning or the e-learning,
and we're real excited about that

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.000
because all the content we're creating,
a lot of the directors

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.260
are excited about it.

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.560
Putting this new content in
with their presentations.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.720
So a whole wealth of online.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.970
We have to start looking at servers,
and I'm pushing for the XServe,

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:20.350
because they want to take that
28,000 movie tone newsreels,

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:23.380
convert them to QuickTime,
have them on servers,

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.710
so that educators from around the
world can log on and start looking at

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:30.320
this content to use in lesson plans.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.570
Or you can just log on and, you know,
just spend all day looking at, you know,

00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:38.120
like the X15 or whatever.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:42.460
So web use,
another big development for them.

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:48.520
CD and DVD use,
working really big on the DVD side.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:53.420
They actually have numbers
and they track what sales are,

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:56.500
and DVDs are definitely on a high rise.

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.890
You know,
it's beyond the missionary phase.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.560
It's got a steep curve.

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.020
So they're talking to us about
creating a lot of content for DVDs.

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.830
Right now what we've done
is we do the fake VRs,

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:13.960
and there's actually a way
in DVD authoring studio

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.560
to change the controllers.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.280
So the idea is that you
make your linear movie,

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:23.400
but you control it from your VR movie,
but you control it by your cursors

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.960
on your TV handheld remote.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.430
So you do a fake VR.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.880
You could spin around
on the inside of that.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.000
I think they did that with Harry Potter.

00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:37.680
I think they have some VR stuff
that's... simulated on Harry Potter.

00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:39.960
Okay, other cool stuff.

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:44.090
Now, I'm sorry,
I only expected five people.

00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:48.220
And I didn't have time.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.050
I bought 100 of these.

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.420
And somehow I'm down to three.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:56.360
So I'm going to pass these around,
but after we're done with

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.840
the presentation today,
I'm going to pull up the-- no,

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.920
you're at the wrong screen, dude.

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.920
Back to the demo screen, please.

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:08.670
So I'm going to pass these around.

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:10.440
If you would grab that.

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:12.290
And everybody, you get two seconds.

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:15.800
Please pass it to the next person.

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.040
Yeah, $5, $5.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.050
Revenue generating.

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:20.780
I keep forgetting that word.

00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:25.310
So our latest thing is VR in 3D.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.990
So using one camera or two cameras,
we're shooting imagery,

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:34.130
and now we're creating 3D
effects by moving red channels

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.440
between the two imagery.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.800
I actually have some VR to show you.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.960
I will do that in a little
bit so you can see the effect.

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.380
But it wasn't so much
just for the average,

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.340
you know,
just joy of putting on those glasses,

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.440
and if I had a room full
of you wearing those,

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.520
I would definitely take your picture.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.480
But there's a bunch of
researchers who are involved,

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.120
and right now all we're doing
is putting in distances.

00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.860
We're putting in these,
they're about four foot wide,

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.300
they have color swatches,
and they mark every six

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:07.110
inches as reference points.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.680
And we have four of these, like,
pieces of foam core that we put

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:14.330
into our images while we shoot,
so that later researchers could

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:18.410
come back and figure out how big
something is and what the distance is.

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.210
The 3D is really big for them.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.160
They think that that would be
a major thing in the sense of

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:29.260
looking at objects and getting
more of a dimensional feel to it.

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:33.220
So when we were showing them VR 3D,
they were like,

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.820
"Can you shoot every airplane like this?"

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:39.720
Let's see, 200 times 2.

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.030
I was like, OK, how big is the budget?

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:46.560
But I will show you that.

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:48.560
Making it a business,
because originally when

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.930
Apple asked me to come speak,
they were like, you know,

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:54.180
you've done this for a long time,
and you actually make money.

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:57.370
So we'd like to have you
speak about making VR,

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:59.980
shooting VR into a business.

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:02.500
So there's a couple things
that you need to think about.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.890
You know what, I'm going to,
how can I do this?

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.760
I can't do that.

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:10.510
I'll get through this quick and then I'll
put the 3D image back up there for you.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:11.240
I'm sorry.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.880
So skill sets that I feel that you need.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.660
Marketing.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.440
Marketing is really big.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.460
I do a lot of marketing stuff, you know,
sending out samples.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.580
But you have to know your market.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.520
You have to know if that market's
viable and you have to find the

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.240
right people in that market.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.360
When I shoot in the car industry,
I know that there's less

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.430
than 100 art directors in the
United States that I need to speak to.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.190
I don't need a big ad campaign.

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.730
I don't need a lot of stuff.

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:40.590
I need to find those 100 art directors.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.480
when I do VR I pick the project where
it makes the most sense and then I start

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:53.230
distilling down who it would service
how I get there negotiation I have

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:58.650
a negotiations always tough and the
big problem is is that you know they

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:02.130
don't want to pay you you know it's
a computer thing right it's only two

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:06.550
seconds I can hire a kid for 15 bucks
out of college to do this for me so

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.500
you know the way I start my negotiation
is this I tell them you you know I want

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.260
a million dollars they'll say how much
do you want for this project I want

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:19.830
a million bucks you know they come back
and they say you know a million bucks

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.920
I said well you don't want you know you
don't want to pay me more than 50 cents

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:27.790
usually at that point they say I don't
want to pay you at all and and so then

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:31.510
I say see we've got the dialogue going

01:01:31.600 --> 01:03:05.200
[Transcript missing]

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:09.140
The most important items to remember.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.730
I have broken them
down into three groups,

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:16.710
because knowing you're all developers,
I have to keep it simple.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.130
Perseverance.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.290
As I told you,
my Smithsonian project took me two years.

01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:25.720
I had a lot of heavy-duty competition.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.850
People who knew the industry
just as well as I did,

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:34.460
who probably had access to more hardware,
more equipment,

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.760
bigger budgets than I did,
but I kept in there.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:42.380
As people got tired and dropped out,
because when you're

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:47.770
dealing with a government,
their whole job is to hold you back.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.020
So I just kept after it, I kept working,
and eventually the tide

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.480
turned and people got excited,
and then all of a sudden

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.560
the floodgates opened.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.430
So now we're talking to other
parts of the Smithsonian,

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:01.210
and we're actually talking
to some countries now.

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.170
A lot of museums are owned by countries,
and we have some places

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:07.560
in Asia and North America.

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.550
There are some places in
North America that are interested

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.410
in hiring us for our services.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.660
Think outside the box.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:20.180
I know a lot of VR people who are,
it doesn't matter what business,

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.120
but they're so focused
on what they're doing,

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.890
they tend to forget that
there's peripherals on the side.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:32.270
A good friend of some of us, Tim Petros,
who shoots VR, he also has these things

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:34.340
called bongo ties.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:37.460
He makes a lot of money on a little
piece of rubber in a wood stack.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.560
But he needed something to use in his
business to hold the cables together.

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.890
So for me, it's looking at other avenues.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:51.740
Remember the panoramic
file of the interior?

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:58.420
Right now we're in negotiations with a
publisher to do posters and calendars.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.200
It'll just be that long,
stripped image with the

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:03.980
calendar down below,
or for another company,

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.140
it's just going to be
the posters themselves,

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:06.930
just a dash.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:07.170
So, I'm going to show you
a couple of examples.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.790
And they pay up front.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.620
I like that.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.760
So, a lot of other avenues.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.790
So I tell people, think outside the box.

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:20.460
I have a couple of companies talking
to us about the handheld devices.

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.130
You know, just knowing that we're
doing research and stuff,

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:25.430
they're asking if we
could help them with ours.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.940
And there's actually companies,
I shouldn't share this with you,

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.370
but since you spent the
big bucks to be here.

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:36.310
People have funding for research.

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:41.300
So the government has grants,
and they're actually-- we're talking

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.800
to the grant department about
a grant on just coming up with

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.360
the concept of content for this.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.150
So there's different things
out there that you can do that

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:54.740
may correlate to your business,
and you could get paid for it.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:59.200
OK, so thinking outside the box,
and my favorite and last one.

01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:04.560
So, you know, what I do is of value.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.250
What you do is of value.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:10.060
You know, I'm sure that when Michelangelo
was paying the chapel up there,

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.900
they were like, you know, telling him,
it's great, it's beautiful.

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.190
They knew they weren't going to pay him,
but they made sure he felt good about it.

01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:21.370
So, what we do is a service.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.930
What I do is help sell products
or help educate people.

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:26.490
That's my two things.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.220
When I take a picture of a car,
it's worth billions of

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.460
dollars in sales to GM.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.670
Well, it's not that GM will ever
pay me billions of dollars or

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:36.720
millions of dollars or hundreds
of thousands of dollars,

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.100
but they will pay me.

01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:41.550
And they know that the value
is of having a good photograph.

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:44.400
So, I should be compensated accordingly.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.270
So, I tell people when they get involved
in projects to remember what

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.140
the value is that you're doing.

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:53.800
And the most powerful thing that
you have in your repertoire is no.

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.670
No, I won't do it for that.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.690
You know,
a lot of us get paranoid and we're too

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:00.820
worried about not getting any money.

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.470
So, we tend to like, you know, okay,
I'll do it for that.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.260
And you forget that you ruined the
industry for the rest of your peers.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.180
You know,
I have to go up against photographers

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:14.120
willing to do VR for $25.

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:16.720
You know, there's no way that I will
do an image for $25.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.920
I won't even get out of bed for $25.

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:23.580
Well, I might get out of bed for $25,
but, you know,

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.940
So you understand the concept
of what you do is valuable and

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.520
you should be compensated for,
and you should be at a

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.920
certain level with it,
based on your experience and market

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.420
pressures and stuff like that.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.210
There's a lot of things.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.170
I would do VR for a lot less if there's
a lot of work that I could do quickly,

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:42.690
and I've done that.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.820
So something for you to keep in
mind is to keep your value up,

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.220
because when you say okay that
you'll do it for that lesser amount,

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:53.180
now you've set a standard, right?

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.130
I know I can get it for this.

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:59.160
And I don't care what you're going to do,
but now when they come talk to me,

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.620
they're going to say, wow, boy,
I don't know,

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.880
I can get this guy to do it for 25 bucks.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.280
Well, okay, go hire him for 25 bucks.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.760
No, I won't do that.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:11.700
So it's a very powerful word,
and I can actually tell you that

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:16.010
I've walked out of rooms and they've
stopped me before I left and say,

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.510
well, but you have all these
other capabilities.

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:22.350
So always remember what your value is.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.940
Always remember what you're doing.

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:29.270
So I'm going to go back
to the demo laptop.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:35.640
and pull up one image real quick,
and then I'll pull up the 3D.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.560
How are we doing on time?

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.400
I got time, right?

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.380
We're good on time?

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:39.760
Okay.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.990
Okay.

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:43.440
Yeah, okay.

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:45.200
Somebody may ask a question.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.120
By the way,
for those of you going to ask questions,

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.420
I have prizes for stupid questions.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.250
There's no such thing
as stupid questions,

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:54.380
so, you know.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.240
All right,
so this is that stripped image.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.890
The screen's a little contrasty,
but 90-meg file.

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.520
You know, I can zoom in.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.380
I can see lots of detail.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.860
We're publishing.

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.020
We're doing a series of 12.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.860
Concord SR-71.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.270
I get really cool stuff to shoot.

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:16.840
So, the Wright Flyer.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:19.570
They're taking a Wright Flyer
down for us in October,

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.980
so we'll be photographing
the Wright Flyer.

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:28.580
Lots of really cool technology,
lots of really cool stuff.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:28.580
So, let me...

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:33.060
I'm going to quit that,
and then I'll get back to the VR.

01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:37.860
So the three people
that have the glasses,

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:43.140
so put on your glasses, okay,
and here I can rotate,

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:47.310
and now that engine should be,
unless the projector's reversed, no,

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.380
I think it's right.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.560
The engine looks like
it's shooting out at you,

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.100
kind of?

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.250
Yeah.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.600
Tainasorda?

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.280
Somebody say yes.

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.980
Just say yes.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.160
Okay, good.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:59.410
I love that guy.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.850
So, yeah.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.320
So, and the 3D effect will maintain
itself even as we zoom in.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.780
So it's not like some of
these Photoshop plugins

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.400
where it makes it a fake 3D.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:19.970
We can actually have full rev 3D.

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.970
If I can find, there they are.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.580
So we're doing a lot of the cockpits.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.860
We haven't authored them yet,
but we're doing a lot

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.360
of the cockpits in 3D.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.010
Here's the using preview.

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.900
This looks like it's just
jumping out at you at the screen.

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:43.400
Here's the still image from the VR,
or a still image from the VR.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.040
B29 looks like it's
also jumping out at you.

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.160
So really cool,
some of the stuff we're doing.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.110
I want to close this.

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:58.840
And then if we could go
back to my demo machine.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.640
I'm sorry, to my presentation machine.

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:04.580
I can launch something
while they're doing that.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.800
OK, good.

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.400
So, we're going to take Q&A and I'm
going to show you one other thing

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.540
that's launching on my machine.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:23.780
I just want to reiterate that I've
made an entire business and an entire

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.240
life out of creating VR content.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.900
I started out as a little photographer.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.340
I'm just a photographer.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.960
And my business has grown.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.810
We now have a huge contract with
the Smithsonian that looks like

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.800
it's going to go on for two years.

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:38.570
Do we struggle?

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.060
We struggle all the time.

01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:42.870
You know, do we suck air like every
other small business?

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:51.280
I hate when that happens.

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:53.810
Okay.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.760
What do you mean QuickTime needs
to know all that?

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.240
It doesn't need to know that.

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.560
So, okay.

01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:03.690
Could we come back to my demo machine?

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:06.940
So let's go back to my demo machine.

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.360
I'm going to show you something.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:12.020
It's just-- and I can give
you some information today.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.340
So I'm going to pull this in.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.080
I don't know if anybody's seen
this presentation from BeHear.

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.640
Has anybody seen this
presentation before?

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:23.520
So BeHear has a VR technology for video.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.240
Now BeHear has struggled like
a lot of internet companies.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.680
I can tell you that a company
two weeks ago bought their

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.490
assets for this technology,
and they're now revving it to 10.

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:39.890
So I'll be able to do this
and play it native in 10.

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:46.340
But this is video VR,
and I can look around in a full 360,

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.230
right?

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.550
So,
we're on the streets of San Francisco.

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:53.980
Should be a title of a TV show.

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.700
And we've got a, what did I write?

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.290
It's a Chrysler Concorde,
something like that.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.030
It's a Chrysler thing.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:07.080
And we're driving down the streets.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.880
I've got the camera
mounted to the windshield.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.520
You know,
and it's mounted to the windscreen.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.980
And all of a sudden,
this guy comes up alongside,

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.340
and he's like,
"What are you doing?" And we're like,

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.460
"We're shooting video." He's like, "Cool.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.380
Hi, Mom."

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.630
Alright, so you know how it is
in the United States?

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:30.390
We're a nation of shy
and reserved people.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.720
And we don't like to think outside the
box and we don't do anything crazy.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.110
No, never do anything crazy.

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.470
But if two people do it, it's a sport.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.370
So there's this sport where
you get on these wooden sleds,

01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:46.440
right, and you go down the
road as fast as you can.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.040
Has anybody seen this presentation?

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:48.770
Okay.

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.930
So anyway, here, let's go.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.720
So we'll start it up.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.340
So we've got the camera mounted.

01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:55.590
It's on a little arm.

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.730
It's facing up.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.100
I can talk about the technology later.

01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:02.560
And we're going down this street,
and I thought this was really cool.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:07.390
So at any point in time,
I can start spinning around.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.340
There's the dude.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:11.570
Yeah, right.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.240
Oh, sure.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.950
You know what?

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:21.810
They line the streets with bales of hay
because sometimes the guys fall off.

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:25.180
You know, and they take spectators out.

01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:27.940
That was exactly the way
it was described to me.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:29.280
I was like, really?

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.000
And the noise you hear,
they steer by drag.

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:35.360
It's all about drag, man.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.720
Those shoes have special
metal plates in the bottom.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.980
And when they want to go to the right,
you know, you put the right shoe down.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.210
It drags you to the right.

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:44.660
When you want to go to the left,
you drag it to the left.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.840
So when you want to slow down,
both feet go down.

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:50.320
I just wanted to show you the ending
because I love the ending of this.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.140
This guy is like a national champ.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.590
He didn't have to compete.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:54.980
So this is the qualifier.

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.740
That's why they could do this.

01:14:56.790 --> 01:15:00.840
So we're looking around, you know,
just spinning around, doing our thing.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.220
There's the bales of hay.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.390
We're cutting them up to the finish line.

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:07.880
These guys hit like 60 miles an hour,
two inches off the ground.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.900
We're passing the finish line.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.450
We're going to start off.

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:12.590
Well, maybe.

01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:16.520
And now we're going to sit up
because we can get more leverage.

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:17.300
Maybe.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.440
You know what?

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.560
We'll go with plan B.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.100
The bales of hay.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.500
But the camera was okay.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:29.960
So thank you very much for coming.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.760
Some more things coming up.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.290
One of the things I want to point
out is that the QuickTime feedback

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:46.990
form has been moved to Marina,
which is this room over here.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.100
Come with your questions.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.950
And while I'm going through
the rest of these slides,

01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:56.100
if you have any questions for Dennis,
please line up at the microphones.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:01.110
And we have a few -- just a
couple of sessions tomorrow.

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:06.740
Who to contact, how to contact Dennis,
how to contact Guillermo Ortiz for any

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:11.600
questions about QuickTime VR at Apple or
QuickTime development things at Apple.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.100
More information,
you guys have seen these

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.600
a thousand times already.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.010
And the
QuickTime Content Creation Lab and

01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:21.600
QuickTime Development Lab is
still open for the next two days.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:27.430
Only today until 4:30 because
we've got the party down on campus.
