WEBVTT

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.440
So, let's take this clicker
and see how it works.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.330
As she said,
I'm the CTO of PopEye Technology.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.900
We are based in Sweden.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.080
We work with encoding systems,
so that's the capacity why I'm here,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.760
and we work a lot with wireless.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.400
So,
what are we going to talk about today?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800
Well, the goal is to understand,
as I said,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.560
all aspects of wireless content creation.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.450
And I don't think you will
have all aspects of it.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.270
We'll talk briefly about business models,
how the radio networks is acting,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.400
content creation,
how the content workflow

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.320
works for an operator,
carrier, etc.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.980
And also show you tools on how
to make this kind of content.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.360
So, how it all started.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.530
It started basically with SMS,
small messaging services.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.660
I know it's coming up now in the US,
you send this text message to each other.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.690
SMS was actually created as a
diagnostic system for GSM networks.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.050
But in 1998,
it started to grow a lot and you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.700
had this kind of SMS messaging,
person to person.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
It grew very a lot in Europe and Asia.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.700
After that,
we got something called Enhanced SMS,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700
which is basically an SMS with like
a two or four bit graphics with it.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.430
In 2000, they actually released
it earlier than that,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.690
but in 2000, something called iMod
was released by Docomo.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.290
It was basically like a multimedia SMS.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.460
You had graphics, you had sound,
you had animation, etc.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.930
and you sent it to each other.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.750
So that's really when
it started to take off.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.450
Then in 2002,
the so-called MMS was released,

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.800
which stands for Multimedia Messaging.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.800
It's like an SMS, but you can have video,
audio, text, animations, etc.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.820
It's pretty much close to what iMOD is.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.810
And now we're in the phase
where video is coming in.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.500
And basically today you have services
where you can download video,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.550
and it works for different
kind of networks.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.780
I will talk about that later on.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.460
And you also have streaming.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.450
Mainly today streaming is about live
streams like traffic surveillance,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.890
etc.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.940
And also video telephony is
coming on the 3D networks.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.640
The cameraman doesn't like
me because I move around,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.380
so I'm going to stand here.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.130
So, a brief look at the business models.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.690
If you look at SMS,
there's a lot of operated SMS services.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.130
But most are third-party
SMS services like

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.610
Let's say weather, news,
that kind of thing.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.400
And it's based on revenue sharing.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.560
So the operator gets a piece
of the SMS and the SMS supplier

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.390
also gets a piece of it,
exactly.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.280
It also works as a bit pipe.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.400
And when I say bit pipe,
I mean that when I send an

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.230
SMS to one person to another,
the operator is used to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.400
pay for sending the SMS.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.390
In this case, it doesn't count bits.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.340
It's a unity price,
but an SMS used to have X amount of size.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.400
So that's why it's a unity price.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.160
Then we have MMS,
and it's pretty much the same thing.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.400
You have operator services based on MMS.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.400
You have third-party MMS services,
revenue sharing.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.180
And you also have the kind
of bit pipe where I send an

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.750
MMS from me to another person.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.770
When we look at video
download and streaming,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.980
I set a question mark
because it just started.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.770
And I see a lot of operators, carriers,
doesn't really know what kind of

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.580
business model they're going to have.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.880
So we have operators which
act as content creators.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.700
Not that they sit down and
record like a football game,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.140
but they take content from
the TV station and edit it.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.690
So they make their own content.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.000
Some of them work with
content service suppliers,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.900
like revenue sharing,
exactly as you did with SMS.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.900
And some only work as bit pipes.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.770
Basically, you have the same kind of
business models all the way.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.870
When we talk about video telephony,
it's time-based.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.900
It's the same as making a call.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.900
So that's pretty easy.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.630
So this is the kind of business model.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.630
I'm not going to get into
too much talking about this

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.630
because I'm a techie guy.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.300
What kind of networks do we have today?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.920
We have the 2G networks,
which is like GSM,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.110
which we have in Europe and Asia a lot,
the CDMA, TDMA in North America.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.790
And you can have 9.6 kilobits per second
when we talk about data transferring if

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.500
you would to do a multimedia service.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.390
And as you all can understand,
you can't really do that much.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.910
It's not like you send a
streamed video with 9.6.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.450
We have the 2.5 generation networks,
which goes up to 30

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.620
kilobits per second today.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.490
But the theory is that
GPS can go up to 171,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.360
and you have HS-CSD,
hard for Swedish to say in English,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.030
which is up to 56.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.310
and you have Edge,
which some argue and say that's 3G.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.230
So it's sort of 2.5.5
or something like that,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.170
which can come up to 474.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.030
But that's in theory.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.460
The networks today are in
practice when we talk about

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.920
2.5G is 30 kilobits per second.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.530
That's the fact.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.100
Then we have 3G, which today only has
64 kilobits per second.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.840
You can get 128 kilobits
per second services,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.080
and I will talk more about
that later on how that works.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.340
But in practice,
it's 64 kilobits per second today.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.510
In theory, it will be able to go up
to 2 megabits per second,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.140
both WCDM and CDMA 2000.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.020
So that is the kind of network
we are talking about when we

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.740
talk about wireless today.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.770
I'm mainly going to focus on 2.5G and 3G
because that's where you can use video.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.250
So a brief look at what kind of
services do you have per network,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.430
because that's actually,
the network is some way steering

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.180
what kind of service you can have.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.200
Of course, for two years speech,
and this is true for all.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.210
If you're three year,
two and a half year, speech is one of the

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.190
major businesses for,
or services for the operators.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.200
It's still where they make much, much,
make much, much money, most money.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.200
You have SMS, as we talked about before,
where you do this kind of communication,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.200
person to person, infotainment, etc.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.690
And ringtones is very popular,
at least in Europe.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.200
I don't actually know
how it is in the US,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.200
but in Europe it's very popular
to download the latest song

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.200
from your favourite artist
and have that as a ringtone.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.320
On two and a half year,
you have this MMS, and,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.060
which is like an enhanced SMS service.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.200
So pretty much the same kind of
service which you would have on SMS,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
but they've added on multimedia to it.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.100
And you have video download, sports news,
etc.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.240
And usually when we
talk about GPS networks,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.180
which is 2.5, we talk about streaming,
we talk about traffic.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.940
You can have traffic surveillance,
you can check out how's

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.150
the traffic on that road,
the 101, etc.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.890
It's small clips you can download,
or stream, news, sports, etc.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.200
So it's the same kind of
services all the time.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.980
And you have more
content that you can use,

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.200
or richer content you can use,
depending on the bandwidth.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.200
For MMS, it's the same thing for 3G.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.200
You have MMS, you have video downloading,
you have streaming,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.200
the same kind of services.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.200
And on top of that,
you have video telephony.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.200
And in Sweden, for instance,
we have an operator called 3G,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.690
which actually is up and
running and doing these kind

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.030
of services as video download,
where you can download news, sports,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.200
entertainment.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.190
You can get videos from your pop artists,
etc.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200
So this is really up and running.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.190
So this is how the services sort
of lay down on the networks.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.290
So, a bit about how a radio network acts.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.880
I'm not going to talk about the structure
of a radio network like RNCs and etc.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.690
If you have questions about that,
you can take them in the Q&A.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.700
But basically,
a radio network is built out of cells.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.700
And if we talk about Deep RS,
we start with that because

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.700
that's the easiest one.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.690
You get time slots.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.590
So you get the time slot,
and many people think like, "Okay,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.470
it's a time slot.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.200
How is that working?"
In a Deep RS network,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.700
every call has a very,
very small time slot.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.690
So let's say you have 100 slots per cell.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.700
Of course, you have a lot more.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.700
But this is just so I can
calculate in my head.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.770
So, one time slot when you enter
the cell is pretty much,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.700
in theory, 12 kilobits per second.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.230
But you always calculate with 10
because you have a lot of overhead,

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.700
etc.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.700
So, usually when you come in,
typically you get three time slots.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:34.700
That's how it starts.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.670
Then you move over to the next slot.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.700
But in that slot,
you have a lot of other uses.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.580
You might just get two
slots in that cell.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.060
And this is one of the things
that differentiates radio

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.680
networks from internet,
for instance,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.700
is that you actually move within.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.300
You're not connected to the
same access point all the time.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.700
You're handed over to new
access points all the time.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.040
So, it's supposed to be much easier that
you can be in the cell and X amount

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.700
of people comes into your cell.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.490
And then, once again,
you might just get two time slots.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.250
So, 3G, well,
it's the same kind of thinking,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.220
but we talk about megabits
per second instead.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.380
It's the same kind of thinking.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.880
You have X amount of bitrate in a cell.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.550
So this is pretty much how
the radio network acts.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.520
So, let's talk about
delivery or distribution.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.370
If you look at streaming for GPS,
as we said before,

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.520
one time slot is 12 kilobits per second,
but we calculate with 10 usually.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.670
So, we're talking about very,
very low bit rates like 20

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.940
to 30 kilobits per second,
which in essence is two

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.590
to three time slots.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.670
But one of the most important
things about a GPS network,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.000
or actually an edge network as well,
is that the operators can

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.280
prioritize the services.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.030
And I haven't met an operator carrier
so far that doesn't prioritize speech.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.700
If there are any operators
here who do the opposite,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.430
they can raise their hands,
but I don't believe that.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.210
So, that means that if there are
X amount of people in the cell and

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.980
they want to use ordinary speech,
the people who's appointed the GPS slots,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.680
the time slots,
they will prioritize that down,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.680
so you will get like one time slot
or two or something like that.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.500
And it's also like this,
that they can prioritize in a way

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.710
that says when you come into a cell,
you have three time slots,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.680
but after 30 seconds or one minute,
then you get down to two time slots,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.080
because they want to give more
time slots in the beginning

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.360
when the user comes into a cell,
because you usually do something like 10,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.560
20, 30 seconds to begin with,
and then you want to have good access.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.140
Then, of course,
you have network congestion,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.750
you have a lot of packet loss.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:58.520
Wireless networks, radio networks,
it's like a... low reliable internet.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.190
You can have half packets
coming through a radio network,

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.730
which doesn't exist on the internet,
for instance.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.500
And the other thing is latency.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.920
When you do streaming,
you have the RTCP keep alive,

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.530
and because of the latency,
you might not get that keep

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.120
alive back to the stream server.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.360
So,
depending on how often that the stream

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.840
server expects to get this RTCP callback,
it will shut down after a while.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.470
So that's why it's important
to do short clips when you

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.680
talk about streaming on GPRS,
because if you do a 30-second clip,

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.910
nothing's going to happen,
because it probably usually takes

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:39.740
about a minute before the stream
server expects to get the RTCP back.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:13:40.600
[Transcript missing]

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.040
Then you have the same
thing as on GPS network,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.250
network congestion, packet loss.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.800
It's much better than on GPS network.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.250
And still, most of the 3D networks
are circuit switched,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.800
not fully like a packet-based network.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.080
So it's a packet bearer which runs
on a circuit switched environment

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.800
within the radio network.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.800
And the circuit switch is
basically like point-to-point,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.790
like that's what you do
when you have an internet,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.800
you know, point-to-point connections.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.800
So that's what circuit switch is.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.020
And then you have X amount of
bottlenecks in the infrastructure

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.800
which you have to consider as well.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.180
For instance,
on the internet you have companies

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.710
like Akamai and those kind of
companies that place relay cache

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.800
service out in the network.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.800
That doesn't exist on
radio networks up to date,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.800
but that's also something that
is coming in the next releases.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.750
So today you have bottlenecks
with... You can think of it as

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.800
routers as well which you have
to take into consideration.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.800
It's not really routers, it's RNCs,
radio network controllers, etc.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.380
The most important, however,
is the firewall.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.160
I don't know how many people
had asked me about firewalls.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.320
Because the problem is that
usually operating carriers doesn't

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.420
open UDP access in firewalls.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.380
So you can't stream.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.210
And everyone's trying to stream
and you just can't do it.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.730
In Europe, they started opening it up,
and I know that in Asia they have it.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.740
A lot is open up there.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.560
But it also depends
on the business model.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.510
Do the operators allow for
third-party services which doesn't

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.380
have a contract with the operator?

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.940
So that is one of the major
issues with streaming on this

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.760
kind of wireless networks.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.000
So, I'm going to talk about
something called 3GPP.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.500
3GPP is not really a standard.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.930
It's something called
Third Generation Partnership Program,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:35.560
which is where you have pretty much
all the big telcos like Ericsson,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.790
Nokia, Motorola, Docomo, Vodafone,
Hutchison, that kind of companies.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.620
And they made a file format called .3GP.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.790
And now you can ask the question,
why its own file format?

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.200
In the beginning,
it was actually using .MP4.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.900
Well, the answer is, in 3GPP,
you use an AMR speech codec.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.690
And in MP4,
you're allowed to have MPEG-4 or AAC,

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.660
or MPEG-4 with AAC,
or CALP as the audio speech codec,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.320
but you don't have AMR.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.750
So, that's why they created
its own file format.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.710
And now,
you can have a file format called .3GP.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.780
But it's very similar to MP4,
which is very similar to QuickTime.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.200
It's built on atoms, etc.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.240
It's very similar.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.640
It has some extra atoms to handle AMR.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.280
In a .3GP file,
you're allowed to have MPEG-4

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.920
simple visual profile level 0.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.460
I will explain that a bit
later what the difference is.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.070
You can have H.263 baseline,
AMR narrowband, AMR wideband,

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.960
and AAC low complexity,
which is what you can

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.640
have in MP4 as well.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.380
And you can also have timed text.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:40.730
That's what you can have in MP4.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.650
You can also have timed text.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.760
That's what you can have in MP4.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.460
The SMILE 2.0 basic is not
really in the 3GP file.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.270
I just wanted to put that out
because the players on the phones

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.740
are supposed to be SMILE players.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.760
So, the presentation language
is SMILE 2.0 basic.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.170
And in that, you can call like 3GP files,
RTSP.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.580
And I heard a lot of questions about it,
but it's actually SMILE.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.130
3GP uses SMILE as the
presentation language.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.630
So, what's the difference
between 3GPP and ISMA?

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.370
I assume many of you know about ISMA.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.660
Well, one of the things is this MPEG-4
Simple Visual Profile Level 0.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.820
In ISMA you have Level 1.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.820
And the difference between 0 and
Level 1 is basically nothing.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:32.270
It's 64 kilobits per second,
but on Level 0 you can

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:37.930
only have one video object,
and on Level 1 you can have four.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.050
So, this is just to minimize
everything for phones.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.240
So, the Level 0 was created
by MPEG-4 for 3GPP.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.200
So, that's why it's
Simple Visual Profile Level 0.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.450
You both have AAC,
but when you do streaming,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:59.330
in ISMA you use generic packetizing,
which my personal thought is much better,

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.650
but in 3GPP they use Latin packetizing.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.580
And then of course is the H.263
baseline and in ISMA you can have MPEG-4

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.280
from Simple Vision Profile 1 to 3.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.100
I think they also put in
Advanced Profile at this point.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.160
And the AMR Codec.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.100
So this is like what
differentiates 3UP and ISMA.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.100
And ISMA is like 3UP,
it's not really a standardization body.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.100
So that's why it's easy to compare it.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.090
They just point at different
standards which they use.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.240
So, a quick talk about terminals.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.200
I say all support 3GPP,
and that's not really true,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.160
but I'm from Europe,
and in Europe it's very true.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.060
So, let's start with Nokia.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.700
Nokia is the leading provider
of handset terminals.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.830
And everyone tells me
that they use ReelPlayer.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.700
Yeah, they do.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.910
But the ReelPlayer in the
Nokia phone supports 3GPP.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.700
So you can play a .3GP
file in a Nokia phone.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.660
You can, however, not stream 3GPP to it.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.190
You can only stream Reel format.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.830
But the new Phone 6600 supports
streaming of both 3GP and Real.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.490
So if you make a .3GP file,
it will work in the Nokia phones

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.230
even if it's the real player.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.720
In the Sony Ericsson telephones,
the P800 is a very

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.420
popular phone on this one,
which is a GPS telephone.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.300
They have the Packet Video Player,
which is an excellent player.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:35.290
It supports 3DPP, it supports streaming
according to 3DPP and ISMA.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.260
So that's why,
I'm also going to talk about it later,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.390
is in QuickTime, for instance,
you have streaming,

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.290
but it's not streaming according to 3DPP,
it's according to ISMA,

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.300
but it will work in
Sony Ericsson telephone.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:52.410
And all use QSYF size 176x144.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.220
And then on top of this,
you have the Motorola telephones,

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.300
you have the Neck telephones, Masashita,
etc., etc.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.350
And most of them in
the world support 3DPP,

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.450
and some of them also support
proprietary phones like Reel or

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.330
Windows Media or something like that.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.000
So, a quick thing about MMS.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.010
This is also something
I saw on the QuickTime list,

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.100
a lot of misunderstanding.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.100
MMS is a multi-mime formatted message.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.060
It's like an email.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:24.100
It's basically an email you're sending,
but it's to the phones.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:31.090
And you can have JPEG images, GIF images,
AMR, sound, you can have smile in it,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:37.100
you can embed a 3D P file,
you can have RTSP links, etc.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.100
So, that's what an MMS is.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.290
So, when you make a 3D P file and you
want to transfer it to the phone,

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.100
it's not an MMS message you're sending.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.090
It's just you're transferring a
file and you're playing it back.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.080
So, an MMS is not a 3D P file.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.100
You can use a 3D P file in MMS.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.600
And video messaging,
which a lot of phones have today,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.100
is actually not MMS.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.360
From a technical point of view,
it's more like just an

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.100
email with an attachment.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.100
But that is more moving
into standardization.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.100
So, you have trouble sometimes.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.090
When you make a clip on one phone
and you want to send it to another,

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.710
you might not be able to play it,
or the phone might not even

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.100
be able to recognize it.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.100
Because it's a proprietary way
of signaling what kind of message

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.070
you're getting to the phone.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.390
All MMSs are distributed by an MMSC,
which stands for Multimedia

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.940
Messaging Central.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.100
It's pretty easy.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.620
And that's pretty much
like an email server.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.100
For all of you working in IT,
it is an email server, basically.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.640
And when you get an MMS,
you have something called a notification,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.500
and that is sent by the PPD,
Push Proxy Gateway.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.500
I think everyone knows what that is.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.100
Anyway, what it does is it sends an
SMS to your phone saying,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.450
"You have an MMS." And you say, "Okay,
fine." You click "Okay." Then it

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.500
goes to the MMSC and downloads it.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.410
So it's like a
store-and-forward function,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.490
exactly like an SMS.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.120
So, let's get in to talk about content.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.060
Oh, so this is how it works.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.180
How to get content.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.200
Well, I see a lot of things like
the operating carriers.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.300
This is not really their business.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.300
But they're starting to look
at it because they need to.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.480
So, and many times they ask
the wrong questions.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.250
I've seen companies, for instance,
I was in a meeting with BBC and

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.430
they came to BBC and they said,
we won't have streaming,

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.610
we won't have streaming content.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.390
BBC didn't understand what
they were asking about,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.480
so they gave them, oh,
we have real Windows Media file.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.040
They came back and said, oh,
what would we do with this?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.240
And said, oh,
we have to use Nokia because that's

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.110
the only phone that supports real.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.960
But what they should have asked is,
what kind of content do you have?

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.420
What can you give us?

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.930
Because BBC has like, I don't know,
enormous amount of MPEG-2, for instance.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.450
They do not have a lot of streaming.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.210
It's just 1%, which is actually in
streaming format from what BBC produces,

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.120
for instance.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.540
So that is usually one of the questions,
that they ask the wrong questions.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.160
So that's good for you to know
if you're a content creator.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.080
Make sure you understand what
they're actually asking for.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.200
And also another thing
is that internet content,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.790
you can't use that in the phones.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.820
I also heard that, but it's a lot of
content on the internet.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.120
Why can't I just use it in the phone?

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.320
Well, pretty easy.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.670
It's not adapted for wireless.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.300
And if you just look at the
size of movies on the internet,

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.590
you realize that you can't
get it into mobile phone.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.100
And then everyone's talking
about real-time transcoding and

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:42.160
it really doesn't work because
you would have like this kind of

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.920
building used to do transcoding in
real-time of this internet formats.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:52.640
So, the production-wise, well,
the productions are obviously

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.590
not made for mobile phones.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.540
It's very few production companies
out there which makes a football

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.930
game to work in a cell phone.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:05.770
And it's basically like when you
do encoding or compression for

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.420
any kind of thing is that when
you work with these low bit rates,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.620
you want to avoid transitions,
you want to have clean cuts,

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.940
you don't want to have too much zoom,
you don't want to have too much movement.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.510
And on a phone which
has even smaller size,

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.940
it's even more true.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.900
And also it's like when
they get content sometimes,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.480
it's not the production format.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.750
It's not like you can sit down and edit,
you get like MPEG-2 or something,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.900
which usually requires pretty
expensive equipment to work with.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.410
So it's not like you get motion JPEG or
like YCBCR file or something like that.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.950
You usually get a distribution format.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.310
Rights is another interesting
thing which is an issue.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.260
Some operators have the
rights to the video,

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.690
the images, but they do not have the
rights for the commentary.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.750
So that means that they have
to take it in and put on

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.400
their own commentaries on it.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.390
So they need to edit,
they need to do voiceovers

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.200
on the content coming in.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:11.720
So, what I've seen today is that how to
drive the business is the operator in the

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.340
short term has to be the content creator.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:19.210
They have to take responsibility
for getting the content.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.000
Because it's hard to go to
a content provider and say,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.360
I want to have content,
I want you to put it in 3GP,

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.730
etc., etc., because it's not that much
money for them to make at this point.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.840
So the idea is that you migrate
in the future from the operator

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.150
being the content creator,
supplier, whatever we call it,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.780
to actually get out to
the real content creators.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.650
So they need to migrate
to business and say,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.770
supply them with content,
but that comes when you

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.350
have a lot of users,
of course, because then it's a business

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.950
also for the content creators.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.050
I'm not going to talk
too much about this.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.680
This is just to give you an
example of how a streaming

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.810
system looks at an operator.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.070
But I'm going to do it very briefly.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:07.580
From the left, you have this CM,
which is the Content Management System.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.850
And then we have,
which I'm going to talk about later,

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.820
product from us, the compression engine,
which actually does the compression.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.800
So you put in content in the
Content Management System.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.440
It automatically encoded into the kind
of performance you'd like to have.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.800
And then it's being distributed into
the stream service and HTTP service,

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.980
et cetera.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.050
What usually differentiates
an operator carrier,

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.740
in this case,
from an internet provider is

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.990
that they have some kind of
RTSP proxies or something like that.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.500
What the RTSP proxy does is
it takes care of billing,

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.440
et cetera, because this has to be
connected to billing system.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.220
And still,
I don't think there's any internet

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.560
service which really makes money.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.930
So this is probably a new thing.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.390
So what happens is when
I set up an RTSP call,

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.890
the proxy will intercept that.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.160
It will go down, as you see.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.160
It will check with the
billing system to see,

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.860
does this person have credit enough?

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.010
Yes, he or she does.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.230
It also checks with the
Content Management System to see,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.250
is it a unit price for the content?

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.910
Is it per packet?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.640
And from that,
it gets an OK or a knock saying, yeah,

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.160
you can play this content.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.150
And after the session is over,
it creates a CDR,

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.490
which CDR is used for the billing,
actually.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.960
So in the CDR, it says that this person,
this person, this person,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.900
looked at this link for
this amount of time,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.540
whatever it is.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.220
And then it comes on the bill.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.760
You also have all this
kind of authentication.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.410
Down below, you see you have triple A's.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.340
That's the authentication service.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.540
So when you log in from a client,
you need to-- the network knows who

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.130
you are and what accesses you have,
et cetera.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.720
So it's a bit complex, the whole chain.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.460
But this is just to give you an idea on
how it works for a wireless operator.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.600
So, now we're going to talk
a bit about creation.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.600
And that slide is not
supposed to be there.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.590
Cool, this is by QuickTime.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600
I do it twice then.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.600
Okay, small operations.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.600
You can have a workflow which
is pretty straightforward.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.590
You have this content, it's quiet.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.600
Basically, you have like a DV camera
or whatever it is.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:20.600
You use like Final Cut Pro or something,
you capture it in, you edit the file,

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:25.520
you do the encoding of it into 3GP
file and you directly distribute it.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.540
With QuickTime now released,
which has 3GP support,

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:35.580
any kind of third-party software can use
this QuickTime API to create content.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.580
So,
even if you wouldn't use Final Cut Pro,

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.600
but maybe Avid or some
other editing software,

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.930
you will be able to create
3GPP compliant content.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:29:09.300
[Transcript missing]

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:14.340
Now we're going to get into
techy stuff about how we encode.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.360
So first of all,
we're talking about low bandwidths,

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.070
below 64 kilobits per second.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.140
The most important thing is to
have as high quality content

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.690
coming using as possible.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.630
This is true for all kind
of encoding compression.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.860
The best,
the highest quality you can get,

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.470
that's what you should
start with on the source.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.870
Of course, use good quality codecs.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:38.800
You have to do some testing to
see which kind of codecs you like.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.730
How does it work?

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.960
High quality pre-processing
is just as important.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.600
You have to scale the pictures,
you have to crop the pictures,

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.940
you have to correct gamma,
etc., etc., and you have

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.140
poor pre-processing,
well, you don't get a good quality.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.200
And also it's that you
have to reduce frame rate,

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.200
and of course you have
to do that all the time.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.090
I mean,
you reduce frame rate whatever you

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.790
do when you go to internet usually.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.450
But on a wireless network, you usually,
instead of maybe going

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:13.030
to 12.5 is PAL or 15,
you might go to 6.25 or

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.280
5 or something like that.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.410
Because it's better to have better
spatial quality on the frames instead

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.840
of having a movement because the screens
on the mobile phones isn't that fast.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.950
So the kind of motion that you're trying
to reduce by having more frames is

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.600
achieved anyway on the mobile phones.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:42.190
So it's better to have lower frame rate
and better quality on the frames itself.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.490
You have bandwidth constraints,
of course, and always use CBR,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.140
Constant Bit Rate.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.660
I don't know how many of you
really know exactly what it means.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.500
Constant Bit Rate is not flat.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.900
Constant Bit Rate means that you can
fluctuate within a certain time frame,

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.900
and that is set by the
Video Buffer Verifier.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.280
So if you set that to two seconds,
you will have a window going

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.330
over the file all the time,
and under those two seconds,

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.900
if you set it to 64 kilobits per second,
it can never go over that.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.900
So that is how the
Video Buffer Verifier works.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.220
So that's very important,
so you have a very,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.900
very constrained bandwidth.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.190
Drop frames.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.940
If you have an encoder which can
drop frames to maintain bitrate,

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.170
use that.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.840
Because this is the most
important thing about wireless.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.300
You don't have any handroom to work with.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.300
And of course,
natural keyframes is possible.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.240
That's the best way to do it.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:43.380
But also if you can add on the
longest distance to a keyframe,

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.300
because that also has to
do with error handling.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:50.210
If you lose a keyframe,
you don't want it to take too long until

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.300
you can recapture it on the images.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.300
And of course,
error handling in radio network.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.300
When we talk about streaming,
you want to be able to set packet size,

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.300
how many frames per packet, etc.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.300
And something called RVLC,
reverse length coding.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.300
And that's very useful when you
have congestion on a network.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.300
So the codec can determine
itself on the player side.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.300
It can build new pixels.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.290
So this is dependent on the players.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.300
You can use RVLC.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.300
And also, some operators have,
for video telephony,

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.300
and they want to use video
telephony to play static files,

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.300
not being live.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:34.710
Then you usually need to use RVLC,
because that's how the video telephony

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.490
client expects to get the frames.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:41.780
Also, what we talked about before
is that make short clips.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.200
Before capacity increases,
it's about 30 seconds, a minute.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.810
That's a good file length to do it.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.270
As we said before,
new users are prioritized in

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.940
sales when they're coming in.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.050
Speech is prioritized, etc.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.280
So make short clips because speech,
as I said,

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.980
has priority over all kind of data.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.300
So, streaming versus download.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.560
Well, streaming for wireless,
the proof is of course that memory

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.990
capacity in phones are limited,
so streaming in that sense is very good.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.450
It's less overhead in RTP than in HTTP,
so you can put more pixels

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.850
or bits to the media itself,
which of course is very

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.000
good on these low bit rates.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.660
It's lightweight DRM in itself,
because you have to be very

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:34.000
skilled to get into a phone,
hack that, and download the video.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.770
On the other hand,
why do you want to download

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.000
a video of 64 kilobits?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.990
So, but that's one of the things.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.800
And it usually is viewable
in about 2 to 4 seconds.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.400
Cons.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.900
Yeah, of course, firewalls.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.540
Same thing.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.340
Firewalls, firewalls.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.060
And it's not supported
by all phones present.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.930
I think most of the phones by the
end of this year and the beginning of

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.720
next will have support for streaming.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.610
Download.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.050
Well, it's supported by all phones.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:00.990
All phones.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.580
So that is a good thing, of course.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.990
The cons is that most of them
don't support progressive download,

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.800
which might seem a bit strange,
but that's just a fact.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.490
It doesn't support interlaced content.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.210
So it needs to be fully downloaded before
you can start viewing the pictures,

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.160
images, or video.

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:17.570
Sorry.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.210
And you need large storage on the phone.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:24.680
In our sense, on a computer,
it's not anything large,

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:30.690
but you still need to have the storage.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.240
This is the thing everyone tells me,
but the quality of download

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.700
files is usually much better.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.850
Because you are not constrained
to bandwidth limitations,

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.700
you can have a higher bitrate
because it's just download time.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.890
Well, yeah,
that's true for internet and it's

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.700
in theory true for wireless as well.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:48.700
But the download time, well,
if you have breaking news and

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.820
you have to wait four minutes
to get the breaking news,

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.700
it's not breaking news anymore.

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:59.690
But one of the more important
things is that you pay per packet.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.130
So, even if it's a download or stream,
you pay for the amount

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.220
of packets you send.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.040
And then people say, well,
it's usually a unity price sometimes.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.090
Well,
the operator has a cost for every packet,

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.940
and this is what drives it.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.390
If you can make content
on a low bandwidth,

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.920
good enough,
so the user wants to pay for it,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.860
and it costs as little as
possible for the operator,

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.830
that's when you're going to get business,
because it costs for the operator.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.460
So,
you have to treat download as a stream.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.550
You don't have to be as constrained.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.070
But don't think,
I can do 300 kilobits per second

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:40.120
because I want to have a better quality,
because the operator or your customer,

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.570
whoever it is,
will come and knock on your

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.300
head and things like that.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.310
So,
this is very important to think about.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:53.670
So, this is where the QuickTime thing
was supposed to be.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:59.800
So, let's get over to this machine,
which is laptop number one.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.700
Do I change or do you change?

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.100
What do you want me to do?

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:28.100
Ah, so that's how it works.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.370
So, let's take a look at QuickTime then.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.570
I have a small file here somewhere.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.960
This is just a little video.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:48.700
This is Motion JPEG,
30 seconds for dead kilohertz PCM sound.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:54.170
So,
if I want to export it into 3D-P file,

00:36:54.300 --> 00:38:02.900
[Transcript missing]

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.310
So, video.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.880
I have my MPEG-4 codec.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.160
I can use H.263 for instance.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.760
But I choose to do it
at 40 kilobits a second.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:15.910
I use 12.5 frames at this
point because it's PAL content,

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.770
so it's 25.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.520
That's why I use 12.5.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.320
I put a keyframe every second second.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.060
And in this case, it's audio speech,
and this is a more narrow

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.400
band you're using right now.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:33.090
And you have fixed bit rates for it,
as you can see when you drag it.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.070
This is called modes.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.300
And this is mode 7, the highest one.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.540
And it's always mono.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:41.690
AMR only supports mono.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.100
It's always 8,000 kHz of sampling.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.000
Frames per sample is
when you do streaming.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.960
And then we come into the
things about streaming.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.000
Well, if I do streaming basic,
this is QuickTime hinting.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
This is not 3GPP hinting.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
But it would work in a P800,
for instance.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.700
And we probably work in some other
phones as well because some of them

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.970
support streaming according to ISMA.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.980
But in this case,
I don't want to have it streamed.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.550
So, okay.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.000
Put it on desktop.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:11.720
Save.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:16.740
And off it goes.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.500
This is now using QuickTime Pro,
as I said before.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.000
But this kind of thing is accessible
through the QuickTime API.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.300
So any kind of third-party software,
any kind of software can use this

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.000
to create this kind of content.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:31.510
Then, as you saw,
there's not much about cropping,

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.450
etc., pre-processing,
but that is what the other

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.000
kind of software you probably
will use to do that in.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.150
So that's how you build it
on top of the QuickTime API,

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.980
basically.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
And this is just an
800 MHz old PowerBook,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
so don't worry about the speed.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
I think.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.300
So, here's the file.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.810
With the beautiful AMR sound.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:04.840
This is of course not down
for this kind of rich audio.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.840
But that's what you have
to live with sometimes.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.840
Yeah, so.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.200
Let's get back to the...

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:30.800
[Transcript missing]

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:32.530
No?

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.960
Now it is.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.320
Now it's not.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.810
So.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.270
What I showed you right
now was a small operation.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.890
This is where you can use
Final Cut Pro or that kind of

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.900
editing tools and directly go to 3GP.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.650
You can use QuickTime Pro if
you have that to take in files,

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.620
edit them, do that kind of thing.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.420
When you get up to a
medium scale operation,

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.900
when you have more content
coming in from several sources,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.420
where you have several editing
stations like Final Cut Pro,

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:05.970
etc., then you have a demand
for larger sort of tools.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:08.370
So what I'm going to show you
right now is actually a pop-up

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.200
product called Compression Master,
which isn't released yet.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.430
It will be released on the 15th of July.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.700
So this is the beta version.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.690
and all of you know what beta means.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.010
So, let's go over to the laptop.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:32.940
Great.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:38.290
So, this is the compression monster.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.520
We're going to start
to do some files here.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.560
We're going to start with some settings,
actually.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.210
So I've done some settings pre-hand here.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.220
So I open up this and we go to 64 Kbit.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.420
And in this, of course,
you do the same thing.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.260
You choose the file format.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.940
You can choose a lot of other,
but now we're talking about 3GP.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.750
So it's a 3GP file.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.340
I want to use MPEG-4, a more narrow band.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.190
I want to do streaming.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.450
So let's move on to the video side.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.580
On the video, I put this into-- well,

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:16.030
64, maybe 42, probably.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:16.740
Something like that.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:23.570
I put the key frame at 25 because still
this is PAL informant I'm going to use.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.600
Simple profile level 0 of the MPEG-4.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.490
This is very important.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:34.100
Why there's a button like this is
because the MPEG-4s usually detect,

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.340
depending on the bitrate,
which profile it is.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.370
But since profile 1 and
0 is basically the same,

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.260
you need to be able to override that.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.500
And it also is because some
operators will come to you and say,

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.210
I want to have 128 kilobits of content,
but it still has to be simple

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.920
visual profile level 0.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.460
So this is why you have
this override thing.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.220
Then we have the buffer verifier.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:59.420
And I should actually set this
to the buffer on the phone.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.790
So if you know that the phone
has a two-second buffer,

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.950
usually if it's a 3D phone,
it means that it can handle

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.390
64 kilobits a second.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:11.060
So you have to sort of calculate as well.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:11.060
But I set this to two seconds.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.570
The sliding window over the
content will say that during

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.250
this two-second sliding window,
it can never be above

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.100
42 kilobits per second.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:23.350
I say framescape probability,
which in this case is dropping frames,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:26.300
because I want to maintain the bandwidth.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.160
So I put that pretty high,
like 44% or something.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.900
And I can use RVLC,
etc., but that's not what

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.100
I'm going to do right now.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.270
I put the frame rate down
to 6.25 frames per second,

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:42.100
because I'm thinking about,
I'm going to play this on a,

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.000
I don't know, I can't say the brand,
but it's a Swedish brand.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.940
And I choose the QC format.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.970
I can choose whatever I like, actually,
but I use the QC format as it is now.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.990
I don't want to do any
cropping on this file.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.000
And then I can do, like, you know,
gamma corrections,

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.880
all that kind of thing,
but that's not really

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.990
important now for this.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.590
for the devil.

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:11.820
Audio, same thing, AMR, Narrowband,
12.2 kbps, sample rate, etc.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.550
I can do metadata,
and I put in stream and

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.130
I say 5 frames per second.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.140
5 frames per packet, sorry.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.220
So, now I've done my settings.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:24.720
I can take a look at some others as well.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.050
This is like a 128.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.060
But the important thing here is
about the bandwidth constraint.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.460
All I'm doing is I'm trying
to keep the bandwidth.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.060
That's the most important thing,
which means sometimes

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.780
I will get lower quality.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.780
But that's actually the fact of life.

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.140
So, that's how it is.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.250
So, let's put in a file.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.740
Let's do the same file as we did before.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.650
I add on a setting to it.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:59.870
So I used the 64 and I put
it on desktop and off we go.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.780
And this is of course
how you can do batches.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.000
You can put on a lot of files,
a lot of settings.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.410
It's just about, you know,
how many files do you want to do.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.700
And with this sense you can build
a small but very effective system.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.880
So you can have several editing stations
coming in like MotionJPEG or you export

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.600
it as native from Final Cut Pro and
you just put it in here.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.480
You have your settings which you created.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.160
You can sit and work with them if
you like to or you can just use

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:33.260
the settings you've done once.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:41.500
So, while that one is going,
let's get over to the slides.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.230
Oh, I forgot this one.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.300
So,
when you have a large-scale operation,

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.860
then you need to have
an automated system.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.900
And that's exactly what we built.

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.900
So, with the Compression Master,
you can export XML settings.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.000
The settings I showed you
before can be exported,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.030
and you put them into something
called the Compression Engine,

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.900
which acts with watch folders.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.140
So, when you've done this once,
the content provider can put in

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:22.280
like MPEG-2s on a watch folder,
and the compression engines will

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.390
automatically start to encode for it.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.940
So, just to give you an idea,
an average portal,

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.960
if you look to the right,
you have like two news feeds,

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.120
10 times times 30 seconds,
financial information, traffic.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.800
It's not a lot of files you
actually want to encode.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.920
It's not a lot of,
if you look at it from sort of service,

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.760
it's not that much,
but it still generates a lot of data.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:57.690
So, you have about 243,000 megs
that has to be converted daily,

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:01.530
and the turnover time from when
you drop it into the system should

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.800
not take more than one minute.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:09.610
And then you need to have a
pretty powerful system to do that.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.900
This is a real-world example
of how an operator works.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:20.030
They hired a post-production company
which has the compression master,

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.900
which creates the XML settings.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:30.900
So they work like a sort of
quality control of how it's done.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:38.070
And they can also make trailers of Nemo,
of course, very good film,

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.900
directly and work with it.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.150
Because it's a trailer,
you sit down and you work with it,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.790
you test with it,
and you make this in the 3D file,

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:45.790
you send it to the operator.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.520
But when we talk about
automated service like news,

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:54.900
sports, etc., what happens is that the
broadcasters deliver it as MPEG-2 files,

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.640
which they have on the
Grass Valley servers or Quantel

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.900
or whatever it could be.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.900
And they take these MPEG-2 files,
which they produce.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.900
So they don't have to do any
special production in their case.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.900
They don't have to do any
pre-formatting of files.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.900
They just drop it into the watch folders.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.900
And the compression end is on the right,
which decides that the operator

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:15.880
starts automatically to
compress this into 3D files.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.900
And the other thing is that they also
take in files and they do editing of it.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.900
And it's a tape transfer.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.230
So they take the tape, take the tape,
put it into Final Cut Pro, edit it,

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:28.900
and then put it into
the compression master,

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:29.900
compression engines.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.860
And this is pretty much the same thing.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.900
This is pretty cumbersome.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.870
So the next step,
what they're looking at,

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:40.900
is to set a compression engine
at the Quantel provider,

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.980
still having the post-production
company deliver the XML file,

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:46.900
so you control what
kind of settings it is.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:51.900
The production company drops their MPEG-2
directly into the compression engine,

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.360
and it goes maybe as a UUV file,
so you can edit it in the

00:48:56.390 --> 00:49:00.900
Final Cut Pro without going to tape,
which takes a lot of --

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.870
takes away a lot of time.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.870
Or it can go direct as a 3DP file,
so you will be able to remove that.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.900
So that's how an operator works today.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:14.150
So right now, I'm going to show you -- so
let's go to the laptop about

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:16.780
how this workflow actually goes.

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:26.300
So, in my compression master,
right now I'm looking at these machines.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.830
I have a watch folder on these Xsers,
which I see here.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.960
I've done two settings.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.960
What I can do is that I can
from here export a setting.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.880
So I take this 128,
I don't think I have that one.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.030
So let's export this one.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.560
So export it.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.560
Run Dexport.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.710
Yes.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:50:01.970
So, now I have this setting.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:06.370
So, now I'm going to move it over
to the compression and inside.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:10.370
You just move it over.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.000
This is Demo Guides.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:24.000
So, now I have three settings in here.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.930
So, now I can take any file from here,
when I've edited it,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.160
and I can drop it in.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.040
And now it's a 100 megabit network,
so it will take a while to do this.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.900
So while I'm doing that,
we can switch over to this

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.470
machine because I'm going
to put in a lot more files,

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.390
but it will take too long
time to do it from there.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.770
So let's go to the excerpts.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.320
So, right now,
here is my watching folder,

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.210
and now I've done...

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.270
Some media files.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.410
I've copied this one.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.740
This is a 30-second clip.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.970
So, let's put this in.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:10.020
So now I'm copying it over
to the compression engines.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.660
And I don't know if you can see
if it started working or anything.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.850
I'm still copying, so...

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:34.200
[Transcript missing]

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.620
And this is done purely
automatic on this XR.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.000
So, let's step this up.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.840
Let's put in some MPEG-2s.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:52.800
So, let's take all these,
put them in there as well.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:59.680
Oh, the netbook hates me.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:03.470
So, still the files are coming out there.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.220
So we can take a look at, for instance,
this one.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:10.250
This is the MPEG-2 file,
which is converted.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:30.500
[Transcript missing]

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.200
Sorry about that.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.640
So in this way,
I can just have this system

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.940
running all the time,
and it does it fully automatic.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.010
And I think now it's a lot of files.

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.550
Is it working?

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.540
Does anyone see anything?

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:55.890
One of them.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.440
Oh, it's a network.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.440
Sorry about that.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.240
Let's see what happens here.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.150
This is typical.

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:18.310
Well, anyway, I'm putting in like 50
files in this system.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.520
So now it's starting automatically.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.440
And this is the kind of system that
the operator needs to have when they're

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.870
talking about automated processes.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.790
So they put this sort
of clusters of engines,

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.950
of Xers, for instance,
and they just drop in files and they work

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:35.790
towards doing it because the turnover
time has to go so fast to do this.

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.680
So they really need to have it working.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.460
Like a one-minute clip should
come out in the phone within

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.800
maybe one to two minutes later on.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.750
So that's how fast it needs to go.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:51.020
And since the network isn't really
doing what it's supposed to do,

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:54.800
you won't really see this, unfortunately.

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.580
Can you go to the... Yeah,
you have it here.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:00.600
So now you see the files
are coming up here.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:06.900
So this is like the... another...
the Tricia McNeil video.

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:13.440
And as you see, this is down from MPEG-2,
so the quality becomes pretty good

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.600
if you put in really good content.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:21.880
Because this is 64 kilobits total,
so the video is about 40

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.080
kilobits a second at this point.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:30.270
So, I think you get the idea on how
the compression engines work and

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:33.230
you have even more files working.

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.760
I think now most of them are
up and running in the XSERVs.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.060
So, let's go back to the slides.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:47.500
[Transcript missing]

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.860
First of all, you need to understand
the operator business.

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.470
You need to understand
if it's a unity price,

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.610
if it's a price per packet.

00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:05.100
You need to understand if the operator
is actually competing with services.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.350
Because today the operators will compete
with what kind of service you have,

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.090
so you really need to understand that.

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.090
You need to be fully integrated with
the existing production environment,

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:16.400
which means that you need to
be fully integrated with what

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:20.100
the TV producers are doing,
like MPEG-2, whatever it is,

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.100
so you can take that kind of form
and with the legacy systems as well,

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.100
so you don't add any time on
that kind of pre-formatting.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.100
Time to show time is very important.

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.100
Breaking news has to be breaking news.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.670
Because why should you pay for
service to your mobile phone if you

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.560
won't get it before anyone else,
if you can just go home

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.100
and put it on the TV?

00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:43.530
The output format, I say,
shall fully support the

00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:47.100
standard set by 3GPP,
because that means that you will have

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:52.100
the most coverage of all terminals,
telephones, etc.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:58.490
Use as high quality source
material in as possible.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:29.400
[Transcript missing]

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:32.740
Of course,
the most obvious thing is to optimize

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:36.520
the compression for distribution
in wireless networks and to be

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.540
displaying in mobile devices.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.910
Streaming vs.

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.600
Downloads: Same thing there.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:49.560
Download exactly as a stream because
the operator has a cost for every bit.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:56.700
And you definitely need to be the expert
because this is new for operators.

00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.700
Even if you don't work
with the whole chain,

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.700
you need to understand
how a stream server works,

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:04.640
you need to understand maybe
how the RTSP proxy works,

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:06.700
you need to understand all the way.

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.730
So be the expert,
help them out because that

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:11.700
is one of the major problems.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.470
And the most important thing is test.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:18.720
It seems like I've heard
so many people say,

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:20.380
"Well,
we did a clip and we tried it in a phone

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.600
and it worked." And that's all they do.

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:28.700
This is completely new for all people
involved doing this kind of services.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.700
So you really need to test to
try out to see how does it look,

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.680
what kind of content can I have,
how does it work, etc.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.700
That's the only way to do it.

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:42.700
So... Wrap up.

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.700
Which means you.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:50.700
I'd like to thank Kay Johansson very
much for his presentation today.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.540
Next,
we usually go through a roadmap slide.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:01.530
Unfortunately,
session 721 that was going to

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:05.190
follow the session in the room
next door has been canceled.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:10.180
So I encourage you to go to session 722,
Advanced QuickTime Interactivity,

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.770
which actually is in this room.

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:17.260
Then on Thursday we have a variety of
other QuickTime sessions and of course

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:23.750
our feedback forum that's going to be
at 3:30 and it's now in the Marina Room.

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:29.310
We also have a couple of
sessions on Friday as well.

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:32.760
If you have any questions
about QuickTime development,

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:40.590
please contact Guillermo Ortiz,
who is our QuickTime technology

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:40.590
manager at QuickTimeMan@apple.com.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.560
For more information,
we have a list of these websites for you.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.690
First of all,
there is a lot of information about

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:51.310
3GPP on the apple.com website.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:56.140
Popwire technology can be found
at popwire.com to look at all

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:59.610
the products that Popwire has
created for this industry.

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:02.390
Obviously,
there's some general information

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:07.140
on our website about QuickTime,
developer information, and so forth.

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:10.230
Some other things not to miss,
hopefully you've seen these

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:13.620
a couple of times by now,
but we have a QuickTime content

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:16.100
creation and QuickTime development lab.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.920
The lab hours are there,
open until 6:00 PM tonight,

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.280
then Thursday only until 4:30,
and also on Friday.
