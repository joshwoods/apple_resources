WEBVTT

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.640
Well, welcome to session one.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.730
It's not the first session of the day,
but it's number one.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.140
We're going to have a lot of fun here.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.520
We've got a lot of stuff to cover,
and I hope that you learned

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.120
something really valuable from
this in terms of how to create a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.760
really complete user experience
for your application on Mac OS X.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.460
So I want to begin by sort of defining
what the focus is for this session.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.780
I want the focus to be
primarily on best practices.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.860
So we're going to talk about what
are the best practices for you as you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
bring your application to Mac OS X to
deliver a complete user experience.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.170
And more specifically,
what are the actions that you need

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.810
to start to employ as a developer
in the process of developing your

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.190
product to deliver qualities in
a product that are desirable?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.780
So everything that we talk about
really is about best practices.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.880
And the areas I want to focus on
are areas that I see developers

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.780
having difficulty with.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.920
So I want to help clarify some of
the issues in these areas and give

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.340
you some guidance on delivering a
great user experience in these areas.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.550
And the first is simplifying
product installs.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.100
The second is leveraging some
of the technologies that are

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.970
in Mac OS X for common tasks to
present a really consistent user

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.240
experience in your application.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.500
Third thing we'll talk about
is how do you make your

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.000
application more Aqua compliant?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.940
And I'm going to give you some very
specific tips and tricks for doing that.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.360
And then the fourth area we'll
talk about is cross-platform design

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.290
issues that people are running into,
and I want to give you

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.700
some guidance there.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.420
All right, let's begin with installation.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.890
You know, from the moment a user,
a customer, purchases your product,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.460
they're dealing, you know,
the first thing they

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.300
deal with is a package.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.720
Now, in some cases where it's software
downloads or electronic distribution,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.090
you're dealing with
an electronic package,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.480
right?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.370
A disk image or whatever.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.040
But much software,
lots of software is delivered

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.860
through retail stores and through,
you know, traditional shopping venues.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.920
And so there's a physical package there.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.290
And the user experience
for me in many products,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.590
although it's a very small part
of the product user experience,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.150
right?

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.350
But there's nothing more
discouraging than buying a product,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.830
paying $129 or whatever the price is,
and then fighting with the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.370
box or the packaging to get
the software out of there.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.450
I don't know how many times I've
opened software that developers have

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.060
sent me for review or that I've,
you know, had to look at for the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.350
Apple Design Awards or whatever.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.340
And I'm struggling with this box and the
CDs fly all over the place when I finally

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.240
figure out how to open the plastic,
you know, insert or whatever it is.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.900
And so I want to encourage you,
first of all,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.070
make your packaging easy to open.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.730
Secondly,
make it attractive on the store shelf.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.300
Thirdly,
clearly indicate the system requirements.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.350
There's nothing more frustrating,
I think, for users to go to the store,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.830
look for software for their
new computer or for their older

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.420
Macintosh and not be clear,
you know,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.670
for it to not be clear for them to know
which product runs on their machine.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.690
So make sure that your box
clearly communicates what

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.520
system requirements are there,
are required.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.470
And also don't try to grow
your market by basically going,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.510
"Well,
I'm going to buy this and I'm going

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.600
to buy that." And then you're going
to have to go through the process

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.680
of getting the product out of there.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.250
"Well, I think it'll run on every
Macintosh." If it doesn't run on

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.980
some of the lower end Macintoshes,
make sure that that's clearly defined and

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.090
that you indicate sort of what the best
or recommended system requirements are.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.060
Believe it or not,
there are products out there that are

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.900
not clearly communicating these things.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.050
And last thing is,
ensure that users have everything

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.700
they need to get started.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.730
What think about, you know your users,
what is it that they need to

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.300
have when they open the box
to get the product going?

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.440
In many cases, not much.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.070
But in many other cases,
what I'm seeing is I open a package

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.300
and I don't get a lot of instructions
on how to get going with the product,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.720
but I get a lot of marketing.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.860
I get coupons for this, that,
and the other thing from third parties.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.480
And I, personally, I find that annoying,
but, you know,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.430
think about what your users want,
and I would recommend that that's

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.310
something you might want to avoid.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.410
All right, software distribution.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.140
So we talked about physical packaging,
but there's electronic packaging, right?

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.720
And in many cases,
that's how you distribute

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.900
software over the internet.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.540
And software distribution should
be done on Mac OS X using an

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.590
internet-enabled disk image.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.130
They are self-cleaning.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.040
They do the right thing with Safari.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.010
Safari downloads them,
mounts them on the desktop,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.560
and takes care of
everything for the user.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.240
So a lot of the hassles with downloading
stuff off the internet and then having

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.000
to figure out which uncompressed file
I need to deal with next is taken away

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.990
with internet-enabled disk images.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.350
Talking about software downloads,
there are two areas where you can do

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.400
best practices or apply best practices.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.520
And that relates to avoid
compressing the compressed.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.440
Right?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.230
How many of you have experienced this?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.140
You're downloading a piece of software,
and you pull something off the internet,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.600
and it's a compressed file,
and you open that up, and there's another

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.800
compressed file within it.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.770
And even beyond that,
I've seen just the other day,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.510
someone showed me a great example
of where it's just senseless,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.340
multi-step, step like that,
where you've got compressed files within

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.950
compressed files within compressed files.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.890
And in fact,
I went to a very high-profile printing

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.640
manufacturer recently to download
a device driver for the printer,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.220
or a driver for the printer
that I'd just gotten.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.960
And the user experience sort of
went downhill from the get-go.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.810
I found the driver okay,
and that was great, so the web design for

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.880
the developer was fine.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.150
But as I started to,
as I found the driver and downloaded it,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.070
the driver name of the file that
I was downloading had nothing to

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.120
do with the printer model that
I was hoping to download it for.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.220
So that was a great experience.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.120
So that was the first thing.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.720
It was like, I wasn't even sure I was
downloading the right file.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.440
The next thing that
came was a binhex file.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.820
And so I opened that up, and then I got a
self-extracting archive on that.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.800
So I, you know, self-extracted that.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.880
I got a disk image.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.340
Right?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.450
I opened the disk image.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.880
Now there's a package, which is okay,
but after three or four steps like this.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.010
And so I ran the installer,
and I had to authenticate.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.590
That's okay.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.860
I understand authentication
is a part in some cases.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.300
But, you know, through the whole process,
and then I had to register,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.700
and then I had to stick
a dongle on there.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.100
No,
I didn't have to stick a dongle on it,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.980
but that was the case.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.980
And another product that I just
thought I'd throw it on here.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.980
But you get the point, right?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.670
Make sure that from the get-go,
the experience is great for your users.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.190
A lot of people think about user
interface design in terms of the

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.590
controls that they put on screen
and the workflow for the user

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.980
once the app is up and running.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.980
But I think there's a lot that goes on
before that that is equally important.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.800
All right, so we've got the software now,
whether it's out of a package or it's,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.460
you know,
software distributed or downloaded.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.080
And now we're into the
installation process.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.640
And, you know,
the guidance I would have for you is

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.080
make this as painless as possible,
right?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.030
Allow users to decide
the install location.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.340
I don't want my installer to decide
where the install location goes,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.920
where the install location is.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.960
I want to be able to
decide that for myself,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.260
particularly in the case of applications.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.170
In some other cases where
you're putting a driver in a

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.190
certain place in the system,
it's different.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.600
But I'm talking about
application software.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.200
Make sure that the user
can decide where it goes.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.080
Avoid unnecessary authentication.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.650
Don't just require the user to
authenticate just for the fun of it.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.440
Okay?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.840
Only ask for authentication if
you're installing outside of the

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.280
current logged in user's domain.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.580
And lastly, avoid custom installers.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.280
The best way to go with installation
for an application on Mac OS X,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.200
out of the box, if possible,
if authentication is required,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.130
is a drag install.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.490
Drag install enables you to put a
background image on the folder and

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.220
communicate some things to your users
about what they can do with this,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.060
where it needs to go,
if there is some specific

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.340
location it needs to go.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.800
You can do some branding there.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.740
It's very straightforward.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.730
And it takes advantage of a technology
in Mac OS X called bundling.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.810
If you're not familiar with bundling,
check out the system

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.920
overview documentation.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.370
But bundling basically allows
you to take all of the magic and,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.560
you know,
required files from your application

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.620
that the user will never interact with,
stick them inside of a folder,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.430
and then set a bit for the finder
so that folder is treated as a

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.880
single icon and a single entity.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.580
And from the user's point of view,
it's great because all of the complexity

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.220
of your application is hidden for them.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.500
Use an installer if you have to.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.470
If DragonStall doesn't cut it,
use an installer, but not a custom one.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.280
Here we've got one that completely
is non-standard for Aqua.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.440
It doesn't look anything like Aqua.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.340
In fact, instead,
opt for the Mac OS X installer,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.930
which ships as part of
every Mac OS X system,

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.220
and you can use PackageMaker
to build up the packages that

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.440
you require to be installed.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.040
All right,
so now we've got the software installed.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.120
Well, what next, right?

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.060
Well, there's always a setup
and configuration step,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.520
which is at times extremely painful.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.700
I've bought a product.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.640
I'm your user.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.430
I bought the product,
and I've installed this thing,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.080
and I've got it on my system.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.760
There's nothing more annoying
than being forced to deal with

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.770
unnecessary configuration.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.080
And we'll talk a little bit more
about some other technologies that

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.840
are available on Mac OS X that enable
you to simplify that setup process.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.890
But if there's anything you
can do to make the installation

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.170
more straightforward,
please do that.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.700
Only ask the user for
help when necessary.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.720
Don't bother the user with questions
that aren't required at that time.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.000
Many users purchase something quickly.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.350
They need it to insert into a
workflow or get something done,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.580
and they don't want to be
dealing with configuration.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.680
Get users up and running quickly.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.100
quickly.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.060
So for the installation here,
the best practices for installation

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.870
are focus on excellence in packaging,
provide system requirements

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.840
where possible,
or always, sorry.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.960
Make sure the package is easy to open,
make sure it's attractive so that you can

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.910
steal sales away from the competition,
all those kind of things.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.280
Provide simple,
straightforward installations,

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.990
and get your users up and running.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.550
That's the key, I think,
with installation.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.680
All right, interaction.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.200
So user interface design,
the science of human computer action,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.260
kind of breaks down into two disciplines.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.020
First discipline is interaction design.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.280
It's all about workflow.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.420
It's all about how many clicks does
it take to accomplish a particular

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.350
action or task inside of a product.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.120
The second area of
discipline is visual design,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.820
the aesthetics of something on screen.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.720
So let's talk about
interaction first of all.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.100
And in this section,
I want to talk about some technologies

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.210
that you should think about
adopting in your Mac OS X product

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:34.540
to facilitate or make more consistent,
deliver consistent user experience

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.590
for a lot of the common tasks that
your users will be faced with.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.260
First is you're hearing
a recurring theme,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.850
I think, today.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.970
Address Book Framework.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.950
It's a great technology built into
Mac OS X that basically provides

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.700
system-wide contact management.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.400
If your application deals with
anything like phone numbers,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.700
email addresses, fax numbers, addresses,
people names, whatever,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.700
whatever information is
associated with a contact,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.650
it should be built upon
the Address Book Framework.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.690
Address Book, the application,
is just a client of the framework.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.640
Your application, too,
can be just like Address Book,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.950
the application,
and can take advantage of

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.680
the Address Book database.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.230
Tied in with Adder's Book Framework
is the People Picker.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.190
We've talked about this.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.750
I'm not going to review all the
Mac OS X State of the Union material,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.450
by the way, but I just want to touch on
a few of these technologies.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.250
If we're talking about
Adder's Book Framework,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.200
the People Picker is now
available to Carbon and Cocoa,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.980
and it enables your application
to provide a very consistent UI.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.990
Basically,
it's the system that provides the

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.640
UI for users to pick the contacts
that your application is dealing with,

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.560
or that they need to deal with.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.140
While we're on the topic of pickers,
there's the font picker as well.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.900
If your app allows users to choose
fonts or glyph characteristics,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.100
let them choose it
through the font picker.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.080
Don't roll your own
UI around this functionality.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.300
And then the color picker, same thing.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.530
If your application provides
for the ability to pick colors,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.150
this is where you need to go.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.290
This is where users need to go.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.640
And the advantage of using these
technologies for your users is

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.320
that users get familiar with
doing this in one application,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.350
and they automatically can take
that experience and leverage

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.850
it inside of your application,
because it's just the same.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.410
All right, Search Kit.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.840
Great technology to build your
application upon if you're doing

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.850
anything related to searching,
retrieving, or summarizing documents.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.100
There's a session later on this week
related to Search Kit in detail about

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.890
how to take advantage of this engine,
this core engine,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.520
and something you should think about
putting into your application in

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.570
terms of doing searching for stuff.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.040
And we provide the UI on this.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.340
Or actually, no, sorry.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.980
This is where we use it in the system.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.660
You saw these slides in the
MacWisdom State of the Union.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.900
Address Book, iCal.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.250
Findr, FontBook.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.640
So we're using it all over the place,
and you can too,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.680
because we give you the UI for this.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.150
The rounded search field is
being introduced with Panther.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.540
It's only for searching.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.820
Continue using the square
rectangular search edit field for

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.250
all other standard tech stuff.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.690
And then the drop-down menu off
of this allows you to specify

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.610
the scope for your search.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.010
All right, Apple Help,
another technology that you can leverage

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.110
to deliver a really consistent experience
for reviewing online documentation.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.760
The cool thing about Help,
and we'll talk about this

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.380
more again later on this week,
the cool thing about Help is

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.880
that it's built on WebKit,
so there's tremendous performance

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.060
improvements this year in Panther.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:34.420
And Apple Help allows you to put
your Help content on remote servers.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.250
So even though your development
may have finished and you've gone

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.780
up to production of your CDs,
your Help teams can continue to finalize

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.310
the Help content and store it on
remote servers that users will actually

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.420
access automatically once they start
running your Help through Help Viewer.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.480
So Apple Help is for user assistance.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.970
Rendezvous, we were talking about setup,
right?

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.910
Setup and configuration are
critical that they be as

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.900
simplified as much as possible.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.480
Rendezvous is one of those technologies
that we've talked about a fair

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.640
bit today and last year as well,
but this technology enables

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.980
you to auto-configure,
and it's a really cool technology.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.470
You can detect IP devices that are out
there that might work with your product.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.800
So leverage Rendezvous to...

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.290
To take your users,
take away from the users the

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.640
need to type in an IP address.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.980
If your application today
requires users to type in

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.360
IP addresses to get up and running,
then you should seriously be looking

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.040
at a rendezvous and figuring out
how that can help you get away

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.520
from forcing users to do that.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.970
Universal Access.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.120
Building on the accessibility
APIs that are built into Mac OS X,

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.840
using standard system controls,
you can deliver your product and deliver

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.680
a very consistent user experience to
users who are in many ways disabled,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.340
or in a variety of ways disabled.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:54.890
So it'll also help your product
be Section 508 compliant.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.780
And lastly, Mac OS X provides a lot of
international technologies.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:03.400
Your application should be Unicode-based
so that all customers in worldwide

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.500
markets can take advantage of the
functionality that your product provides.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.600
All right, so we're still on the
topic of interaction,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.220
which is the workflow of the application.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.440
And there's a critical component
to this part of the design of your

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.940
product that often is overlooked,
and that is feedback and communication.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.080
How do you convey information
back to your users?

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.320
Well, this is not the way to do it.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:30.790
Right?

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.470
It's important to report errors,
but it's really critical that if

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.020
you do report an error that you
say something useful to the user.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.390
Here's a sample alert dialog
from an application on Mac OS X.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.720
Great application, actually.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.640
And thank you to the developer
who brought it to the platform.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.970
But in this particular case,
I want to use this as an example to

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:56.300
point out some of the errors that
I see other developers making as well.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.880
So here we've got a standard dialog
that talks about an error condition

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.410
and basically asks two questions.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.200
Do you want to import the structure?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.500
Yes.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.340
And then the Yes button is Yes, Continue.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.540
So at least it should have been Yes,
Import.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Or do you want to display
the text "No"? "No,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.000
cancel"? Is it "No,
display the text" or "No,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.000
cancel"? I don't know.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I'm confused.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.510
Better way to do this, oh,
not to mention the fact

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.000
that there's a wrong icon.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.920
So when you're doing
alerts in your application,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.270
make sure to use standard alert
calls to deliver a consistent

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.000
appearance for your alerts.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.610
If you are doing them manually,
the alerts manually,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.890
make sure that the icon that's
displayed is your application icon.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.000
And only in the case
where there's destructive,

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.000
you know, some destruction of data
that's going to occur,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
do you want to badge
it with a caution icon,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
which is the small yield sign.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.760
Alright, so the right way to report
errors is basically through

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.000
this example from the finder.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.990
So what's right about this?

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.890
Well, first of all, a good error message
has three components.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.000
First of all, what happened?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.030
In this case,
the iDisk cannot be accessed.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.810
The second element is, why did it happen?

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.230
Well, it's because the user didn't
have a .Mac member name and

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.490
password in system preferences.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.500
Okay, so there was an error.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.120
What happened?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.360
Why did it happen?

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.020
And the third component is,
what can the user do about it?

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.540
And that's typically in the smaller text,
and then directly associated with

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.260
the button that the user would
pick to actually solve the problem.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.220
So three important parts
to an error message.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.590
What happened?

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.790
Why did it happen?

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.880
What can the user do about it?

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.400
And finally, notice the application icon
that showed up in this case.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.700
All right, and finally,
on the topic of interaction,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.040
I just want to leave a few tips
of things that I pass on to a

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.400
lot of developers as I meet with
them and review their products.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.090
First of all,
I think it's critical that no matter

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.370
what audience you're focused at,
whether it's an enterprise professional,

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.280
enterprise IT person,
whether it's a consumer-level iMac user,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.650
sort of entry-level iMac user,
it doesn't matter what your audience is,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.800
it's important that your product
delivers solutions and not just

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.790
be a container for features.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:20.230
What's great about iPhoto
and iTunes and iMovie,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.810
et cetera?

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.780
It's not so much that they're
full-featured applications and they

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.410
do everything that every user would
possibly want in every market segment.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:35.150
It's that what they do,
they do extremely well,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.150
and they typically do the things
that most people want to do.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.800
Your application can be the same.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.980
It doesn't have to do
everything necessarily,

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.350
but what it does, it needs to do very,
very well.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.860
And that's all about interaction design.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.230
It needs to lead the user
through the task at hand.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.420
And these are hard problems to solve.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.120
It's important that you know your user.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.850
Many developers are seeking
as big a market share as

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.740
possible and are trying to aim,
pluck a feature from here for

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.580
these users and stick in another
feature over here for this crowd.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.710
We've got a sales opportunity over here,
so let's throw in this and

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.860
that and the other feature.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.560
And the problem is that
at the end of that,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.260
you get product bloat.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.910
And really, in many cases,
there's nobody that's overseeing the

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.540
overall user experience of that product.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.770
How do all those features
operate together?

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.900
How is the data viewed
and interacted with?

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.780
And these are difficult things to solve,
but it's something that needs to be done.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.360
So make sure that you know your user.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.760
Target your products at
a very specific market.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.870
That way,
you can tune the product to that market's

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.820
needs and that market's workflow.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.260
Know your application.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.260
Understand exactly what your application
was designed to do and don't cobble on

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.240
extra features for a particular market
segment that really don't match what

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.140
your application is capable of doing.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.540
Avoid crowding toolbars.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.600
Toolbars in Mac OS X,
you'll see in the Finder, for example,

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.560
have-- there are shortcuts
to things like applications,

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.720
home, you know, documents,
this sort of thing.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.890
And those are quick shortcuts to
things that are multiple clicks away.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.590
Your toolbar should really be
shortcuts to functionality in your

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.140
application that your users might want.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:18.060
Provide things in toolbars that enable
users to get at-- to sort of make

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.000
visible things in your toolbars that
users might not necessarily discover,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.240
but that once they do use it,
solve a lot of-- save

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.320
a lot of time for them.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.600
Don't put things in toolbars
that have keyboard shortcuts

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.200
already associated with them.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.120
You're going to overcrowd your toolbars.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.620
And it's a lot easier for a user
to learn a keyboard shortcut,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.220
in many cases,
and they already know many of them,

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.670
than to populate-- you know,
create an icon for that that's yet

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.120
different from another icon for Save,
for example,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.000
or New from any other application.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.380
So New, Open, Save, Print, Cut, Copy,
Paste, all of those things that have

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.530
standard standard keyboard shortcuts,
they don't need icons and menu bars.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.050
And then in the process of developing,
simplify your product,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.180
work out the best UI you
believe is required,

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.590
and then simplify again.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.240
It's a difficult thing to do,
but focus on your users.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.110
Know your users,
know what your application can do,

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.190
and aim towards that.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.100
All right,
so best practices for interaction.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.560
Leverage relevant technologies.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.140
Just went through a kind of a laundry
list of some relevant technologies

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.570
for some of your applications,
but choose the best technologies for

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.850
the customers you're going after and
based upon what your application does.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.070
Take advantage of what's already in
the system to deliver a consistent

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.150
user experience for common tasks
that users are going to be faced

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.120
across a multitude of applications.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.170
What they know from one application,
they can then apply to yours.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.690
report errors properly,
and deliver solutions, not just features.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.600
All right,
so I said that human and computer

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.650
interaction is kind of-- or
user interface design is broken

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.030
into sort of two disciplines,
right?

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.640
Interaction design, visual design.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.310
And I'd like to take some time
now to talk about the tips and

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.320
tricks for delivering a really
great layout or delivering great

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.310
Aqua compliance in your application.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.880
So it's critical that your
application focus on clean design.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.580
As you work out the UI and the
appearance of your product on screen,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.680
it's highly important that you focus on
cleanliness and space and room so that

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.530
people can find what they're looking for.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.940
A cluttered interface is
very hard to navigate.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.330
It's hard to find what I'm looking
for when stuff isn't related or it's

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.680
not grouped or it's laid out poorly.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.280
Rather, take something like this.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.340
And when you apply the layout guidelines,
you get something that's a lot cleaner

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.180
and much more appealing to look at.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.830
And if you do this kind of exercise
across your whole application,

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.220
the effect is dramatic.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.060
You don't need to add a single
feature to your product,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.740
but just clean up the UI if
it's already on Mac OS X,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.310
and you'll have a brand new product.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.780
So, let's talk about how to do that.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.460
And to do that,
I want to take an example dialogue,

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.990
let's call it our patient,
and we're going to go through

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.580
the process of operating on this
patient to provide a facelift.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.690
And we're going to end up with this.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.520
So we're going to go
from what's on the left,

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.630
we're going to transition to the right.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.800
I want to talk through the exact
steps that we went through to get

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.090
that from the start to finish.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.460
First of all, button placement.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.970
I see this over and over and over,
a violation of this most

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.300
basic Macintosh UI guideline.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.160
Action buttons go in
the bottom right corner.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.920
They're spaced by a
specific amount of spacing,

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.970
and if you don't get that exactly right,
that's okay,

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.810
but it's important that they're,
that the cancels to the left of

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.880
the right of the okay button,
I'm sorry.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:49.160
It's important that the OK button is OK,
capital O, capital K, not OK,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.150
or hunky-dory, or, you know,
something like that.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.950
I'm going to use orange in the
next series of slides to highlight

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.910
areas that are white space or that
are focal point for the slide.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.590
So here,
we're using white space to delineate,

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:08.100
to create natural dividers between
the different groupings on the dialog.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.590
So we don't need lines.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.050
We don't need hard physical lines.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.930
We can just use white
space to accomplish that.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.340
It's important to group related items.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:23.260
Now, in the dialogue that we saw earlier,
in our patient dialogue,

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.390
there was group boxes that were used.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.240
And in Mac OS X,
I'll talk about group boxes in Panther,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.120
but group boxes are great
for grouping things together,

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.000
but in many cases,
it's not necessary to use a group box,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.660
per se.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.370
Mac OS X, or in Aqua,
we introduced this idea that you

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.230
take a group box and eliminate
the sides and the bottom,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.160
and you could just use the top of the
group box to group things together.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.590
So here, we're doing that.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.500
Basically,
we got rid of the group box completely.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.630
What that does is it just
kind of lightens the UI.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.300
And in many cases,
white space as a divider is

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:58.250
perfectly sufficient for creating,
you know, putting together what we want.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.090
If you're going to do
that single top divider,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.170
which is the group title and
then the single horizontal line,

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.010
make sure that the horizontal
line is aligned with the

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.970
baseline of the group label.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:18.320
So, Mac OS X provides for the ability to
group related items by using white

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.920
space or the grouping title and line.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.020
But also, in Panther,
we've introduced the group box.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.660
And the group box is not
something that we've,

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.640
you know,
the issue we had with the group box

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.910
historically was that it was these
hard black lines around the edge.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.720
And until we solved
that appearance issue,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.440
we really weren't pushing group boxes.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.280
So, if you want to continue
using group boxes,

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.170
go right ahead.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.490
They're available in Panther,
but they now have an etched

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.730
in appearance and have a much,
much finer appearance

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.320
than Mac OS X Panther.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.510
All right, well,
how do you deal with alignment

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.460
of objects on screen?

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.970
Well,
there are some basic tips that will roll

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.260
into the human interface guidelines,
but that I want to talk

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:56.920
to you about today.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.950
The first thing to remember is,
in a dialog box, for example,

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.950
or whether it's a modalist
dialog or whether it's a sheet,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.600
in any window that's got
labels alongside of controls,

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.380
make sure that you right-align
the labels along the colons,

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.800
if they're stacked vertically,
for example.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.610
The next thing is you want to
left align all of the controls

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.300
that are labeled by those labels.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.900
And then in most cases where you
have a bunch of stacked objects,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.790
where you've got controls
that are labeled and they're

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.610
stacked on top of each other,
it's sufficient and it looks

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.110
good to extend all of those
controls to be the same width.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.290
Now, that's not always the case,
and it's very difficult to

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.620
roll out very hard and fast
guidelines for some of this stuff.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.300
In this particular case,
there are some pop-up

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.900
menus here that may have,
in the case where they

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.510
were numeric maybe,
there would be a specific length to

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.100
that number that could be put in there.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.230
And it wouldn't make sense for
that pop-up menu to be really wide.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.290
So moving the pop-up menu itself
to be shorter would be fine.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.650
But what provides a very cluttered
appearance is when the width of

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.180
controls and a bunch of stacked
items are kind of going in and

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.030
out and in and out and in and out.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.930
It actually looks a lot better when
stuff is aligned equally on each side.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.860
Okay,
there's another question that comes up,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.780
and that is, well, okay,
if I've got a group of radio buttons,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.780
for example, that have child objects,
you know, when I enable or disable

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.320
one of the radio buttons,
the child elements enable or disable.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.880
At least that's the way it's
supposed to work if options

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.360
aren't available to users.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.740
The question is,
how do you align the items

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.130
that are children items?

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.830
And wherever possible,
continue that alignment of colons

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:43.290
for all the labels across the dialog,
and make sure that the label of

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.450
the child object doesn't extend
to the left beyond the edge,

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.870
sort of the, you know,
the edge of the left of the parent label.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:51.620
Do you understand?

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.590
So the diagram there,
tried to diagram this, and hopefully that

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.370
communicates what we want here.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.700
There's this other concept in
Aqua which was misunderstood

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.160
when we first introduced Aqua,
and that was this idea that people

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.880
thought everything in Aqua was centered.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.160
Well, that's clearly not the case.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.360
What it is is that things
are center-equalized.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.040
So within a panel,
within a system prep pane,

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.500
or within a dialog box, or a sheet,
or a tab pane, take all of the contents

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.810
of that tab pane,
follow the guidelines

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.130
we just talked about,
aligning labels and aligning

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.370
objects and all that sort of stuff,
and then create sort of an invisible

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.300
box around it and center all of that
stuff inside of the pane itself.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.940
So in this particular example,
you've got the center line going

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.670
down the center of the object,
and then the dotted line

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.290
is kind of the frame,
the invisible frame that's there.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.220
Here's another example that's not
related to our current patient,

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.420
but just another dialogue
that I showed earlier,

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.520
which shows the same idea, right?

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.320
You've got the content of
this pane centered within

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.080
the area of the dialogue box.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.600
Okay, so what a transformation.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.180
I mean, some basic things, white space,
alignment of objects,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.160
some symmetry introduced,
and there's a major transition,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.750
transformation that takes place.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.550
And if you can do this to all
of the dialog boxes or interface

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.320
elements in your application,
the app will look really, really great.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.710
Another thing that I see as
I work with developers to

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.920
help them create applications
that look better on Mac OS X,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.510
easier to use, et cetera,
is just poor use of labels.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.720
Labels tend to be replicated
across a dialog box,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.640
or there's lots of redundancy
in the text on a dialog.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.570
And one great exercise once you're in
the development cycle at some point

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.930
is to get a technical writer from your
company or get somebody who's good

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.230
with the language that you're shipping
your product in to look at the UI and

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.550
make sure that the labels aren't highly
repetitive and that you're not overusing

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.860
certain words again and again and again.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.200
Here's a case where we've got a
dialog box from a product shipping on

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.540
Mac OS X where the word argument or
arg is used like eight or nine times.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.060
Anytime you see a word used over
and over and over in a button label,

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.160
for example,
the question you should ask yourself is,

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.190
well, wait a second, are those,
if they all relate to the same object,

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.710
and I need to put the
object name in the button,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.450
then maybe they're not closely, you know,
positioned, they're not close enough,

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.410
they're not positioned close
enough to the object or

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.650
whatever it is that they affect.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.400
Another thing that I see a
lot is repeating menu items.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.340
New layer, delete layer, you know,
print layer, save layer, whatever layer.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:40.520
And sometimes those repeating items
aren't in a menu called layer.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.790
If they've got enough of them,
they could actually move maybe

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.360
into a menu called layer,
and then you could just have new, print,

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.400
save, or whatever.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.560
I mean, those aren't necessarily
things you do with a layer,

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.490
but you get my point.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.860
If there's repeating objects,
think about whether the UI is

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.880
communicating enough about what
those objects or those buttons do.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.600
And you can often eliminate a lot
of this redundancy and repetition.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:07.060
So another problem here is that the
title of the window is not very useful.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.510
The argv wizard dialog.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:16.760
There's room on this dialog box for,
it's actually an assistant,

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.150
supposed to help me through the
process of setting up something

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.030
that the software's going to do,
but the difficulty here is that

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.260
there's an area for help text,
but there's no helpful text there.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.140
It's basically just yet another
repetition of the same thing.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.960
I need to, you know,
you the user need to put in an

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.220
argument or something below.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.960
If you're going to provide help text,
make sure that it's helpful.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.560
So if we clean this thing up
and apply the same guidelines

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.080
we talked about previously,
we get something that's

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.450
quite substantially changed.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.930
So we've got better,
we've removed the duplication on labels.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.200
Just got new edit and remove.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.900
We've got a better title on the window.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.290
Now, you know,
the better title means something in the

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.790
context of what this application does,
but make sure that the titles of

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:01.250
your dialog boxes have meaning in
the context of your application.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.780
And just let me diverge for a minute and,
and, uh,

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.040
Go down a small side road here.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.690
One of the most,
the first guidelines we ever

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.400
published on the Macintosh back in,
you know, the first days,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.980
and it's still true today,
is the fact that the title of a dialog

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:23.390
box should be the same text as the menu
item text that brings that dialog box up.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.640
So if there's a menu item
that says preferences,

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.290
dot, dot, dot,
it should bring up a preferences dialog,

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.880
a dialog that's titled preferences.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.850
It shouldn't bring up
something else that says,

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.480
you know,
application setup configuration options.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.040
Helpful text, you can't read it.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.140
Buttons at the bottom, the navigation,
standard navigation, forward,

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.770
back buttons, et cetera.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.670
All right,
and in the chapter of visual design,

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.900
there is always the topic of using
standard controls and appearance.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.330
And why this is critical is because,
as you saw in the Mac Weston

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.790
State of the Union,
right, Scott Forstall showed you

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.140
how we've been tuning Aqua.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.420
And we're going to continue to do
that from one revision to the next.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.460
If you're using standard system controls,
you're going to pick up those

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.050
changes automatically with
no extra effort on your part.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.550
If you're rolling your own,
it means every time you've got to get

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.780
back in sync with what we're doing.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.370
If you can even simulate some
of the things that we might do.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.760
So it's important to use standard
system controls for that reason.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.460
The other reason is you
get things for free,

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.660
like screen readers just work if
it's a standard system control.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.170
And a variety of other benefits.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.980
So let's talk about using
system controls and appearance.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.720
You saw that with Panther,
we've rolled out three

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.300
different types of controls,
or three different sizes now.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.640
And this is based on developer feedback,
primarily for high-end CAD CAM products.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.080
And 3D modeling tools
that have got a ton of UI,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.160
and they want to fit it into a very
small amount of space on screen.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.640
We introduced many controls.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.290
Be careful how you use these.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.890
What we don't want to see is standard
dialogs and standard sheets within

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:04.670
your application using mini-controls.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.340
If something is modal,
like a standard modal dialog or a sheet,

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.060
where the user is focused on
what's going on in that sheet,

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.830
there's no reason to use small
controls or mini-controls.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.700
A standard-sized control is perfectly
acceptable because it doesn't matter

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.410
how big that sheet or dialog box is,
because the user is focused

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.350
on what they're doing there.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.720
It's a message I've given
over and over at WWDC.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.340
Don't mix the sizes of controls.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.700
Don't use small text with big controls
or big controls with small text,

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:32.210
etc.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.460
Match everything.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.960
But the mini-control is pretty exciting,
I think,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.080
for some up-and-coming applications.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.780
And so, as you saw before,
you can take a palette, on-screen,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.280
utility window that your
application might use.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.280
When you use the mini-controls,
you get something that's

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.670
significantly smaller,
which is really great.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.200
And the difference in size is there.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:58.050
See, the problem with not using system
controls in appearance is not only,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.990
you know, do you not get things for free,
but you basically look

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.860
like a freak in some cases.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:09.610
Here's an application shipping on 10
today that just is totally non-standard.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.640
What's wrong with it?

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.630
Well, let's see, non-standard labels.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.980
Why the blue background?

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.730
I mean, if you really want to
emphasize the labels,

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.180
maybe bold it.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.020
But even in that case,
I would hesitate to do that.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.910
Non-standard display font,
Geneva 9 being used

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.890
across the board here.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.710
Lucida Grande is the display
font by default on Mac OS X that

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.240
you should be using.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.260
It's antialiased, looks great,
different sizes.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:37.920
What else is wrong?

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.930
Well, non-standard list backgrounds.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.090
Lists on Mac OS X,
scrolling areas of text

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:45.370
have a white background.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.050
They don't have the corduroy pinstriping.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.650
"Misplaced buttons.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.380
They're misplaced in the context
of how this application works,

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.690
and I don't want to take the time to
speak to exactly how the app works,

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:04.020
but suffice it to say it's an
accounting product that I have

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.270
to set up my chart of accounts,
and then I've got to put in

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.690
user passwords and access
to different menu items,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.560
and I have to go through this tremendous,
highly complex configuration

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.990
setup process to get this
thing even up and running,

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:17.990
and it's just crazy."

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.120
On the topic of system
controls and appearance,

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.960
there's one more thing.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:27.330
What about metal?

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:28.290
All right.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.510
So here's the finder, new finder, right?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
iTunes, iCal, Address Book, Mail.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.640
Mail's not metal anymore.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.980
Why not?

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.400
Well, the guidelines are as follows.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.940
Metal is to be used with care.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:58.160
It is absolutely for digital lifestyle,
digital hub-related applications,

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.400
so iTunes for the MP3 players,
iPhoto for digital cameras,

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.920
iMovie for video cameras.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.010
Anything fitting into the
digital hub can be metal.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.560
If your application
fits in the digital hub,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.210
it can be metal.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.710
actually is metal because
it links to a cell phone.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:36.000
[Transcript missing]

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:42.400
[Transcript missing]

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.590
Material,
it's a heavy enough material that when

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:50.610
you've got playlist-type functionality,
it enables you to visually separate

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.920
these related lists of content.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.940
And you'll see,
as you mock up your own applications,

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.900
notice that the playlist applications
that Apple has are using Metal,

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.390
and there's very good reason there.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.040
Hopefully you'll also notice
as you install Panther that

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.240
there's a lot more consistency in
terms of how we're using Metal.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.120
Mail is no longer Metal.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.040
Mail is a real standard Aqua application.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:17.700
For example, so layout and appearance,
what are the best practices for this

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.670
area of the design of your product?

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.640
Focus on clean design.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.100
It really matters.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.570
From the get-go,
when I open the package and start

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.020
running the piece of software,
now I'm, you know, I mean,

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.750
this is my job,
so I look at this kind of stuff,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.050
but products that are messy,
that have a cluttered UI,

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:39.640
and that are poorly designed visually,
make me feel like the

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.480
code quality is of equal,
like the code is of equal quality.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.490
Don't get your code judged based on
the appearance of the application.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.430
It's like anything in our world, right?

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.210
We buy anything,
and if it looks crummy or it, you know,

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.260
doesn't look high quality,
then we start to wonder whether

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.250
the product actually does what
the vendor is claiming it does.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.710
Follow the Aqua layout guidelines.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.580
We don't publish these
numbers for nothing.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.550
We've thought long and
hard about these things.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.710
Use Interface Builder,
and if you're not nib-based yet,

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.270
you should start making that
transition to being nib-based.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.520
Nibs are the files that
interface builder produces.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.610
If you're not nib-based and
want to continue doing what

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.260
you're currently doing,
then at least switch into Interface

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.550
Builder to design the UI and then
take out the numbers from there.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.360
But my recommendation would
be switch to Interface Builder

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360
and start being nib-based.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:29.580
It's available.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.790
Carbon has support for it.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.910
AppKit just picks it
up for free in Cocoa,

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.250
right?

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.600
Use standard system
controls and appearances.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.700
A lot of benefits there.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.770
And don't abuse Metal.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.500
There are good guidelines out there.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.260
We're going to publish those,
and please stick with them.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.040
So finally,
the last area for best practices

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.650
is cross-platform design.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.090
And this is a thing,
here's a statement that

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.150
I run up against a fair bit,
because there's a lot of software

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.780
coming to Mac OS X from other platforms.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.420
Well, you see John, I can't,
we can't really do it that way because,

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.860
you know, the UI needs to be exactly the
same across all the platforms

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.950
that our product runs on.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.020
Well, it's a myth.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.140
It's basically not, it's just not true.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.540
It's the same thing as saying that,
you know, one size fits all.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.670
Well, that's not the case.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.850
It's the same thing as trying to
dress for two types of weather.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.530
Try to wear your snowboarding
outfit when you go windsurfing.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:31.740
It doesn't cut it.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:36.540
You cannot be doing the same
thing in both places or in

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.500
different weather conditions.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.440
You can't dress for
all weather conditions.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.140
So for example,
here's a developer that has chosen

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.820
to go their own way and not deliver
a Mac OS X compliant appearance.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.160
Well, it ain't Aqua.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.410
And it isn't Windows either.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.590
Wrong wardrobe.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:56.840
Right?

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.620
You've got a Mac OS X application with
buttons that are clipped at the bottom,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.920
which is just inexcusable.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.680
To me, that says,
here's fit and finish that

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.120
was just left on the table.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.580
Right?

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.860
No polish was applied here.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.550
And also, we've got a tree diagram,
you know,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.460
the hierarchy of files here that
just is straight off of a PC.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.160
And it might work on Windows,
and that's fine,

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.460
because that's the way that the
appearance is on another platform,

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.520
or there's maybe another, you know,
OS that that appearance is acceptable on.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.030
But for a Mac user who's navigating
a hierarchical diagram like that,

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.660
that's not their standard
expected appearance.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.760
They're expecting something
like List View and Finder.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.420
Here's something dressed for failure.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:48.660
Taking MDI, Multiple Document Interface,
and moving it onto Mac OS X.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.390
Mac OS X users expect,
and many of you are probably

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.760
working with two monitor desktops,
right?

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.100
You've got two systems connected,
or two monitors on your machine.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.960
You're moving windows
from one to the other.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:05.340
The limits of window movement are
basically the size of your desktop.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.430
With MDI,
while it's supported on Mac OS X through

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:11.890
the Java interface primarily,
this is who I'm seeing doing this,

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.570
while it's supported for
compatibility with Java,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.250
it's just not a behavior that's
consistent with the overall

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.600
user experience on Mac OS X.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.640
So the proper appearance for this is,
don't constrain document windows

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.900
to some parent window paradigm.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.940
But make sure your docking
windows just live on the desktop.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.840
The parent window is the desktop.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.700
Let users move them around and
interleave them with other applications.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.860
That's how the window layering
model works on Mac OS X.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.720
All right, close but yet so far.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.830
I mean, you know, Aqua widgets,
the right text, but my soul,

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:49.040
I have no idea what I'm
supposed to do here.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.840
I spend all my time reading
the labels in this prep pane,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.110
and I don't know what I'm supposed to do
or why even I'm asked for these things.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.590
We get back to setup and configuration,
right?

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.500
Make sure to only ask your users
for things that you absolutely

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.440
need to know from them that
you cannot figure out yourself.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.800
You know your users.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.480
You know what they're trying to
accomplish and what they're working on.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.260
You know what their workflow is.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:17.010
And you know what your
application is capable of doing.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.500
Make intelligent choices for the user.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.670
Don't force the user to do that.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.400
One more thing.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.590
on the cross-platform topic,
file name extensions.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.840
Great way to ensure
compatibility between files,

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.440
between multiple OSs, right?

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.640
Users in heterogeneous environments
are moving documents back and forth.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.550
Mac OS X fits into that
world a whole lot better than

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.760
earlier versions of Mac OS did.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.020
What does that mean for you,
the developer?

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.290
A couple things.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:51.320
First of all, the save panel has a hide
extension checkbox that the

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.660
system provides for you.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.750
Make sure you're taking
advantage of launch services

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.520
APIs to do the right thing.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.970
The system will set or hide that
checkbox based on what the user types.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.710
Basically, the rule for file name
extensions in Mac OS X is

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.840
what you type is what you see.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.220
If you type an extension,
you'll see an extension.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.670
If you don't type an extension,
you'll never see that extension.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.300
to file extension, okay?

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.860
And it's on a per file basis.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.460
So, as a result of that,
the choice is in the user's hand.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.850
Therefore,
make sure that you show the proper

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:31.210
display name for a file in your UI,
whether it's the document title,

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.210
or whether it's some, you know, status,
dialog box that shows status

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.840
or information about a
document or what have you,

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.320
anything,
any UI that shows information about a

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.200
document should show the display name.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.920
There's a set of APIs in
Mac OS X called Launch Services,

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.250
and you can say, "Hey, Launch Services,
with this file system object, you know,

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.880
file on system, what's its display name?"
And Launch Services will know whether

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.740
the extension should be shown or not,
and just pass you the right string back.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.420
So here's a file that
has no extension on it,

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:04.000
or at least that's not visible,
and here's the same file with

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.080
the extension being shown.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.320
So the user typed it one way or
the user typed it the other way.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.070
Make sure your application respects that,
because that's what the user wanted.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.920
So best practices for
cross-platform design,

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.220
a lot of things.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.520
Be consistent, yet platform adaptive.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.780
So what users really want is the same
functionality in the same locations,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:29.900
but they want the system appearance from
the platform that they're running on.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.690
So in other words,
it's not that they want the pref panel,

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.020
the preferences dialog,
to look exactly like it

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.640
does on some other platform.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.990
They want the same options to be
available in the preference dialog,

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:42.060
and they want them to
be in the same tabs,

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:42.760
for example.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.930
Thank you.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.180
Provide identical functionality
between the platforms.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.480
Don't deliver an inferior
product on Mac OS X.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.450
There's stuff available in Mac OS X now
that can enable you to take your

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:58.260
product to a whole new level in
terms of overall functionality and

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:01.550
connectivity and user experience.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.560
Deliver the
platform-appropriate appearance.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.650
Make sure you're leveraging
standard system controls,

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.980
right, to get the Aqua appearance,
look and feel.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.880
Platform behaviors.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.820
For example, drag and drop.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.880
Drag and drop on
Mac OS works a certain way.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.310
Make sure that your application
fits into that world and it

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:21.730
accepts a drag from the desktop,
if that's appropriate for it to do that,

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.560
given the workflow users might have.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:25.100
Leverage platform strengths.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.390
Wherever possible,
take advantage of really cool

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:28.740
technologies on Mac OS X.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.010
Some of them don't relate
to user experience,

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:31.840
but many do.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.970
If you're in education, higher ed,
there's some good reasons for using text.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:43.660
We have a great synthesizer on
Mac OS X that can speak back text

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:48.630
and save your application from
having to store digital audio.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.710
You can reduce the size
of your footprint on a CD,

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:53.620
for example, and speak back text in a
very intelligible voice.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.350
There are other technologies.

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.170
Address book.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.560
Don't write your own, you know,
contact management system.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:00.640
Leverage address book.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.920
So leverage the relevant technologies.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.590
Embrace file name extensions
and show the display name.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.570
And lastly,
avoid delivering a lowest common

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:11.950
denominator user experience.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:16.720
The problem that I see in many cases with
cross-platform applications is they're

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.630
not leveraging platform strengths.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.960
And yeah, I'm standing up here for Apple,
encouraging you to leverage

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:27.280
platform strengths from Mac OS X,
but the same is true for Windows,

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:30.100
if you're delivering on Mac and Windows.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.380
If you deliver a lowest common
denominator user experience,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.060
your Windows users are
going to suffer as well.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.550
So do what you can with the
architecture of your product to take

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.440
advantage of the strengths that are
on the platform and deliver what the

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:44.330
users on that platform really want.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.940
Finally,
where do you go for more resources here?

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.780
Well, a really great place to go and
remember is developer.apple.com/ue,

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.530
which is the user experience portal.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:02.500
There's links to piles of
information about address book

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.470
and speech and help technologies,
et cetera.

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:10.570
There's some great links to stories of
peers of yours who have decided to go

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:15.140
out the extra mile and pull out all the
stops and take full advantage of Aqua.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.500
And their stories tell about the
experience and their learning and how

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:24.410
it affected their business positively,
and lots of other great resources there.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.860
Secondly, always consult the human
interface guidelines.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.560
We've got a new version
coming for Panther,

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.020
and it's going to include a lot of
the stuff I've talked about today,

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.770
as well as, you know,
as we figure out the

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.970
fine details of Panther,
we'll include a lot of that

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.820
information as it's relevant for you.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.600
Another thing that I didn't talk about
but that relates to the visual appearance

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.620
of your application is the icon design.

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.280
What do toolbar icons look like?

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.980
What is your application,
the application icon itself,

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.830
the one that sits in the dock,
what does that look like?

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.640
Does it fit into the world of Mac OS X?

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.790
What do your document icons look like?

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.890
A lot of these things need to be redone
or done in the first place for Mac OS X,

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.360
and in many cases,
developers don't have the

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.180
resources in-house to do that.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.020
If that's your case,
there are some great resources

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.810
that are linked to Mac OS X.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:14.640
I think you can see off of the
user experience portal of companies

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.900
that can help you do this.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.360
One of them is Icon Factory.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.350
They're here on site, I think, today.

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:21.300
I don't know if the other companies are.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.900
If they are,
feel free to stop in and work with them.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.470
These guys do great work,
and their expertise is icon

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.840
design and visual design.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.670
Their expertise is in programming.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.580
That's your job.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.120
But go to the experts
for some of this stuff.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.740
And lastly, work with me.

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.040
Take my email address down.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.410
Contact me after the conference.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:44.740
I probably do three UI reviews a week,
which is where I sit down with developers

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.520
for an hour or up to a whole day,
depending on what my schedule allows.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.030
And I can look at every menu,
every dialog box, every document window,

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:54.430
every aspect of your
product from installation,

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:58.510
packaging, through installation,
through configuration, through operation,

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:02.020
and help you craft that product and
make it a whole lot easier to use.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:31.940
And lastly, work with me.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:31.940
Take my email address down.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:31.940

And lastly, work with me.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:55.300
Take my email address down.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:55.300
Contact me after the conference.
