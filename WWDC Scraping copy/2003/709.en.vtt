00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.140
- Pleasure to introduce to
you your speaker for today.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.280
And his name is David Egbert.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.230
He's an expert in QuickTime at BYU.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.260
And he'll tell you all about how
QuickTime is being used at BYU to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930
enhance the learning experience.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.450
So, David.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.160
Thank you, Amy.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.790
Welcome.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.330
I appreciate you coming today.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.070
I'm very excited to share with you
some of the developments that we've

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.160
been working on in synchronizing
media inside of QuickTime.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.130
As an introduction,
let's talk a little bit about

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.140
objectives of this presentation.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.310
I'd like to talk a little bit about
some of the best practices and worst

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.480
practices that we've encountered
in using synchronized media to

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.300
enhance the learning process.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.400
And also,
I'd like to talk to you a little bit

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.200
about providing you with knowledge
and resources necessary for you to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080
be able to create your own projects.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.270
Sometimes I know at some of
these conferences we talk about

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.110
all these great solutions,
but no,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.230
actually give you the opportunity to
learn how to do some of these things.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.600
So I'd like to focus
on that today as well.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.660
Here are some of the things that
you'll learn in this presentation.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.800
We'll talk a little bit about the
benefits of online synchronized lectures.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.820
We'll talk a little bit about the
design process that the Center for

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.900
Instructional Design does in
developing some of these products.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.870
We'll talk a little bit
about tips in acquisition,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.060
tips in authoring, and tips in deploying
some of these products.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.730
And lastly,
we'll talk a little bit about how to

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.600
author these materials and various
different solutions inside of QuickTime.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.610
We'll talk about QuickTime Pro, Smile,
using Ahrefs tracks, and lastly,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.620
Live Stage Professional.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.740
Of course, this whole presentation is
brought to you by the Big Blue Q.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.900
Very powerful architecture.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.530
We really like what's under the
hood and what's available for us.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.810
Let me talk to you a
little bit about BYU.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.990
It's a private university in Utah.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.820
Currently enrolls about 34,000 students,
undergraduates, and admits about 7,000

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.460
new freshmen each year.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.870
We also have a continuing education area
that hosts about almost half a million

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.760
users or hosts about half a million
enrollments in their distance education

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.860
and conferences that they have as well.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.220
And then there's the Center for
Instructional Design,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.930
and we build all the online content
for both on-campus courses and also

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.340
for the continuing education area.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.760
The Center for Instructional
Design also uses students extensively

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.310
in the development process.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.920
It's a great learning
experience for them,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.520
and they're very talented people,
so we like to leverage the students

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.980
in the development process.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.840
The challenge at BYU,
like many other universities,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.050
is that we have a very diverse and
diverse universities today is that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.540
these are tough times and at BYU there's
a freeze on building new buildings

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.610
and expanding our campus that way.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.480
There's also a freeze on hiring and
opening new positions on campus.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.630
Someone has to retire or quit
their job to be able to open

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.370
up a position for someone else.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.640
There's also a freeze
on student enrollments.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.370
We have a cap at 34,000.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.610
We can't enroll anymore.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.440
Because of that,
we're seeing increasing numbers of

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.460
applicants that are turned away.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.650
Each year that number
gets higher and higher,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.650
and we're very concerned about that.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.110
Also,
freshmen are arriving much smarter and

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.240
expecting much more than in the past.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.540
Being able to work with these students,
it's just amazing to see how

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.960
bright they are these days.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.380
And they really have high
expectations of college.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.320
So we have a challenge.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.580
The president has challenged us
and challenged the whole university

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.320
to think of ways that we can
accommodate more people on campus.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.230
And think of ways that we can
improve the student learning

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.060
experience through technology.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.530
Of course,
our area takes that very seriously,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.860
and hopefully today you'll be impressed
with some of the things that we've found.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.750
One of the initiatives that we have
on campus to explore that challenge

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.680
and try to find a solution to
that challenge is what we call the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.920
hybrid distributed learning model.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.160
Basically what this is,
is that students spend half

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.090
of their scheduled class time,
instead of in the classroom,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.310
They actually learn those
lectures outside of the classroom,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.400
either at home on a personal
computer or in a computer lab.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.070
And then the other half of that classroom
experience is actually in the class,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.000
where they have face-to-face
collaboration with their professor

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.910
and also with the rest of the
classmates and discussion.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.610
We try to focus on more personalized
things in the classroom.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.500
It's been a very interesting experience.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.650
An example of using that hybrid
distributed learning model is

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.750
a course called Accounting 200.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.040
And this is the solution
that they have come up with.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.280
It's an online lecture mode.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.420
It allows the students, actually,
to go through the lesson content.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.830
Instead of in class,
they go to a computer and get

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.080
the content from the computer.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.960
It's been a very interesting experience.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.830
This particular class enrolls
about 1,200 students annually.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.650
The professor has worked with
the Center for Instructional

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.160
Design and created about 50
hours of lectures on six CD-ROMs.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.580
This is now a commercial product that
other universities are leveraging.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.280
It took about two and a
half years to develop,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.550
and it took about six figures of
funding to get it out the door.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.140
Here's the kicker.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.090
Software requirements.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.540
This thing only runs on Windows,
basically.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.690
There's no Mac OS support,
and you have to do a few things

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.770
to get it to work in Windows XP.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.440
It requires Internet Explorer 5 Plus,
the Java virtual machine,

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.740
and Windows Media Player 6.4 to 8.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.500
It's not compatible with 9.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.900
It also leverages Flash 6 and above.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.200
And there's some documents on
the CD that use Acrobat Reader.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.700
Let's take a look quickly at some
evaluations of this particular product.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.300
Did you prefer the CD course
lecture format of this course

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.660
to a more traditional format?

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.540
This is what the students said
of this particular course.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.960
"Overwhelming support for this
new online experience that the

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.770
students are using in the classroom."

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.200
Let's take a look at some more
evaluations from this particular course.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.850
For this course,
which format do you think would

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.900
have been better in helping you
more effectively and efficiently

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.070
learn the core exam material?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.420
Instead of yes and no here,
the yes should say is the CD format,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.940
and then the no should
be the in-class format.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.920
So again,
overwhelming support from the students

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:52.070
using this class to use the CDs instead
of learning the traditional methods

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.880
of the lecture format in class.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.620
Here's another interesting
question we posed for the students.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:09.150
Would you prefer the eight lectures on
CD and then never meet in class again?

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.610
This one's a little different here.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.000
We've got most of the students saying,
"No,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.580
I still want that in-class experience."
That sort of validated our premise that

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:28.260
this hybrid model of having the lesson
content being learned outside of class,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.270
but still having that
classroom experience,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.900
that personalized experience with
the professor and your classmates.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.000
We think it's a very important
aspect in using technology.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.460
We don't want to lose
that personal experience.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.880
Well, let's take a look quickly at
some of the student comments.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.800
"It was convenient and
flexible," a student said.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.940
"I review difficult concepts with Norm,
the professor, on my own time.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.100
Very flexible.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.900
The best reason why I like the
CD format is because I can go back

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.220
and see the lectures over again for
clarification." Here's another student.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.780
"It allows you to go
through at your own pace.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.980
If you didn't quite understand something,
you can go back.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.850
So this way you don't have the
problem of the one kid in class always

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.960
asking dumb questions and wasting
everyone else's time." Amen to that.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.700
No questions, right?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.700
Okay.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.290
Here's some negative comments
about this particular product.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.630
I have quite a few problems
with the technology,

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:32.130
and this was annoying to deal
with when I had to do a lesson.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.300
Another student,
it's not quite as easy to study

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.320
off the CD as it is out of a book.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.150
Sometimes students, there are, you know,
the stereotypical student is

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.520
so technical savvy these days,
there are students out there

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.690
that would prefer not to use the
computer in the learning experience.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.870
Here's another one.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.660
It's hard because you cannot ask
a question for clarification.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.320
That's very true.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.110
Although, in some instances,
we've married this with an

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.310
online discussion area where
the students can ask questions.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.280
Here's another one.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.780
I was just frustrated it didn't
work on my home PC with Windows XP.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.480
There's lots of technical issues.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.860
In fact,
technical issues seem to be the number

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.000
one problem with these kinds of things.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.990
Here's my favorite.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.930
Accounting 200 is not
Macintosh compatible.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
This was a major inconvenience.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.130
You know, accounting has traditionally
been a Windows-oriented study,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.290
unfortunately.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.620
Although there are quite a few
students now that are using

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.790
PowerBooks and Mac OS X on campus,
and we don't want to leave them behind.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.300
Let's talk a little bit about
compatibility problems now.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:43.500
This is unbelievable.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.270
I just could not believe this.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.340
When Windows XP was released,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.000
It just drove our department crazy.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:56.550
We had all kinds of technical problems,
support issues to deal with in this.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:01.900
So now we have five pages of instructions
on getting this thing to play back on XP.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.630
You have to install Reel 1,
you have to install

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.690
all Java applications,
and you have to uninstall the Java VM.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.670
And then you get to
follow a 40-step process.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.360
And you have to follow that process step
by step or you're going to have to start

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.980
all over again to get this thing to run.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.400
In hindsight, we simply chose the wrong
media architecture for this.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.470
It was very obvious to us that
using those various products,

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.750
we just did not create a durable product.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.080
So we have a new project inside of CID,
the Center for Instructional Design.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.820
We need to take a closer
look at the requirements for

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.260
synchronizing lectures on campus.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:48.660
We want to create an ideal
solution to easily create

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.060
cross-platform synchronized lectures.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.870
Now with every project at the
Center for Instructional Design,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.800
we of course have a workflow,
and this sort of outlines

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.000
what's going on here.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:07.400
The blue boxes on the right are the
personnel that's involved in a project,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.810
and of course the processes are
outlined in the green boxes.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.880
So we have faculty consultants
on campus that go out and find

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.310
out the needs from the faculty.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.870
That's our whole job is to find
solutions for the faculty and report

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.150
some of those things back to us.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.060
So if a professor has a great idea,
like a synchronized lecture,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.530
the faculty consultant will work with
the faculty to create a proposal.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.980
That proposal goes to a governing body
called the portfolio management team.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.030
And they get to decide yea or nay.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.950
They measure that against all the
other priorities that we have and

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.600
the money that we have available.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.600
If a project gets approved,
it goes through a design process.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.600
At the start of the design process,
we have a project team that's assigned.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.430
We have a project manager,
an instructional architect,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.700
an art manager,
and also a technical manager that

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.590
are placed on that particular team.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.600
Their job is to come up with
a proper design specification.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.840
For each project.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.600
And to also work through the
production of that particular project.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.600
And also conduct usability
and quality assurance.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.560
Once the project's done and
the professor's signed off,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:29.620
there's also an evaluation process that
is absolutely critical to ensure that

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:35.350
our materials are actually doing the
things that they were designed to do.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.680
So here are the specifications,
most of the specifications,

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.650
inside our MediaSync project.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.900
We need this thing to be cross-platform.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.200
We need full transport
control over that lecture.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.600
We want to be able to stop
it at any point in time.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.120
We need to be able to rewind
those kinds of controls.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.780
We want an index that we can navigate
to specific points in the lecture.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.490
We want, of course,
sync slides with the audio or video.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.650
It needs to be compliant
with accessibility standards.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.630
That's a very important point.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.640
Sometimes it gets neglected.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.420
It also needs to have a progress
indicator that's scrub-able.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.280
That was one critical feature
request from the faculty,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.770
that some faculty want to be able
to scrub and find a specific point.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.220
Let's see,
we also need to support our projects.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.500
These projects need to support
standalone lessons and/or whole courses.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.690
It needs to be extensible enough
to be able to break things up into

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.410
components or have one course.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:40.460
And lastly, it needs to deploy on many
different delivery platforms,

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.650
including CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and the web.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.140
Well, that sounds pretty much
like a job for QuickTime,

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.630
don't you think?

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.100
Some of the advantages of
QuickTime include cross-platform support,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.710
Mac and Windows,
and you can even get interactive

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.240
QuickTime running on Linux through
the crossover plugin.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.390
The tricky part there is to get
those Linux users to actually fork

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.140
up some money to pay for the plugin.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.420
It's $20.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.320
Sorry if I offended any
Linux users out there.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.840
QuickTime has a track-based architecture,
which makes it very easy to

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:19.010
be able to repurpose materials
and put materials together.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.810
QuickTime has impeccable synchronicity.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.280
Basically, for the most part,
synchronizing materials in

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.000
QuickTime is very solid.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.640
Occasionally,
we've seen some hiccups now and then,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.590
but for the most part, it's very good.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.040
QuickTime has a long history of
CD-ROM and web video solutions.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.900
There's all kinds of CD-ROM applications
out there that are leveraging QuickTime.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.560
This is a big one for us.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.630
We wanted to support a single plug-in,
not a half a dozen different applications

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.800
that all could be a point of problem.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.220
We want a single plug-in.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.250
Now let's talk a little bit about
some disadvantages of QuickTime.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.300
The dreaded install.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.980
That seems, at least from the
administrative standpoint,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.900
that seems to be a big barrier.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.710
What we found is that students,
that's not much of a

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.770
big deal for students.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.510
For the most part, students don't have
questions about the install.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.010
They're used to installing a lot of
different products on their machines.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:26.090
There are a few barriers for getting
the install process completed.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.260
One is on Windows,
especially Windows 2000 and XP.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.010
You need to have administrative access
to the computer to make the install.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.000
And sometimes when a student is
using a colleague's computer,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.020
they might not have
administrative access.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.800
So occasionally, we need to help people,
we need to help step people

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.980
through the process of the install.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.900
This one's actually a bigger one.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.010
And that's the dreaded NAG screen.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.420
We get calls all the time about this,
asking us,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.010
do we have to buy this upgrade?

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.820
Sometimes it can be difficult.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.400
Also, there are limited
authoring tools available.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.160
In fact,
we've been searching quite a few.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.030
There's just a handful of tools that
really do a nice job with synchronized

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.080
lectures and putting those together.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.080
We wish there were more.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.560
And lastly, it's kind of hard to find
some use cases out there.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.240
There are a few that are
popping up here and there now.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.650
But we couldn't find a lot of
use cases on using QuickTime for

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.720
synchronized lectures.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.710
So we decided to kind of forge
ahead and try to figure out what

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.020
we could do with this architecture.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.170
So here's the process that we've
kind of figured out on creating

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.240
synchronized lectures for ourselves.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.510
We need to acquire the slides, of course.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.610
We go in and capture the audio
and video of the professor.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.030
We synchronize those slides
to the audio or video.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:52.640
We add

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.010
We add a caption.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.880
Again, the accessibility issue
is very important to us.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.800
We add an index,
an index that we can navigate to,

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.360
and then we prep those
files for deployment.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:10.210
Let's talk quickly about some
tips in each one of those areas.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.210
Of course,

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.650
When we receive those slides,
we need to convert those into

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.450
something that QuickTime can support.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.300
And that's very easy to do for
us because QuickTime supports all

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.340
kinds of standard image formats.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.670
Perhaps our favorite these days,
depending on the image format,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.100
is probably PNG,
but depending on the case,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.190
GIF works as well.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.050
So does PICT and JPEG.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.440
If you're using PowerPoint,
this is an important one,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.940
export your PowerPoint slides
to still images on the machine

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.510
that it was authored on.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.520
And the reason for that is that
when you export those slides,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.340
it's leveraging the fonts, right?

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.460
So you want to make sure if you were to
- we run up against this all the time.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.820
And that is the PowerPoint slides
were authored on a PC.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.000
We take it in and put it on a Mac.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.780
And of course they're using
all kinds of different fonts.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.890
And so when we export it on the Mac,
the spacing of the fonts are

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
very strange and all kinds of
weird things are happening.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.620
So that's just a tip to
make sure you export.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.140
Here's another tip.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.980
You can actually on the Macintosh,
if you export as picked,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.800
it will render those files,
some of those files as vector based

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.320
and it will actually go grab the font
and display it inside that still image.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.600
And so for Macintosh,
if you export as picked,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.520
then you want to make sure that
the people who are using your

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.480
product also have that font.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.520
To keep things simple, again,
we usually use ping.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.110
Okay, here's some tips for,
some basic tips for

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.320
capturing the audio video.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.790
Use your tripod, of course.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.930
When you're jiggling around that camera,
you're wasting all kinds of

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.640
pixels in the compression.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.290
Just keep it simple.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.580
Also use a lavalier or a close mic.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.480
You get a nice, strong audio signal
that's very important.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.940
You need to prepare the lighting.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.080
In fact,
we strongly recommend that you go into

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.300
a classroom or wherever you're shooting
this material and scope out the lighting.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.880
Sometimes lighting is
absolutely horrendous,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.200
and that can just throw all your
video signal out the window.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.960
Captured to tape.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:25.190
We've investigated capturing straight
to a PowerBook or other computer.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.310
Sometimes there's little tiny glitches,
and you want to make sure that

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.860
you have that source material
so you can reuse that again.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.730
We strongly recommend that you use tape,
even if you are trying to do some

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.420
live capture and live compressing.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.200
Pre-processing and compression,
of course.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.160
We like to use Squeeze, Cleaner,
and now there's Compressor as well,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.940
a part of Final Cut Pro.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.640
They're all very good tools
to be able to crop your video,

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.520
de-interlace it, and compress it into the
bandwidths that you need.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.160
Alright, have the instructors
repeat the questions.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160
That's another very important issue.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.240
A lot of times students will be asking
questions and we just don't have the

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.090
microphones out with the students,
it's just with the professor.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:15.700
So have the professor repeat those
questions so it's audible on the tape.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.420
This one's sort of a preference.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.960
We really prefer to have a formal
recording session with the professor.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.700
Again,
we can get the lighting done right,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.640
we can get the sound right,
and there's not all

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.560
kinds of distractions.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.700
You know,
sometimes that's not very practical,

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.430
but if at all possible,
we like to bring them into a small

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:38.220
little studio and shoot them that
way instead of in the classroom.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.910
Okay,
let's talk a little bit about indexing.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.960
Of course,
each slide's going to need a time stamp,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.920
right?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.150
So here's a few ways that
you might be able to do it.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.840
This is a low-tech way,
and it actually works pretty well.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.670
And that is just having a student
assistant in the classroom,

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.960
and as the professor's
moving the slides around.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.460
Have the student notice what time
it is and mark it down on a sheet.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.980
We can take that information.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.400
We've had some Apple scripts and some
other technologies that allow us to

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.560
easily synchronize those materials in.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.080
High-tech includes
Live Stage Professional.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.300
Live Stage Professional 4
now has a synchronizer,

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.030
and I'll show you a little bit
here shortly on how to use that

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.300
synchronizer to synchronize the
slide materials with audio or video.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.510
And there just may be some other
tools coming out here shortly

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.030
that might be available that
can facilitate this as well.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.070
Creating the caption.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.400
How do you create a caption, right?

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.250
Well, with a caption,
the low-tech solution is to have the

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.560
word processor and your word document
or word processing document up.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.750
And as you listen to the transcript,
you can pause it, do a command tab,

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.700
go right to the processor and type it in.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.080
Anyway, that's the low-tech solution.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.110
HiTech is, of course, Magpie.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.760
Can't really see your hands out there,
but how many have used Magpie before?

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.440
This is a free tool from
WGBH that runs on Java,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.290
so it runs on Windows and Macintosh.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.080
It's an excellent tool
to create captions with.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.040
And again, it's free.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.040
What's nice about it is it allows
you to control the audio and video

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.500
while you're typing in the caption.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.050
And then after you're done,
you just choose export,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.650
and it exports to all
kinds of different formats.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.520
It's a very good tool.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.180
So I would strongly
recommend to go check it out.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.030
Check it out.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.630
Here's the URL to that
particular product.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.490
There are also other tools
that are available out there.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.600
If you go to Version Tracker
and type in QuickTime caption,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.800
you'll find all kinds of different
tools that allow you to do that.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:50.280
One other issue here,
one other nice thing, QuickTime captions

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.400
aren't only for the deaf.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.390
QuickTime captions can also be searched.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.810
I don't know if you knew this,
but in the Pro version of QuickTime,

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.200
there's a search feature.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:07.210
We'd certainly like to see that
available for the free version.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:07.210
In fact,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.830
We'd like all of you to go
ahead and submit a request to

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.060
Apple to make that search feature
available for the free version.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:19.770
This could be very useful,
especially in an education setting where

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.300
a student remembered something from one
of the lectures but can't really find it.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.260
They could just pull it up and
search through the caption.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.090
It would be very useful.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.410
You can also do this with Wired Sprites,
but unfortunately there are some

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.580
issues there still with searching
the caption through Wired Sprites,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.000
and hopefully those will
be fixed here shortly.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.590
All right, creating the interface.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.630
This is really simple.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.140
Just make sure that, you know,
it's in an image format

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.360
that QuickTime supports.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.140
And I would strongly recommend
that you leverage layers,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.560
and I'll show you that here shortly,
on creating an interface.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.660
All right.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.200
We need to create a navigable interface.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.550
And to do this,
we can leverage chapter tracks.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.850
If you think about it,
QuickTime has these chapter tracks that

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.460
allow you to jump to specific points.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.520
And it's really nice because it always
shows you what chapter you're on,

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.020
right?

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.850
And when you need it,
you can click on it and

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.210
navigate to the right one.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.760
There's quite a few different ways
you can create chapter tracks.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.270
One is using Apple Script,
and I'll show you a demo

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.140
of that here shortly.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.720
There's also Go Live and Live Stage Pro.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.650
You can also make a visual
index as well by using Flash or

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.790
Live Stage Professional.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.540
Alright, to put it all together,
again we have many solutions here.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.900
So here comes the fun part.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.880
Let's show you some demos here of
how you can author this stuff right

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.390
inside of QuickTime Player Pro.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.000
You know, it's $30.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.400
What can you do with QuickTime Pro?

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.600
So here's a demo.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.590
I'm going to transfer to this
other machine right here.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.100
Great, here we go.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.590
So here's a demo that we're gonna create,
all right?

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.220
This is a professor.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.820
Here's the Accounting 200 professor.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.170
Great.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.400
And this particular...

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.560
Let's go over these questions
reflected here in this first problem.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.460
The first one was,
why is accounting sometimes referred

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.160
to as the language of business?

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.190
Great.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.900
So we have the video and
the audio and the slides,

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.160
and the slides are synchronized,
of course, to the audio.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.160
We also have the caption track down here.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.640
If I wanted to search for something,
let's see, they've changed this.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.540
It used to be Command-F, right, for find.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.000
Now it's Command-R for whatever reason.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.260
Let's see.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.000
I think, since this is accounting,
I think he talks about

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.220
investing or something.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.440
So, when I search for invest, I found,
it found investors right here.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.040
And let's see, if I go under edit,
I can choose find again,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.800
and it'll find that again,
and I can just kind of go through the

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.290
whole piece and find all the different
excerpts that he's talking about,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.880
invest, whatever is related to investing,
right?

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.390
So, pretty slick.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:12.410
Also in this particular chapter,

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.640
In this particular project,
it has a chapter track, right?

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:25.380
And as this thing is going,
this thing will update and let me know

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:33.700
what topic I'm on as I'm going through
the project or going through the lecture.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.060
Sorry, I'm going to turn this back up.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.540
I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to do that.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:42.700
Okay, let's go through the process of
putting this together in QuickTime Pro.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.680
30 bucks, pretty cheap, huh?

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.410
Here we go.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.680
We've got our development folder here.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.700
And what I'm going to do,
here's the video.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.210
We actually shot this and
compressed it in MPEG-4.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.120
And the first thing I need to
do is I need to - I'm going to

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.400
synchronize the slides with the video.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.900
Okay, so to do this,
I'm going to take my slides, and again,

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:09.830
we've exported the slides out
from PowerPoint into - excuse me,

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.400
GIFs.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.570
I'm just going to - I'm going
to drag select all of those,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.700
come down here,
and I'm going to pop it up

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:18.740
inside of QuickTime Player,
all of those single images, okay?

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.990
Here we go.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.120
Great.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.770
All right, I'm going to move the
video file over here.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.660
So I can take a look at it.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.780
I'm going to start with slide one.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.930
I'm going to copy that.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.700
Okay, and then I'm going to close it.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.800
All right,
now over here with the video window,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.720
I'm going to hold down the shift key,
and I'm going to hit play.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.600
And while this thing is playing,
you notice that these little

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.370
sliders here will start to move,
and it'll start to select

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.760
a piece of the video,
right?

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.820
So here we go.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.860
I'm going to hold down the shift key.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.940
Let's go over these questions
reflected here in this first problem.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.480
The first one was, okay,
that's the first part of the slide.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.590
Now,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:09.190
that slide that I copied straight to the
video right here by using add scaled.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.380
And what that does is it
actually adds that slide to

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.520
the selection that I selected,
the piece that I selected.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.900
Okay, now what I'm going to do
is if I type command B,

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.400
it's going to move those selectors
to the point where I just stopped,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:25.980
right?

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.520
Okay,
now I'm going to go back to slide two.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.890
Copy that, close it out so I don't have
to worry about that again.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.900
And I'm going to continue by holding
down the shift key and playing...

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:43.720
Why is accounting sometimes referred
to as the language of business?

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.230
Okay, that's the next slide.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.130
So, now I can use addScale again.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:56.320
If I hit the back arrow key once,
this is going back one frame,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.200
and there's my slide.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.200
Now, this isn't visual, right?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.200
But it's still available,
and it's still totally

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.200
possible to do this.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.200
We found it in very short projects.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.200
This is actually a lot faster than some
of the other things that we've found.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.280
So after you go through the whole
piece and synchronize those slides up,

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.200
just using addScale to
put all those together,

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.130
the next thing we need to do is we need
to add an interface to the back of this.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.200
To do that,
I'm going to hide this for just a sec.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.180
I'm going to go back,
and I created a background image.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.200
Now, this was just created in
Photoshop and then saved out as a PNG.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.200
Here it is.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.090
All I did is I created
a region for the video,

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.820
I created a region for the slides,
and I created a region

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.040
here for the transcript,
right?

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.200
And it's just a still image.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.200
So I'm going to copy
this to the clipboard.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.340
Back to my slides here.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.620
This time I'm going to
select the whole piece.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.690
So I did a Command-A.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.130
And then I'm going to
use add scaled again.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:07.470
And it added the interface to
the whole length of the lecture,

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.470
right?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.820
Now, as you can see here,
I don't see the video and

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.600
I don't see the slides.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.680
And the reason for that is that
when you paste a new material,

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.700
when you paste new material
inside of QuickTime,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.300
it always puts that to the front.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.130
And we need to move some layers here.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.600
So to do that,
you go under the Movie menu,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.490
down to Get Movie Properties.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.980
Here we can have a listing of
all the different things that

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.500
have been added to this movie.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.990
We have a soundtrack,
and these two files here are

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.310
actually associated to the
soundtrack because it's AAC audio.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.500
Here's a video track,
and then these two video tracks here

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.500
are the first two slides that we added,
and then this is the last video track.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.500
This is actually the background image.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.500
Sometimes it's helpful to go ahead and
select one of those images and rename it.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.090
And to do that,
you just go to the General tab

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.500
and choose Change Name.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.560
This is the background.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.150
Whoops.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.500
Great.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.710
All right,
what we need to do with the background

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.480
is we need to actually put that in back
of our video and all of our slides,

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:05.950
right?

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.970
So to do that, just come under the layer
area of QuickTime Pro,

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:16.060
and what we need to do is back
this off and give it a high number.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:22.310
Negative numbers go closer to
your eyeballs as you're seeing it,

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.290
and higher numbers go
further back into the layer.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.340
So there's, we put that on layer 12,
that ought to be enough.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.850
And you notice that the
video instantly popped up.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.460
If we actually go to the
very front of this video,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.440
now we have our slides showing as well.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.620
Now let's see, the slides are kind
of in the corner here,

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.480
and what we want to do is we want
to put the slides in the slide area.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.720
Well, you could actually go through
every single slide and

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.120
move it to the right area,
or we found that if you

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.740
just move the background,
and to do that,

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.720
you just move to the size property
for the background and choose,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.720
and click the adjust button,
that will allow us to drag the background

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.110
to the area where we want it to go.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:06.690
Okay, here we go.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.600
So we're just about there.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.600
How's that?

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.190
Now we have all our slides.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.690
You could have 50 slides in there,
and you didn't have to move them all.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.880
You just moved the background.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.280
Okay, so we're done with moving
the background around.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.880
Now what we need to do,
we should probably take a good look

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:26.610
at moving the video into that window.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.460
And so to do that,
I've selected the video track.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.970
I'll click on the adjust again,
and there it is,

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.420
hiding behind that slide.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.020
I'm just gonna click on
that and move it around.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.610
Now, you gotta be careful sometimes
if you click one of these sides,

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.520
whoa,

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.250
"Sometimes it won't refresh as much.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.540
Also, you can skew it.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.270
Hey, it'll play great that way too,
but the professor doesn't like that."

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.220
Okay, here we go.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.280
So that's about where I want that.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.400
Okay, so let's just play it
and see how it's going.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:05.040
Let's go over these questions
reflected here in this first problem.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.840
The first one was,
why is accounting sometimes

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.160
referred to as the... Okay,
let's add a caption to this, right?

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:16.770
Just like I addressed earlier.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.030
Let's see.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.550
Here's what the caption looks like.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.700
QuickTime has a text-based
format for text tracks.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.600
You don't actually have to
author that inside of QuickTime.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:34.160
In fact, this is just a BBEdit text file,
and there's some markup

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.470
language - sounds familiar,
like HTML or something - that

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:43.290
allows you to actually specify
what's going on with this text file.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:48.430
And so here we specified the size,
what font we want to use,

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:49.380
the justification.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.140
It's all available inside this text file.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:56.660
So what we like to do a lot of times,
if it's a pretty short piece,

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.430
we'll just open up our word processor.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.880
And then we'll go back
to QuickTime Player.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.400
We'll play the song.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.400
Well, accounting is a language.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.400
Well, accounting is, or something.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.400
And we'll just come back
and we'll type that in.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.390
Well, accounting is, you know.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.310
And then we'll command
tab back to the piece.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.370
Business,
because accounting seeks to provide.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.400
Okay, accounting seeks to provide.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.400
And you just go and write
your transcript that way.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.400
Usually once the transcript is done,
then we'll go back another time.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.940
And this time around,
we'll open up our little

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.400
properties window again.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:33.520
Amen.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.670
And then in here,
if you go down to the time property,

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.480
it'll show you what time
that you stopped on.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.900
So let's see,
let's go over these questions.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.340
Let's say we wanted to use that as our
caption for this particular segment.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.050
You'll notice that this ended at 4.03,
four seconds and three frames.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:59.220
So now I can come back here and
I can add that timestamp here to,

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.040
well, let's go over these questions.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.180
Okay, so that was 4.03.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:12.910
So I just go ahead and type that in
and just keep going down the list.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:17.650
Magpie actually does a much better job.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.770
You don't have to worry about
all the time stamps and stuff.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.540
So once you get that done,
you'll have a movie.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.200
It's ready to go.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.610
I'm just going to open that
up in QuickTime Player.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:31.890
Here's our movie.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.700
I'm going to choose
Select All and copy it.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.410
Close it out.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.060
I'm going to go to the
front of this movie.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.480
And this time, instead of Add Scaled,
which would scale that video

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.100
clip to the length of this movie,
I'm going to use Add instead.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.870
And what Add does is Add just
adds it as a separate track.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:51.760
So now I'm not scaling.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.430
I want the synchronizing nature
of that text track to be absolute.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.560
So I don't want to use add scale.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.480
I just want to use add.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.000
So now you can see that our text track
is actually at the very top here.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.200
We need to move that down.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.040
So again, I'll go under movie,
go down to text track.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.470
This time, I'll go down to size,
and we're going to just move that text

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.260
track down into the spot that we created
in our graphic for the text track.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.800
Great, look at that.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.740
All right, looking good.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.670
OK, so now we have video,
we have synchronized slides,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.720
we have the caption track
that's already put in.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.790
Now let's add some interactivity.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.060
Let's add that chapter track.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.380
Now the easy way to do this,
the least expensive way,

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.920
is actually to use Apple Script.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.230
If you go to the AppleScript website,
there's a place where you can download a

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.800
set of AppleScripts just for QuickTime.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.410
And when you install those,
and I believe with Mac OS 10.2,

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.770
you also need to install the...

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.480
You also need to install the script menu,
which is available right here.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.890
Now, this is very interesting.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:06.510
There we go.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.000
Okay.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.150
Once you install that,
you get the scripts.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:14.380
And in the scripts menu here,
there's what we call

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.840
QuickTime Player Scripts.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.680
And what we want to do is inside
the QuickTime Player Scripts is a

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.620
chapter area where you can actually
create and edit chapter tracks

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.800
just inside of Apple Scripts.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.370
So here what we want to do first is
we want to create a chapter track

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.040
in this particular QuickTime movie.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:38.780
So if we create that,
we need to pick the track that we

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.340
want to synchronize this thing to.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.030
And usually that's good to either use
the soundtrack or the video track.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.600
Go in and create it.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.360
You notice down here now,
in the bottom right-hand corner,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.590
we have a start menu.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:55.040
That's the first entry
for our chapter track.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:58.070
Now, as we go through this piece,

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.020
Let's go over these questions
reflected here in this first problem.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.660
The first one was... Okay,
I'm going to back that up a little bit.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.950
Here's another trick for you.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.400
If you hold down the command
key and type the left arrow,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.100
it'll play this thing backwards.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:18.660
...reflected here in this first problem.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.900
I think about right about there
I want my first chapter listing.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.800
And so what I do is go
into the scripts menu,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.640
go to QuickTime Player Scripts
to Chapters,

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.000
and I want to add a chapter
at this current time.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:31.290
So, Shazam!

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:38.690
I'm going to go ahead and name this.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.690
Let's see, let's see...

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.400
Thank you.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.160
Okay, great.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.460
Now if we notice here,
we have a start menu,

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.330
and when I select that,
it goes to the start.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:54.110
And if I choose Shazam, thank you,
it jumps exactly to that spot.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.390
So here's a nice,
low-tech way for you to be able to

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:03.500
create a synchronized lecture right
inside of QuickTime Player Pro.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.940
Excuse me.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:10.500
OK.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.500
Let's go back to slides, please.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.110
You like that?

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.590
Great.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.250
OK.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.040
Let's talk a little
bit about href tracks.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.650
Here's another technology you can use
right inside of QuickTime that the video

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.520
is actually controlling some web pages.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.300
And you can do it this way as well.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.430
And so, back to the PowerBook.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.650
I know these guys in the back,
they're really nice to me.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.600
I'm driving them crazy here.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.600
Okay, so let's look at hreptracks and
how we could put this together.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.690
Let's show you a final product here.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.440
This is what an HREF track
lecture looks like.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:41:00.240
Let's go over these questions
reflected here in this first problem.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.480
The first one was,
why is accounting sometimes referred

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.140
to as the language of business?

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.710
Now with this one,
we've got that all familiar

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.800
chapter track here,
and I can jump to a specific spot.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.540
And you notice when I go to that
area and I'll hit play here,

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.710
it will continue to
synchronize those slides.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:24.140
"We've got a frame here for the video.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.510
We've got a frame here for the
content." But if you're going

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.080
to try and make an intelligent,
informed decision,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.640
you better get some information.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:36.640
At least understand something about
the company that you're investing in,

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.590
looking at what its current
financial position is.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:44.400
So here's another way that you can use
QuickTime to be able to control lectures.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.280
So let's go through the
development process of how

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.700
you can put these together.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.600
And to do this, you need to use Go Live.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.840
So let's go through a project here.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.880
I'm going to open up the index
file really quickly and give you

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.520
an idea of what this looks like.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.010
So first I have an index file and
in here I have specific frames,

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.480
right?

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.530
I have a frame for the video,
I have a frame for the content,

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.430
and you could also have
a frame for navigation.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.450
We probably won't deal with that today,
but we'll just deal with

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.700
these two frames here.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:24.700
So in the content frame, of course,
you've got whatever your first slide is.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.760
And again,
what makes this nice is that you

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.580
can go into PowerPoint and say,
"Hey, export my slideshow as a web

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.820
page," and it'll automatically
create all those web pages for you,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.490
right?

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.680
Another nice thing about this
particular solution is that web

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.260
pages can be extremely lightweight,
much lighter than graphics.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:50.180
So if you're just using text or
leveraging cascading style sheets,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.680
this can be a very good solution.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.740
Okay, so there's the content window.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.160
Let's look at the video window.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.920
Again, we've got this QuickTime movie
embedded into a web page.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.410
Now,
some of you may not know that Go Live has

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.610
a very good QuickTime editor in it.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:08.490
If I double-click on this video...

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.340
It's opening up my
QuickTime movie inside of Go Live.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:20.640
And if I click on this
Show Timeline Window button,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.970
it actually opens up a timeline.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.420
Here's a timeline of my QuickTime movie.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.190
Now let's add some additional
interactivity to this

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.960
particular QuickTime movie.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.090
I'm going to move my palette over here.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.200
If you slide your
object's palette over one,

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.250
there's a hidden QuickTime palette
there that has all kinds of cool

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.320
things you can add to QuickTime movies.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.200
We're going to add two things.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.640
First,
we're going to add a chapter track.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.600
So if we just drag that
chapter track icon down there,

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.280
it creates a chapter track.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:58.580
And if you select on the chapter
track name-- let me just move

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.990
this inspector over a little
bit-- it gives us the opportunity

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:07.060
to change the name of the track,
if you'd like.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.500
And it gives us kind of a
timestamp of what's going on.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.620
If you select the sample,
which is down below,

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.700
this is where you can actually
create your chapter track.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.330
So we're going to start with Start.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:21.000
And then you can play it down here.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.040
And it'll actually play the video.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.140
Questions reflected here
in this first problem.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:29.380
The first one was-- OK,
so right about there is our first,

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.420
where we want our second chapter track.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.680
So to create an additional
chapter listing,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.080
you can just come under here
under this Divide Sample,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.110
go over here and just click in this area.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.600
And now it's created a second sample.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.820
Here we can, let's see, this was Shazam,
right?

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:51.000
Great.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.390
And you can just go through your
whole piece and create a chapter track

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:58.440
going through all the different areas,
right?

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.440
Okay, now here's how you would
create that href track.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:04.990
This icon here is for href tracks,
and it's very similar.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.270
So here, let's see, whoops,
we'll have to back it

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.150
up here a little bit.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.440
There we go.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.840
But this is almost the
exact same process.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.840
First, you come in here,
and if you were to select the href track,

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.060
it gives you the
opportunity to type in a...

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:34.200
A URL to wherever that
slide is contained.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.110
And this is very important.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.860
This target area,
if I were just to leave this link alone,

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.190
what would happen is as
that QuickTime movie hit

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:48.000
that first href listing,
it would actually replace the movie.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.540
What we need to do is have the content
be replaced in that content window.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.790
And so if you click this button here,
it kind of shows all the different frames

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.980
that you have in your initial web page.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.550
And we actually named our
content window the content,

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.460
so we'll use that.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.850
And then this is the other important
parameter you need to select,

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.980
and that is auto load.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.210
What that means is as
this movie is playing,

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:17.200
and when it hits that new href track,
it's going to auto load that

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.360
web page in the content frame.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.050
So just make sure that's selected.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.140
Now once you have the first one selected,
you can go through again.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.500
And a lot of times you find
that the slides are actually

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.000
synchronized with the chapter track,
which is synchronized

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.360
with the HREF track.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:39.210
So I can see visually right here in this
area right here where Shazam starts,

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:44.030
I can just line that right up,
go to my divide tool.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:50.270
Divide it up and then
rename that to slide two.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:59.290
Great, and I can just keep going linear,
I can just go down the, linearly, wow,

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:03.670
go down the whole QuickTime movie
and just chop it up as I go.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.640
So that's basically
using an Ahrefs track.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:12.800
All right, let's see.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.760
Let's go back to slides.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.640
Okay, so we've talked a little bit
about QuickTime Player Pro.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.580
We've talked about href tracks.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.400
Now let's talk about Smile.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.560
How many of you have used Smile before?

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.760
Okay, a little bit, a handful.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.520
Okay,
Smile of course is a markup language,

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.000
right?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.700
A lot like HTML,
except that it has a time parameter.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.320
And QuickTime is actually
a nice player for Smile.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.530
And so now we're going back,
and I'm gonna show you how to

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.490
put something together in Smile.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:01.670
Here's what a SMILE lecture
looks like inside of QuickTime.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:16.890
Let's go - okay, the question was,
why do you use Smile?

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:23.090
Well, Smile allows us to keep the content
separate from the programming

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.480
language that's behind it,
allows us to easily repurpose things

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:31.300
because Smile is a text-based format.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:36.750
So we've got databases that can render
our Smile files on the fly really easily.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:42.080
Just allows us, since it's text-based,
to really easily edit what's going on.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.620
And you can see in this
particular example that we have

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.530
some additional functionality,
and that is we have this text-based

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.840
navigation sitting right on the screen.

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:54.270
Sometimes students like to see that,
kind of see what's going on,

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.580
what they can anticipate a little bit.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.240
So you notice also that we still
have our chapter track here,

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:04.260
which is something that's totally
supported inside of Smile.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.570
Let me show you what the back
end of this thing looks like,

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.940
okay?

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.360
Oh,
I just have to prove to you that I can

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.740
actually click through some of these.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.100
And okay, great.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.400
So let's open this up,
and I can kind of show you

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.480
what's going on on the back end.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.250
It's this presentation Smile file here.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:24.550
Okay, so there's different components
inside of Smile file that

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.540
you'll need to be aware of.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.980
The first part here at the very top, it's

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.790
is Smile specific,
and then QuickTime specific

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.900
parameters when you open this up.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.930
For example, I've set autoplay to true,
and I said, "Yeah,

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:43.700
I want a time slider at the very bottom."
And immediate instantiation means that

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.090
everything gets downloaded at once.

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:51.180
And then I also have
chapter track listings here,

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.390
and there's different modes
of putting up the chapters.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.530
Anyway, after that,
we have the header section,

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.240
just like a web page, right?

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.470
And in the header section,
we have metadata that allows us

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:04.850
to name the title of the movie,
so when you open this thing up,

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.940
it actually displays that name.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.840
We can put author and all kinds of
different annotations in here as well.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.390
In the layout area,
this is the area that we get to

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:18.840
specify what content gets displayed
in what area of our lecture.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.320
And so you'll notice here that
we've got an area for the backdrop,

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.840
which includes the whole
dimension of the movie.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.840
We've got a region just for the video,
it goes in the top left-hand corner.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.420
We've got a region for the slides,
of course,

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.820
and we have a region for the transcript.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.180
Now the navigation,
that text navigation that you saw,

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.820
is a little bit more
tricky inside of QuickTime.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.460
What we ended up having to
do is go ahead and specify a

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.510
region for every single line,
and the reason why we had to do

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:52.470
that is that you want each line
to have an anchor tag or some way

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.840
to click on it and do something,
right?

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:59.820
And so we had to break up, unfortunately,
the text there.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.110
Fortunately, it is text,
and it's pretty easy just to go ahead and

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.840
add copy and paste and put those down in,
or use a database and

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:07.840
extrapolate these materials.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.640
Okay.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.810
So we've got a lot of text here.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.840
Okay.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.640
materials together.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:16.970
So, also,
there's a little tiny dot that tells us,

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:19.370
you know, what topic that we're on.

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:23.510
And so, again, we had to break that up
into separate portions.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:28.090
Finally,
we get the body of - this is the content

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:31.580
of what you're seeing on the screen.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.400
And you'll notice here that
we have the image source,

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:38.460
which is the background,
and it's actually associated to

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:41.040
the region that's called backdrop.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.320
And so this is where you get to
take the content and tell it what

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.890
region you want to put it in,
right?

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.280
This "par" tag here means
that anything inside these

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.790
tags is going to be parallel,
meaning that it's all going to

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.900
play together at the same time.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.900
You'll notice down here,
after we put in the background,

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:05.460
and the video, and the transcript,
which all should be

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:06.900
playing at the same time,
we have a sequence tag.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:10.090
And what that sequence tag means is
that we're actually going to start

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:11.900
playing these things in sequence.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.310
We're going to add a timestamp to it,
and that's where the slides are

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:17.890
displaying at those particular times,
right?

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:21.660
In fact,
after that we have another parallel tag,

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.960
and we're actually showing the
slides and that little pointer

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.730
at the same time on the window.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.880
So basically, that's a smile file.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.100
Down here is our navigation, and here's

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.200
We're actually using QuickTime text.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.520
You notice here's the QuickTime text
markup language that we're

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.760
using to embed that in there.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.710
So it just reads the QuickTime text.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.800
Unfortunately, Smile is a standard,
of course, right?

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.800
And there's different players out
there that can play Smile files.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.550
The problem is that each
Smile player leverages different

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.800
video and audio formats.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.140
So it's very difficult to create
something that's compliant with

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.800
all the different products.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.800
And this is case in point.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.800
The text here is QuickTime-specific text,
unfortunately.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:14.760
So let me just show you that
one more time and show you

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.810
the functionality of that.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:19.500
So again, here's the metadata that's
showing the title of the window.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:25.220
We've got, we can navigate through
the different areas here.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:43.600
[Transcript missing]

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:51.440
That particular smile file
was created in BBEdit.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:55.170
I've actually found that GoLive
does a pretty good job of,

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.040
once you've created
the initial framework,

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:01.080
to bring it into GoLive,
and it'll mark up the text with colors.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.860
It makes it a little bit easier to
deal with some of the things there.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.850
We're actually investigating
and using some web applications

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:10.970
to create some of these things,
being able to author

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:15.580
some things to the web,
pull it up, grab timestamps,

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.430
throw it in a database,
and then output the whole final

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.570
product just from a web database.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:25.510
I'm not quite there yet,
wouldn't be able to show you that today.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.200
The possibility is totally there.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.330
All right, let's move on.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.590
Now we're getting to some things
a little bit more exciting.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.800
Let's take a look at
Live Stage Professional.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:37.800
How many of you have had the opportunity
to take a look at Live Stage?

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.790
OK, oh good, we've got quite a few here.

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:40.960
That's good.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.190
Live Stage is an authoring tool
specifically focusing on leveraging

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:48.040
the interactive nature of QuickTime.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.640
There's all kinds of really
cool APIs on the back end of

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.950
QuickTime that allow for interactivity.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.420
And so Live Stage will allow you
to create a synchronized lecture

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:02.690
with all kinds of enhancements that
we haven't been able to do before.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.540
So without further ado,

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:16.340
Here's an example of a synchronized
lecture done inside of Live Stage.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.190
Again,
very similar to what you've seen before,

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:23.510
except that this time around we have
mouse overs on our navigation index,

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.340
and we also have the
cursors changing to a hand,

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:30.780
which sometimes makes
a lot of sense to have.

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:36.020
It helps the students out knowing that,
"Hey, this is really a button." So again,

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:39.990
if we just start this off,
Financial Accounting seeks to

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.570
provide information to students.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:46.740
The last question was,
what is GAAP or GAAP?

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:50.900
Well,
GAAP is Generally Accepted Accounting.

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:52.900
Great, you get the idea.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:57.890
How many of you have used the
synchronizer inside of LiveStage?

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.200
We got crickets.

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.150
No, we got two or three here.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:00.540
Great.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:07.560
Well, Live Stage 4 has this new feature
called the synchronizer that will

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.490
allow you to synchronize these
materials right inside of Live Stage.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.160
Let me show you how to do
that really quickly here.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.200
Alright, to do that we need to create -
I've kind of got a shell here.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.890
I've already got my video and I've got my
- you can see all the tracks are listed.

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.640
I've got video,
I've got the sprite track,

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:34.100
which is the sprite that's displaying
exactly what topic that you're on.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.400
And that gets changed through time.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.950
I've also got the navigation,
right in this area.

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:42.370
That's a sprite track of course.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:44.930
And those are using separate
images to swap in and out

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:46.290
as you use the mouse over.

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:51.900
I've got my text caption and soundtrack,
and here's my soundtrack.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:58.400
What I first need to do is go ahead and
I need to create a new picture track.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:03.090
So here's my picture track,
and I'm going to call this "Slides".

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.400
Great.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.460
I'm going to delete that out there.

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:06.920
OK.

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:12.010
Now if I go down and I select the sound
portion-- you'll need to use the sound

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.580
when you're synchronizing this stuff.

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:18.400
If you just select video,
it's not going to select anything.

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:20.680
Oh, let me back up.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.800
One last thing.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.180
Before I do that,
I'm going to select the sprite track.

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.460
I'm going to move my slides
over to this area here.

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.800
And I'll just resh--

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.820
Change the dimensions
so it matches my slides.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:35.480
There we go.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.150
Great.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:39.640
So now if I select the soundtrack,
I come up under the movie menu

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.680
and go down to media synchronizer.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.920
Pulls up this window.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.910
It already has the soundtrack
that I had selected.

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.810
And right now the sync
source is set to background.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.990
What I want to do is set that to slides.

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:53.820
Now if I go over to my library,
in my local library,

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.590
I have a folder full of slides.

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:59.250
If I grab all those slides,
bring them down, just drag them down,

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.080
and I'm going to go over to my library.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.160
Drag him into that window.

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:07.240
Oh, sorry, one last thing.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.040
We need to be on edit mode, I believe,
and we'll just drag those to the window.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.380
Okay.

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.690
One last time.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.790
Well, let's see.

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:26.480
I must have forgotten something.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.350
Anyway, let's try this real quickly.

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:40.600
Interesting.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:45.400
Well, demo gods are not with me today.

00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:49.020
I know that there's a way you can
add all of those slides at once.

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:53.260
And then from there,
you can set the endpoint

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.160
on the first one,
and it'll automatically

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.380
start the audio clip.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.760
And as you go down
through the whole section,

00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.760
you'll be able to set the out
point of that particular slide.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.750
And you can just keep going
down with your slides as you're

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.980
listening to the content.

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:08.480
Makes it much easier to put
these materials together.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:15.830
Paul, apologize for that.

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:15.830
Okay, let's just continue on with slides.

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:22.230
Okay, let's talk a little bit
about deployment options.

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.760
Of course, CD-ROM and DVD-ROM are our
number one choice right now.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.160
Seems like a lot of students still
don't have broadband at home,

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.440
if you can believe it.

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.640
So CD-ROM seems to be
our best solution so far.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.380
Also, there's, of course,
progressive web download.

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:42.280
Just throw these synchronized
video clips on a web server,

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.040
and students can grab them from there.

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.140
Also, there's real-time streaming.

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.230
We can actually put the video and audio
on a real-time streaming server and

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:53.830
deploy these lectures that way as well.

00:59:54.040 --> 01:00:00.660
So let's talk a little bit about some
tips for CD-ROM and DVD-ROM development.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.290
There's actually a couple different
ways that you can put these

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.500
materials on a DVD and deploy them.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:11.500
The first one would be to actually embed
all of these materials in web format.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:15.610
So a lot of times,
to avoid that NAG screen,

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:21.180
we'll put all these materials in on
web pages and create a web interface

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.390
and then burn that to our DVD or CD.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.700
There's an application out there
for Windows that allows you to

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.000
actually auto-launch a web page,
and it's called Shellout that

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.500
we found to be very useful.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.340
It's free, and here's the URL that
you can grab it from.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
What this allows you to do is,
on Windows,

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.760
it'll automatically launch your
initial web page so the students don't

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.490
have to go searching around on their
hard drive trying to find this thing.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.500
It's a very good product that
we've found to be very useful.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
Of course,
when you're building web pages,

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.320
you want to build in some kind of
QuickTime checking mechanism to make sure

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.800
that they might - make sure that the end
user has the right version of QuickTime.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.790
And there's various solutions out there.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.440
If you're using Live Stage,
this is a very good tutorial on using

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.800
QuickTime checking routines for the
web and also for QuickTime Player.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.720
You can also deploy your materials
just through QuickTime Player itself.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.720
In fact,
Live Stage 4 now has a deployment

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.800
tool that you can just select
from the file menu saying,

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.620
export this to CD-ROM,
and it uses this Kickstart

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:33.220
program to actually automatically
check to see if QuickTime is

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.060
installed on the client's machine,
and if not,

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.310
it'll launch the QuickTime installer
that you've licensed from

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.940
QuickTime and put on the CD.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.800
It's quite a slick setup.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.490
We really like that.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.560
There's some custom solutions, too.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.200
We've been investigating
Runtime Revolution,

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.000
which is an excellent product
that could do the very same thing.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.160
Other products are available for
director-type applications as well.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:02:00.110
Let's talk a little bit
about web development.

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:04.580
A lot of professors really prefer
this method because it's so flexible,

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.100
right?

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.760
They can easily submit changes.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:14.020
The students can download these
lectures and burn them CD if they wish.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:18.700
That takes that cost of creating
those CDs away from the professor,

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.950
and for students it's not a big deal,
right?

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.460
It's also possible to
prevent downloading.

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.910
Some professors are very concerned
about students ripping off their

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:32.590
materials and not letting them use them.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.580
Inside a live stage, of course,
there's a technology there that

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:45.950
allows you to prevent downloading
of those QuickTime lectures online.

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.800
We have real-time streaming deployment.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.540
This is a little bit more technical.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.190
It does allow for instant access,
and so if you have a

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.020
lecture that's an hour long,
and you'd like the students

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:58.540
to be able to get to the,
you know,

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.670
45 minutes into the lecture without
having to download the initial

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:09.050
portion of that QuickTime lecture,
real-time streaming is

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:09.050
a good solution for you.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.360
Real-time streaming is a little
more sensitive to bandwidth issues.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.130
It's not quite as forgiving.

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:18.910
You know,
if on a downloadable QuickTime movie,

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:23.010
the QuickTime movie will pause
and allow you to wait until you

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.240
have more of the movie downloaded.

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:28.800
With real-time streaming, you know,
the QuickTime movie is trying

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.420
to drop packets like crazy if
you don't have enough bandwidth,

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.230
so you get a lot worse experience.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.630
Okay, and of course,
real-time streaming isn't quite as

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:42.330
portable because the video and audio
reside on a real-time streaming server,

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.900
and the slides, text,
and graphics need to

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.190
reside somewhere else,
either on a CD-ROM or a web server.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.240
So it's not quite as flexible.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.160
Again,
most professors enjoy having it as one

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.660
package that they can just move to a
CD or the web or on their hard drive,

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.410
wherever they need it.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.590
So, we're just about done.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.750
In the spirit of Apple presentations,
there's one more thing

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.710
that I want to show you.

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:12.810
Time Scale Modification The human
brain can comprehend speech

01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:16.360
up to 600 words per minute.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:24.320
Some professors can be a little
long-winded and a little bit boring.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.140
Why not speed up the presentation?

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:30.620
This technology has been
around for quite some time.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:34.280
In fact, the Accounting 200 course that
I talked about earlier has used

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.960
a product called Enounce that's
available just for Windows.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.940
Student feedback has been very positive.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:45.300
First, it requires the students to focus.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:49.980
They're not just watching
the video at one speed.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.970
They're watching the
video at one and a half,

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:55.280
two times the speed,
two and a half times the speed.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:59.390
The students love this, by the way,
because they can just focus

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:01.490
and get through the content.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.360
So again, we've had lots of positive
feedback from the students,

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.700
and we've had some
negative feedback as well,

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.260
and most of those are technical issues.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:14.260
You get up to two and a half and,
you know, the audio's garbled.

01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:17.210
It's really hard to understand.

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:20.000
It's hard to install, things like that.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.620
So, let's do it in QuickTime.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:27.600
Let's go back to the slides,
back to the PowerBook, please.

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.180
Okay, so here we go.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:40.160
Let's see, in our secret folder we have,

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.100
We have a lecture here.

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:47.690
Let's go over these questions
reflected here in this first problem.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.990
The first one was,
why is accounting sometimes referred

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.200
to as a language of business?

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:51.400
I love that.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.000
Well,
accounting is a language of business

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.700
because accounting... All right,
let's crank it to two.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.200
Here we go.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.090
...that communicates to those
who are interested in a business,

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.500
whether they be investors
or creditors or managers,

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.600
they need information.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.900
It's accounting that provides
the information that serves

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.200
as a base for many of these
decisions and communicates it.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.170
The second question was,
what is financial accounting as

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.400
opposed to managerial accounting?

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.820
Again, both of these categories of
accounting are involved with

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.600
trying to provide information.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.300
The decision is who they
buy that information to.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.100
Financial accounting seeks to
provide information... Again,

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.400
all the navigation still works.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.350
...an investor consider an
investment in the stock market.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:18.720
Can you get that?

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.200
You have to focus.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.200
"When you're thinking about making
an investment in the stock market,

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.650
you're trying to find a
variety of different companies.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:29.810
You can buy the stocks of a lot
of different companies." "Doesn't

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:33.740
that seem a little strange,
going back to one?" "There's a

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.690
lot of businesses there." "Great.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.960
Alright, so, we've got all kinds of
interesting feedback on that.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:42.410
Well, thank you, thank you very much.

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:44.200
Back to slides, please."

01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:47.360
What a great use of technology.

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:54.040
Students really,
really like speeding up the lectures.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.800
It can save them all kinds of time.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.350
And it really requires them
to focus on the material.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.440
What's interesting about this
is that the test scores - first,

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.100
the test scores haven't changed
at all throughout measuring

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.600
from when they did traditional
tests and traditional lectures.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:11.700
They moved it to CD.

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.500
The test scores didn't change.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:17.260
And now they're using this new method,
and the test scores

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.890
still haven't changed.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.450
What has changed is the time
the professor needs to spend in

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:26.320
class and the time the student
spends learning the materials.

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:29.780
So it's been a really
fascinating experience.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.040
So to wrap up, I think we just have
a quick summary here.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.570
QuickTime is definitely a viable
solution for synchronized lectures.

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:39.200
And it doesn't have to cost you
a million dollars or whatever.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.340
It can be very simple.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.770
It can be a very easy solution for you.

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:47.600
There are many different ways, of course,
to create them.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.400
And we've outlined some of those here.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.100
We do need more applications
to make this a lot easier.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.040
So if you're a developer,
think about creating some

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.440
products for education.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.400
This could be one that
could be a killer product.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:07.000
I guess here's some additional programs,
sessions that are available.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:10.460
I'd strongly recommend checking out the
advanced interactivity in QuickTime.

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.030
Michael Schaaf's going to be doing that.

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.320
I'm sure it'll be just a killer session.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.360
And all kinds of other interesting
sessions on using QuickTime.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.200
And let's see.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:19.870
Here we go.

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:21.140
Oh, let me back up one.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:25.430
I got a... This QuickTime alternative
programming environment is going to

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:29.390
talk a little bit more about Runtime
Revolution and some other products that

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:33.820
are out there that you can incorporate to
make CD-ROM and other interesting things.

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:36.360
I'd highly recommend that one as well.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.510
So here's some contact information.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:42.130
If you have any questions about this,
there's my email address.

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:43.560
Feel free to contact me.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.820
I'd be happy to share.

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.770
And then also, Guillermo Ortiz.

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:48.340
I see you in the office.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.920
He might be here as well to
answer some of the technical

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.560
questions on the Apple side.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:58.580
And here's some more general
information of where you can

01:08:58.650 --> 01:09:00.220
find some of these things.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.160
If you check out the,
also the little QuickTime page,

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.010
I don't know if Judy and
Robert are in the audience,

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:10.480
but they have an excellent page on
updated information on QuickTime.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.800
I'll send them a URL where you can
check out some of this stuff online.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.050
And, oh, more,
don't miss some of these other

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.940
interesting things that are going on.

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.280
Of course,
check out the Content Development Lab and

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.660
some of the lab hours.
