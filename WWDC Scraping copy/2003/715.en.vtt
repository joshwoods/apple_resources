WEBVTT

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.890
Hi, I'm Justin Bur from
Mind Avenue in Montreal,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.050
developers of Axle.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.090
Axel is a complete solution
for high-impact web graphics,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.220
which means that we do highly
interactive 3D animation mixed with

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.160
all sorts of 2D things as well,
sounds and movies.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.450
It's a cross-platform solution.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.240
The authoring tool and the viewers
run on both Macintosh and Windows.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.830
Then we decided sometime last
year that it would be really

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.950
interesting to have QuickTime as
a platform as well as the web.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.800
So there is an Axel QuickTime component,
and Axel is now a QuickTime media type,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.740
which lets you have interactive
3D tracks in QuickTime movies.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.440
Axel is also a user of
QuickTime for the usual things,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.190
so movies and images and sounds
are imported using QuickTime,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.420
and you can use them to decorate
your 3D objects in a scene.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.060
Now, for marketing purposes,
we have this diagram to try and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.520
show you that we take an awful
lot of different formats and let

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.050
you do things with them with Axel,
and then put them out at the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.600
other end in a variety of formats.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.390
Axel is, well, first of all,
it is a 3D modeler in the same

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.700
way that Maya or Lightwave are,
but of course, it's not a really high-end

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.340
modeler like they are.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.020
However, you can work with geometric
primitives and text.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.690
You can take line art and extrude
it or do rotations with it,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.520
so you can create your 3D objects.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.020
Also, if you have existing 3D models that
you've done in another 3D application,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.310
you can bring them into Axel
through VRML or using our dedicated

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.930
Lightwave importer or the exporter
we have for 3D Studio Max.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.830
So, you bring your 3D stuff into
Axel or you create it in Axel.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.460
You can then use a whole bunch
of image and movie formats

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.930
via QuickTime to decorate it,
basically to create 3D textures.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.930
And then I will shortly show you
all the sorts of interactivity

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.940
things you can do and animation
things you can do with Axel.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.360
On the other end of the pipe,
you publish to the library.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.320
You publish to Axel's own format,
which originally was intended to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.360
work with a web browser plug-in.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.320
And this plug-in works, as I said,
for Windows and Macintosh.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.790
Now, we also have a standalone player,
which is an application in

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.360
Windows or a Mac application
that will just play your content,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.360
sort of like a flash projector.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.450
And of course,
you can import any Axel output

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.780
into QuickTime if you've
got the component installed.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.780
Or now, if you publish as a
QuickTime movie from Axel,

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.870
that gives you something that
will automatically cause the Axel

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.370
QuickTime component to be downloaded
from Apple's third-party component site.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.100
We also have a variety of exporting
possibilities so that once

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.840
you've done your work in Axle,
you're not stuck there.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.020
You can export VRML,
you can even put it out in Flash,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.290
which means that Axle can be
a very interesting solution

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.800
for 3D work with Flash.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.840
But that's not the point right now.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.280
So, let me give you an idea of sorts
of things you can do with Axle.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.200
So switch to the demo on laptop 2,
please.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:33.020
First example I'll show you is
our QuickTime Everything example.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.950
Here we have an Axle model
of the new iMac as it was

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.240
introduced a year and a half ago.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.180
This was done by one of our 3D artists
in about half an hour after Steve Jobs'

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.670
keynote a year and a half ago.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.180
And so it's just a little iMac
that you can move the screen around

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.900
and you can rotate and see it.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.010
Now, and he's impressed here to
see the CD tray came out,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.910
very nice.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.460
Okay,
what would be really neat if it worked

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:15.540
is that the screen here is set up to
show QuickTime video across the internet,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.830
and it's, well, it's not doing it,
so let's go and...

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.680
Anyway, no,
I won't waste time with that right now.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.980
The idea here is though that
you're playing QuickTime video

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.250
on a 3D object created in Axle,
and then the whole thing is being

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.500
played in the QuickTime player.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.880
And yeah, it's a very cute example
when it's working.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.290
Oh well.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.090
And then the other thing
I want to show now is

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.470
Okay, I'll use the web browser
plugin in Safari here.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.740
This is an example that gives you
an idea of the different sorts of

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.940
things you can do with Axle models.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.670
So first of all,
we have an animation here.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.510
If I click here,
then the little figure...

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.490
So that's an ordinary keyframe animation,
but this is also a fully

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.140
interactive presentation.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.840
So I can change the lights
using this slider here.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.740
I can grab onto this
character and move him around.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.480
I can throw him and he
hits against the walls.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.430
We have inverse kinematics,
which is a 3D technique for handling

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.530
the arms and legs of characters,
so that when I move his hand,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.700
the rest of his body follows.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.050
Axel gives you things
like proximity sensors,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.780
so that as I bring the
microphone over towards him,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.900
he speaks.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.770
And you may have noticed
that no matter where he is,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.340
he's always in the spotlight.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.210
That's because the light here
is permanently pointing towards

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.420
him wherever he happens to be,
wherever the light happens to be.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.380
And so yeah, I drag the light.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.480
Then when I let go of the light,
it'll just snap back to

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.980
the nearest anchor point,
since it has four anchor

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.220
points set up there.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.260
So that's the way it works.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.220
So I can move the camera around,
and I can move the camera around,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.300
and I can move the camera around.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.410
So that's the way it works.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.380
So--

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.060
That gives you an idea of
what Axel can do basically.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.410
And now I'll go back to the slides and--

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:34.090
go through the Axle workflow,
just to list off the sorts of

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.270
things you can do with Axle.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.220
So, remember we start with
creating our models,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.690
whether it's by...

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.960
Excuse me.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.990
I'll just send that away.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.920
Okay.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.990
Right, so you've got your geometry,
you've got objects, then you can create

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.140
relations between them.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.570
Our Relate menu lets you
constrain one object to another,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.600
link them together,
or constrain something to a path,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.210
so an object can only go along a path.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.230
You can have objects
that spring together,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.250
like we saw the lights that spring,
sorry,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.700
we can have objects that spring together,
or that snap to a certain point,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.760
like the lights we saw that
snapped back onto their fixtures.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.070
And also, there's skin and bones for
doing character animations.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.680
You can set up visualization options,
which means the rendering style that

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.700
can be shaded or wireframe or cartoon.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.310
And you can add as many
cameras as you want,

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.520
you can do lighting and textures.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.630
These are all basic things
that you would do with 3D.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.690
They're all very easy to do in Axle.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.290
And textures,
that is sort of the wallpaper

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:50.200
that decorates objects,
can be QuickTime movies or still images.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.970
And what I hoped to show you
there was the QuickTime movie

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.650
displaying on the iMac screen.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.940
Um.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.750
When you're animating,
you can animate along a

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.000
path or with keyframes.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.420
You can do interaction,
which is very simple because we have

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:13.260
a drag and drop interaction editor as
well as some predefined interactions.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.100
And no scripting
required for any of this.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.960
So I'll do one last demo very
quickly now since we're running

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.460
out of time for my segment.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.900
So back to laptop 2, yes.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.730
This one here is what
happens when you put... Okay,

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.140
here we have an Axle model.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.550
So it's been set up so that
you can rotate it and move it.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.240
We have an interaction here so that
you click it and the head gets bigger.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.900
Or another button.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.500
So all of this is Axle.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.780
Around the edges,
everything is QuickTime sprites.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.300
This was put together
by using Live Stage Pro.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.890
The QuickTime interactivity editor.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.810
And so right now it's set up to
modify the background and I can

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.300
change the... Or I can send a message
to Axle to change the rendering style.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.980
So this is QuickTime talking
to Axle to tell it to change

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.300
different colors and objects.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.530
So finally, back on the slides.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.500
Axel, so Publish Your Work is an
interactive QuickTime movie.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.480
It's on the Apple download program,
and we have communication with

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.400
other QuickTime tracks enabled.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.180
Live Stage Pro 4.1 supports Axel,
so come later on today to session

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.400
722 and hear about how that
works from the Live Stage people.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400
Thank you very much.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:53.400
Next, we'd like to invite up
Peter Falco from Zoomify.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.900
Hi, my name is Pete Falco
and I'm with Zoomify.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:20.210
And what Zoomify does is we
enable QuickTime to deliver high

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.650
resolution images over a network.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.560
It's great for not only images,
but objects and panoramas.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.260
And as you'll see, it's easy to author,
the viewing happens very quickly,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and it's very extensible.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.580
What I'm going to go through here
very quickly is we're going to

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.230
see some real world applications,
what people out there are

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.030
using it for right now,
how the technology works,

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.450
how to use the technology,
and then I'm going to do a

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.420
quick tutorial on putting
hotspots inside of the content.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.760
And at the end,
I'll talk about what we've

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.490
got planned for the future.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.690
You can see these are some of the
customers that we have that are

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.630
using the technology currently in
several different market areas.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.210
Museums and archaeology,
medical and scientific, e-commerce,

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.560
entertainment.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.310
Now I'm going to switch
over to the demo machine.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.850
I'm going to show some of these.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:26.680
So what we're looking at
here is this first image is

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.000
actually a 257 megabyte image.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.040
Now,
normally you wouldn't think about putting

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.830
something so large up on a web page,
but you can see this is

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.930
live from our server,
how fast it loaded.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.800
And if I want to see more detail,
I just zoom in, and when I stop,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.240
it will go and retrieve the
pieces of the image that it needs

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.820
to show that part of the image.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.380
So you can have virtually unlimited
size images in a web page.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.220
We have customers who have 10
gigabyte images for one single

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.680
image in the medical community.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.420
The same technology can be
applied not only to images,

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.900
but also to panoramas and obviously,
to the internet.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.400
objects.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.360
So this is a panorama
that we'll see here.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:17.180
This panorama is 207 megabytes.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.250
And like I said,
normally you wouldn't consider putting

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.900
something that large up on a web page.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.460
But see when I zoom in,
it will go and it'll

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.110
get more data as needed.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:36.300
OK, I'll switch back to the slides.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.150
So how does it work?

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.170
The standard practice when taking
images and delivering them over

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.630
a network is to compress them,
JPEG being the most standard

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.350
form of compression.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.660
We take a different approach.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.100
Just like with a movie,
you want to stream it because

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.930
there's lots of frames,
and you don't want to download the

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.040
whole thing before you start playing it,
the same goes for an image.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.310
What we do is we take the image
and we break it up into tiles,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.580
which you could think of
being very similar to frames.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.420
And then we only download the tiles
that we need to display the view

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.100
that you're currently looking at.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.820
So the image over on the left-hand
side of the slide there shows

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.000
the pyramid that we build.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.820
So we cut it into pieces,
we scale it down,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.330
we cut that into pieces,
we scale it down,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.560
we cut that into pieces.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.410
And that's what allows us to
get access to any resolution,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.690
any piece of any resolution in the image.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.500
It's a standards-based approach.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.600
Each one of those tiles
is just a JPEG image.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.560
So not only-- is it streamed,
but it's also compressed.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.790
And unlike a lot of other
people in this space,

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.720
our business model is
just based on software.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.670
There are other companies
that are doing this where they

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.660
put strings on your content,
you pay them each time somebody views it,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.400
or they sell you a $10,000 server.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.920
Our products range in price
from $99 to $800 for our most

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.060
expensive enterprise product.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.380
And there's one or two skews in between.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.580
We actually even have a free product
that you can go to our website.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.570
It's called the JPEG.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.580
It's a very simple version
of what our product can use,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.370
which is a fully functional--
it'll convert your image,

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.580
and then you can put it in a web page.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.580
No strings.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.090
It's just a very simple version
of what our product does.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.710
How do you use it?

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:22.950
That's also very easy.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.600
You just take your image,
you drop it on our encoder.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.000
It'll generate a QuickTime file for you.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.240
You take that file,
you embed it in your web page like

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.320
you would any other QuickTime content,
and put it on your web server.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.660
There's nothing special
needed on the web server,

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.520
and the only thing that is needed
on the client side is QuickTime.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.700
We also have a Flash version,
a Java version,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.960
and our own ActiveX control and plug-in.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.760
Okay, let's switch to the demo machine.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.850
I'll just do a quick convert here.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.700
So as I said,
it's a very simple process to

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.400
convert one of these images.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.590
If I just take--

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:15.740
Take this panorama right here
and drop it onto the converter.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.120
So you're presented with some options.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.140
This is our standard dialog.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.520
First thing you need to do is say,
where do I want to output these files,

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.930
the width and height that it's
going to be in the web page,

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.460
copyright comments.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.380
Down here is what type of
output you want to have.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.000
We'll just do a straight QuickTime.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.160
And this is a panorama.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.540
So for a panorama,
there are some extra things

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.830
that you have to specify.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.810
But we're just going to
have it auto-calculated.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.960
So we just drop the image on there,
and basically said,

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:53.980
here's where to put it when I'm done,
and I want it to be a QuickTime file.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.060
When I say OK--

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.460
This was a cylindrical panorama,
so there's actually a

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.500
two-stage process involved.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.000
The first step is everything
that we do is a cube,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.500
so first we convert it to a cube,
and then we save it out to our format.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.140
This is our format, PFF,
it's for pyramidal file,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.320
and this is the pano.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.210
And that was the extent of the
authoring process right there.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.440
If we switch back to the slides.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.310
In addition to being able
to create zoomable content,

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.270
we also have the ability
to add interactivity to it

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.800
in the form of hotspots.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.880
And the way we do that is through,
we also have a Photoshop plugin,

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:50.870
so instead of doing the drag and
drop encoding to create the image,

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.810
you could just take an image that's
in Photoshop and we have an exporter,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.720
and you can export,
you'll get that same dialogue.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.800
It's exactly the same experience.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.800
For creating hotspots, we use ImageReady.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.230
It was running.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.840
The Image Map tool inside of ImageReady,
we leverage that functionality because

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.300
we figure why reinvent the wheel.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.760
Somebody already spent a lot of
time building a nice interface

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.600
for dropping down a hotspot.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:28.150
So I have this file
right here that -- oh,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.210
we need to switch.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.240
Okay, so this is the panorama
that I just created.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.120
If I want to put a
hotspot into this file,

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.210
you see I have an image map defined here.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:47.470
If I go down here, and I select that.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.620
So when I want to put in
a hotspot in ImageReady,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.930
basically in the name field,
I'm going to say,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.000
the hotspots in our world
are actually images.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.550
And we support both JPEGs and GIFs.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.140
So I would put something like--

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.040
Peter Giff,
and the URL is the URL that it'll

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.980
jump to when you click on it.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.820
This URL field can also be
any of a number of different

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.590
events that we support,
and I'll show that in a little bit.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.850
Events can be go to this view or change
the panorama that you're looking at

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.960
without going to a whole new web page.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.830
There's a lot of different
events that we support.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.000
Go to my favorite URL.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.550
The target, just put it in a new window.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:54.990
The alt is a tooltip that will show
up when you mouse over the hotspot.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.690
And if I save this.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.000
And I go to export.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.640
So this would be to export
the image as a panorama,

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.800
and then there are several different
hotspot exporters that you can see here.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.000
This happens to be a
cylindrical panorama.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:20.600
So I select that,
and I say where do I want to output it?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.020
I save it to the desktop.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.080
Now here it is.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.410
And this is the file that it generated.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.290
We'll look at that.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.040
Let me edit.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.760
So, what was this?

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.440
Quit.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.340
Skip version.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.200
OK.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.140
You can see there's
two hot spots in here.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.700
One was the one that
was already in there,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.900
and the other is the new one.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.640
And it's a fairly straightforward
text-based format.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.380
The polygon information is what you
need image-ready to generate for you.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:07.800
There's different triggers and the
URL to be used to load in the hotspot,

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.030
the tooltip.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.360
It's a very straightforward format.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.960
It's all documented in our product.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.640
And then if we look at this right here.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.220
This is the hotspot that I made.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.210
And if I click on it,
you can see where it goes.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:36.440
So this is an animated
GIF with transparency.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:41.730
So you can put-- it can be dropped right
into the environment fairly seamlessly.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:47.860
Let's switch back to the slides.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.770
And so what do we have coming?

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.570
There's a couple different format
options that we have right now.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:02.320
We have our own proprietary format,
the PFF format that you see here.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.460
In order to make that
work in our Flash Viewer,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.280
it actually required a
small server-side component.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.250
So we came up with another format
that all the tiles are just

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.660
separate and put into folders.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.720
So that format is also an option.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.600
Soon we'll have the ability to
support via that same serverlet,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.720
JPEG 2000.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.360
So if you prefer to work
in a more standard format

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.890
than our proprietary format,
that won't be a problem.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.140
Whiteboarding and synchronized
browsing sort of go together.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.670
We have one application where
multiple users can be looking at

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.980
the same image at the same time,
and when somebody zooms into an area,

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.340
everybody sees the same thing.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.590
You can add notes right
on top of the image.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.680
It's being received very well
in the medical community,

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.030
actually, for doctors to all be
looking at the same scan of,

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.680
say,
patient's tissue sample of some kind.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.210
And I think that's --
maybe I'll do it for me.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.730
Oh, a recap.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.970
So, Zoomify enables high resolution
images in web pages via QuickTime.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.110
It's perfect for not just images,
but objects and panoramas.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.500
It's easy to author, fast to view,
and totally extensible.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:39.500
[Transcript missing]

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.280
Can we see this machine here, please?

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.750
That's my dog, Zoe.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:59.000
[Transcript missing]

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:03.400
This is a motto that
drives all our development.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.760
And this is called VAMP Tool Ready.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.110
And it is, why should it be so difficult?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.170
I shouldn't have to care about
what file format things are in.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.540
I shouldn't have to care about
what tracks are being created

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.090
for this QuickTime movie.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.100
All I should know is that
I want to build something.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.590
So what we did,
we spent a lot of time and a lot of

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.970
years building pieces for other people.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.290
A couple of years ago
I fired all the clients,

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.100
because we realized, hey,
we actually have a product here.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.810
We have 130,000 users.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.100
They're all in education.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.100
That's growing by about 10,000
to 12,000 a month at the moment,

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:42.100
and we're really pleased.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.100
So are our investors,
especially after I fired the clients.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.060
So let's have a look.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:52.100
What I want to do is I want to
build something for the web.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.100
I want to build something,
a little web page.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.100
It shouldn't be a big deal.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.820
So the first thing I should be able
to do is take a bunch of files,

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.770
pick them up and say, yeah,
I'm going to use all these things.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.080
So what's happening here is the
program is taking a look at the formats

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.940
of everything I just brought in.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.440
It says,
do you want to resize some of them?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.900
No, I don't.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.150
OK, so I've got a bunch of stuff here.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.710
Some of them I don't
really need right now,

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.100
so I'm going to get rid of them.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.140
This I want to use as a background,
so I'll just tell that

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.910
to go in the background.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.520
You have to sing while you do this,
otherwise it doesn't work properly.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.160
This, I want to be a button.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.740
I think there's another
piece of that somewhere.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.160
I got some text.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.340
Oh, we don't want that either.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.800
That's me playing the guitar.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.600
That's not a good thing to listen to.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.640
One time I made my living doing that.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.310
I never could understand why
people would pay me to do it.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.140
So I got some text here.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:50.420
I'm going to just change the font
so it's a little more readable.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.400
Ignore the fact that it's doing
weird things with the... There we go.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.900
And change the color, I think, too.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.000
Okay, and you know what,
I think that should be transparent.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.490
So here's a little bit of text,
so maybe the text can go here.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.500
This is a VR,
oh here's the other bit of our button.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.500
Okay, and this is a graphic, just a ping,
we don't want that.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.420
Here's a piece of video.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.950
So what I want to happen is,
in my webpage,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.500
I want it to come up like this,
with my text up here.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.500
If you read this text, by the way,
it's actually a book I'm writing.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.500
So we had to have non-copyright stuff.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.250
If you read it,
you'll see what kind of a brain I have.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.440
So this guy,
I want to be a rollover for this.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.100
So if I double click on the object,
I just say, you're a rollover.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.500
And you rollover this guy.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.770
And the thing that I want you
to control is this movie here.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.360
So let's move that up a little bit.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.880
OK, I'm done.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.060
So what we need to be able to
do now is to output this so

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.150
that we can use it on the web.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.740
I want somebody to save it, so I'll say,
yeah, let's leave it called Untitled.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.220
And right now I'm actually finished.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.250
We should get music for that dialogue.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:09.460
And if I put that away... What it did,
then, it created these three things.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.560
And if I pick this HTML file
up and chuck it on the Safari,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.300
we'll see that...

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.780
Here's our,
and this is a multi-node thing,

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.160
here's our rollover, if I click on it.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.840
So it should be that easy.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.640
You're allowed to applaud now.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.270
Thank you very much.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.700
Oh man, I was in the entertainment
business for a number of years.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.740
Let's make another one.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.290
So we want to have a second
page for our website,

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.170
so this one's going to have
something more interesting on it.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.610
What did I just open?

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.990
Okay, I opened the wrong thing.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.500
Duh.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.000
There we go.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.710
So here is a nice big movie.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.010
This was done by an 18-year-old
who I took right out of school.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:09.400
I was waiting for him
outside the gate one day.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.480
We do these science fairs and
he came up to me after and said,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.910
"I want to get into
your business." I said,

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.700
"Are you crazy?" He said, "Yeah, no,
I really do." I said, "Well,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.830
what do you do?" He said, "Well,
I'm a sculptor." I said, "Okay,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.850
so show me your stuff." So he showed
me some things that he'd done,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.950
so I gave him a machine and
showed him how to use some tools,

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.640
and this actually was
the first piece he did.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.640
And it was done for a client.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.790
As I'm talking to you, by the way,
I'm just making things so

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.640
that I can navigate around.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.620
This is a really ugly button here,
but that's okay.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.580
It's just going to be a thing
that goes to the next frame.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.910
So let's output that and see what we get.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.050
You can actually get involved
in image compression,

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.720
but I'm not going to,
because the program actually has a

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.660
lot of intelligence built into it.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.390
Because we did a lot of this
work for a number of years,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.600
we know that you do certain
things all the time.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.160
We know how to compress
video so it runs properly,

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.600
we know how to compress images,
we know what to do with sound.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:30:46.200
[Transcript missing]

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.670
No, no, please don't.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.140
Actually, don't clap, throw money.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.640
At Azita we do more than
just this particular tool.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.970
We have a whole range of tools.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:07.440
We have a series of add-ons
to iMovie that make it easy to

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.720
do things like blue screening.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.920
That make it easy to do things
like picture in picture.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.460
Matting an image over
the top of an iMovie.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.920
It's really simple.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.120
Doing animation, you know,
animating text, graphics,

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.920
other movies in iMovie.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.520
It's the kind of tools that we build.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.920
They're personal creativity tools.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.920
That's what they are.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.190
And if you just give me one second,
if I can find it.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.360
What you've been looking
at actually is Java.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.520
The whole front end was built in Java.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.600
You shouldn't even have to know that.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:48.520
The program runs on both machines,
on both platforms, Windows and Macintosh.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.400
The file format is totally
transparent to both platforms.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.330
So you can start working on Windows,
switch it over to a Macintosh,

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.340
continue working on it, put it back.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.840
It doesn't care.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.710
Just keep moving.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.080
I was going to show you where
we're going in the future,

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.730
but I can't find it.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.360
Oh, here it is.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.690
My desktop.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.550
Before I came up here,
I had to clean stuff up,

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:16.450
so my desktop is normally
quite a good mess.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.400
Bear with me a second
and I'll find something.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.280
One of the things that we've
just finished fighting with

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.760
is the problem of buttons.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.700
These buttons that you can see here,
they look pretty cool.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.000
This is a button that actually
has a movie embedded inside

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.800
it with some transparency.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.960
I don't know why you'd want to do that,
but I did it just to show it can be done.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.540
and this of course is...
isn't that great music?

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.100
You can buy this... no you can't.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.100
SteffieEmbleton.com?

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.100
No, that doesn't exist.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.220
I'm still looking for something,
so I'm talking while I'm looking for it.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.670
I should have brought it out.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:02.420
We have a complete new version
coming out very shortly,

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.040
which is, there it is,
as you can see from

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.370
the name of the folder,
is Cocoa.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.990
This is this morning's build,
so you know what that's

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.240
like if you're a programmer.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.840
You never know what you're going to get.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.290
We outed the Java for
a number of reasons,

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.840
one of them being the speed of the thing.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.190
I just want to show you what
you can do with buttons.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.940
These are not predefined types.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.950
These are ones that
I decided I wanted to use.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.500
I went into Photoshop and made pictures.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.440
And then you drop them
into a special folder.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.500
And you can say, yeah,
this is the kind of button I want.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.500
I'm going to make it this size.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.490
And here's the color it's going to be.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.440
And when I go over the button,
I want it to change to this.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.420
Did that wrong?

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:49.950
Oh, no.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.490
I want it to change to that color.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:51.500
It's already done it.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.360
And when the mouse goes down,
I want it to change to that color.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.050
Export.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.200
- I'm on the desktop, yeah, good.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.180
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.640
There it goes, thank you.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.780
Did you see how fast that was?

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:18.160
We actually had to slow the exporter
down in this version by putting

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.590
in the fake thing going along.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.520
So here's our button that we just made.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.020
As you see, I roll over, it goes a color.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.790
I press the mouse down,
it goes a different color.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.770
And of course,
you can link it out to all those

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.720
things that I was showing you.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.380
We support...

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.620
are all hot spots in VRs.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.230
We probably support Axle.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.680
I haven't actually tried it,
but it'd be interesting to do.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.380
You shouldn't have to get
involved in scripting.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.910
There is none,
and we will not be putting any in.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.780
The application you've
just been looking at,

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.000
however,
the Cocoa app is fully Apple scriptable.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.960
So it is a scriptable app,
so you can automate things and

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.190
get it running in the background.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.010
We're going to be releasing that.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.640
I don't know, Chris is over there,
our director of engineering.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.520
He'll have a fit.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.560
We're going to be releasing that soon,
aren't we, Chris?

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.060
No, he says, no chance.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.080
Oh, well.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.960
We also have pathing.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.860
We also have-- there's going
to be a public beta release

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.700
on our website next week.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.230
and the other two are going to be
doing a video presentation on the Web.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.520
We're going to be talking about the Web,
and we're going to be talking

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.160
about the Web in a bit.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.960
with the same ease of use.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.960
The timeline is dead when people
are going to realize that,

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.380
I don't know.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.260
You should not have
to get involved in it.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:40.730
I'm done.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.770
Thank you very much for your time.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800
Next up is Curtis Garton from Kadara.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.800
Curtis Garton-san is Kadara-san.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.270
Okay, where's my little mic?

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.780
Okay, I'm Curtis Garton with KDAR,
and I'll be talking about the

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.590
FBX file format from KDAR.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.800
Essentially what we found is that artists
are creating more and more content

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.690
from a lot of different applications.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.680
What we're finding is a lot of these
different 3D applications don't like

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.200
to talk to each other very well.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.810
So what we're looking for is
a 3D interchange file format.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.400
So artists are creating all this media
from all these different applications.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.680
And what we're looking at is some way
to bring all this 3D content together,

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:45.960
so that we can start exchanging this,
distributing it, and sharing the content

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.710
in between artists.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:51.030
So essentially what that comes
down to is some type of universal

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.140
file format which is going to
allow us to store in 3D models,

00:36:55.210 --> 00:37:01.150
2D textures, video, characters,
skeletons, animation, that type of stuff,

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.610
all inside of one kind of
universal vanilla wrapper.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.610
So what we developed was
a file format called FBX.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.200
And essentially what it is is
a 3D interchange file format.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.240
Currently, we write plugins for the
following 3D packages,

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:22.280
including MotionBuilder for OS X and PC,
as well as 3D Studio Max,

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:28.640
Alias Wavefront Maya on OS X and PC,
Softimage XSI, as well as Lightwave on

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.110
PC and Macintosh as well.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.870
After that,
we realized that we needed a way for

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.040
artists to start viewing this 3D content.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.740
So let's say you were a 3D
artist creating 3D content,

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.110
and you wanted to distribute this
to other artists that weren't

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.060
using 3D applications of any sort.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:50.220
So we really looked for, I guess,
a way to start distributing this

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.130
to essentially anyone who wanted
to be able to view 3D content.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.610
Typically what you find is that
most professional 3D applications,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:03.340
you're going to have to actually render
out your content to a rasterized version,

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.890
a very linear version,
which really restricts what

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.500
users and your audience can see.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:13.150
So we started working with Apple and
the QuickTime team to essentially take

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:17.340
our 3D technology and the FBX format
and integrate that into a plug-in,

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.350
which would work inside
of the QuickTime player.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.660
So this is a rendering example
of what you can get in real

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.420
time using our 3D plugin.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.370
You can see we have dynamic lighting,
character animation, textures,

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.970
all being played back in real time.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.960
What this allows you to do now is
to start taking your content and

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.570
allows you to essentially visualize
and distribute this to pretty much

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.450
anyone who has the QuickTime player,
which is in the millions

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:52.800
and millions nowadays.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.800
So you're not restricted to
users of just 3D applications

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.430
or to sending out rendered out
rastered versions of your content.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.920
It also allows you a level of
interaction with your content.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.120
Inside of FBX files,
you can have user interaction

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.990
through such things as keyboard,
joysticks, the mouse,

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:17.580
which really allows you to take your 3D
content to the next level of interaction.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.380
It's also available free,
which is one of the key things that

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.120
we made sure to work with Apple,
was that we were going to be giving a

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:28.700
plug-in back to the community that was
essentially without a price tag on it.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.900
So anyone can go and download
this plug-in for free,

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.330
allowing you to view FBX content.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.580
and it's available off
our website as well as the

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.640
Apple download site for QuickTime.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.500
So what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to show you guys a couple of

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.080
quick examples of FBX for QuickTime.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.650
So I'm just going to switch
to Demo Machine 2 here.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.980
So we'll just open up a couple
sample scenes we have just to

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:01.570
show everyone the 3D in real time.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.800
So what I've got here is a
sample 3D model of an iMac.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.700
You can see we've got audio and
video playing in this as well.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:16.040
And if I go through and
actually just switch cameras,

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.480
I can actually start through
interacting with this scene,

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.210
just like I was in a 3D application.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.980
open up another sample
scene here for you.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:32.440
This one here demonstrates character
animation being played back in real time,

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.510
as well as some of our particle shaders,
which we've integrated

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.380
into the plugin as well.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.740
- I'll play this back, like so.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.220
So you can see we have these
particle shaders happening there.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.800
We've got some character animation,
this character walking around.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.430
You'll see we have real-time shadows,
as well as real-time reflections.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.030
And we also have the
ability to do interactions.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:09.040
So what we have here is a
simple tic-tac-toe game,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.720
which allows me to interact with
this content using keyboard.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.230
So for example, I can just go and have a
virtual 3D game of tic-tac-toe,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.740
like so.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.900
The beauty of these FBX files is
that now that they're available

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.850
through the QuickTime viewer is that
you can embed them in web pages.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.920
You can distribute them to essentially
anyone with a QuickTime player,

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.730
and it'll automatically download
the plugin to allow them to

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.290
view the content for free.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.420
I'll show one more example here.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:45.770
My favorite,
the ever-famous T-Rex running around.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.900
Couple seconds here to
decompress the textures.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.180
So here we have our T-Rex.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.550
Just going to loop this movie.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.060
You can see we've got a nice
little run cycle on him.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.880
I can change the
visibility modes as well,

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.180
so we can actually see the underlying
skeletal system of this character.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.980
We've got this little run loop on there.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.530
And what we have here is a little
legend of actual keyboard shortcuts

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.030
that we have created for the scene.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.860
So you can see if I hold down one,
we've got our T-Rex running around.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.420
Maybe he's in a school yard,
and he's going to grab some kids.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.660
When he gets mad,
he blows smoke out of his nose.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.090
So just some simple interaction
that you can create inside of these

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.380
FBX files to really make your 3D
content that more interactive.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:48.920
And that's it.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.790
That is FBX for QuickTime.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:10.040
And last up, I'd like to welcome
Marc Cohen from Video Clicks.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.000
We're here.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.300
Just going to switch laptops.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:24.440
So VideoClicks is a QuickTime based
application for you to easily

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.420
add QuickTime interactivity into
your existing QuickTime content.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.600
It's pure QuickTime,
doesn't require any additional plugins.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:37.690
You can add QuickTime chapter tracks,
time-based actions, events,

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.670
and the coolest of all,
what we like to refer

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.430
to as video hotspots.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.800
So I'm going to show you
the VideoClicks application,

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.190
and you'll see exactly how it works.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.740
It's a carbonized application,
so it runs in Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:58.240
We're currently in version 2.5.1.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.640
And I think you'll
think it's pretty cool.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:36.200
[Transcript missing]

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.100
Yeah, sometimes it works by turning
the mirroring off first and

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.700
then setting the resolution.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:07.290
Can we see this screen,
the PowerBook screen, temporarily?

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.780
You want to make sure we're at 1024
by 768 at that low refresh rate,

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.710
70 hertz.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.560
- Try the 75 hertz,
that's all it's making available to us.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:40.000
You're gonna have to go off screen.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.450
You're gonna have to go off screen,
just swing the mouse over, yeah,

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.100
there you go.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:02.800
So those are some pretty
cool tools we saw earlier.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:08.800
I mean, QuickTime's great because you've
got this huge wealth of tools

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.800
that are all so easy to use,
so affordable.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800
That's great, thank you.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.790
And tons of fun.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.800
Okay,
well let's just see what's going on here.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:24.670
Okay, first I am hoping to show you
our showcase on our website.

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:45.700
Make sure we're connected.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:50.820
Okay, this is our website.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.050
I'm just going to take
you to our showcase area,

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.970
so you get an idea of what
you can do with VideoClicks.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.520
This is our showcase.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.570
We've got a variety of different
examples here of what people

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.840
are doing with VideoClicks:
entertainment, education,

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.050
product placement.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.520
I'll show you this.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.300
This is our James Bond demo.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.130
Just see,
we've got some audio happening here.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.200
So,
we've got a QuickTime movie playing here.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.080
It appears just to be a
standard QuickTime movie,

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.420
just playing on a web page.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.700
However, everything in this movie
is totally clickable.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:23.220
I can click on her, I can click on him,
I can click on his glasses, his shirt,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.890
her dress, the environment,
anything at all within this movie

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:30.430
is clickable thanks to VideoClicks'
ability to create video hotspots,

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.770
the GPS system, etc.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.460
So you can see that whenever
I click on something,

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.140
I'm able to bring up more
information about that product

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.140
in a neighboring frame.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.420
Here I'll give you
another example of that.

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.410
Here's a trailer from our
favorite movie company.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.140
I'll just drag further
ahead in the movie here.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.600
So the movie's playing.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.590
Once again, using video clicks,
I can add all types of

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:50.580
QuickTime interactivity here.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.000
We see text tracks playing there.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.880
We also see chapter tracks here,
where I can easily navigate to

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.370
different parts of the movie.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.660
And anything and everything can
be clickable inside this movie.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.100
I click on Mikey.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.650
I can click on Sully.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:09.660
And we see I'm targeting information
in a neighboring HTML frame here.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.900
So that's what VideoClicks does.

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.980
And let me show you the application,
and you can see how we do it.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:49:52.700
[Transcript missing]

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.500
And at this point, I'm going to use our
real-time tracking tool,

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.980
one of the tools in the toolbar,
to lock the hotspot to the cursor.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.990
So essentially,
I'm not holding the mouse down,

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.700
I've just clicked once and that
hotspot is locked to my cursor,

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.770
so I can now track the motion of that
object or my subject matter in the video

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.500
in either real-time or slowed down,
which will make things

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:12.200
considerably easier.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.240
And here's my speed settings.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.600
One-to-one is obviously real-time.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.840
I'm going to go down to eight-to-one,
make it really easy.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.960
It's going to slow things down.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.090
If there's complex motion,
I can easily follow it by

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:23.160
locking that hotspot to my cursor
and moving at a slower speed.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.600
So here we go.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.520
I'm just going to play the movie.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.390
And then we can see things
are moving very slowly,

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.100
eight-to-one.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.430
And all I have to do is simply
follow Mikey about with my mouse.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.800
This is the real-time tracking option,
where wherever he goes, I go.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.820
And that's that.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.710
You can see I can now unlock my cursor.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:52.500
[Transcript missing]

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:57.050
So you can see each one of these
are separate interactive objects,

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.700
and they're all listed here
in the inspector window.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.820
I could change the parameters
of any one of these objects,

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.380
and if I play this back,
you'll see how that hotspot is

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.600
following Mikey about the stage.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.590
Actually, I'm just going to play it
back at full speed here.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.460
So you can see how
that's following Mikey.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.400
Now, here's another,
that's real-time tracking,

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.600
but there's much easier ways to
track objects with video clicks.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.460
You can see he is over here at one point.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.080
I stop my tracking right when he gets,
just stands upright here.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.670
And now, let's say that you have objects
moving from this point on the screen

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.450
to another point on the screen,
and you don't want to

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:36.420
track it in real time.

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.300
Well, you can use the tweening feature,
which is very cool.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.680
So he's here at this point.

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.060
He moves over to this
point on the screen.

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.000
I can simply reposition
my hotspot at this point,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.980
and then use the tweening tool.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:51.930
And then you'll see
that from this hot spot,

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.090
- Which is, at this point,
to this hotspot,

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.480
I can just turn the tween on.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.010
And now,
you can see here in the timeline,

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.540
we actually see this dashed line,
which represents the tweening.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.490
And if I play it,
you'll see how it now follows him.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:06.310
- Okay, it's supposed to be-- - Oh,
I'm just gonna back up a bit here.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.720
So there's my real-time tracking,
and there's the tweening right there,

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.160
as it tweened from this position.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:19.110
The other cool thing about tweening
is it doesn't just tween motion,

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:22.600
you can tween shape, size, color, URL,
etc.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:27.090
So you can easily have a complex
object like the plane that I showed

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.560
you here in the James Bond demo,
made up of simple primitives

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.600
that are all grouped together.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.090
So I'm just going to jump to
the end of this movie and you'll

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:39.600
see that there's a plane here,
and that plane consists of a number of

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.600
really simple primitives all grouped
together with the same attributes.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.480
And you can create complex hotspot
groupings in the timeline here simply

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.490
by dragging one hotspot onto another.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:53.710
I'll just simply create
another hotspot here,

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.610
I'll call it Sully,
and we see that it's its own

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:56.600
track here in the timeline.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.720
I can grab Sully at any point and
just drag him on top of Mikey,

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.500
and it warns me,
"You're about to take this

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.420
hotspot and give it the attributes
of the parent." No problem.

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:07.120
And now it's part of the parent,
and if I move one,

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.600
they both move together.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.600
So that's how you can
map complex objects.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.600
You can also do some other really
cool things with video clicks,

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.360
like chapter markers.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.650
If you have a particular
place in the movie,

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.600
you want to drop a chapter that allows
people to easily navigate to that point,

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:22.730
you can simply choose
the chapter marker here,

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:25.600
click anywhere in the monitor window,
call it what you want,

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.770
and here in the inspector
window under the chapter tab,

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:30.430
you can see here's the name of it
and here's the time that that occurs.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.150
You can also utilize what we
call time-based actions using

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.600
the action button in the toolbar.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:42.600
So let's say at the end of the movie
you wanted it to go to your web page,

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.170
I can just grab the action marker,
click here, go to web page,

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:50.600
etc., and now this is an
action that I can customize

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.550
with a variety of behaviors.

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:54.570
I can launch a URL,
I can go to a particular

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:57.040
time in the movie,
I can jump to a predefined

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.920
chapter that I defined earlier,
I can even go to a flash frame if you're

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.600
embedding your QuickTime inside a flash,
I can go to a flash label,

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.660
I can send a debug string to
communicate with a database backend,

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.600
or I can just simply display text.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.440
And there's some very simple
text creation tools here that

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.600
you see in the inspector window.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:17.510
So the primary interactive types that
VideoClicks can do for you are text,

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:22.550
chapter tracks, time-based actions,
and coolest of all, those video hotspots.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.640
You can also control your
workspace using the tools here,

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.600
whether you're moving
the workspace about,

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.120
zooming in or zooming out,
or you need to,

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.240
let's say you have a cluttered workspace,
for example, I've got a number of

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.280
hotspots on screen here,
and I want to hide those

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.600
down here in the timeline.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.300
I can say, oh, hide these objects,
hide my text tracks,

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.600
hide my chapter tracks, or my actions.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.480
So you can very easily clean
up your workspace and make it

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:48.480
quite simple and straightforward
to add your interactivity.

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:50.600
When you export this,
it's simply a QuickTime movie,

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.600
it doesn't require any
additional plug-ins,

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.270
and there's a cool feature in
here where you can actually

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.590
export it as a debug movie,
and then what that'll do is,

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:02.040
let me just export this on the desktop,
what that'll do is it'll actually export

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.600
the movie and it'll show you the vectors,
it'll show you the hotspots,

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.120
so you can just be sure that
they're there and they'll still

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.600
be active as hotspots as well.

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.130
Let me just go to the desktop here.

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.030
Here's my exported movie,
and you'll see what I mean.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.290
and I jump.

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.550
So there you go,
you can see those hotspots

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:21.770
there and they're still active
if I've given them actions.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:25.470
So in the standard exporter movie,
of course, those are invisible as

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:26.770
we saw in the demo here.

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.480
I just want to show you
one more example here.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:33.390
This is really cool because in
this Lord of the Rings trailer,

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.440
which is very cool,
you've got a number of

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.540
characters coming across here.

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.280
Here's Gandalf.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:38.160
I can click on him.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.540
I'm targeting the lower frame, Legolas,
etc.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.660
But even if the movie is stopped,
these are still active,

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.030
these hotspot areas,
so I can call up various

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.570
character information,
whether the movie is playing or not.

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.270
And that's really it.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.000
That's VideoClicks.
