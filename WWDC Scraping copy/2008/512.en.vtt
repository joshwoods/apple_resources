WEBVTT

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.400
Okay, so we gotta take a poll here.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.840
We gotta start with a poll.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.790
How many people are from government?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.560
So this is spot the Fed.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.960
No.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.930
How many people are
from kind of commercial?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.360
Okay, how many people are education?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
Now, some of you held your hand up twice.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.720
Are you not sure?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.490
There's a little
schizophrenia going on here.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.700
Okay.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.290
Those, okay,
so maybe I'll ask one last question.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.090
How many of you were here for this
same kind of similar session last year?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.780
Okay,
hopefully you'll still get some value.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.640
What we're trying to do is kind of
give you some high-level guidance,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.760
give you some lower-level thinking.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.920
We'll be talking about kind of
critical thinking of security.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.680
But most of all,
this comes back to the security guidance

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.260
that we do really within our documents.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.540
And we'll hit on this a little bit later,
but hopefully you're all aware that for

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.270
both Leopard Client and Leopard Server,
the security guides that we do

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.210
collaboratively with several
of the agencies hit the street

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.900
back in the beginning of June.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.240
So again, in this session,
Help Set Expectations,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.040
is we want to help you better
understand how you can do a

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.260
little bit of system hardening.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.210
Some folks say, well, OS X is secure,
right?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.820
Well, when you're changing environments,
maybe go to some hotspots,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.230
you may be going into some more
where security requirements

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.380
are at a higher level.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.630
What do you do?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.090
What do you need to figure out what
services to modify or to manage?

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.780
So that's kind of where this
guidance of this session is going.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.840
We want to introduce you
to some of the tools,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.790
and of course, at the very end,
we want to be sure that you

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.910
have the right resources,
the right references to get this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.620
guidance on a regular basis.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.140
So that's what we're going to do today.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.560
So hopefully,
we're going to help you better

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.060
understand how to do that
hardening in your environment,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.230
and I want to emphasize your environment,
because every environment

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.590
that you're running,
the laptops, desktops, handhelds,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.380
the iPhones,
each environment that you're in,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.380
has a different kind of attack vector,
a different kind of attack environment,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.000
right?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.400
You need services, maybe when you're on
a laptop in a hotspot,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.790
you need Wi-Fi that you may not need
when you're inside of your own agency.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.980
So these are all considerations
that you need to understand

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.620
when you're kind of doing that
fortification in your environment.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.710
We want to help you with kind of
some of those steps of what you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.240
can do to mitigate some risk.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.380
Kim from NSA will be helping you.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.910
She's going to walk through
some thinking about how to think

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.900
critically about security when you're
thinking of this fortification,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.990
and again, ongoing guidance.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.320
Okay, kind of like what we did last year,
for those of you who are new to this,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.710
or you just kind of need a refresher,
what do we really mean

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.120
by system hardening?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.420
Well, really,
it's taking the steps to eliminate or

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.230
minimize a lot of the security risks,
or minimize it as much as possible,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.760
right?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.240
Again,
you always need to leverage services,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.920
so you're trying to take as many
steps or the appropriate steps

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.700
to reduce any kind of risk,
but still maintain that functionality.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.780
And one of the areas I kind of wanted
to hit on on my part of this is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.160
that predominantly with the laptop
environment and with handhelds,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.340
portables, phones,
it's really become a very

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.250
mobile landscape here with data,
right?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.800
We're all kind of moving around
with a lot of our portable devices,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.760
and we're all kind of moving around
with a lot of our portable devices,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.860
it's not the same as it
was several years ago.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.860
Very few folks had so many laptops that
carried around so much sensitive data.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.690
And now all of that sensitive data,
whether it's our corporate information,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.960
whether it's national
information or whatever,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.860
it's walking, right?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.420
It's leaving the doors,
it's going out on devices,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.860
and so this becomes a sensitive issue,
things that we need to protect.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.240
So now you think of this mobility,
probably every one of you have

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.520
heard of so many situations
that have raised awareness.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.160
And so I kept on a couple
government-related issues.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.140
When you think of facilities
that have so many laptops,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.540
thousands and thousands of laptops,
things walk out the door,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.800
you don't have good protection on this,
and they get into environments

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.740
where things are exposed.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.760
These are concerns with this change of
landscape that now has raised awareness,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.390
kind of triggered the thinking,
in some cases triggered a lot

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.640
of policy related to that.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.790
But most of all,
it has given us two reasons for taking

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.560
a closer look at what we can do or
what we should do with our systems.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.620
So at least in my part here,
I want to focus a little bit

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.910
on how can you take some minor,
very simple modifications on your

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.770
systems in improving things from
a portable computing standpoint.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.010
Some of these points,
those of you who were here last time,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.760
I kind of carried some of the points
forward because these are just points

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.990
that just can't be emphasized enough.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.260
First is, a lot of the Wi-Fi access
or just communication,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.300
any kind of security guidance
that you receive from anybody,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.820
one of the first things
that we all say is,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.640
if you're not using the service,
turn it off.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.370
That's kind of a simple thing,
but it's easily forgotten because you

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.870
might be enabling Wi-Fi for a hotspot,
you might be enabling

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.820
Bluetooth for some other device,
and you move about.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.720
We're in a hurry,
we're constantly running

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.800
from one thing to another,
but yet that's a typical form of learning

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.990
new information about people's machines,
a new way of attacking.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.360
So one of the first things you can do,
item number one is, turn things off when

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.430
you're not using them.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.120
All these ports for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
you name it.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.970
And particularly when
you're doing discoverable,

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.400
right?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.200
If you're discovering or enabling
your system for discoverability,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.060
whether it's your phone or your laptops,
it's just one more

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.470
reason that folks have,
or one more capability folks have of

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.890
learning what kind of device you have,
what kind of system you may

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.810
have that they can attack
with through various means.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.140
So on each one of these,
I want to kind of bring up,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.160
why would you take this approach,
or why are you using these kinds

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.810
of steps to mitigate these risks?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.950
And one is, in this case,
we're just going to

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.390
reduce... this attack,
right?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.940
We're going to reduce what any kind of
malicious individuals or organizations

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.320
or services can actually attack us.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.150
We're going to reduce that down
to the bare minimum that we

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.850
actually have to use right now.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.470
In this case,
it may just be a Wi-Fi access.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.610
So what are the tools that Apple provides
in our products to help you with this?

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.740
Well, first of all,
if you are being centrally managed and

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.970
you're doing this from a Mac OS X server,
you'll notice that you can fully

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.930
manage those ports and do that
disablement on a given system for users.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.890
So you could enforce this by policy on
behalf of that user that may forget or,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.680
again, you may require this.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.510
So second of all, if you're doing the
one-to-one deployments,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.600
of course, you can physically disable
those interfaces as well.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.740
Lock this down and require administrative
or additional authentication mechanisms

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.960
to modify that and re-enable it.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.240
So you can do that by
using the kernel extension.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.740
Many of you might be in
environments where you've got

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.120
to go to the lowest level,
and that is you may physically

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.410
need to remove some of the
kernel extensions to just,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.500
through software, disable those services,
right?

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.740
Anytime you're doing modifications,
whether it's network setup or

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.040
whether you're using terminal
to physically remove kernel

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.150
extensions for disabling ports,
always remember that

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.740
anytime we do an update,
right, if you're removing kernel

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.010
extensions or something,
that they might be reapplied.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.170
So be aware of the ramifications of
updates to your systems with respect

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.170
to the type of approach or the type
of management you're doing here.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.150
Another point I brought up last year
was about baselining your system.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.170
It's amazing how many folks,
when you ask them, they say,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.450
"Something's happened to my
machine," and you may ask them,

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.180
"Well, how do you know?" "Well,
I think something's changed," right?

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.930
You always want to be sure that you
have leveraged a server or a service

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.110
or a capability that you can truly
baseline what your system should have

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:07.110
or does have as kind of the approved
or configuration of your system.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.110
And there's a lot of reasons
why you want to do this.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.410
First of all, again,
is how else are you going to

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.060
know that something's changed?

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.260
You want to be sure that
you can ensure what's right,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.120
and how do you ensure that?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.150
Many of the cases,
many of the tools that folks

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.200
are using are tools that,
generally,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.000
do potentially hashes of applications.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.190
It may do the validation
of signed apps within OS X,

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.870
within Leopard at this point.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.240
There's a lot of the open-source
tools and referencing for scanning to

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:45.060
be sure that it's the same services,
the same file system is there,

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.860
same files, same environment,
same configuration.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And there's several organizations that,
surprisingly, are using a combination

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.940
of some of these tools.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.850
So they may be doing some
scripting themselves,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.000
tying that back into remote desktop,
and kind of pushing those out,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.940
other scripts out to run on each one of
their desktop or laptop environments.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.940
Another area that we've provided
services that you can leverage,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.930
and not everyone always
knows about these,

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.940
so we always want to
bring about awareness,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:20.940
is that BSM, or Basic Security Module,
was ported over from Sun onto OS X.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:27.750
So you have the ability of doing the
additional security auditing on OS X.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.870
And what we mean by this is you're quite
familiar with the system log and what

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:39.710
applications and the OS logs as activity,
but you can go further into

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:45.250
defining and configuring what
additional security relevant events

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.880
are that you want to capture.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.880
And so the auditing services are there.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.160
Some of you might be familiar
with some of the turmoil that

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.880
has happened throughout the
different versions of the OS.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.960
There were some transition periods,
10.4 on Intel,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.820
where it wasn't readily available.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:07.400
10.5 auditing tools are available
publicly for all 10.5 systems now,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.820
so you're all back to snuff on that.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.960
This gives you the
ability of capturing and,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.620
in many cases, most folks,
most of you are probably aggregating

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:25.820
these security audit logs on a central
server or in a data center for reporting,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.500
in many cases, this is by policy,
organizationally by

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.760
policy at a later time,
so that you can prove what did

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.760
or did not happen on a system.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.760
So let's go forward.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.760
This is something that
many folks should be doing,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.950
more so than they are,
and that is we talked

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.740
about all these laptops,
this mobile data,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.760
this landscape change where a lot of our
data is going around on mobile devices,

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.760
the leveraging of the built-in FileVault.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.760
How many people are leveraging FileVault?

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.750
How many?

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.760
Some of you.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.760
Okay.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.320
Well, we've got FileVault there,
and hopefully you're aware

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.700
that with Leopard Server,
you can additionally force that

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.760
by policy on those accounts.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:14.740
We did a security discussion on the
East Coast just this other week,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:21.840
and the awareness of being able to force
FileVault onto all the portable devices

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.700
was kind of a new thing to many of them,
that they could now force all of

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:25.700
their mobile devices on their devices.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.070
So we're going to be working
with the local workforce to have

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.320
FileVault running for their accounts,
or FileVault containers for their

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.580
account on their portable devices.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.590
Then with the extension
of encrypted containers,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.600
portable encrypted containers
on external drives,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.870
just about every one of us
have received all the chachkas,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.130
all the little thumb drives from just
about every conference we've gone to,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.700
a couple gig drives here that typically
are just used for exchanging data.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.700
Sometimes we've been able to do that.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.670
We've been able to do that.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.700
We've been able to do that.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.700
And we put sensitive
information on there.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.720
The best thing is put an encrypted
container on there using disk utility,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.700
dump in an encrypted container.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.750
That way every time we
write data to and from that,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.700
we're protecting all of it.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.700
Again, why are we doing this?

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.530
To protect or prevent
the exposure of our data.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.700
And many times that can
cost each one of us a lot.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.050
In many cases,
from some of the companies,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.560
when data gets exposed,
it's corporate IP.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.700
It could mean loss.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.840
In some cases,
it could mean loss of millions

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.610
of dollars just with information.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.860
For many of us,
it could mean loss of our jobs, again,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.700
with the type of
information that gets out.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.520
So with FileVault and the disk images,
always be aware now that you can

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.700
-- the upgrade with Leopard gives
you the 256-bit encryption now.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.700
If you're using things like FileVault,
it's on the fly.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.700
You kind of set and forget.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.350
In many cases,
it's a situation where most users,

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.700
if they have to deal with
trying to figure out whether

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:53.700
they're going to encrypt,
they're going to do it.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.960
If they have to deal with trying
to figure out whether they're

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.670
going to encrypt the data or not,
probably not a good thing because

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.650
most likely they're going to forget
because we're all in a hurry.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:05.250
So when you're thinking of FileVault,
fully encrypts their user account,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.700
set and forget.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.730
If you're using encrypted disk images,
it's also the capability of

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.700
carrying that data across the
network that becomes quite helpful.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.930
And I'll share this in a second
because the encrypted disk image

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.700
is something that carries across
all storage devices that you use.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.720
This is an environment that, within OS X,
using the same technology on

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.640
all of your storage devices.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.570
So whether this is your CDs, DVDs,
thumb drives, USB, FireWire,

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:37.360
whatever it is,
if you can access it as storage,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.710
as media, then you can put these
encrypted containers on here.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.460
Then again,
with the Leopard brings a 256 bit.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.410
Well,
one of the areas that has really been

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.620
helpful for folks is the fact that these
containers can then also be partitioned,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.000
right?

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.320
Consider that encrypted container,
do the same thing with it that

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.100
you would do with a hard drive.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.440
You can partition it,
have various disk formats

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.470
in each one of those.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:06.660
A lot of folks are doing that for
maybe creating a FAT32 disk formatted

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.700
partition and use that with Parallels
or VMware for storage of their content,

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.750
their additional data, additional apps,
while it's part of that

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.700
full encrypted container.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.310
And the area here which really is helpful
to a lot of folks and they haven't

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.900
been aware of it is this same encrypted
technology gives you the ability of

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:34.590
storing that data on a file server
and accessing it remotely on your laptop

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.170
and accessing that as a block device.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.780
So you now have blocks of either
128 or... or 256 bit encrypted

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.940
data traversing that network.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:49.380
So it now means that remotely I can have
access to massive amounts of data that's

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:55.240
encrypted at rest on the server and I may
have a very low bandwidth connection,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.580
but I have full access to
that data on my mobile device,

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:58.800
right?

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.040
So I'm no longer relying on a sole
solution of carrying all my data with

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.390
me on my laptop and being concerned
about having that data physically

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.000
on the drive and if it gets stolen.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So now during use of that data,
I have access to it across the network.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.250
That's been quite helpful
to a lot of folks.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.840
Things that are near
and dear to my heart,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.160
and many folks in the audience as well,
particularly if you're

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.630
in the government space,
is the shifting and using of

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.450
two-factor authentication,
predominantly in a smart card space.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:34.000
This is where no longer do you
deal with the typical weaknesses

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.220
of all of us in passwords,
either the weakness of a password

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.120
or just human nature that if we
have to keep changing passwords,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.500
it becomes reduced entropy in
the difference of our passwords.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:50.380
So between that and the ability
of now with all kinds of resources

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.700
and super computer capabilities,
even on our own systems,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.180
is the ability to crack passwords
if you're trying to protect

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.420
things just with passwords alone.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.240
Moving to a two-factor authentication,
solutions like smart cards,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.740
give you a significant protection,
really with reduced

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.940
or limited complexity.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.110
for systems.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.700
I want to take the smart card piece just
a little bit further for some of you,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.800
because this happens to be
particularly in the customers that

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.730
I deal with in the enterprise space.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.090
They weren't aware of all
the capabilities that we have

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.900
integrated in with smart cards.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.860
Here you'll notice about
biometrics and one-time passwords,

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.330
cryptocard and secure ID.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.460
Ty those two together with the smart
cards and the key thing is that

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.900
we're trying to give you multiple
forms of strong authentication built

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.730
on the platform that you can tie
into whatever directory service

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.470
that you have on the back end.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.270
As I just mentioned,
I want to highlight the smart

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.000
card piece here real quick.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.770
And that is with the integration
work that we've done,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.200
you can now leverage that single
form of two-factor authentication,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.200
that smart card,
for obviously logging into your system,

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.800
for system administration,
the unlocking of screen saver, typical,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.790
sign encrypting of email, VPN,
you've got secure web access,

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.200
and even the unlocking of key chain.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.200
With Leopard came the unlocking of
FileVault with those smart cards.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.200
And this doesn't require heavy
infrastructure on the back end.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.230
This could actually enable many of
you with one-to-one deployment with

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:33.200
your own laptop to do that two-factor
authentication with a smart card

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.310
directly on your local workstation,
requiring the infrastructure

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.600
on the back end.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.340
Now,
going forward with other things here.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.740
As I mentioned,
there's always certain things

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.840
that any kind of security
individual would suggest folks do,

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.800
and that is securing services.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.000
Anytime you're enabling a service,
you always want to leverage

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.910
the more secure version,
and if you're not using that service,

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.790
disable it, just kind of like I said
about the interfaces.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.070
We always note within OS X that
we definitely don't want customers

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.670
to be using the insecure versions
of things like Telnet and others.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.710
That's why we, by default, use SSH,
right?

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.790
That's the way it's configured in OS X.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.770
SSH, secure copy,
secure remove for securely erasing data.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.020
So again,
if you aren't using the service,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.750
disable it.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.830
Some organizations will go as
far as to physically remove

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.800
that service off the box.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.870
Because if it's a... If it's still there,
and it's... Even if it's just

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.050
installed and not enabled,
if there's a compromise or a

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.390
vulnerability in another service,
it does allow for the potential

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.800
kind of hopping between services
or capabilities on the box.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.750
And that is,
you leverage a vulnerability in one,

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.790
if the service is still available
or the executables are there,

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.800
there is a potential for leveraging
that in a form of attack.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.300
So again,
these are all types of ways that you

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.720
can better avoid these kinds of risks.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.900
Typical tools,
we always kind of highlight this again,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.310
is what you can use to control that.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.830
Now, we get into firewalls.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.840
By default,
you've got all your services turned

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.960
off and there's really nothing
sitting there listening to any

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.140
kind of a request for a service.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.980
But once you do enable services on OS X,
the best thing to do is start

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.600
enabling and configuring that
firewall for that protection.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.760
You always want to put up yet
another barrier to attack.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.700
Blocking those services and the
little image you're seeing there

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.800
is the new application-based
firewall that's built in OS X.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.610
It was our ongoing effort to
simplify the complexities of

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.540
firewall for the average user.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:58.270
I still am amazed at how many
times we're in conversations,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.820
even in very large organizations,
where there are so many

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:06.300
challenges to folks understanding
complexities of firewalls.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.410
And that's just the case, right?

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.620
It's so complex.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.420
But yet we're expecting
as IT folks for our users,

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.960
our end users, to protect themselves

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.070
It's either going to be done by policy,
by you all enforcement,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.270
but Apple takes the extra
effort to simplify the process

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.700
for kind of the rest of us.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.700
Now,
keep in mind that when we did on Leopard,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.810
we brought the
application-based firewall,

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.840
so you're doing that leveraging
through system preferences.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.200
And on Leopard,
we still have IPFW on the client,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.680
so many of you were looking at kind of
larger-scale deployment and management

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.700
of the firewall on Leopard client.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.310
And the approach many of you have taken,
which is the right way to do that,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.910
and that is you're still managing
and pushing out those rule sets and

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.210
leveraging the built-in IPFW on the box,
rather than the individual themselves

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.570
managing the application-based firewall.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.420
And on the server,
that's management on the server admin,

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.080
of course, that's the full granular
control of IPFW on the servers.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.000
Maintaining system updates.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.580
Again, some of these seem so
simple and so natural,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.110
but we always want to be sure that
folks are aware of and fully leverage

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:32.000
the additional updates and advancements
of security updates coming from Apple.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.730
We wouldn't be putting out security
updates if it wasn't something that

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.890
we truly felt is in your betterment.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.440
We're trying to address
identified issues that have arisen

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.580
either that we've identified,
external entities have identified.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.440
So, as we might say,
heed those security notifications

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:55.040
from us and update those systems
after you're doing some validation

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.690
internally in your organization.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:03.320
The key thing is, the longer you wait
between those updates,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:03.320
the longer you're going to have to
wait for the security updates to come.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.740
So, when you're doing security updates,
when they're available, again,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.160
is that time that you're potentially
exposing yourselves to vulnerabilities

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.520
once a given vulnerability in a service
or an application has been known,

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.220
the longer you wait,
the longer you expose that system.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.300
Of course the tools in our case.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.700
Many folks are doing some incredible
scripting in their environments

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.270
to do a lot of the management
and we'll talk a little bit

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.700
later about the security guides.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.190
Many of you, if you've looked at them,
we've added the additional

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.200
command line equivalents for
each tweaking the configuration

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.700
on the client and the server.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.910
This should enhance those scripts
that you've already developed and are

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.700
pushing out either through third-party
tools or remote desktop for tweaking

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.700
and maintenance on those systems.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.700
So, as I kind of hit some
of those highlights,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:02.700
let me bring Kim on to walk you through
thinking critically about security

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.880
and how you should be formulating
security guidance or security by

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.700
policy within your organization.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.490
So, Kim?

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.300
Hi, I'm Kim Hersh from the
National Security Agency.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.050
And as Shawn said,
I'm going to talk to you a little today

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.300
about thinking critically about security.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:32.240
What I want to do is just
give you a way to kind of

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:46.000
[Transcript missing]

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:56.470
Just get a good grip on thinking
about security and getting into,

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:05.840
really into thinking about it and just a
step-by-step way of locking down systems.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.560
Most people want the step-by-step
way of locking down systems.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.990
They want it to be just kind of
a no-brainer way of doing it.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.010
the...

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.520
When we develop the
configuration guidance,

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:27.560
we design it to be kind of step-by-step
guidance to securing a system and

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.320
it comes from the best knowledge
we have on the security features

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.820
of a system and it's designed using
standard security design principles.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:43.970
And, but like I said,
most people want it to be a no-brainer,

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.500
but does one size really fit all?

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.940
Well, not really.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.880
There's too many varied environments,
differing requirements for a single

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.140
guidance document to fit all needs.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.590
And trying to write several documents
to capture a majority of needs

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.400
would still not satisfy everyone.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.760
So the approach we've taken is simply
to tell how to lock down everything

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.340
as securely as possible and to give
some of the ramifications for not

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.060
doing so where we possibly can.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.690
And this allows every organization
to use the guide to develop an

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:22.160
individual security plan for locking
down their own systems according

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.780
to their own particular needs.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:30.780
Okay, so using the guide means
knowing how to adapt them.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.920
Adapting them to fit organizational need,
organizational policy,

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.550
sensitivity level of the data,
and balancing these needs

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:45.060
and the easy use against the
security risk to the systems.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.390
All right,
so there are general principles

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.540
that are followed when developing
security configuration guidance.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.440
These are the same principles that
should be followed when adapting that

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.630
guidance for use in specific environment.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.900
Let's look at the security principles.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.660
We have separation of function.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.740
If at all possible,
you should have a separate

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.890
firewall between the outside
networks and your internal network.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.630
I know a lot of times in a
mobile environment these days

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.870
that's not always possible.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.770
Email and web servers,
those should be separate.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.630
Also, the user database should reside on
its own server whenever possible.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:34.150
Having all these services
reside separately means that if

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:34.150
someone should compromise one

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:42.100
has a strong authentication requirement,
and he's not necessarily going to

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.800
compromise your entire network.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.460
Having good separation between
the services by putting them on

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:49.460
separate servers and having strong
authentication required between the

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:49.460
servers adds another layer of security.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.000
Never surf the web with
your admin account.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.700
This cannot ever be said enough.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.420
Use admin only for
administrative functions.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.440
Encryption provides yet
another layer of security.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.790
No remote login should be done
without some sort of encryption.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.590
Any services, especially network services
that are not absolutely needed,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.600
should be stopped on the system.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.200
This is true also of any
unused code in the system.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:29.130
One such case,
even though it's not a service, is IPv6.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.200
IPv6 is currently started automatically.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:40.420
Many organizations have currently not
yet switched over to IPv6 addresses,

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:46.090
and so if you're not using it,
go ahead and turn it off.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.130
Kernel extensions.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.940
They can also provide
an attacker a window,

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.550
so if there are any unused or
unneeded extensions in the system,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.430
they should be removed.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.210
Also, they can be a good place to remove
capabilities from the system,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.500
such as the ability to
use USB flash drives.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.880
You must be remembered, however,
that kernel-less extensions may be

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.500
restored any time the system is updated.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.500
So, if any extensions are
removed from the system,

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:22.690
they should be removed each time
an update is done to the system.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.470
Choose the most locked-down
configuration you can while

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:36.580
still providing the functionality
that's required by your users.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:44.390
Always lock down anything
that is not absolutely needed.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:51.400
And last but not least,
you want to always give least privilege.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.800
This includes for the users,
for file systems, for groups,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.200
anything on the system, group ownership.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.450
You want to give the least privilege
needed for everything to work properly

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:13.980
and for the user to be able to still
do what he needs to do on the system.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.550
Okay, now I'm going to show you how
we go about using those security

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:26.260
principles to develop guidance
by taking a look at the iPhone.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:32.100
Right now, we have

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:36.720
We are starting to look at
guidance for the iPhone.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.810
Eventually,
we're going to develop a guidance

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:47.060
document with the goal that
probably a federal desktop core

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:53.090
configuration guide will be developed.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.050
Under the Enterprise Environment.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.900
But, of course,
the Enterprise Environment's not out yet.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:05.180
So meanwhile, using just our standard
security principles,

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.450
we can at least somewhat secure
the iPhone just as it comes

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.830
right out of the box right now.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:19.390
So, first, you turn off access whenever
you are not actively using it,

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.000
such as when the device is sitting
idle on a desk or in a car.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.600
This reduces the risk that an
attacker will access the device

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.000
remotely without your knowledge.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.080
Next, set the iPhone to always
ask to join a network,

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.740
rather than joining automatically
by toggling the Ask to

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.000
Join Network switch to on.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:44.000
You should only join your iPhone
to networks you know and trust.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.360
Only enable the Bluetooth communications
when it is explicitly being

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.970
used to pair the device with a
Bluetooth headset or hands-free device.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.670
This limits the chance that an
attacker could take advantage

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.930
of the Bluetooth connection
to attack your iPhone.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.270
Airplane mode should be enabled
whenever taking the iPhone into a

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.550
sensitive area where all wireless
functionality should be disabled.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:14.520
Obviously a good example
would be on an airplane.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.780
Set the auto lock option to five
minutes or less in order to mitigate

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.340
unauthorized access to the device
when it is not in use or in case

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.160
the device is left unattended.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:33.560
Again, setting a passcode for the device
helps to reduce the chance of

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.200
unauthorized access to the device.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.270
In order for the passcode
to be truly effective,

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:43.160
the required passcode option
must be set to immediately.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:51.150
Now remember, if you set this passcode,
make sure you know what the passcode is.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.200
If you don't,
it's going to get locked up.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:01.120
You're going to get a little message
that you're going to have to contact

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.600
your carrier to be able to unlock it.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:09.130
And suddenly we're going to have a
whole bunch of people in the room

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:15.420
calling AT&T and AT&T is going to
wonder why we suddenly have a room full,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.200
you know, a hundred people or so
calling them from Santa Fe,

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:20.200
New York.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.200
And then you're going to have
to get a message from the AT&T.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.900
And then you're going to
have to get a message from

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.200
San Francisco with locked-up phones.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.190
So please know your passcode
if you set this option.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.570
Okay, using VPNs for internet
connections whenever possible

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.800
is strongly recommended.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.160
They should always be configured
to use L2TP in conjunction

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.880
with IPSec if at all possible.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:53.870
PPTP alone should be avoided because
there are known security problems.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.900
The RSA SecureID feature
provides token-based,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:05.840
two-factor authentication between the
user device and the remote VPN server.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.600
This option provides
additional protection and

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.080
should be enabled if possible.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.210
If the RSA SecureID feature
cannot be used,

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:20.760
a strong password should be used instead.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:24.880
Password strength is an
old topic at this point.

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.500
Everybody knows you need
to use strong passwords.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.340
There's plenty of guides
out there on the internet,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.540
everywhere else about
what password strength is,

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.880
so go find them, do it.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:44.240
PPTP is not recommended at all,
but if there's no other choice,

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.250
it's better than nothing.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.100
If it's used, make sure the encryption
level is set to maximum.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.620
Advertising the type
of device you're using,

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.650
an iPhone, just gives attackers a head
start on knowing how to

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.540
approach attacking your device.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:10.180
It also notifies them when the iPhone
is active and available based on when

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.390
an email was sent from your iPhone.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.380
If all of your emails
have the same signature,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.660
attackers will not know whether
they came from your iPhone,

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.950
your work machine or somewhere else.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.330
So they won't know if your
phone's available to be targeted.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.010
So change it.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:32.190
When setting up mail service,
it's recommended to set it up to

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.550
communicate over SSL if possible.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.440
The default on the phone is
set to communicate over SSL,

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.550
so don't override the
option if you can use it.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.890
If you set the show my
caller ID switch to off,

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.370
your phone number will not
show up on other caller IDs.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:58.080
So if that's important to you,
you should set that option.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.770
Toggle the SIM pin option to
on and create an eight-digit

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.670
pin to lock down the SIM card.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.380
This will provide an extra layer
of protection by helping to prevent

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:15.770
unauthorized use of the SIM in the iPhone
or in any other GSM cellular phone.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:20.220
No phone calls can be made or
received when the SIM is locked.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.370
And as I said, remember your pin.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:31.050
Also, there are a number of known
exploits not just under Safari,

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.860
but with all web browsers.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.740
Because of this,
Safari should be tightened

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.580
down as much as possible.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.630
Unfortunately,
there's a limited amount you can do

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:45.520
to lock down Safari on the iPhone.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.760
But you should use what little
bit is available to lock it

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.910
down as much as possible.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:57.830
So disable JavaScript and plug-ins,
enable pop-up blocking.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.960
Toggle the Accept Cookie option
to From Visited.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.720
The Accept Cookies option
should never be set to Always.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.680
And every time
Safari settings are changed,

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:16.390
the phone should be rebooted or restarted
to make sure the settings are accepted.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.150
Also, cookies,
history and cache should be cleared

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:24.550
each time Safari is used and every
time a secure connection is made.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.200
The phone should be also here too,
the phone should be restarted

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.870
after these are cleared to make
sure the settings were applied.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:41.430
Okay, now that we've gone over
what the settings should be,

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:44.270
we're gonna go over a few
best practices for using,

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.140
carrying around, you know,
having your iPhone.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:55.880
Once a phone is left unattended,
if you still have it after that,

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.590
it will be suspect.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.100
It may have been compromised.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.070
So you don't know if your data
has been seen by somebody else,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.090
you don't know if
something's been put on it,

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:16.100
you just don't know what has happened
to that phone while it was left alone.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:21.800
Always use the provided applications
to download and play media,

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.480
not third-party applications.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.760
Third-party applications are
from unknown sources and they

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.370
may introduce additional risks.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.360
Clearing the history in
Google Maps clears all

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.730
addresses in the history,
except for the last one entered.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:44.780
So,
if you care about people knowing about

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:49.630
any of your addresses on the phone,
that last address won't be cleared

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.360
until a new address is entered,
so you might just want to put in some new

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.100
arbitrary address to clear that address.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.220
Don't hack the iPhone,
including jailbreaking,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.480
fake activating and unlocking the phone.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.560
All the sources to do
this are unverified,

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.390
untrusted sources and they could
introduce malicious code onto

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:18.100
your phone and could compromise
any personal data on your phone

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.100
and could even render it useless.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.130
And installing software from
sources other than those provided

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.100
through the official sources have
the same risks as the packages

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.890
provided for hacking the phone.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:37.160
Best Practices for Browsing with
Safari Browsing the internet is where

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.660
some of the greatest security risks lie.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.420
Some of the best ways to mitigate
security risks are in how you use the

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.600
device when you're on the internet.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.200
Make sure that whenever a web page
requires a login that it uses SSL.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:57.500
or that it says HTTPS instead of HTTP.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.930
If it doesn't, don't log in.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:06.540
Also make sure that SSL is being used
whenever sensitive personal information,

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.040
such as credit card numbers,
are being exchanged.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:15.270
There's going to be a small gray lock
at the end of the address to indicate

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.100
that the connection is encrypted.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:23.100
Don't just click continue if the site
certificate is not properly validated.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.560
When a message comes up that
indicates the certificate is invalid,

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.100
there's a reason for that.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.320
Make sure that any site with
which you are exchanging sensitive

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.460
information has a valid cert.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:40.030
Make sure you log off and navigate
to a blank page when you are

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.800
exiting a secure link in Safari.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.140
Don't just quit Safari without
logging off first.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.090
And always log off and quit
Safari between secure sessions.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.800
Okay, storing your sensitive information.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:01.050
Currently there is no way to
encrypt stored data on the iPhone.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.710
And though the iPhone is a very handy
way to keep a whole lot of information

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:11.800
in one place to carry with you,
remember things,

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:16.920
it's also a very handy way to give out
a whole lot of personal information in

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.780
one package if you lose it or it gets
stolen or it's compromised when it's not.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:28.470
So sensitive personal information or
company information should never be

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:34.070
stored on the iPhone or should at the
very least be kept to a bare minimum.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.790
This includes information
stored in the notes application.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:41.320
And it includes things like
usernames and passwords,

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:44.620
account numbers,
personal data and proprietary

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.590
information among others.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.910
Don't go putting your credit cards
on there and storing them because you

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:52.780
want to keep them in a safe place.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.310
and then you don't have to carry
your credit cards because...

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.400
There's no way to encrypt them.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.400
It's a very dangerous thing to do,
let's just put it that way.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.400
And so it's taking pictures of them
and keeping pictures of them on there.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.270
I've heard that that's
something people do too.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.550
Any of your sensitive data
is wide open on there.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.900
Clear out all personal data
after browsing the internet.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:26.070
To make sure this takes effect,
as I said before,

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:29.900
the phone must be restarted
after clearing these settings.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.860
As stated previously,
this should be done not

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.560
only after browsing overall,
but it should be done after

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.590
each secure session before
beginning another web session.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:46.320
When connecting to a Wi-Fi access point,
you should always choose the strongest

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.850
wireless security available to you.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:54.450
WPA2 provides the strongest
security available on the iPhone.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.240
You should always choose
this if it's available,

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.050
use the Enterprise Edition when
it's possible,

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.770
and choose EAPTLS or
TTLS for authentication.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.750
When WPA2 is not available,
WPA should be used as the

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.900
next best available choice.

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:16.960
The enterprise option should be used over
the personal or pre-shared key option.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:20.620
The enterprise option
requires more infrastructure,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.840
but it's more secure.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:29.700
If PSK must be used, again,
choose a strong password.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:37.210
Use only, oh, WEP, avoid using it.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:44.050
Only use it if WPA2 and
WPA are both unavailable.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.500
Choose a strong password
if you have to use it,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.660
and avoid performing any
sensitive transactions.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.780
Do not connect to unknown
wireless networks.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:01.300
A good example of this
is free public Wi-Fi.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:09.330
It's a rogue ad hoc wireless
network that maliciously propagates

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.830
itself across connecting hosts.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.070
Many commercial and private networks do
not implement proper wireless security,

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.600
leaving them open for connection.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.340
Even though they are open for connection,
connecting to them without permission

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:31.400
and proper authorization is unlawful,
and it also leaves you open to attack.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:39.990
Disconnecting from your
wireless access point when your

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:39.990
connectivity is no longer needed.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:45.400
helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized
remote access or exploitation.

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:50.160
It also has the added benefit of
helping save your battery life.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:58.730
Okay, so summing up.

00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.730
When securing or even
just using a system,

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:05.260
Such as your iPhone, your laptop,
anything, always applying basic security

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:10.120
principles can help keep your
system a lot more secure.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:15.180
So, even though we've got these guides
out and you should use them,

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:20.420
a lot of this is just thinking
about security by using

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.110
basic security principles.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.680
Take these principles, think about them,
use them,

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.770
always apply them to your system,
always apply them to the

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:35.040
way you use your system.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:41.650
Using guidance will help,
but even without this guidance,

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:45.500
if you apply the principles,
go through the system,

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.630
you'll be able to lock down a lot
of things in the system on your own.

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:53.600
And remember,
the user has a greater responsibility

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.800
than ever to secure the machine.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.390
Securing a machine or device
frequently means disabling features

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.720
that people insist they must have.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.750
So sometimes the security
is in the hands of the user.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.420
When locking down a system,
we always end up having to

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.240
strike a balance between
functionality and security.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:17.870
And Shawn, I'll hand it back to you.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.650
So right about now,
probably at least half of you in this

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.990
room are scratching your heads saying,
"Can I actually use my system

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:32.660
after I do all this?" Keep in
mind that a lot of this is,

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.300
again, kind of across the board guidance.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.790
We keep mentioning about making
it apply to your environment,

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:42.300
to where you're using your system.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:48.620
So if you took your system and
applied every aspect of this,

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:53.510
it may indeed be unusable
for the functions,

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:57.300
for the services that you need.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:03.370
So again, these are just that,
guidance about how to further fortify

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.300
various services or general systems.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.120
Keep that in mind as you go forward.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.660
So, as I mentioned, And...

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.720
We always want to be sure that you
have ongoing understanding of where to

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.660
get this guidance on a regular basis.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.540
Share with you a little bit of the
guidance that we've done in the past.

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.270
Hopefully many of you are aware of the
fact that we started a collaborative

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:33.720
effort with NSA on security guidance for
client and server back in the 10-3 days.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.420
That's where it was predominantly
generated within NSA.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.040
We were part of the
vetting process of that.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.580
We moved forward with this collaboration,
provided guidance documents directly

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:50.880
from Apple that were collaboration
between us again and NSA for 10-4.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.530
Then when we came and just
recently released for 10-5,

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:04.990
those documents were many folks from NSA,
from DISA, NIST and from Apple were kind

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.260
of the core group of this.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.270
There were several
folks within government.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.900
There were a couple of folks in
commercial who were additional

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.770
vetters of the document that came out.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.630
Keep in mind that the release that
we just put out recently is kind

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.500
of the first release for Leopard.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.380
We're going to be taking some
additional public review part of the

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:30.630
NIST process and the DISA is some
additional external public review.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:35.400
We'll be bringing that input back in,
working both that input

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.250
and some of our additional
refinement of this first release.

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:41.740
So we'll be bringing that in for
the second release for Leopard.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.550
And then there'll be a subsequent
release or an update to this guide,

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.050
again for Leopard itself.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.810
And Kim had mentioned that work is
already underway for the phone itself.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:56.750
So if you are in an environment
where you need some very specific

00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:00.730
guidance on these devices,
whether it be desktop,

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.570
server or the phone,
the best place to go for this is

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.750
references on the on snack site at NSA.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.060
But at Apple, we have a.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.340
Website where a lot of
these resources are as well.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.400
And the second down there is a
security configuration guides.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.480
That's a new site.

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:20.080
Many of you probably
aren't aware of that,

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.330
but at Apple dot com slash support
slash security slash guides is

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:29.260
kind of a new website for the
aggregation of all of these guides.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.750
So that's kind of your landing
spot for looking for these

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.480
guidance documents going forward.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.480
There's a lot of resources,
whether you're in the I.T.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:39.140
Space, whether you're the developer,
whether you're just kind

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.260
of looking at information.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:40.360
Related.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.770
To security updates and
OS ten and of course,

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:49.160
subsequent updates for phone the iPhone
and all these are very good resources for

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.920
you going forward relative to guidance.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.420
So now I think at the end,
bring Kim back on.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.160
And those of you that have some
additional questions that we can

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.470
help you through at this point,
we'd be more than happy to answer

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.360
questions related to general guidance,
security guidance in your

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:10.260
environment or specific questions
if we can help you navigate.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:14.650
now on particular issues you may have.
