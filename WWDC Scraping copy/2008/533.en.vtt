00:00:20.700 --> 00:01:56.200
[Transcript missing]

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.120
Now, of course,
you want to take this wiki and actually

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.600
make it look like the rest of your site.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.750
You're going to want to
take it and add custom tags,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.410
as I discussed earlier,
to allow through the whitelist.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.770
We actually provide at least a
dozen professionally designed

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.550
themes that look great,
but maybe you want to do one

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.560
that actually matches the
rest of your web presence,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.690
and we'll get a little bit
into how to do that as well.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.340
You may want to add links to the
sidebar of your group homepage,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.420
and we'll discuss that
a little bit as well.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.040
and David are the two people who
are going to be working on the data.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.770
And lastly,
you may want to connect the wiki to your

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.080
external applications so that you can
get data into the wiki and pull data out.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.080
And we'll be having a great
demo of that as our last demo.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.120
So the first way

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.030
Some customization in the
Wiki without having to write any

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.440
code or do any manual configuration
is just to use the Settings page.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.380
This is where you'll choose between
those dozens of great themes.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.920
You can upload a banner of your own.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.040
We'll scale it for you.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.680
You can create a sidebar which performs
a search based on any tag you want.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.170
And of course,
you can enable podcasting in the blog.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.600
That's kind of basic,
so the thing we're going to get

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.580
into now is how to do some more
advanced things with the server.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.580
And the first thing that you may
want to do is allow additional

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.210
tags through the HTML scrubber.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.520
And this is going to allow content
that normally would get scrubbed

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.690
out when you save the pages to disk.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.760
And that could include things
like Flash plugins with video,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.500
iframes with content from other sites,
JavaScript, and custom tags.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.580
So I don't know if you can read
the JavaScript dialogue there,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.470
but it says, I have your session ID,
and it lists the session ID,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.220
and then says pwned.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.840
So how many of you here have
heard of cross-site scripting?

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.700
A few of you.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.230
About a third of them
server engineers over there.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.030
Cross-site scripting refers to
the ability of one Wiki user,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.630
in this particular case,
to run a script on somebody else's

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.340
machine using their context.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.690
So it's definitely something you'll want
to watch out for when you're allowing

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.210
things like plugins and scripting that
you may not want people to be able to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.880
run code on other people's machines.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.250
That's why we keep it off by default,
but provide a way for you to turn it on.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.530
So the next way you might
actually want to customize your

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.870
wiki is by using a custom theme.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.970
And that actually allows you to
change the presentation of your

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.880
wiki and add functionality as well.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.210
And to illustrate how
a theme actually works,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.760
I'm going to go over what
actually comprises any page that

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.150
comes out of the wiki server.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.490
So the first thing we send out in the
HTML are link tags for the theme's CSS.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.060
So this is where you can place
any of your color choices,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.470
borders, anything that basically defines
the look and feel and makes it

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.620
match up with the color palette
and general theme of your site.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.610
Okay.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.290
The next thing we send
out is the system CSS,

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.210
and this defines the basic page metrics
for everything from the basic page

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.250
layout to all of our JavaScript controls,
such as dialogs, pop-ups,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.980
the WYSIWYG editor.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.940
We send that after the theme CSS so
that it's a little bit more difficult

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.630
to accidentally override something
that our functionality depends on.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.870
But there is actually a
way to get around that,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.060
and there's a couple methods,
and James will get into that later on.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.550
The next thing we send out
is the system JavaScript,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.600
and this concludes all of the
interactivity that you see on the Wiki.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.460
So the WYSIWYG editor, the tagging,
comments, history,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.060
basically all the functionality
with which you interact with the

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.570
Wiki Server is sent out at this point,
and it's all added via

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.520
JavaScript after the page loads.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.210
Next, we send out script tags for
your theme's JavaScript.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.390
This means that you can put any
JavaScript in your theme and it will

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.600
get automatically added to every page
that comes out of the Wiki Server.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.290
And finally, we of course send out the
content of the page itself.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.200
So that's what makes up a page,
but what makes up a theme?

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.410
It's basically a bundle.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.270
It's a folder full of various files
that describe the theme's look

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.520
and feel and its functionality.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.230
The first of those files is actually
a thumbnail so that when the user

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.400
chooses a theme in the settings page,
they'll be able to see a picture of

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.350
what the theme is going to look like.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.340
The next thing we include is
a screen.css and a print.css.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.220
Those define the print and screen
stylesheets for your theme.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.300
Next, we have a theme property list.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.900
This contains metadata about the theme,
such as a desired

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.290
banner size to scale to,
a display name, and a list of sidebars.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.510
and finally,
you can include any JavaScript you

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.860
want and anything with a .js
extension will get added to every

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.380
page coming out of the Wiki Server.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.220
But to back up just a little bit,
I'm going to get into the different

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.920
sidebar types that you can actually
specify in your theme's property list.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.560
So there's different sidebar sections.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.140
The one that's probably most
common for people to use is

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.040
a search sidebar section.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.120
And in this,
you can define any kind of search you

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.890
want based on keywords or tags or both.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.860
Define the sorter order,
and it will automatically populate

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.660
the sidebar on the group home page and
reload it without refreshing the page.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.580
You can also add a list of
static links to your theme.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.400
So this means that you can have
links to other parts of your site,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.440
basically any links that are outside
of the wiki that you just want to add

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.730
and have them show up statically every
time you load the group homepage.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.590
There's a calendar sidebar section,
which always displays upcoming

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.340
events from that group's calendar.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.690
And then, of course,
we add an admin sidebar if

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.720
somebody is logged in as an
administrator or a group owner.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.910
And this provides the links to
the settings page as well as a

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.720
way to edit tags in bulk and find
pages that users have deleted.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.680
So the first thing you may want
to do in your theme is define CSS.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.580
And that's what allows you to turn this--

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.060
and David are the two people who
are going to be doing the demo.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.330
I'm hoping you're going to do something
a little more easy on the eyes,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.030
but for the sake of the demo,
I wanted to do something

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.200
a little bit drastic.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.210
I also tend to be a little snarky.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.030
To show something a
little bit more realistic,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.510
I'm going to bring up
James Craig to demo CSS in a theme.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.290
So can I get the demo machine?

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.590
All right.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.300
So I've got my standard install of
Leopard Wiki Server running here.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.290
And I'm going to pull up Safari.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.400
I'm going to size this window
back down a little bit.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.590
So I pull up Safari and I've
got a list of groups here.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.050
So I'm going to go to the first group.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.090
And I want to customize
this a little bit.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.940
Now, John mentioned that you can
do anything you want with CSS.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.440
And we have some documentation out there.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.200
It's the first result in Google for
extending your Wiki Server.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.300
I encourage you to read it.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.580
One of the ways that you can
do it is to start with our

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.520
default wireframe Wiki theme.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.960
And that allows you to do
pretty much anything you want.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.020
It's kind of a
start-from-scratch CSS theme.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.240
But the other thing that you can do,
and this might be more

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.130
beneficial for you guys,
is to take one of our existing

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.830
shipping themes and just
change a few properties of it.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.720
Essentially piggyback off of
our CSS and change a few things.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.510
And so I'm going to pull up Dashcode.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:27.290
Just to show you what
this theme looks like.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.340
So I've got my theme1.wikitheme.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.180
This is in the sample code
that you can download for this

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.390
session on the conference site.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.510
It's also on the ADC site.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.740
And among other things in there,
we've got our preview PNG,

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.620
and that's just a little thumbnail that's
going to show up on the settings page.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.380
We've also got the theme plist,
and this is just an XML file.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.540
Now, what John mentioned,
you can do a lot more with this,

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.220
but I've kind of stripped
it down to the bare minimum.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.580
And what we've got in there,
we've got a version.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.750
We've got a display name,
and that shows up along with a

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.960
thumbnail on the Settings page.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.680
And we have this name,
which is just a unique identifier.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.140
And it can really be anything you want,
as long as it doesn't conflict

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.810
with one of your other themes.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.160
The other things that we have in
this theme folder are print CSS,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.020
and this one just
imports the default CSS.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.640
You might need print CSS, for example,
if you have a theme that's got a

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.280
black background with white text.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.850
Well, it turns out that backgrounds
don't print very well,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.350
don't print on most browsers by default,
so white text doesn't look very

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.680
good on a white piece of paper.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.400
So you can change those CSS.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400
It's a different media type.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.800
You can change it and do
what you want with it.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.310
In this case,
we're just using the default one.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.160
Now, this next one is Screen CSS.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.580
So this is what's going to show up
on your iPhones and your desktop

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.270
browsers and stuff like that.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.110
And this first line up at the
top just imports the default

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.700
styles for our existing theme.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.700
So as you can see, we've already got this
existing theme in there.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.800
It happens to be called Horizon Blue.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.740
I'm just importing all
the CSS from that one.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.310
And in addition to that,
I'm importing a couple of local styles

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.900
just to change a couple of properties.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.960
and that particular file is this
one right here called mystyles.css.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.440
So this is all we're
gonna do for the demo.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.290
Just change a couple lines of CSS.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:35.780
So the first one defines a
background color for the page.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.400
This is kind of a hex
value for a slight yellow.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.480
And the next one,
we're actually going to rearrange

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.890
the order of the columns.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.400
So I'm actually going to close this
because this isn't the live file

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.930
and I'm going to open the live file.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.180
We're going to edit for the server.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.670
So it's just that one,
there's a couple lines of code.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.670
Now again, this first line changes
the background color.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.750
So because I'm logged in as an admin,
I'm gonna go to the settings page.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.050
And I'm going to edit the settings page.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.130
Choose the new theme.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.300
All your custom themes show
up down here at the bottom.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.840
We've already got these two installed.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.320
So here's my thumbnail.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.370
Here's the display name.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.420
I'm going to choose that one.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.790
Click okay.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.480
You can already see in this preview mode
that it's changed the background color.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.790
And that's pretty bright
yellow on that monitor.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.300
Once I've saved it,
you can see it's changed

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.880
for every page on the site.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.180
Here it is on the blog,
even though there's no content.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.310
Here it is on the Wiki page.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.310
It's across the site,
but you might have noticed that

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.800
the default order of these main
two columns here hasn't changed.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.300
So I'm looking at the code,
and this is the live code.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.200
And I'm thinking, okay, well,
this is column secondary,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.420
which is the second one here.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.330
And I'll show you how I figured
out what those classes are.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.580
But I'm not sure what's going on.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.080
So there's this preference in Safari.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.110
If you go to the Advanced tab in Safari,
you can show the

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.920
Develop menu in the menu bar.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.510
And once you enable that,
then you get this secondary

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.320
function on a mouse click,
or on a secondary mouse click,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.060
you can say Inspect Element.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.920
And this pulls up the WebKit Inspector.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.700
It's a really cool debugging tool.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.580
And I'm going to click
on this DOM node here.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.140
That's the column secondary.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.420
So, again, that's the sidebar contents.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:59.800
[Transcript missing]

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.660
So if we look at the rules,
we've got one called

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.930
groupHome.columnSecondary.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.500
That's the main part of this.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.990
And it's set to float right.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.560
GroupHome.columnSecondary.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.680
And it's set to float left.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.230
And because the system
styles come after this,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.970
then it wins in the order of the cascade.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.140
So, in order for me to override this,
I'm going to have to make a CSS rule

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.390
that is more specific than that
other one that has two classes.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:34.390
So, instead,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:39.920
This is a div with a class of
column secondary that is in another

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.940
thing with a class of group home.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.290
And that's a more specific rule.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.780
And I'm going to do the same
thing for the primary column.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:51.180
I'm going to save it and
kill the WebKit inspector.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.580
Refresh the page.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.250
And it flips the columns.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.280
So in case you're running into any -- oh,
thank you.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.640
So in case you're running
into any CSS debugging,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.180
you can go in and check out
the order of the cascade.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.400
John asked me not to say CSS specificity,
but that's the word to search for

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.110
if you want to know more than that.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.750
Thanks a lot.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.900
Thanks, James.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.820
So as James mentioned,
the WebKit Inspector and some of the

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:33.900
other similar tools on other browsers
are really useful for debugging CSS.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:38.110
And you'll find it invaluable when
something in your CSS isn't showing up.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.990
You can find out exactly why
and how to be more specific.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.770
So that's a great tool for you to use.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.440
Now, you may want to do something more
than just change the presentation,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.500
change the look and feel.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.690
You may want to actually
add functionality.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:17:02.790
We had somebody in the lab yesterday that
wanted to add server status to the wiki.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.660
Things like that are where you'll
actually want to add custom JavaScript.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.530
And this is where you can add additional
functionality and markup to your pages.

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.620
And the way you do this is
by overriding a method that

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.170
we implement called prepare.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:30.430
Prepare is a little bit different from
Onload in that Onload will actually only

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.430
run once the page is entirely rendered
and all of the images have been loaded.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.290
We found in our usage that sometimes
that would make the toolbars and

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.760
some of our additional functionality
that we were adding to the page via

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.800
JavaScript to show up seconds or,
if somebody has a page of 100 images,

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.300
maybe minutes after
the page has displayed.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.070
So the prepare method will
actually run as soon as the

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.940
document object is available.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.280
There is a method called
onDOMContentLoaded

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.340
that is fairly similar,
but it doesn't work on all the browsers.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.580
So prepare is a great
cross-browser way in the wiki

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.520
To add content to your page immediately
as soon as it's visible to the user,

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.540
and that way they don't see the lag
that is typical in adding things

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.150
to the page using JavaScript.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.000
So after you get called
with your prepare method,

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:22.020
you use a W3C DOM to modify your
document to add whatever you want,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.710
remove things, move them around,
add your own functionality.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.880
And then, of course,
you can add your own AJAX hooks to

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.260
pull data from servers if you need to.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.140
We include several JavaScript libraries
to help you with this and

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.510
to make your life and,
of course, ours as well a lot easier.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.140
Those libraries include
Prototype and Scriptaculous.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.700
You can use Prototype to
traverse a DOM really easily,

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.460
and I'll show you an example in a second.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:53.250
You can use Scriptaculous Builder
to build elements with a lot

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.260
less code than if you were just
creating nodes manually in the DOM.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.860
And you can even use Scriptaculous
Effects to animate in some

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.520
of your new functionality.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.910
if you want to have some added pizzazz.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.130
To show you an example of
how this might be done,

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.480
I have some code here that
adds an additional link to

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.830
the footer of every page.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.150
So the first thing I'm doing
is I'm stashing away the

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.670
original prepare method.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.260
We, of course,
implement prepare ourselves so that

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.500
we can add the toolbars and set
up the WYSIWYG functionality and

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.340
everything else that's interactive.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.560
So before you override
our prepare method,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.460
you'll, of course,
want to stash away the original one,

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.380
and that's what we're doing
in this first line here.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.200
Then we implement our own prepare method,
and the first thing we do in

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.020
that prepare method is call the
original one that we stashed away.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.940
And that will add all of the toolbars
and everything just like before.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.910
The next thing we're doing is
using prototype to traverse the

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.880
DOM and find the first unordered
list under the page footer element.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.310
So this is an example as to how
the included libraries make life

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.960
a lot easier for you in finding
a particular part of the page,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.680
traversing to it and adding
something to it yourself.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.810
And then I actually
said to use the W3C DOM,

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.880
and I'm cheating a little
bit here for brevity's sake.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:17.640
I'm using inner HTML to just add another
list item to that unordered list in

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.010
the footer with a link to Apple's site.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.780
To show a little bit
more of this in practice,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.760
I'm going to bring James back up for a
demo of custom JavaScript in a theme.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.770
Thanks again, John.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.900
So we've got the same default install.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.190
Standard install.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.140
I'm going to bring up Safari.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.190
And we'll go to our second
group here with the hypno-toad.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.580
And I've got this blog that
I think is filled with terribly,

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.780
terribly interesting content.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.930
And I have a ton of readers,
and they all think it's

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.580
terribly interesting,
too, and they want to share it.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.580
And so I want to add a dig link.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.870
You guys are familiar with the
social networking linking site,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.920
Digg, D-I-G-G.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:10.180
So I want to add a dig link to every
one of these web log entry pages.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.950
Now, I don't want to put it on
this main blog listing here.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.700
I don't want to put it on the wiki page.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.960
I don't want to put it
on my calendar page.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.100
I just want to put it on
the individual blog entry.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.370
So I'm going to click
on one of those entries.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.150
And you can see that I've just
got a regular wiki page here.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.850
It's got the title and some content and
an image in the toolbar and paginator

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.230
control and the comment functionality.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.830
It doesn't have a dig link yet.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.840
I don't want to change anything
about the way this page looks.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.300
I just want to add some JavaScript.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.280
So I'm going to show you how to do that.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.280
So I'm going to pull up Dashcode again.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.050
and we'll move to the second theme.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.360
Now this one is just like before.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.600
We've got a preview thumbnail
of what it's going to look like.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.430
We've got our plist that has --
it's just stripped down to the bare

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.190
minimum because I don't need to
do anything with custom sidebars.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.690
I'm going to have a banner on this one.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.190
So it's just got the version.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.300
It's got a unique
identifier for the name.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.350
And it's got the display name that's
going to show up on the settings

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.420
page when we choose the theme.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.350
And again, we've got our print CSS.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:25.160
It just defaults to import
the shipping print CSS.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.450
We've got our screen CSS,
and this one is almost

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.660
the same as the last one.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.240
It imports the Horizon Green theme
because that's the one that we're

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.120
using on this particular blog.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.590
And it does nothing else.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.560
Like I said,
I don't want to change any of the CSS.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.320
I'm just going to import all the
CSS from one of the existing themes.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.580
And so the only thing special that's
in this theme directory is this other

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.940
file over here called adddiglink.js.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.850
It can be called anything, but it does.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.910
As long as it has a .js extension,
then the Wiki Server is going to

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.210
know that it's a JavaScript file,
and it's going to

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.760
include it on every page.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:06.610
So as John showed you,
we've got our original prepare function.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.600
We store it away.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.010
And then we override that
original prepare function

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.340
and execute the original one.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.350
So this is what -- what this is going
to do is it's going to set up our

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.440
toolbars and it's going to set up the
dialogs and the comment functionality.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.390
It's basically going to keep the
rest of the Wiki Server working.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:27.360
And then in addition to that,
you can add your own code.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.100
So all the rest of this
is in a conditional.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.110
And this conditional,
I'll explain the shorthand here.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.600
This is using the
prototype dollar method,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.550
or dollar function to get
anything with an ID of WikiD.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.860
and Jack So how did I find this?

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.880
I'm going to go back
to the wiki page here.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.040
And I'm on the web log entry page.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.030
I'm going to inspect the element.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.380
I'm going to go up and
look at the body tag.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.200
And this body tag,
you can see right here,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.700
has an ID of WikiD and a class
that includes web log entry.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.580
And so that's what I'm going to do.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.960
Any page that's just a web log entry,
because I don't want to

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.830
run this on the calendar,
I don't want to run this

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.640
on the main Wiki page,
I don't want to run this on

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.100
the main web log listing page.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.280
It's only going to run
on this particular page.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.900
And so the next thing that's
running inside this conditional,

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.320
I set up a dig link that just
goes off the dig site and uses

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.200
whatever the window location URL is.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.120
And then I use some more shorthand here.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.820
This is builder.node.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.120
Some of you guys might
be familiar with this.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.620
This comes in builder.js part of
Scriptaculous and the prototype library.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.550
And what this is going to do is
it's going to set up an A element,

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.280
that's an anchor,
and give it this dig href

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.050
that I set up the link.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.450
Then it's going to put this text,
dig this, in that text link.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.710
We could have made this an image one.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.700
We could have done, we could have,
you know,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.530
had it be the iframe of how many
times it's been dug and whether

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.220
or not the user has dug this page.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.780
but we wanted to keep the
example pretty simple.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.450
And the last thing this does
is it inserts that element

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.360
before the paginator widget.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.300
The paginator widget is this

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.400
We're going to insert that
link right before that.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.040
I'm going to go back
to the main Wiki page,

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.680
go to the settings because
I'm logged in as an admin,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.710
and I'm going to change the theme.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.360
Again, we drop down here to the bottom.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.900
Here it is.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.200
We select it, save it.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.480
Looks exactly the same as it did before.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.640
The only difference is that in that list,
I know that that's the one that said

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.560
something about adding a DigLink.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.830
So if I go to the main wiki page,
nothing happens.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.910
If I go to the main blog page,
the listing page, nothing happens.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.800
But when I go to one of the
individual web blog entries,

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.800
then I show up with this
little DigLink right here.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.300
It runs right as the page loads,
adds that DigLink.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.840
And this one is running off a local host.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.700
So if I clicked it,
it would go to the Dig website.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.470
But since the Dig server can't see it,
then it's going to think it's a bad link.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.040
If you were to take the sample code,
which is again available on the

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.510
conference site and from the ADC,
and run it on your own public web blog,

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.060
it's going to work right out of the box.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.200
And I encourage you guys
to mess around with it,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.640
because I think you guys can do much
more interesting stuff than this.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.490
So thanks a lot.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.160
Thanks, James.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.830
So along with debugging your CSS,
you're probably going to want to

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.900
debug your theme's JavaScript.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.360
And if you're anything like me,
if your code works the first

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.720
time that you try it out,
you're a little terrified.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:02.860
Almost all code breaks
the first time you try it.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:02.860
So debuggers are crucial here.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.550
And in the latest nightlies of WebKit,
there's an excellent debugger

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.390
built right into the inspector.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.070
You can set breakpoints
and it's super fast.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.820
So it's much improved, in my opinion,
over the old Drosera stuff and

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.880
it's definitely worth checking out.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.750
And it's my debugger of choice now.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.940
But you can see here that the
code isn't always going to break

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.950
in your own JavaScript code.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.180
Something may happen,
something may cascade,

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.500
and the bug may actually
occur in our code.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.580
And I dare you to look at this line of
compressed JavaScript code and actually

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.810
figure out where the problem lies.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.060
So there is actually a
way to work around this.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:50.800
And you can go to a URL on your server,
which is /collaboration/debugmode.html.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:55.430
That brings up a web page with a
checkbox for turning debugging mode on.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.520
And when you turn that on,
it sets a cookie in your

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.860
particular web browser,
which will then cause the server to

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.120
send out uncompressed JavaScript.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.440
So instead of seeing this
in your JavaScript debugger,

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.970
you see this,
complete with comments and much,

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.630
much easier to find out what's going on.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.120
And in this particular case,
I actually deliberately broke the page

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.480
by removing the link search element,
which it's looking for

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.140
in this line of code,
and then falling over.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.080
So by turning on debug mode and
using the JavaScript debugger,

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:39.560
you're going to have a great way to
figure out what you did to break things.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.930
The next step that you may want to
do is you actually may want to change

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.120
the HTML that comes out of the server.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.140
and you can do this by
creating custom XSL templates.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.650
And if you take any of the
system's XSL templates and

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.700
copy them into your theme,
it'll use the ones in the theme

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.730
instead of the system ones.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.860
So this allows you to change
the HTML that actually gets

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.500
generated by the server.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.150
Now, when is this useful?

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.630
It's useful for browsers in
which JavaScript is disabled.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.740
And that's the one case in which
this is absolutely necessary.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.190
But I will give you the caveat
that without JavaScript,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.710
there's no editing of the wiki.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.360
It's a read-only system at that point.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.910
But again, if you want to be able to make
the changes without JavaScript,

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.240
XSL is the way to do it.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.590
This is also one of those
things where I'm kind of saying,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.160
don't do this, but here's how to do it.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.560
And the reason for that is that,
for one thing, it's not useful for adding

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.210
dynamic content to your pages.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.880
XSL is a transformation language,
so it's taking a context XML document

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.160
and turning it into a web page.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.230
So if there's a piece of information that
isn't on the page and you wish to add it,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.250
JavaScript is the way
to do that and not XSL,

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.760
because that information isn't
there and therefore it can't be

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.340
transformed into anything else.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.370
The other thing to watch out for
is that it's not future-proof.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.630
When you take Apple's template
and you copy it into your theme,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.030
it's going to use the copy of
the template that's in your

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.420
theme now and not the Apple one.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:09.590
This means that if we send out software
updates with bug fixes or enhancements,

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.690
you won't see those because it's
going to continue using the one

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.330
that you've used in your theme.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.460
So you at least want to make
sure that you track it so that

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.300
you can look for diffs and patch
them into your own XSL templates.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.580
And lastly, you'll definitely want to
exercise caution when actually

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.900
removing elements from the page.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:33.260
As you saw earlier, I removed the link
search element using XSL,

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.910
and that made the JavaScript fall
over because it was expecting

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.140
that element to exist.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.100
So if you actually want to have
elements not show up on the page,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.940
the best way to do that is to turn them
off using CSS and using display none.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.050
That makes them invisible to the user.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.080
But any JavaScript that
depends on it will still work.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.000
So that's a little bit about XSL.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.100
And again, I kind of issued the, like,
the edict or, you know,

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.430
the preference that you're going
to get a lot more done and be a

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:08.370
lot more future-proof if you use
JavaScript rather than XSL to

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.710
change your markup of your page.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.560
But lastly,
the one thing that you may want to

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.330
do is talk to the Wiki Server from
other scripts or other applications.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.240
and there's two great industry standard
ways to get data out of the server

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.590
and to put data into the server.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.100
So firstly,
if you want to pull data from the server,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.270
you can use RSS and Atom for that.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:34.700
And there's lots of different scripting
modules that handle RSS and Atom.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.940
And every page that
you look at has a feed,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.760
at least one feed.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.870
And every search that you
perform also has a feed.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:45.620
So you can perform a search that
does what your script needs,

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.610
grab the RSS feed and
use that for your script.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.120
CREBS.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.640
And if you want to push
data into the server,

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:56.310
we also handle a couple of
industry standard methods for that,

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.260
and those are MetaWebLog and AtomPub.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.330
And you can use either of those to
add Wiki entries and blog entries

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:04.340
and get data into the server.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:09.050
And to show a really cool demo
of what you can do with the APIs,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.800
I'm going to bring
James Craig back up here.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.400
Thanks again, John.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.000
So because we're not actually going
to be showing the code in this sample,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.080
it's more than will
fit on a couple pages.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.720
I just want to talk to you about
what's actually going to happen.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.230
So I've got my phone up here,
and I'm going to take

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.680
it out of airplane mode.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:52.300
[Transcript missing]

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.960
This local server,
it could be running anywhere.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.750
It could be an external.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.780
It's usually on a server,
but it could be running anywhere.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.150
And what that's doing is every now
and then it's checking to see if

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.890
there's a new image in this RSS feed.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.130
When it checks to see
if there's a new image,

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.570
it gets that image back down,
pulls it down, it does a little bit

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.390
of image manipulation,
and it pushes it off to the

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.150
Wiki Server blog via metaweblog.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.100
Can I bring the house
lights up a little bit?

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.320
Can I get somebody to
bring the house lights up?

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.790
Maybe.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.200
That's okay.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.560
I'll take a photo of this and you can
kind of see you guys in the background.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.560
Look a little plushy here.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:46.980
And I'm going to email this off.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.780
Send to my WWDC demo.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.300
It creates an email.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.740
I'm sending it right now.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:03.520
Still sending.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.120
And I'll go to the group.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.520
And it may or may not be here already.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.560
So it's not there.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.570
Let's see if it's still sending.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:23.290
Hey, guys, quit using your iPhones,
because then I can get out.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.550
All right, it looks like it's sent.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.300
and it's not there yet,
but in the meantime,

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.410
I can show you some vacation photos
of mine with impossibly beautiful

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:33.710
people if you'd like to see them.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.100
The Internet is a truck.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.980
It's a series of tubes.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.110
So it's running a little bit slow,
but we'll get it.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.320
There it is.

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:44.040
I'm in your demo.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.700
So I got a little plushy animal
and you guys in the background.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.300
And that's it.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.300
So thanks again, guys.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.580
Okay, so as James showed you,
there's actually a number of really cool

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.890
things that you can do using the APIs.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.070
And so in summary,
there's a number of different

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.900
ways that you can take the
Wiki Server and make it yours.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.890
You can use the built-in
customizations from the search page.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.300
You can design your own CSS in a theme.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.910
You can add JavaScript in a
theme to add functionality.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:26.310
As a last resort,
you can change the XSLT to change the

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.840
HTML that's generated by the server.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.840
And, of course, as James showed you,
you can use the API to get data into and,

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.690
of course,
pull data out of the server and integrate

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.180
it with your own other applications.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.190
So for more information,
I'd encourage you to talk to Mark Malone.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.180
And the other thing is that
if you go to the attendee site

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.460
for this particular course,
you'll find links to the PDF,

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.110
which describes in detail
how to accomplish some of the

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.760
things that we've done today,
and also provides links

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:56.810
to the documentation for
Prototype and Scriptaculous.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:02.730
And with that, I'd like to bring the
Apple engineers up for Q&A.
