WEBVTT

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.910
Welcome to session 101,
Getting Started with

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.240
Mac OS X Administration.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.340
My name's Brian Loose,
and I'll be the presenter today.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.140
And along with me is Jason Deraleau,
offstage.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.160
And Jason will do a couple
of demos tonight for us.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.220
So just informally,
we've got a couple of questions we

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.140
wanted to ask about the session.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.900
How many of you would say that
you're new to the Mac platform?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.380
Hands.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.960
Okay, and how many would say
that they've got experience

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.300
administering Windows platform?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.260
And then, and also for Unix, Linux?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
Okay, so a fair amount.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.140
Okay, let's get started then.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.300
As Bertrand told us this afternoon,
the Mac platform is only

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.440
increasing as a platform.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.900
And it's become a great business tool,
really,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.670
in the last few years particularly.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.200
Now, you're probably seeing in a lot
of your own businesses that you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.550
see management and power users,
both that are bringing Macs into the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.550
office and they're getting work done on
the Macs and they're being productive.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.060
But a lot of you are probably thinking,
how can a Mac integrate

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.170
into our environment?

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.750
How can we make it integrate?

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.410
And how can I also support that when
I may not have Mac administration

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.740
specialties or capabilities and
you have a lot of MCSEs or Unix,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.550
Linux admins on staff?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.670
So how can I be sure that somebody with
that knowledge can administer some Macs

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.720
that I'm bringing into my organization
and hopefully expanding that presence?

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.610
So we'll answer a lot of those questions
and we'll show you some equivalent

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.110
platform tools that we have on the Mac.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.380
And we'll also talk about how
we can use some of our existing

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.600
infrastructure in our IT organizations
to integrate and support those

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.090
Macs that we're bringing in.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.300
So we'll do that in a number of ways.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.330
First, we'll give you an overview
of Mac OS X administration.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.360
Now, this is not intended
to be a real deep dive,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.200
but it's intended to have you get
a real good look at the platform,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.970
see what some of the tools are,
and then look at the rest of the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.420
sessions over the week and see where
you want to get more information and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.970
more of a deep dive into that topic.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.410
So first we'll give you a
very brief platform overview.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.900
Just to kind of give everyone a level
set of the hardware and software

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.500
platforms that we're dealing with,
just in case you missed some

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.500
of the sessions this morning.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.040
And we'll show you some of the
tools and utilities that you'll

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.880
use to administer Mac OS X,
both from the GUI and the command line.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.030
Now next, there's four things that
we're going to cover today,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.040
really.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.140
First, user accounts.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.050
And just some basics about how
do I configure user accounts from

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.320
a local perspective on the Mac.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.340
Then we'll dive a little
bit deeper and talk about,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.970
well, how would I do that if I was
tied into a directory system,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.360
a directory service,
both on a Mac or an active directory?

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.200
Third, we'll look at policy management.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.900
A lot of you that are
familiar with the PC platform,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.070
we call it policy management.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.000
On the Mac, very commonly referred
to as client management.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.140
So when you see sessions
that say client management,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.850
that's pretty much what we're talking
about is how do we administer policy.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.100
And lastly, system deployment.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.390
Taking a Mac out of the box,
how do we get it ready to give to a user?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.360
How do we manage it over its
lifetime so I can distribute

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.420
updates and things like that to it?

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.780
And lastly, we're going to cover some
of the related sessions.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.380
As you're looking through that
guide of sessions to attend,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.630
we'll have a list of all those.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.000
We can quickly go over those at the end.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.090
We'll also point out sessions on slides,
which usually you probably

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.240
won't see too much during this,
but because it's an overview session,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.990
we are going to point out relevant
sessions right on the slides.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.000
So with that,
let's start with a platform overview.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.930
So a lot of you are
probably very familiar,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.680
you know, in the last two, three years,
Apple's transitioned

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.340
to the Intel platform.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.020
And that's -- they've been
a great partner of ours,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.780
and all of our machines are on Intel,
and for that matter,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.590
They're all very much standards-based.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.110
Beyond the processor themselves,
when you think about things

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.210
like the USB interfaces,
using keyboards, mice, thumb drives,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.860
USB hard drives, firewire drives,
displays, using DVI or VGA displays,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.490
and those types of areas.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.170
And as Bertrand mentioned this morning,
multi-core is very, very important.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.570
Now,
Mac OS X has always been very friendly to

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.290
the multi-core and the multi-core area,
always recognizing those cores,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.500
always making them available to
both the operating system and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.980
the applications that are written
to specifically address those.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.800
Now, a third area where you probably
are less familiar with is EFI.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.660
Now, rather than using BIOS like
the traditional PC standard

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.750
of the last decade and a half,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.000
The Mac uses EFI to handle
pre-boot types of capabilities.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.400
Now, EFI is that next generation
standard from Intel,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.380
and I think over the next few years,
you'll start to see PCs as

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.220
Microsoft supports EFI,
you'll see that in the

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.300
hardware of the machines,
and that's what we use.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.010
And it gives us some great capabilities.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:12.060
Because we were bringing our platform
up on Intel from very recently,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.780
we were able to see that
this was a future direction,

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.370
and so we built on EFI rather than BIOS.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.020
I mentioned it gives
us some great things.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.750
So with EFI, we can emulate BIOS,
and that's what we do as one of

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.350
the ways that we allow you to
use the capability of Boot Camp,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.790
which allows you to actually
install and boot Windows on a

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.400
parallel partition on your Mac and
switch that back and forth and use

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.160
that either one whenever you want.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.900
Now, a lot of people are using VMs and
virtual machines to do emulation.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.200
I'm sorry, not emulation,
but virtualization.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.610
But in some cases,
you may want to boot that Mac directly

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.970
into Windows and make use of it.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.000
So Boot Camp gives you that capability.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.130
And to have it on the machine installed
right alongside your Mac gives you

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.140
a great opportunity to do that.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.400
Now the next real foundation
technology of Mac OS X is Unix.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.960
A lot of people are familiar
with our great GUI interface,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.420
and it's been -- it's what's
made Mac OS X very popular

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.940
with a lot of people.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.500
But the real foundation and the
strength of Mac OS X is the Unix

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.020
underpinnings and the foundations.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.310
So let's take a little bit
of a further look at that.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.360
So with Leopard,
one of the things that's a great

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.300
improvement in the platform
is being UNIX 03 registered,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.600
one of four platforms to do that.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.990
So we are a certified UNIX.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.440
And we're also POSIX compliant.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.580
So if you have source code
that's also POSIX compliant,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.900
you can be pretty sure that you
can bring that source code in,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.270
you can build it, compile it,
and run it on our Unix foundations.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.050
Now, you're going to find that
it's very similar to BSD.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.260
You'll find a lot of the same
directory structures and a

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.780
lot of the same commands,
so it'll be very familiar to you.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.940
But in a lot of cases,
there are certain commands

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.690
that you may not find.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.100
You might think that they're missing.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.510
But in fact,
they've probably been superseded by

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:23.980
commands that Apple has written that go
beyond the initial command that you might

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:31.350
be missing and address functionality
far beyond and integrate further into

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.500
the Mac environment than the binary
commands that you may have been missing.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.800
So last, let's talk about networking
and communications.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.560
Nowadays,
communications and being able to

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.740
communicate to people in a wide variety
of ways has never been more important.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.770
So whether you're using a dial-up modem,
a cellular card, Wi-Fi,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.980
or gigabit Ethernet,
some of the fastest standards,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.850
You can be sure that with
our self-tuning TCP/IP stack,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:11.770
that we're gonna manage things
like latency to make sure that

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.840
you get the best throughput,
no matter whether you're using

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:15.840
a modem or that gig ethernet.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:15.840
So it's gonna manage that for you.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:15.840
Very powerful TCP/IP stack.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.090
And our networking is
also very standards-based.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.700
So you can be sure that you
can take a Mac out of the box,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.010
either plug it into your network,
configure it to work with your wireless,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.560
configure that security if needed,
and you can be sure that you're

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.990
going to get an IP address,
you're going to get on that network,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.950
and you're going to be
able to start working.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:41.940
I've also got a very robust
firewall that supports both IPSec

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.000
and PPTP standards for Microsoft.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.960
So that's built in, ready to go,
right out of the box.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.000
And finally, if you are having some
issues with your networking,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
you can be sure that there are
a lot of diagnostics tools,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.170
both in the GUI and in the command line,
to help you get through a rough patch

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.000
that you might be having networking-wise.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.060
Now let's take a look at some
of the tools and utilities

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.000
that you're going to use.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:16.940
Now, a lot of these you'll find have
equivalents both in Windows and the Unix.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.810
And so we'll try to point
those out where relevant.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.770
The first tool,
which is very handy when you're

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:28.310
doing any type of diagnostics,
and you can use either by yourself

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.470
or you can even prompt a user to very
easily use and give you some piece

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.680
of information to diagnose something.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.300
This is System Profiler.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.970
Now you can also call this
from the command line in the

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:46.410
user S-bin system profiler,
and that'll spit out an XML list

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.680
of information that you can
capture to a file and possibly

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.280
save or transport somewhere.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.900
But you've also got a full GUI interface
into this to very easily check the

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.920
settings of a specific device or if
a specific device is even showing up.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.560
The next is Activity Monitor.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.460
It just gives you a very quick basic
system resource usage of the system.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.960
Kind of see if you've got a process
that's perhaps using more resources

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:20.130
on the processor or from a system
memory than it should be and manage

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.810
that process a little bit better,
in some cases killing it.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.770
Very similar to the Unix
command top or even PS.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.570
So from a command line or GUI,
you're pretty much covered there.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:43.440
Now, as a Unix admin,
one of the things that is usually

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.580
very troubling is the myriad of
areas where logs from a system

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:55.830
or application standpoint are
stored all across your system.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.500
One of the things that the console
application does is allows you one very

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.470
quick interface into all the system logs,
all the application logs,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.450
and can very easily allow you
to go in and check out a log and

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.280
also filter a log for keywords.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.130
Another thing that Jason's going to
show you in the demo is a neat feature

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.020
where you can mark sections of the log.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.560
So it's very easy to go back and see
where you were in a log at a specific

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.440
time when you waited for an event
to happen that you were looking for.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.640
Oh, let's go back in there.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.060
One thing is that you're probably
used to on the Unix command

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.770
line is using the tail command.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.580
Okay, so we can wait for events that
are logged to a specific file.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.990
Very similar in this area.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.070
You use this instead.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.110
System Preferences is the one place
in Mac OS X where you can configure

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.940
all of your OS environment settings.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.340
So things like setting up your
desktop and your dock and some

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.450
very Mac specific things such as
your expose window management.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.880
Now, there are a lot of similar command
line types of tools that we also have.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.240
The network setup command from the
command line will allow you to do most

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.740
of the configuration settings that
you can do in the network preference.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.270
PMSET is a command line tool
that will allow you to do very

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.460
similar things to the energy saver
settings in the preferences panel.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:28.830
And MDUtil is a utility that will
allow you to manage Spotlight.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.420
Now, the spotlight,
as you can see up here,

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.490
is one area that you can configure
to allow you to index metadata

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.200
for your files in Mac OS X.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.360
So you can do this from the command line.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.360
You can also do many of these things.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.230
You can do them all in the GUI,
but many of them from

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.920
the command line as well.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.460
And lastly, CUPSD.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.570
CUPSD is the system that runs
our printing architecture

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.580
from the command line.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.650
There's also a web interface into
CUPSD that you may want to look at.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.660
That can help you manage printers
from the command line if you need to.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.890
So, let's go ahead and start.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.040
Next is Disk Utility.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.560
This is the one tool that
you'll probably use to format,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:17.570
erase, partition disks,
whether that's a single

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.600
OS X HFS partition or
even a Windows partition.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.680
You can configure all those types
of partitions in Disk Utility.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.730
There are also some great companion
tools in the command line,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.970
Disk Util and HDI Util,
which is more geared towards

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.840
So being able to take an
entire disk that you have,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.170
a physical disk,
and copying that into a disk

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.130
image that you can move,
copy, and deploy on another disk.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.130
Now,
we talked about some of the capabilities

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.200
for doing networking diagnostics.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.700
Network utility is a very,
very easy application to use.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.340
You could probably walk any user
through using this and can get

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.480
some great information about what
your Mac sees networking-wise.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.380
So you've got a lot of the
familiar Unix commands there,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:10.840
ping.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.860
You can do some things like
the netstat capability.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.520
And you have similar
functionality to host,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.860
the dig, and the ifconfig commands.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.010
So, a very good tool for
diagnosing networking issues.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.240
Now,
Directory Utility is a primary tool that

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.270
you'll use to do binding of machines.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.300
We'll talk a little bit more
about Directory Services.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.990
We've got a whole section on it later.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.790
But this is the tool that you would use
to bind your machine either to LDAP,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.600
open Directory Servers,
active Directory Servers,

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.500
all right inside Directory Utility.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.990
Now, there are also many command
line equivalents to this.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.500
You'll see Directory Service,
DSConfig LDAP,

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:01.200
DS Config AD, DS Cache Util,
and the Mount command.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.810
Those are all commands that
we do in a very similar way,

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.550
but through the GUI with direct utility.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.640
Now, the next two are a couple
of server-based tools.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.210
If you were in the last session,
I'm sure you saw some of that.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.700
But first one is Server Admin.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.540
It allows you to administer a server
locally on the box or remotely.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.420
Very easy to do that either way.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.430
And from a command line perspective,
you can also do this with a command

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.410
line tool called Server Admin.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.630
So this is primarily for starting
and stopping server processes and

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.050
also configuring those processes.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.140
And additionally,
it will also handle all of

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.780
your file share capabilities.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.260
So if you were going to reshare
a directory on the system,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.680
this is where you'd go to do that.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.000
It also gives you
status of these as well.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.050
As you see there, all green lights.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.510
Everything's great.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
Second tool, Workgroup Manager.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:04.940
And this is primarily for managing users,
groups, and computers, and policies.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.220
Some command line tools that will
also do similar types of things,

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.220
DSCL, DS Group Edit, and PW Policy.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:18.110
So if you're into the command line,
you'll want to look into those tools.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.420
And now lastly,
Remote Desktop is not included

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.250
in the operating system like
the rest of those tools are,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:36.090
but it's a great tool for beginning
and medium-sized networks that want

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.870
one tool that can manage their Macs
from a number of different areas.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.300
You can observe Macs on your network,
be able to grab their screen, view it,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.020
control it.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.980
You can also do things like
install software over the network,

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.500
push software out to those machines.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.160
You can also do some great things.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.210
One of my favorite things is to be
able to distribute a Unix command

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.790
across a number of machines.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.480
So you can do things one machine
at a time with Remote Desktop,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.380
but you can also batch those things.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.750
So you can select a
group of 100 machines,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.670
deploy a piece of software to them.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.900
Or issue a Unix command and have
the result come back from all 100

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.280
machines from their Unix command line.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.430
So this is an additional
piece of software.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.700
And now we've got Jason to
come up and give us a demo of

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.460
the typical Mac admins doc.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.030
And he's gonna go through some of
those applications that we just spoke

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.920
about and give you just a very brief
tour of some of their capabilities.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.390
Over to demo machine, Jason.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.240
So I'm just going to walk through
a quick demo here of some of the

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.580
different tools that Brian just covered.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.070
First one up we have is System Profiler.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.930
And System Profiler is a great way
to go in and take a look at the

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.120
details of the hardware and software
configuration inside your machine.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.620
I kind of think of this like
the old MSD command under DOS.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.920
You get a lot of information
about what particular hardware

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.200
is installed in the machine.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.320
For example,
I can see the graphics adapter

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.500
in this particular workstation.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.160
I can take a look at the
different hard drives installed.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.760
I can get into different software
configurations so I can find out

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.500
what version of an application
is installed on the machine,

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.270
when it was last modified,
and even can tell me whether it's

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.110
a universal binary or maybe like
a classic one that would require

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.660
me to use the classic environment,
which we don't really

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.850
have as much these days.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.780
I can also take a look at extensions,
which are similar to the

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.310
concept of device drivers.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.360
This is the way that the hardware
is going to talk to the kernel.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.960
And there's a lot of great information
in here that you can use to collect

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.770
specifications about the machine,
what the current configuration is,

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.720
and whether anything has
been changed recently.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.920
You have the ability to go in if
you're working with AppleCare,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.520
for example.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.440
You can send the information
directly to Apple.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.680
You can save it out to a file and perhaps
send it to your IT department if you're

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.920
on the road and having problems with it.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.460
And it's just a great tool to
get all the information about

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.640
the machine in one place.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.400
Moving on,
the next tool is Activity Monitor.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.460
And with Activity Monitor,
like Brian was saying earlier,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.890
this is very similar to
the Unix top command.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.460
Getting information about what processes
are currently running on the machine,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.960
how much memory they're using, CPU time.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.040
I have some nice little graphs
down here at the bottom as far as

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.260
what the disk activity currently
going on in the system is.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.820
If I come up here to this show box,
I can actually see all the

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.770
processes hierarchically.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.380
So I can see how the different
processes are structured on the machine,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.440
and I can see the bridge between
the system processes themselves

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.680
and into the user space.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.100
Another thing I particularly like
about this tool is you can go in and

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.940
sometimes you get a problem where I'm
maybe trying to eject an external drive

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.790
and it keeps saying a file's open.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.810
Well, if you go into Activity Monitor,
you can inspect the process,

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.180
and it'll actually show you what files
and ports are open on the machine.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.820
So this is kind of some of the
same kinds of information you

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.040
got in Netstat and also some
information out of the LSOF command.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.520
and for you Unix admins.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.700
The ability here to stop processes,
do sampling,

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.120
get some more information about what's
currently running on the machine.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.560
Next tool I'd like to
show you here is Console.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.610
And with Console,
usually when you first open it up,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.640
you kind of want to come over
here and click Show All Logs.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.080
And what this will do is allow
you to see all the logs that

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.570
are gathered up in the system.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.980
And these are organized
into different domains.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.760
Brian touches on this a little
bit later in the presentation,

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.300
but depending on whether the log is,
for example,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.790
something running in my user space,
like an application like

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.910
Mail or maybe the .max sync
panel or something like that,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.210
that's going to end up in
a different location on the

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.770
system than system processes.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.800
So, for example, if I want to take a look
at what the Apache logs are

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.860
doing for the Apache service,
I can come down here to Var Log,

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.740
where you'd find it
traditionally on a Unix system.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.950
However, for something like within
the Disk Utility tool,

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.680
when I run it in my workstation,
I'd find that in my local log file.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.620
Now,
kind of a neat thing here that I like,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.310
and I kind of wish Event Viewer
had this on the Windows side,

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.750
is the ability to mark the log.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.560
So I can actually click
here to insert a marker,

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.150
and you can see it does a timestamp.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.040
And then I'm just going
to open up Terminal here,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.550
and I'm going to issue a bad command.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.640
Now,
if I come back over here to System Log,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.700
I can actually see that the information
about the failed attempt for the

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.240
authentication is popping up in the log.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.440
And now I can insert another marker,
and this gives me two points of

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.590
reference to determine what's going on
in the system when I have this failure.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.450
So if I'm having problems with a service
starting or I keep getting an error

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.610
when I'm trying to upload something,
I can come in here, mark the logs,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.800
repeat what the process is,
and then use that as a way

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.050
to troubleshoot a little
further on what's going on.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.800
Now, System Preferences is very
similar to Control Panel,

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.670
same kind of tool you would use on the
Windows side to configure a lot of the

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.240
basic configuration of the machine.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.080
And actually,
you can even use a lot of the

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.610
Windows terminology in here.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.780
So, for example, on the Mac,
we call our background a desktop picture,

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.710
but on Windows, you call it a wallpaper,
right?

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.780
So I can come up here, type wallpaper,
and it's actually going to suggest to

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.580
me that I go over to this particular
panel and then change my picture.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:19.560
One other one I also get questions quite
often about is going into right-clicking.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.840
And you'll find that if you go
into the keyboard and mouse panel,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.790
you have the ability to
go into the mouse section.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.080
And you can actually switch
this over to secondary button,

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.830
which will make it act
like a right-click.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:34.780
So even if you have a standard USB mouse
that adheres to the HID standard,

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.150
you can come in here,
enable the right-click,

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:39.150
and it'll work just like a
mouse would on Windows side.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.470
As far as Disk Utility goes, again,
this is a way you'd use to

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.400
go in and partition drives.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.800
You can also use it to set
up different file systems.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.220
A nice feature of Disk Utility is you
can create images of different devices.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.230
So, for example,
if I have a CD and some software on

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.450
a CD that I want to make a backup of,
I can actually use Disk Utility to make

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.280
a copy of that in a file on my machine,
and then I can back it up on my

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.990
workstation instead of having
to burn another copy of it.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.300
Another feature I really like
about Disk Utility is you have

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.510
the ability to go in and do
multi-pass erases on a drive.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.690
So, for example,
I'm about to decommission a

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.940
whole bunch of workstations,
I'm going to throw them up on eBay.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.960
Before I do that,
I probably want to go in and

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.660
erase my company's sensitive data.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.410
So, I can come into Disk Utility,
go to the erase portion,

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.160
and right here I have this
option for security options.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.360
And in here you can see I can
zero out the data just to get

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.740
the drive out to a certain state.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.060
I can do a seven-pass erase or a
35-pass erase to eradicate the data.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.440
Something I do personally is
just kind of a best practice.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.350
I like to zero out the drive before
I install the operating system on it

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.470
because it'll actually try to write
to every single sector on the drive,

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.000
and that way, if any of them are bad,
it'll mark it in the volume

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.790
bitmap and it won't use that
block for data in the future.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.770
As far as network utility goes, this is,
again,

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.850
a tool you would use to do a lot of
diagnostics related to the network stack.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.630
You have some pretty standard stuff here,
you know, as far as I can get information

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.750
about a network interface,
which, you know,

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.780
is very similar to if I did
perhaps the ifconfig command,

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.240
I'd get a lot of the same
information right here in the box.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.550
Netstat, you know,
if I want to take a look at the

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.280
routing table on the machine,
I can get that back and find it here.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.720
If you're still using Apple Talk,
you can make use of this through here.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.390
DNS lookups, trace routes,
all the standard kind of

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.400
tools you'd find in there,
even a rudimentary port scan utility.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.400
So it's a great tool for just a
graphical interface for users who may

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.680
not be comfortable with the command
line to do basic network diagnostics,

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.570
but can at least click around in
a box and work with you on the

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.600
phone while you're working on it.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.470
As far as directory utility goes,
this is the tool you use to connect

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.600
to different directory systems.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.400
For example, in this case here,
I'm working off an open directory server.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.710
There's also options to add
active directory servers.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.850
So if I want to go in
here and click plus,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.980
I can say I want to use active directory
and just as easily bind to an AD backend

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.550
in my enterprise environment as I could
bind to an open directory environment.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.590
There's also the ability to go in
and search some advanced settings

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.570
here where I can set up mount points,
I can disable and enable

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.130
different plug-ins,
and I also have the ability

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.720
to modify the search policy.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.390
And for those of you who are a
little newer to the platform,

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.480
the search policy is
kind of a unique case.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.850
On Windows, you know how you have
the authentication box,

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.460
and typically you have a name,
a password,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.610
and then you have a selection of a domain
at the bottom where you would pick which

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.910
particular domain you want to log into.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.220
On the Mac,
the way you pick what domain is used is

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.490
based on the order of the search path.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.970
So if, for example,
the LDAP directory has a

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.880
user account named Bob,
and the Active Directory system

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.440
has a user account named Bob,
whichever one comes in the list first

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.480
is the Bob that's going to get used.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.620
So if you're having problems logging in,
it's usually a good idea to come in

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.550
here and just double-check the order
that you have in here to be sure that

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.730
you're authenticating against the
directory system you think you are.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.700
For Server Admin, again,
this is the basic tool to come in and not

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.520
only examine the status of the server,
but also configure its services.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.920
So it's kind of like the
services panel in Windows,

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.400
but it's a little more featureful.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.760
Not only am I able to stop
and start the services,

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.160
but it's also a way to
manage their settings.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.940
There's a lot of great
information in here about the

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.420
machine as I'm looking at it,
so I can find out, again,

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.150
some of these graphs.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.940
I can see an activity monitor
about CPU usage and disk usage.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.570
I have an overview here of the
different services that are

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.760
currently enabled on the machine.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.560
And you can see in the list here that a
green dot means it's currently active,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.990
while a gray dot means it's
not running at the moment.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.740
So in this case, DHCP is not running.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.390
I have the ability to go
in to look in the logs,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.970
and this is the same information
I'd find in the console tool,

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.760
but the big difference here is
that all of our server admin tools,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.200
as far as server admin,
work group manager,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.050
they're designed to be used remotely.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.800
So the idea is I can have
my administrative laptop

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.990
sitting at my desk here,
and I can manage an entire rack of

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.820
servers in the other room from one place,
and I can go in and view

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.720
all their logs individually,
collect performance information,

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.540
and otherwise configure the machines.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.350
Again, some more of these nice
graphs we can look at,

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.990
configuring share points on the server,
giving a list of updates,

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.220
SSL certificates, pretty standard fare.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.960
Another big one's notifications, right?

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.380
As far as the individual
services themselves go,

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.750
they have a pretty standard format.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.190
Each one will have an overview
telling you what the current

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.240
status of the service is.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.790
Depending on the different service,
it will give you a little

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.820
bit of information here,
like the connections in use,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.020
or if we look at mail,
it will tell me a little more

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.040
detail about the different
services related to mail.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.190
So depending on the service,
these vary a little bit,

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:54.670
but generally speaking,
you'll have an overview information

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.540
about the current status of the service.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.540
You'll have some log information for the
logs related to that particular service,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.240
and then depending on what service it is,
I might get some things like more

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.040
graphs or a connection table.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.790
And then finally, at the end of the list,
I'll have the settings.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.800
And in here, this is how I would actually
configure the service itself.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.050
So the settings for
AFP are going to be very,

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.370
very different than
the settings for DHCP.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.370
It's just what's involved in
the nature of the service.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.430
Finally,
Workgroup Manager is the tool I would

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:29.200
use to configure my user accounts.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.680
So this is similar to
Active Directory Users and Computers.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.870
And in here, I can go in,
create new users, delete users,

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.510
change passwords.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.400
I have the ability to set different
types of password policies.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.450
So for example,
if I want to require the password

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.240
to be changed on a specific date
or introduce different types of

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.940
password complexity requirements,
I can do that through Workgroup Manager.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.460
Additionally,
no standard things you would find

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.470
related to a user account as far as
the groups the user is a member of,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.250
where their home
directory is going to be.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.360
If you're using the
Windows services in Mac OS X Server,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.830
you can configure their
profile path and login script.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.340
It's a pretty standard tool for
just setting up your user accounts

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.520
and putting them into place.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.320
Additionally,
we'll touch on this a little later,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.150
but when you get into the
policy management portion,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.940
this is where you go in and
configure your policy management

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.200
for your user accounts.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.010
If I want to enforce different types
of company policy on the user account,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.480
I can do that through WorkRoute Manager.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.210
The command line equivalent tool,
or one of the many that you can

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.580
use with work group managers,
is called DSCL.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.850
And I actually like this one a
lot because it lets you browse the

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.380
directory service system as if it
were a directory on a file system.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.340
So, for example,
I can use the LS command and I can

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.640
see the individual plugins that are
currently configured on the machine.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.360
I can CD into, say, the LDAP plugin.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.480
I can see what servers it's connected to.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.730
And then from there,
I can go in and look further

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.930
into it as far as finding,
for example, my list of users.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.240
A lot of Unix administrators may be
familiar with the tools like UserAd or

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.620
UserDel that you would find on a standard
Linux machine or like a BSD machine.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.820
And unfortunately,
that isn't the exact equivalent

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.500
available on Mac OS X,
but using DSCL, you can introduce a lot

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.440
of the same functionality.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.670
So, really, again,
this is just a basic overview

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.440
of the different tools.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.030
You'd use and you'd find in a
typical Mac administrator's doc.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.190
And, again, I think that each one
has its own purpose.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.260
And just as you would when
you're administering a

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.870
Windows machine or a Unix machine,
you'll find that even though the

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.260
tools may be a little different,
the underlying concepts are the same.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.020
You're still working with user accounts.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.200
You're still setting up
services and configuring them.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.960
Brian?

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:59.800
So the next thing we're going
to talk about are users,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.120
and specifically users
from a local perspective,

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.050
those that are configured on
the actual computer themselves.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:09.960
Now, there are a couple of things,
sometimes we consider

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.810
those best practices,
some things that you might want

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:16.610
to do right out of the box,
especially in the corporate

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.610
workspace for a local user.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.820
So you've probably seen when you
configure a user on Mac OS X,

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.700
it asks you for the name, the password,
and it logs you right in.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.800
And any time you restart the computer,
it logs you right in.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.100
So the first thing you probably want to
do is go into the accounts preference.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.680
And by default,
it's going to have that state

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.200
until you create a second user.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.990
Now, if you don't want a second user,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.780
You can go in and configure that to
give you what we call login window.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:50.330
So when the machine comes up,
it will either give you an icon

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.040
to display the users that are
available and a space for a password,

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.440
or just two spaces to enter
a name and a password.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.170
So that's what I recommend for
best security is two empty spaces.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.470
So you can configure that in
the account system preference.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:10.360
And so that's where you
configure login window.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.100
And as we mentioned,
the first account that you

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.490
create has admin privileges.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.820
Now, that's good because admin is
the level of user that you need

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.080
to create additional users.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.360
So in many cases, what people will do,
they'll create an admin user

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.310
on the computer and call it
admin or some variation of that.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.950
And then for actual users,
even if you are the main

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.820
user on the machine,
create a second user for yourself

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.460
and run as a standard user.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.440
It's a good security practice that you
might want to get used to on a computer.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:51.600
But it's important to realize that
even if you stay admin on the machine,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.340
admin level user, it's not root, okay?

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.940
There are still many,
many areas on the computer

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:02.230
you can't get to and things
that you can't do as an admin.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.520
So even when you want to
change things on the computer,

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.040
if you haven't authenticated
an application to do something,

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:17.840
it's still going to pop up a
dialog box if you're admin and say,

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:17.840
please authenticate as
admin so I can do this.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.540
Now the admin user can create
additional users as we mentioned,

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.940
standard users as well as guest users,
something that's new to Mac OS X Leopard.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.960
We'll talk about guest
users in the next slide.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.450
But as I mentioned,
we probably recommend that you

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:41.320
just run as a standard user
with standard user privileges.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.460
Now, what's nice about this as a
standard user is that you can always

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:50.180
authenticate as an admin anytime
an authentication box comes up.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.580
So it doesn't really
limit you in any way.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.190
If you do know the admin password,
you can go ahead and authenticate

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.900
and allow something to happen.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:02.000
And if you have a user that's
running as just a standard user,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.000
they can call you up and say, hey,
something's going on in the box

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.810
and it says I need to authenticate.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:12.100
You can walk over to the box and you can
authenticate with your admin privileges

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.390
in the box and allow something to happen.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.100
So it doesn't mean you're
locked out running a standard.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.560
It just means I'm going to
need to talk to somebody before

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.900
I can get something done.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.190
Now,
it is important to realize that once you

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.580
authenticate and you allow an application
the privilege to change something

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:34.680
low level that requires admin access,
that application still has, by default,

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.370
five minutes of admin privilege to it.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.170
So, best practice,
you'd probably want to quit that

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.250
application after you change something
so that your user couldn't go ahead and

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.740
change it back or change it to something
different that you didn't want to happen.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.680
Now let's talk a little bit
about a guest user account.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.900
We can use this in some
kind of interesting ways.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.310
I'm sure you can think of a few ways
that or a few things that you can

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.560
use it for in your own organizations.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:07.280
Now, as I mentioned, it's new in Leopard,
and one of the things that's really nice

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.980
about it is that it gives you an account
that somebody can just click on guest or

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.250
type in guest and no password is needed.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.610
Now, because of that,
the home folder is completely temporary,

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.690
and after the user is done working
and doing what they want to do,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:30.610
maybe accessing a website or accessing
a file share that they needed to

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:30.610
authenticate to and log on to.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.040
When they log out,
then that entire home folder

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.040
is deleted when they leave.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.970
So number one,
it's very important that any work

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.990
they do is copied back onto a server,
which is great.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:44.200
Or if they're using a website,
obviously whatever's going to get changed

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.890
in the website is going to stay changed.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:51.330
And the reason we did this is
that it took a lot of manual

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.950
work to do this in the past.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.280
People wrote things like login
hooks and logout hooks to manage

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.330
users that didn't necessarily
have an account on the machine,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.100
but they still wanted people
to have access to a machine.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.800
So we put this in.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.980
Now keep in mind that this is
anonymous access on the computer.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.500
It means that anybody can just
walk up and log in as guest if

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.340
the guest account is enabled.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.210
It's not enabled by default,
but if you turn it on, keep that in mind.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:25.500
The fact that it is anonymous may mean
that it's something that you might not

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.630
be able to use in your organizations.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.000
You might want to check with your
IT security guidelines because you may

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.180
not allow anonymous logins on a computer.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:37.350
But where it is allowed,
it can be very handy in situations.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.220
Now, additionally,
you can restrict this account with

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.190
what we call parental controls.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.990
Now, it's a little bit misleading,
and it's called parental controls for

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.140
a number of reasons we don't need to
get into too much in this discussion.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:58.650
But what it allows you to do is a
very smaller subset of basically

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.510
policy management for users.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.990
We'll talk about that a little bit later.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.480
Now the next thing we want
to cover is the concept of

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.000
resource domains on the computer.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.150
One of the things that you'll
notice is that as a user,

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:19.540
you only have access to
specific areas on the computer.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.780
And if you need to get access to other
areas that are restricted to you,

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.060
you're going to need to have a
little bit higher level of access.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.580
So let's talk about that
a little bit right here.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.200
Across the top we have the domain,
the type of usage that that

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.070
domain or directory is used for.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:38.230
And then we have each of
the account types inside of

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:44.560
Mac OS X and how that account has
access to that different domain.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.440
So if we look at that second line where
it says home directory or home dir,

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.660
and what that's used for
is your own user data.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.220
And as a guest all the way through root,
you have read and write

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.800
access to your home directory.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.340
Now, if we go one level deeper
into that home directory,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.820
you've probably seen the
library subdirectory.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.320
Now, what that library directory is
used for are additional types of

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.200
data that applications may store.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.070
You'll also see a preferences
folder inside there.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.220
All of your preferences get stored
in that library preferences.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.800
You'll also see a fonts folder.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.230
So, anytime you want to add a
font into your computer,

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:29.010
you go into the home directory, library,
fonts, you would add that in.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.030
Now, it's important to note that anything
that you do in the library domain or

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:39.700
the directory in your home directory,
it only applies to you as a user,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.140
not to anybody else on the computer.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.000
So, if you were to do something
like add a screensaver,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
in some cases, it does ask you now,
do you want this to apply to just you as

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.840
a user or to all users on the machine?

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.370
And we'll get to that situation next.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.010
But you can see,
even inside of your home directory,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.060
that library domain,
each account type still has

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.280
full read-write access to
the information in there,

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.390
which means you can throw
it away and delete it.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.030
If you're having an issue
with a preference and you're

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.890
trying to diagnose it yourself,
you can take a preference, throw it away,

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:18.920
you'll be fine.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.830
Now it's when we get to
the next level of library,

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.530
which is at the root of the file system.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:31.230
That's where computer specific data goes,
data and resources.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.700
Now, in addition to resources like fonts,
screen savers, things like that,

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.940
applications can also install
files and resources in this area.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.030
So if you were to run an application
that needed to be run from any

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.940
user account on the system,
if it needed to get

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.640
access to those resources,
it would go in here because,

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.060
as you can see, we have read-only access.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.220
All accounts have read-only
access to that domain.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.240
Okay, very important.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.300
So I can read the resources, use them,
but I can't change them as

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.000
a guest or a standard user.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.690
Now we can get in there as an
admin and pull those out and

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.080
change them if we need to,
or root.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.370
And then beyond that,
we can make available a

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.520
network library folder.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.140
Now,
it serves the same purpose as library,

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:29.800
but that access to the network
library would be given to you

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.410
through some sort of an AFP mount,
NFS mount perhaps.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.760
And what that does is allows you to
distribute the same types of information,

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.860
fonts, screensavers, whatever it may be,
but it allows you to put that on a

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:48.820
network share and change it in one
central place rather than having

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:53.570
to push that information or copy it
out to a user's local slash library.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.920
Now, there may be reasons why you
would want to store it locally,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.850
such as performance type reasons,
but in a lot of cases,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.760
having a network library is great
because you change it in one place.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.830
And everyone that has that network
library mount automatically

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.050
receives those changes.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:13.050
Now, if you look at that line,
network library, and we look across,

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:17.390
we show that admin still has
read and write access to that.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.840
So in this case,
we're assuming that the admin also

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.760
has read-write access to the file
share that that mount is based off of.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.720
Now lastly, we have the system library.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:36.130
Now this is dedicated to operating
system specific types of resources.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:41.800
So little utility programs and resources
that the operating system needs.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:47.280
And nobody has access to those except
in certain situations where the admin

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.400
may be able to authenticate as admin.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.650
In the case where you're installing
a kernel extension for some reason to

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:57.490
support additional hardware or maybe to
install a kernel extension for a server.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:05.290
You may want to install some
resources for a VM environment.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:05.290
So it does require that
that admin authenticate.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:09.150
Okay, so in general,
you don't delete anything out of there.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.840
It's generally specifically for
the operating system itself.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.090
Let's now look at a couple of
advanced tips for local users

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.550
that you might want to look into.

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.090
This is new in the
accounts preference pane.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.700
There isn't a lot of detail in the
user accounts for people sometimes.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.640
If you right-click or
control-click on individual user

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:43.690
accounts in that preference,
it will show you additional information,

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:48.020
such as the directory that that
user's home directory is stored in.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:54.680
It will show you their user ID,
their group ID,

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:59.240
their generated GUID as well.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.120
So additional information in there.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.620
It also allows you, if you're an admin,
allows you to change that.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.570
Now with knowledge is power and
the ability to change stuff,

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.710
but you also have to take responsibility
because you can screw things up

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:17.540
by changing anything in there,
such as a user's user ID.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.340
But it's there if you need it.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.440
Now, additionally,
how do we enable root on the system?

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.070
Since we said that admin,
the admin user is not root,

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.660
and root is not enabled by
default on the computer.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:34.690
So if you go into that accounts pane,
you can enable root if you're admin only,

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:40.840
and you can turn that on and give it a
separate password from your admin user.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.590
Additionally,
you can use the ds enable root

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.720
command from the command line.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.170
So if you're already an
admin on the computer,

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.420
you can run the ds enable root command.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.820
It will ask you for a
password for the root user.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.750
You give it a password,
preferably different

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.600
than your admin users,
and you're off and running.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.770
You can now log in from
the command line as root.

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.600
Once again,
dangerous because it will do what

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.100
you tell it and it does not forgive.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.280
Okay?

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:13.050
So very, very careful on the RMs
and that sort of thing.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.210
Okay?

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.340
We covered that.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.720
Another new thing in Leopard
is the ability to have a home

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.520
directory on a portable device.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:28.700
So you might have a nice beefy thumb
drive or a FireWare drive or a USB drive.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.800
You can now create an account
that has that home directory

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.310
stored right on the thumb drive,
and you can make that portable and

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.620
carry it around with you and plug it
into machines that are authorized to

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:45.280
have an account installed that way,
or if you have a network-based account

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.290
that has those settings stored in it,
it will be able to use that thumb drive.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.740
Now lastly, another real dangerous area.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.630
That's why this is an advanced tip, okay?

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:04.560
There's a file called authorization
inside the /etc directory.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:09.990
Now, this file is a compilation of
a number of different security

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.910
settings in the operating system.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.820
It's only available to
-- it's not available to,

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.000
you know, standard users.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:23.370
To be able to get to that and edit it,
you have to have the right privileges.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:28.860
Now, it does allow you to change some of
the security parameters on the system.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.250
Now,
we're not going to get into those here,

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.700
and it's not really well documented,
but it does allow us to have some

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:38.240
workarounds into some security
issues that you may be having or some

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:43.420
capabilities that -- or configuration
changes that you think you need

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.170
for a couple of different reasons,
and you can't change any

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.920
other way on the computer.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:51.450
This is an area that you can look into.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:51.450
Okay?

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.040
Now, lastly,
we're going to mention a great session,

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.340
512, Deploying Macs in a
Highly Secure Environment.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.920
Now, in addition to this that
you might want to attend,

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.640
a Leopard security document was
just released on the Apple website.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.700
So that may be also something that you
want to look into to help you configure

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.740
your Macs specifically from a security
perspective to meet your IT policy needs.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.190
So we talked about local
users on the machine,

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.780
but that's really not that powerful.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.100
What we really need in a lot of
your environments is our users need

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.320
access to just about any machine
that they sit down in front of.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:46.190
And the way that we accomplish
that is directory services,

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.190
and we do that in a very similar way
as pretty much any other platform.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:50.200
So why do we use directory services?

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:54.960
Well, it allows us to take all those user
accounts that used to sit locally

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.760
on machines and allow us to put
them in a central location and apply

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.790
policy information to those as well.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.580
So this greatly simplifies
our administration.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.090
So we don't have to
visit machines anymore.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.410
We don't have to do bulk
operations over the network to

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.010
try to manipulate those accounts.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:18.440
We just change them in one central
place and hopefully they just all

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.090
work with all of our remote machines.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.280
So a great thing also,
kind of a side benefit of this is

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.450
that anyone deploying a directory
service is going to deploy one that

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:33.960
also has a system for redundancy,
both in the fact that if one goes down,

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.240
I've got another one that's still up.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.350
But when you have multiple
directory servers,

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.800
you can also provide a level of load
balancing as well for authentications.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.370
Now, these are primarily IT things
that we worry about,

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.260
things that make us happy.

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.090
Well, for a user,
there are very few things

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.340
that an IT organization does
that makes our lives happy.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.560
Okay, let's admit that.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.100
But one of the things they can do is
give us single sign-on for a user.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.180
So when they sit down at a computer,
they can authenticate,

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.120
type in that password once,
and for the most part,

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.620
they're probably going to work
at that machine during the day.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.870
They may not have to authenticate again
because they'll have the advantages

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.530
of single sign-on capabilities.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.480
So whether it's a file share or
maybe even an internal website,

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.400
they may not have to authenticate
again the rest of the day.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400
That's nice.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.380
No more yellow stickies up on
the monitor with their password.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.430
And lastly,
because we're a developer crowd as well,

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:37.670
it gives developers a single target
for a target API to write to.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.830
So on Mac OS X,
developers can write to our

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:45.460
directory services layer,
and they don't have to worry

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.770
about what the back-end storage
is for the user accounts or

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:50.540
any of the policy information.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.040
They can work with our
directory services API,

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.840
and it's very simple for them
to support a number of different

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.510
architectures on the back-end.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.820
They don't have to worry about it.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.840
So let's talk first a little
bit about Open Directory,

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:10.240
which is the way that
Mac OS X does directory services.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.740
Now it's based on open source
in many different areas.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:18.870
First, from the directory side of things,
it's based on OpenLDAT.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:22.500
So we take these open source tools
and we're using them in a lot of

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.300
our areas of our operating system.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:31.040
And when we talk about open directory
or an open directory system,

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:37.420
we talk about that being something that's
used on the client as well as the server.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:41.290
You may hear of a server being an
open directory master or a replica,

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:44.280
so those are specific to servers,
but on the clients,

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.210
open directory is still the method
that we connect into those servers,

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:50.200
so it's kind of an umbrella term.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:57.840
Now, there's really three areas that
make up the directory service

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:01.230
in open directory in Mac OS X.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:06.140
First is the LDAP server that pretty
much has a standard schema that

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.600
you'd expect on an LDAP server that
you would find in an organization.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.860
But we've also added Mac-specific
schema that can support additional

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:18.190
things like management and things
that apply specifically to the Mac.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.050
The next area is Kerberos.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.340
So we have MIT's Kerberos
as part of Open Directory,

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.200
and that's going to handle
your authentication.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:34.310
So very well respected, very widely used,
but not so easy to implement on

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.630
a number of different platforms.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.900
If you've ever tried to do this in Unix,
it's not always that

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.160
easy and straightforward.

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.700
So on Mac OS X,
it's a couple of button clicks,

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.600
and you've deployed a full,
on the server anyway,

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:51.010
you've deployed a full Kerberos system.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.750
And then the third key piece
of this is an open source piece

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.940
of technology called Sassl,
which we use as our password framework.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:03.500
So when we store passwords on the server,
the password goes in once,

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.520
and it's stored inside
of the Sassl framework,

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.160
security framework.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.670
And that password never
comes out of there again.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:11.200
It's a vault.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.080
It's simply,
when authentication is needed,

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.950
it verifies that the password is correct,
but that password is,

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:20.540
for all intents and purposes,
locked away.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.080
it's never gonna get out of there.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:28.050
Now the last thing that's really
great about Open Directory is

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:29.440
that it's plugin based.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.350
And we hear a lot about plugins
all over the operating system.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:37.940
This is one of the places
where it's extremely usable.

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.940
In fact, Apple's LDAP and built-in
directory services tools

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.670
are all plugins themselves.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.410
Okay, so we know that the plugin
architecture works well,

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:55.550
but one of the most widely used
plugins is Active Directory plugin.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:53:02.090
So let's take a little bit of a look at
that and how this works in the platform.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.990
So just the last slide,
you heard me mention that

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:11.380
Open Directory was based
on LDAP and Kerberos.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.460
Well, what a surprise.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.420
Active Directory is based on
LDAP and Kerberos as well.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:22.840
Yeah, they probably have some
secret sauce in there,

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.600
right?

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:23.600
But...

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.540
They're essentially built
on the same technology,

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.140
so why can't they work
together pretty easily,

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:30.220
right?

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:34.170
That allows us with our
Active Directory plugin to bind

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.440
a Mac OS X client or server

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:54.400
[Transcript missing]

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.300
Well,
you may not want to sit at every machine

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.720
and use the command line to do that,
but what about if you had automated

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:03.790
scripts that could use that
DSConfigAD tool and automatically

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.440
configure and bind machines as soon as
they're imaged and put on the network?

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:13.790
So a very easy way to bind those
machines into your directory service.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:19.000
Now what's also great
is if you're an admin,

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:27.250
you can configure it so that every
machine that's bound to your network,

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:30.290
you can sit down in front of and
still authenticate as an admin,

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.290
even if the user that's using
the machine has just standard

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.290
user policy given to them.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.820
Now we can also do some nice
things like cached local accounts.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.940
So if your machine is
connected to the network,

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.840
that's great.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.140
But what if you're on a laptop and you
want to disconnect from the network?

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:46.150
One of the things we can do is
cache that account and those

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:49.880
credentials locally on the machine,
unplug from the network, walk away,

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:51.830
you can still authenticate
to that machine.

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:56.560
So it's authentication
information is stored,

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.490
encrypted on the machine,
and you can still authenticate

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.020
no matter where you are.

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:06.240
You can also have a local
or a network home directory.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.940
So if your active directory has a
network home directory already stored,

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.120
a location for that
already stored for you,

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.990
you're going to pick that
up and automatically use it.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.020
We can also configure this so that
you can have a local home directory.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.350
Now that goes great in combination
with the local cached accounts.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.760
So when you leave the office,
you have your cached credential,

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.650
you also have your home
directory available with you,

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:29.850
and you can also configure that
to automatically sync back to

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:31.780
your network home directory.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.660
So when that data changes,
when you're on the road, you come back,

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.770
plug in,
you can have it sync back to your

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.240
home directory on your Windows Server.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.700
Now additionally,
we've got a couple of classes

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.780
that you may want to or sessions
that you may want to attend.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.500
There's a directory services
lab that will allow you to play

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.520
with all of these technologies
and see how they work hands-on.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.360
And then there's another session,
extending and troubleshooting directory

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.680
services that I highly recommend,
specifically if you're looking

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.700
at active directory integration.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.480
Next, let's cover policy management.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.540
As I mentioned,
Mac users are probably used to

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.020
this term as client management.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.490
But because this is talking
specifically from an IT perspective,

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.250
probably from a
Windows type of perspective,

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:25.140
we're going to continue to use
policy management as our term.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:29.060
And this is basically about controlling
your user's work environment,

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:29.800
right?

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.660
So we use it in a number of ways.

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.960
First of which is to
enforce our IT policies,

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.380
right?

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:40.020
We're IT, we got policies,
let's enforce them, right?

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.740
Don't let people do this,
don't let them do that,

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.010
make sure they do it this way.

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:48.410
We also can push out
application preferences,

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:50.930
or at least default
application preferences anyway.

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.240
If we don't want them with iTunes,
we don't want them to be able

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.970
to go to the iTunes store,
we can push out maybe a

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.000
preference that keeps them
from visiting the iTunes store.

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:08.520
Now additionally,
policy management can be stored and

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.450
pushed out using our directory services.

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.780
So kind of a great one-two punch.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.620
Directory services and policy management,
they go great together.

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.030
And this is the same
way we do it on the Mac.

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:22.710
So whether you're bound
to Active Directory or

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:27.080
Open Directory on the Mac,
we can still push out client management

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.510
and policy information that way.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.450
Now,
it can be stored in AD or Open Directory,

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:39.060
but if you're going to do further
work in the policy management area,

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:44.280
if you want to use
Active Directory by itself alone

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.330
and not integrate any other systems,
you're going to probably want to

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:53.230
install schema extensions into
Active Directory that allow you to

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:58.640
then add the attributes that Apple uses
to control policy information.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.030
Okay, it's about 24 attributes.

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.170
If you're interested in this,
talk to your Apple rep.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:09.480
They can get you discussions with
Apple's professional services group.

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.230
They can provide a little bit
more information in that area if

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.840
you want to extend that schema.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.720
They've got a lot of experience
doing that over the last few years.

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.130
Now, if you don't want to change
your Active Directory server or

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:27.170
you have policies against that,
one of the things you can do is bind

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:32.020
your Mac for user authentication,
user accounts to Active Directory,

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:37.600
and then have your Mac also pick up
policy information from Open Directory.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:42.730
So a dual binding capability,
and that allows you to do that as well.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:47.060
So it does require that you have
Mac OS X Server in that environment,

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:51.870
but it works very well and is an
easy way to overcome IT that's

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:53.880
nervous about extending the schema.

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.590
We do recommend schema as
probably the best way to do it,

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.620
but you can do it either way.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.030
Additionally,
there are some third-party tools that

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:05.180
you could look at if either of those
aren't going to work well for you.

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.520
And the first tool is
Admin Mac from Thursby.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.470
They've been around for
quite a while doing this.

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:15.440
They do allow you to do policy
management without extending your schema.

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.330
And then...

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:26.250
If you're also looking to have
additional types of clients,

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.710
also integrate into
Active Directory such as Linux,

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:33.590
Unix, a number of other additional
platforms other than Windows.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:38.490
Centrify has software that can allow
you to bind your Macs in and not allow

00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:40.220
you to have to extend your schema.

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.180
So a couple of tools.

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.360
There are more out there.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.360
Just use Google, find them.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:52.430
Now let's talk specifically policy
management from a very basic perspective,

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.570
just on a local machine level.

00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.780
We mentioned parental controls,
and they're a little bit misleading

00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:01.780
because that's how it happens
to be represented in the GUI.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.780
But parental controls allow us to do some
basic restrictions on local accounts.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.430
We can regulate application usage.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:13.620
So you can say these
applications you can't run,

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:16.400
these are applications you can run.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.500
We can restrict websites and say,
"These are ones you can access,

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.370
these you can't." We can log those.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.230
We can also monitor email on
the account that's attached,

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.720
the email account that's
attached to that system.

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:33.300
We can log chats if you need to,
depending on policy.

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:36.100
And you can also use time restrictions.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.190
So you can say this user can only
log in between these time periods

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.240
or this user can only use the
computer for this amount of time.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:46.990
Okay, sounds great for restricting
kids' access to a computer.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.150
So that's probably where we
get the parental controls from,

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.720
right?

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.980
Now, you can also use this in
combination with a guest account.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.880
Okay, so combine those two together.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:02.000
You do have some capabilities for
doing policy management locally without

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.800
having to integrate a lot of extra

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:13.500
[Transcript missing]

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.070
If you have Mac OS X Server and
you've got Workgroup Manager,

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.300
that's kind of a last resort.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:24.530
You can run that locally on a computer
and apply policy to specific accounts on

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.180
that computer using Workgroup Manager.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.500
It's kind of a last ditch.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.660
If you absolutely have to
configure somebody's policy and

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:35.960
that's the only way to do it,
Workgroup Manager can work against the

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.680
local account database in that regard.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:49.270
So from a little bit more
advanced perspective,

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.270
let's look at a server-based
deployment scenario.

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:52.400
So we talked about it,
we can extend the schema.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.780
We bind Macs to
Active Directory with our plugin.

01:01:57.010 --> 01:02:00.290
We manage users using our
normal Active Directory tools,

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:00.970
right?

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:04.190
Using the tools that Microsoft gives you.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.460
In that scenario though,
you would use Workgroup Manager and

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.410
you would authenticate against
Active Directory with our tool,

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:19.260
and that would allow you to manage
the Apple specific sections where

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.200
it specifically applies to policy.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:21.990
Okay.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.400
So it does require that extended schema,
but you manage policy

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.990
with Workgroup Manager.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.180
That's important.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.200
Windows cannot create our policies.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.090
Okay.

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:34.420
We have to create them with our own tool.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.070
And those policy settings are then
delivered with our directory service,

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.740
which is the Active Directory plugin.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.590
You can apply policy at the
user group computer level,

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.280
and you can also do
combinations of those,

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.300
and we'll composite those
policies together if needed.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.360
And what's great is if you
have those offline accounts

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.700
or those cached accounts,
we also cache that policy information

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.760
so when you leave the network,
you still have that enforcement on the

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.250
account that you're using to log in.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.490
So just because you leave
the network and go home,

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:10.120
it doesn't mean that you can get
around the policy that IT has

01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:11.660
enforced on that computer.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.540
Now, if you're interested in more
information in this area,

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:19.170
there's the Managed Clients
Lab and also Managing Clients

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.750
and Preferences Session 517.

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:25.620
So two great areas where you can
find more information on this.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.530
And now Jason's gonna come up,
he's gonna give you a

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:37.550
demo of Workgroup Manager,
specifically in the area

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:44.060
of policy management,
and show you some of the powerful

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:44.060
things that you can do with Workgroup
Manager in managing your Macs.

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:44.060
Jason, over to the demo.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:48.620
So at this point,
I'm once again back in Workgroup Manager.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.230
And up at the top here,
before we were looking at accounts,

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.750
so this was where we saw some
of the settings about basic and

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.870
advanced settings related to
the particular user account.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.660
But if I click over here to Preferences,
this is how I'm actually going

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.240
to go ahead and manage my policy.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.630
So as you look through here,
there's some different types

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:04.860
of policy I can manage.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.660
For example, mobility settings,
if I want to set up login

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:09.420
accounts for mobile accounts.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.740
I can come in and look at
universal access settings.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.720
Depending on the types of settings,
they are available in

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.860
different categories.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:20.840
So for example, if you take a look here,
I have, what, 13 items right now.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.340
If I look at a group, I'm sorry, if I,
yeah, there we go.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.340
If I come over here and
I look at a computer account,

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.070
I actually get a couple extra settings.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.090
So for example, this allows me to look
at time machine settings.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.620
Depending on the type of
preferences you're trying to manage,

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.100
they may be managed at different levels.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.660
And you can actually manage
several of them on multiple levels.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.610
So for example,
maybe I want to have a group of

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.400
users who have a particular set of
applications launched when they log in,

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:51.070
while I want one user to have a
different set of applications.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.100
I can configure that easily using
Policy Management and Workgroup Manager.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.300
So I'm just going to set up my
Joe demo account here with a

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.480
couple quick policy settings.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.060
Again, I have the same options under
parental controls that you would

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.480
find in the system preferences
panel on a standard computer,

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.400
on a standard client workstation.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.280
But I have an ability to manage
this at a directory service level,

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:18.900
so I can push this out to an entire
organization through one set of settings.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:21.170
Now, across the top,
when you're looking at this interface,

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:22.800
you'll see a few different options here.

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:24.420
Never manage the settings.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.460
And the interesting thing about this is
when you first start working with this,

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.430
this isn't like an ACL rule where
it'll keep it from happening if

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.120
you have it managed elsewhere.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.320
So, for example, if I'm,
I may not be managing the parental

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.670
control settings at a user level,
but if I'm managing

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.310
them at a group level,
those group level

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.840
settings will still apply.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.960
This doesn't mean it
will stop applying them.

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.340
You'll also see an
option here for always.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.290
And basically what this will do
is make it so that the user cannot

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:53.060
even change the option in the app.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:58.390
So, if I set these settings in here,
they go into the...

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:05.200
- So, just a quick one here.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.650
I'm gonna say I'm gonna always manage and
I'm gonna do some basic limiting to limit

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.520
the user to a specific set of sites.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.010
And I'm just gonna say local.

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.210
So they won't be able to get off
anything but the site that's on the

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:21.710
server itself that I'm using here.

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:23.290
Go ahead and click Done.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:27.040
And now I want to come back in
and I'm going to manage some login

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.120
settings for the user so that I want
to have a particular set of login

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.890
items load when they first log in.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.000
Now, you'll notice here I have the
option to set this option once.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.360
So basically, if I want to set kind of
some defaults for my users,

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.820
I can set the manage policy in
here to say I want to have it,

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:44.200
you know,
for the first time the user logs in,

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.890
I want them to load address book.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.930
But then if they decide they don't want
address book to load when they log in,

01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:51.520
it's able to be disabled.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:56.280
So we'll actually go ahead
and say address book here.

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:01.930
And just a couple other options in here,
like you have Network Home SharePoint for

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:03.490
network home users,
Group SharePoints for

01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:04.510
when they're in a group.

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:06.370
A lot of stuff you can set
in here depending on what

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.510
you're also working with.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.970
For example,
if we were working with a computer

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:13.740
account instead of a user account,
I can set login scripts and such.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.240
I'm just gonna do a couple other
little things just to mix up what

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.950
the user's account's gonna look like.

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.790
I'm gonna push the dock over
to the left side of the screen.

01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:29.740
Let's see.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:33.800
And now I'm gonna go ahead and just to
take a look at the information here,

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.500
I have, if you look next to these icons,
I have this little

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.220
darkened arrow in a circle,
and that actually indicates quickly

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.180
to me that I'm managing policy
for this user at that setting.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.340
So for this account, Joe Demo,
I can see just at a glance that I'm

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.640
managing those three sets of preferences.

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:52.900
While if I look at this
podcast admin account,

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:56.330
I can see clearly that there's
no management going on.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.100
If I click over here to the Details tab,
I get a little further information

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.050
about what's being managed.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.790
So, for example,
if I look at the doc settings

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.080
here and I click the pencil,
it'll actually show me what

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.950
preferences are specifically
being managed for the doc.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.450
Now, the interesting thing about this is
what's really being manipulated on the

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.300
back end is what we call property lists.

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.000
These are just simple
XML formatted files that,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.530
or in some cases binary file formats,
that contain the specific

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.660
settings that are being managed.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.990
So,
much as Brian was talking about earlier

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:28.470
where you'll find these inside your
home folder inside library preferences,

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.370
what you're doing is forcing the
values in those files so that

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.210
when the user logs in and they go
to open a particular application,

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.480
it's going to look at that file and those
settings are all going to be in place.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.670
An additional nice thing about
this is you can have what's

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:43.640
called preference manifests.

01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:46.210
And Brian alluded to this earlier
where if I have a particular

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.310
application that I want to manage
that's not necessarily in this list,

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.810
I can take the preferences file for
it and I can drop it into this box and

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:56.470
make use of those preferences and manage
them even though it's not necessarily

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.670
built in as part of the original
infrastructure for the application.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.130
For example,
if I come over here and I look,

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.440
I really don't have any time
machine preferences managed and

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.310
I don't even have an ability to
manage them for my user account.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:11.010
But maybe I want to keep that
box from popping up saying,

01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:13.510
do I want to use this as a
time machine drive every time

01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:15.260
I plug in a new FireWire drive?

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.840
Well, what I can do is click plus here
and right on my desktop I have a

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.950
file that has the preference in it.

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.520
And now I can see I've added a new
preference to the list for time machine.

01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:27.280
And if I look at the settings
for that particular one,

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:30.980
I can see that here's the do not
offer new disks for backup option.

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:32.680
And I'm just going to move
that to always manage.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.380
And now at this point,
this user should not

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.580
get that option anymore.

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.930
It won't pop up the box
and won't annoy your users.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.430
So now that I've set all
these different preferences,

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.860
I'm just going to go ahead and test
them out so I can show you it in action.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.090
And as I'm logging in,
you can see my docs on the

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:52.580
left side of the screen.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.260
Address book popped open for me.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.780
And even though I have all
these different drives on here,

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.120
Time Machine's not giving me any trouble.

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.510
So that's just a quick overview
of some of the different things

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:02.820
you can do with policy management.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.570
Again, it's a very flexible system,
I think more so than even group

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.400
policy on the Windows side,
because you can manage far more options

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.920
than are traditionally available to you.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.310
Brian.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.200
Thanks, Jason.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.380
And now the last area that
we're gonna cover today,

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.300
system deployment.

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.480
Now there are really three areas
of system deployment that we talk

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.340
about when we talk to customers.

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.100
First is, how do we image that system?

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.760
Whether it's out of the box from a
reseller or out of the box and we've

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.920
done something to it at our corporate
headquarters and distributed it.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.900
So how do we image that system?

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.230
How does it get to us?

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:47.600
What shape is it in?

01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:51.420
Then how do we inventory that hardware
and software that's on the computer,

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.800
both initially and over time,
how do we keep up with updates?

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.800
And then finally,
maintaining that system,

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.700
software updates,
keeping it running well.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.750
Sometimes we may have to push out an
additional script to do some changes,

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.790
some fundamental changes to our system.

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:09.790
So really those three areas.

01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:12.880
We'll talk about how we do
system deployment in a couple

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:14.800
of different environments.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.790
So first is Windows.

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:21.930
A lot of people use a very popular
Ghost program to do their imaging.

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:26.940
Sometimes it's local with a boot floppy
or a boot CD and they'll kick it off.

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:32.750
And a lot of times that's Pixie
booted and they'll restore

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.750
a machine over the network.

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.820
And typically you're using
the Windows.msi files,

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.050
and you're going to push
those out in some manner,

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:44.680
whether it's the Windows tool
itself or some third-party tool.

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:47.150
Now,
there are also a variety of tools on the

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:50.200
Windows side to do system management.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.120
So you may be using one of those
various tools today to already do that,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.080
or Windows, the Microsoft tools.

01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:02.730
And they're using software maintenance
options on the platform as well to

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:08.580
do your push of software and security
updates beyond initial deployment.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.080
So how does that map kind
of to the Mac experience?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.680
Well, we're gonna talk about the
Mac in a couple of areas.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.640
First, a very simple Mac deployment.

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.820
Let's say you have under 10
Macs that you're working with,

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.070
but you know you want 100 or 1,000 later,
right?

01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:28.580
So let's talk about the small deployment.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.930
Well, you're gonna build a master
image typically on a,

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.520
find your newest Mac,
and you're gonna build that system,

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.470
make it perfect exactly as
you want it to be deployed.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.420
And you're going to create a
disk image of that deployment,

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:43.290
of that hard drive.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.490
And once you have that image,
you can then use a number of

01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:47.920
different tools to deploy it.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.180
You can use disk utility
to create that image.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.540
You can also use a number of shareware
tools that are on the market to do that.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.130
Just Google those.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.160
And typically, you're going to deploy
it with a FireWire drive.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.940
A lot of people will boot the
system up with a FireWire drive

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:08.110
and then go ahead and deploy that
image right onto the hard drive,

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:09.950
write it out, and image it.

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:13.530
Now, one of the things you can do
is with Apple Remote Desktop,

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:18.580
you manage those systems in
Apple Remote Desktop and periodically

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:23.540
have them talk back to the
Apple Remote Desktop server product,

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.610
and they'll upload their
software information and their

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:30.010
hardware specs automatically.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.690
Once they're uploaded, they're in the
Apple Remote Desktop database,

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:36.270
and you can do queries
against that anytime you want.

01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:38.860
So even if the computers
have been shipped off,

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:41.880
somebody's in Africa on a
photo shoot using a computer,

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.320
that information has been stored in a
local database in Apple Remote Desktop.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.590
You can always query it.

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:53.350
And then you can also push software
updates using Apple Remote Desktop.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:58.700
So grab a group of machines
that you've deployed,

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:01.970
Tell it you want to
install a specific package,

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:06.260
software package, the PKG format,
and it'll go ahead and send those,

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.610
push those updates out to the computers.

01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:13.520
Either in real time, right as you ask it,
or if you're running

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.740
Apple Remote Desktop as a
client server type of model,

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.660
that server remote desktop copy is going
to sit there and watch the network and

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:24.520
wait for computers to join the network,
and when they do,

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:26.390
they'll go ahead and push
those updates out to them.

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.300
So a computer doesn't necessarily have
to be on the network right at the time

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.130
that you push an update for it to happen.

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.890
It will make sure that does happen.

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:37.820
Now, optionally,
you can configure your systems

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.580
to talk to Apple's remote,
I'm sorry,

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.040
Apple's software update server.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.680
So if you have Mac OS X Server,
you can turn on the software

01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:49.620
update server capability,
and it basically acts as a local proxy

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.980
for all of Apple's software updates.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.960
Now, this does a couple of things.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:59.380
It reduces the network load that you
might be using to do software updates

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.380
over your connection to the Internet.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:04.160
But really the most
important thing it does,

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.520
though, is it allows you to check
out a software update,

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.130
hold it in your system,
do some testing in your IT labs,

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.260
make sure that an update is something
that's not going to break anything

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.320
that you've got set up and configured,
and then when it's complete,

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.750
you can go ahead and release
that and allow it to go through

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:25.360
the software update process,
and the machines can then find it,

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.840
install that software update.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.710
So a couple of great uses for that.

01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:33.740
Let's look at a little bit
more of an advanced deployment.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:37.180
You build and create your
images basically the same way.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.490
But in an environment where
you've got hundreds of machines

01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:44.440
now or maybe thousands,
let's think of a campus environment even,

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:49.360
you'd probably deploy that
image using a Netboot server.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.550
And for that,
you'd need a Mac OS X server

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.160
running the Netboot server,
and the system can boot off

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.320
of that and image the machine
right off of the Netboot server.

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.420
So, in a great way,
especially in a distributed environment

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.780
where you can just simply press,
hold down the N key,

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:12.400
the system can boot up over
the network and image itself.

01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:15.460
You can then configure the client to
pull updates from Software Update Server,

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.010
as we mentioned in the last deployment.

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:25.570
And in most cases, imaging, inventorying,
and distributing third-party software,

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.470
you may even be,
you may want to use a system

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.640
that you already have in place.

01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:33.320
A lot of systems that
people have to do that with

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.740
Windows already support the Mac.

01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:38.650
Okay, so just check and see if
you have a Mac client.

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:45.180
Okay, so some of those include Altares,
FileWave, Landesk, LandRev,

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:47.840
great product, and RadMinder Puppet.

01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:51.300
So some of you may already be
using some of these tools or you're

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.440
interested in some cross-platform tools.

01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:55.560
Those are some great options.

01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:57.950
Okay,
so if you're interested in this area,

01:16:57.950 --> 01:17:02.460
you're probably gonna wanna look at
managing Macs with NetBootPrefs and ARD,

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.450
session 908.

01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:10.580
So what have we learned?

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:13.880
Okay, I'm the only thing keeping you
from pizza out in the hallway,

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.220
so we'll cover this pretty quick.

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:16.620
What have we learned today?

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.840
Well, Macs really are standards-based,
right?

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:22.760
We're so standard, in fact,
that you can take Windows,

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:27.340
install it on the Mac via Boot Camp,
and it will run, okay?

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.000
So very standards-based hardware.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.020
Second, knowledge is transferable.

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:35.320
So some of you that are
MCSEs or Unix admins,

01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:38.760
or if you have those types of
people back at your offices,

01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:42.480
you can see that through the
GUI or through the command line,

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.890
most of that knowledge that they have
is very easily transferable to the Mac.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.060
We've also seen that it's very
easy to leverage existing resources

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.540
that you have in your environment.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:57.240
So whether it's Active Directory that
you already have deployed,

01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:04.310
it's very, very easy to use those
existing systems that you have.

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:09.800
The key though is if you're kind of new
to the platform and you're just starting,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.520
start simple.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.960
You don't have to go for the most
advanced management options right away.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:21.470
Start simple and as it meets your
needs or you start to outgrow that,

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:26.210
then migrate up to a little bit
more advanced way to do some things.

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:29.240
And lastly, I can't stress this enough.

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:32.580
Take what you've seen here today,
because this is not a very deep dive,

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.840
as we said.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.320
Take the information you've seen
today and go to the detail sessions.

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:41.040
They'll be able to answer most
of your questions there as well.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:45.380
And so that's really where you're gonna
get the most out of this is the sessions.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.520
So I've listed them up
here just very briefly,

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.070
just as the same ones that we've covered.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.660
I won't read through these.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.970
These are all the IT track,
the orange sessions.

01:18:56.230 --> 01:19:00.140
Okay, and one last page that
we want to cover here.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.350
These are the labs, so hands-on,
get to see how this stuff works.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.640
And then lastly,
when you leave here or later

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.410
tonight on your iPhones,
you've got some great resources on

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:12.940
the internet that I wanted to mention.

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:16.640
Apple.com slash ITPro,
that's a great resource.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.190
It has a lot of Apple white papers
for a lot of the things that

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.640
we've already spoken about today.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.300
Developer.apple.com slash documentation.

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:28.150
There's Mac OS X client and
Mac OS X server areas on there that

01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:30.880
have some great detail information.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.570
And then also MacEnterprise.org
and AFP548.com,

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:39.660
two great resources if you need to
find a little bit more detail in a

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:44.200
certain area or want to pose a question
for the internet to answer for you.
