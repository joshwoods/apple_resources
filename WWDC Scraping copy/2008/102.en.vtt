WEBVTT

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.430
We are going to talk about
your organization's first Macs.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.400
With me today will be Ian Kelly,
Senior Systems Engineer,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.540
and we're also going to have
a short demo on some things,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.180
but I want to ask a
couple questions first.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.500
First off, how many people have
never been to WWDC before?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.120
This is your first time.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.050
Excellent.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.180
You're in the right place.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.440
Secondly, how many of you have never
administered Macs before?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.960
Good, you're in the right place.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.080
Welcome.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.030
When we get started,
we have some people that

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.900
we want to talk to today.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.410
We want to talk about the Mac user
in a Windows-dominated environment.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.030
We want to talk about
the Mac support staff,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240
the island of Mac people.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.390
And we want to speak to you,
the Windows IT administrator who's

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.090
now been handed the Mac support.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.850
What are you going to learn?

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.550
You're going to learn strategies for
gaining acceptance and offering support

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.240
for the Macs within your organization.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.720
We're going to talk
about migration planning.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.220
We're going to talk about
building acceptance for the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.300
Macs within your organization.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.070
And we're going to see with a couple of
case studies how others have done this.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.600
What we're not going to learn,
this is not a full and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.850
complete deployment session.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.670
It's not a detailed integration session.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.620
That's not what it's about.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.100
It's not an imaging session.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.180
However, there are other sessions this
week that I urge you to go to.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.120
You'll see them on the
slides a little bit later on.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.360
For example,
the Directory Services Troubleshooting

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060
session later on this week.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.720
Excellent session and I urge
you to go to that as well.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.410
We're not gonna talk about patch
management and this isn't a quick

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.480
and dirty shortcut way to do this.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.400
We wanna give you real solid
strategies for supporting your Macs.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.870
So let's look at the Mac people.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.340
Who are they?

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.000
Well, I'm one of them.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.410
You have a new Mac user.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.930
It's an executive, maybe a superior.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.400
They don't really have
a technology background,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.400
but they have a Mac.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.520
They may not speak all the Mac stuff yet.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.970
They may not call it a doc.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.760
They may not really understand it,
but they've got it.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.190
The value is placed on the integration.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.100
And if you're the IT administrator,
they don't care about your feelings.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.900
They write your check.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.490
Make my Mac work.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.020
What they'll use?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:07.140
Mail, Safari, maybe iWork, maybe iLife,
probably Microsoft Office,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.390
and they may have a Mac at home.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.770
And as we're going to see
a little bit later on,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.390
if they have a Mac at home,
they're probably a local administrator.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.500
and chances are in your
Windows environment,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.510
you don't allow your Windows people
to run as local administrators.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.420
Not a good idea.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.500
So there's a little bit of
re-education that has to go on here.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.610
We'll talk about that.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.850
The other set of Mac people
are the Mac Island,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.460
right?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.000
It's a small group,
maybe a graphic design group.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.930
They're self-managed,
they're isolated from the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.140
corporate IT strategy.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.180
They just, they don't get any
love from corporate IT.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.100
and the Mac IT staff.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.040
Maybe one person, right?

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.480
Not supported by IT.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.480
They're forced into the back.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.530
At this time I'd like
to bring up Ian Kelly.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.900
and Ian's going to talk about
the Windows side of things.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.980
Ian?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.540
Thanks.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.960
So how many people here before
we start are actually current or

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.900
former Windows administrators?

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.390
Okay, good.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.860
So as Schoun said,
I'm a systems engineer with Apple Canada.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.240
I cover the whole of Ontario up there.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.120
And in a previous life,
I was a Microsoft guy.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.780
I spent my entire life doing NT to 2000,
2003 migrations, exchange migrations,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.700
probably more migrations than
I can actually care to remember.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.260
And now I'm a system engineer at Apple.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.440
So it's a transition that can be made
and can be made very successfully.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.280
So what's the profile that we're looking
at for the Windows administrator?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.370
Typically,
you're looking at someone who is

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.000
probably overworked and probably
spends most of their time doing

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.920
maintenance and or recovery rather than
looking at ways to push the boundary,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.770
look at new technologies and look at
ways of making the working environment

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.060
for users better and more efficient.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.690
A lot of time will be spent
with things like making sure

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.670
that antivirus is up to date,
pushing out hot fixes and a lot of these

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.740
will be happening out of hours typically.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.880
So you'll be doing your nine to five
stuff and then working evenings and

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.650
weekends to do stuff on the servers when
you can actually have some downtime.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.840
and then there's Vista.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.590
So what's the typical environment that
the Windows IT admin is working in?

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.080
We're looking at, obviously, nowadays,
a large,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.120
complex Active Directory environment
where things like group policies

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.840
are pushed down to users,
the desktop is managed,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.910
and applications that can or can't
be launched and printers are set up

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.710
and all that kind of stuff as well.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.520
There are some probably very
extensive security policies and

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.460
guidelines about what you can
do and can't do on the Internet,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.500
what you can do with email and
what you can't do with email.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.160
And typically,
you don't have much of a life.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.160
And certainly, for my part,
towards the end of my

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.630
career as a Microsoft guy,
there was a lot of Mac envy,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.550
seeing the way that things could
be done and seeing that maybe the

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.420
grass was greener somewhere else.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.770
So what are the kind of questions that
IT management ask or obstacles they might

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.160
raise and put in your path when you're
looking at this kind of transition?

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.040
Well, firstly,
it's always kind of a financial

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.660
human resources thing.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.160
Well,
we can't afford to hire any more staff

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.330
and you can't find these Mac guys.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.910
Where do you find a Mac guy
and how do they train them?

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.460
There's no training for this.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.160
It's kind of a dark art thing.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.070
And certainly we can't afford to
double our resources and have a whole

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.260
bunch of Windows guys and a whole
bunch of Mac guys at the same time.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.860
So what are the important things to know?

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.640
Well, as I said earlier,
the skills are transferable.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.450
I spent seven or eight years as
a Windows sysadmin and I made

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.130
that transition to understanding
how the Mac works pretty easily.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.510
I mean,
the skills that you're understanding,

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.350
the foundations, things like networking,
are all completely the same on the Mac.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.460
So once the foundations are solid,
the transition is quite easy.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.950
I know a number of great Mac sysadmins
who used to be Windows sysadmins.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.720
Especially anyone that's
managing Unix right now,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.940
and particularly Solaris,
they make fantastic Mac guys.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.130
And I have a customer
of mine back in Toronto.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.200
He has been using Solaris
for about 20 years.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.420
And I spent a day with him to show him
just the little intricacies of how the

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.770
Mac is slightly different to Solaris.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.030
And he's never bothered me
with another question since.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.620
To highlight this,
I'm going to talk a little

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.890
bit about a company based in
Toronto called Core Feature Animation.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.050
They're an animation company and about
two years ago they did an animated

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.240
movie with Disney called The Wild.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.660
And they had a decision from the
start that all of the 3D animation

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.260
was going to happen on Linux machines,
but everything else was going to be Mac.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.400
And it was the same kind of deal
that Schoun spoke about earlier

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.450
that basically the head of the
company was a Mac guy and he loved

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.520
Apple products and said we're going to
be using them wherever it makes sense.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.180
So they had around,
it was a two to one ratio.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.310
They had 400 Linux machines for all
of their 3D and everything else,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.130
all of the Final Cut editing,
all of the shape compositing and

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.210
all of the systems administration.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.040
By that I mean like the production
scheduling and all that kind

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.500
of stuff was handled on Macs.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.030
And their headcount was basically
one senior full-time admin for

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.220
the Macs with a half-time junior
and five senior Linux assistants.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.230
So they had around,
it was a two to one ratio.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.260
They had 400 Linux machines for all
of their 3D and everything else,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:48.280
all of the Final Cut editing,
all of the shape compositing and

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.560
all of the systems administration.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.570
admins and six full-time juniors.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.830
So really we're looking at a
ratio of 2:1 on the machines

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.880
with a ratio of around 11:1,
or 11:1.5 on the actual

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.590
overhead for managing them.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.110
Talk about strategies.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.110
Now we're going to delve into some
kind of finer-grain strategies,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.930
and I'm going to hand back to Schoun
to talk about the first of those.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.280
Thank you, Ian.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.940
All right, so the strategy that we have,
we have five reality distortion

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.640
fields that are sometimes
considered pain points.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.240
They're not really,
and that's what we want to do.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.560
We want to dispel these myths.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.410
We want to give you strategies and
offer you support techniques for this.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.780
First off, we have networking.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.500
Integration, Management,
Deployment and Security.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.210
Okay,
so let's talk about networking first.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.520
The myth, our network is fine.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.180
We run dynamic DNS,
file transfers are fast,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.140
we don't have any problem.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.390
Besides, the Macs need AppleTalk,
I still hear this.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.910
Today, the Macs need AppleTalk,
it's chatty.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.500
We use Cisco's VPN.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.260
What's Bonjour?

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.050
How does that fit within my organization?

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.620
Can I control it?

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.660
I don't understand it.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.600
And maybe the Macs don't
really network all that well.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.140
So let's talk about DNS.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.500
Dynamic DNS, it's great, it's okay,
works well.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.240
How many people run Dynamic DNS in
their organizations now?

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.930
Okay, how many people run Static DNS?

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.900
Okay, you're probably a little happier.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.570
It's harder to manage,
takes a little more skill, but

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.940
Overall, it's a little bit better.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.480
With a Mac, straight out of the box,
DHCP is fine.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.710
You want to have DNS in order,
especially if you're going to

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.090
be running Mac OS X server.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.470
For example, if you're going to be
using static addresses,

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.520
you'll need pointer records,
you'll need the reverse records.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.220
Dynamic DNS may not always set these up,
you may have to go in

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.420
and put them in there.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.240
File sizes.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.410
A while ago, a few years ago,
I went to a large company in Islip,

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.190
New York.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.680
They had a NOC,
Network Operations Center,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.660
about the size of a
football field underground.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.340
It really,
Star Trek-like Network Operations Center.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.140
They had a graphic department,
they had a design department.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.780
And what happened was that the department
was complaining file transfers were slow.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.430
And they had, at that time,
a state-of-the-art server

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.760
sitting down on the NOC.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.760
Everything was great.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.010
But they had one switch for
the graphics department.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.570
So you had about 24,
25 Macs that were all

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.320
being piped through there.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:53.660
All we did was ask them to look
at the average file transfer size.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.210
The Macs were 250,
300 megabyte Photoshop files,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.250
these really large files that were
being transferred back and forth daily.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.900
And the IT staff just didn't have any
idea because all the other files and

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.110
everything else were relatively small.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.400
And just like most organizations,
those PowerPoint presentations

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.760
were attached as email.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.340
There was no limit.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.170
Hey,
let's send a 15 megabyte attachment to

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.190
the person in the cubicle next door.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:22.500
Why?

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.850
Because we can.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.850
So,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.400
When we showed them
that the Macs generally,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.530
if they're in a design department,
they use larger files.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.300
They all had a direct
line down to the server.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.240
Problem solved.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.500
It's also an excellent strategy
for putting it on XServe.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.050
AppleTalk.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.410
Macs can do AppleTalk for discovery.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.530
It's been deprecated, yes.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.320
They can't talk AppleTalk specifically,
but they can do it for discovery.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.150
And here's a little screenshot
showing that you can actually

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.420
check it and turn it on.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.060
And then we have the
Apple filing protocol,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.100
which runs over port 548, all right?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.780
Windows servers,
they just use AFP 2 old and busted.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.140
It's just services for Macintosh.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.980
Doesn't work anymore with the new Macs.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.780
You're gonna have problems with it.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.640
It's AFP 3.new hotness, right?

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.210
So there are a couple things
that we can do if you wanna

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.720
do file transfers this way.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.950
First off, you can turn to SMB.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.210
Mac OS X servers can be an SMB server.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.100
Macs can connect to SMBs.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.660
You can, if you need to,
you can transfer your files over SMB.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.800
It's not a problem.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.890
There's no client access licenses.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.180
You may have some file name excitement,
right?

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.280
If you've had Mac users that have
been using Macs since the 1800s,

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.520
chances are they probably put forward
slashes for dates in the file names.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.480
We know that Windows can't do that.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.970
So sometimes you have to
retrain the Mac users,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.780
don't do this anymore if
you're going to be transferring

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.120
these up to Windows machines,
here are the illegal characters you

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.080
can't use and so on and so forth.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.930
Also, there's a product called
ExtremeZIP from GroupLogic.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.740
It runs AFP on a Windows server.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.920
They do file and print services,
they do clustered services.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.810
So if you can't get a Mac OS X server
in your environment and you can't run

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:28.470
file services in your environment,
you can purchase ExtremeZIP and you

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.460
can run AFP on your Windows box.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.540
And this is an excellent
solution in certain cases

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.530
where the IT staff just said,
"Okay, fine,

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.130
we'll put Mac OS X clients in here,
but we are not going to put

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.450
a Mac OS X server in here.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.550
We're just not going to do it."

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.560
With respect to overall
networking on Mac OS X,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.500
networking is handled in the GUI,
the Network Preference Pane.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.780
There is a command line
tool called Network Setup.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.280
You can script it just like you can
do any other command line tool and

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.210
you can do everything from setting up
a new interface to changing DNS and

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.470
search domains and everything else.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.710
As you'll learn later on this week,
especially if you do a little

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.320
digging and you learn about launch D,
you can actually set up a launch

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.170
D item to watch for certain changes.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.770
For example,
let's say you have a launch D item

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.570
that watches for maybe a DNS failure.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.010
If it sees that a
DNS server has gone down,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.330
it can trigger a shell script that
runs network setup to actually redirect

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.290
it to a second DNS or a third DNS.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.720
If a user goes home and it
detects a different IP range,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.300
you can have it actually do automatic
network changes for the user.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.770
Network setup is an excellent
command line tool and I urge

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.390
you to take a look at it.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.630
We also have a plethora of
troubleshooting utilities from network

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.500
utility to ping to NS lookup to dig and
all the rest of the command line stuff.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.040
Really, really good tool.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:01.300
Macs do run wireless, 802.11b,
802.x and Leap and TTLS and

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.040
all the really good,
neat stuff that we need for security.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.290
And Macs run VPN.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:14.140
So I want to tell you another story
about another company in California.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:21.470
They ran a proprietary VPN service
and they paid client access

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.800
licenses for all their clients.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.930
And life was okay,
but they still had to pay this.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.370
They looked at
Mac OS X server's VPN server.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:39.420
It can work with Windows users
authenticating against the VPN server,

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.050
but there's no client access licenses.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.530
And in Leopard,
you can do VPN load balancing.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:52.390
So I can have six VPN servers
and I have 5,000 users.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.520
They're not all going
to slam the same server.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.840
It'll do round robin load balancing.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.770
I can also purchase RSA or CryptoCard.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:06.010
They're both supported by
Mac OS X right in the GUI.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:06.010
So if I need token-based authentication.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:12.240
This company basically changed over
from using a third-party client

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:18.670
access licensed VPN server to using
a Mac OS X server as a VPN server.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.840
and there are no client access licenses.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.190
They realize their savings immediately.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.200
Bonjour.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.200
Bonjour is based on zero-conf.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.810
It does four things.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.440
Apple has it doing three of them.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.740
First,
automatic discovery of local resources.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.590
I have a printer, I have something else,
I plug it in, boom, it shows up.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.280
Automatic Address Assignment.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.600
I get a 169.254 if I don't
automatically get an IP address.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:56.600
All Macs have 169.254
in their routing table,

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.790
even if they have an IP address.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.040
In other words,
I can have two Macs on the same subnet.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.900
One of the Macs could
have a 172.16 address.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.580
Another Mac could have a
24-dot something IP address,

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.580
totally not in the same subnet,
on the same network,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.170
and they can transfer files.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:22.840
Why?

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.890
Because the 169.254 route
is in the routing table.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.680
It's hard coded in there.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.740
This is a tremendous advantage.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.880
Secondly, automatic name resolution.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:41.800
So in other words, we can put a name in,
just like Microsoft wins and NetBias.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.390
So we can do automatic name resolution.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.430
Behind the scenes,
all the networking is handled by configd,

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:54.160
that's the daemon that handles
all the networking in Mac OS X.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.220
You can have multiple active
interfaces by default.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.480
I can have wireless active,
I can have Ethernet

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.590
active at the same time,
can have two DHCP addresses

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.800
at the same time,
but I can have one static

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.620
and one DHCP address.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.050
And the interfaces can be reprioritized
without you losing connectivity.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.430
For example,
if you have a VPN interface and you

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.950
want all your traffic to go over VPN,
you can simply drag that

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.340
interface up to the top.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:27.350
It'll remain inactive as
soon as you connect to VPN.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.350
It'll move itself to the top
and all the traffic will be

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.350
pushed over the VPN connection.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.190
So what's the strategy with networking?

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.800
We want to showcase the Macs
networking extensibility.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.460
It is extremely extensible,
extremely powerful, and very,

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.780
very efficient.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.330
We want to provide solutions
instead of workarounds.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.150
And if you're talking
to the network IT staff,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:53.210
you want to be extremely
concise about your topics.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.540
So if you're a Mac person,
if you're the Mac island,

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:02.540
these are some excellent strategies for
you to get your Macs onto the network.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.430
If you're the Windows IT administrator,

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.400
You may need extreme ZIP.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.560
If you're not going to let a
Mac OS X server do AFP on your site,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.090
look at extreme ZIP as a solution.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.990
If you're running SMB and
you don't have any problem,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.620
there's no real changes that you need.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.380
You don't really need
to change your network.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.220
You do need to look at
file transfer speeds.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.790
And

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:37.300
It may force you to clean up your DNS,
which is a good thing.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.070
At this time,
I'd like to bring Ian Kelly back

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.290
up to speak about integration.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.640
Five years at Apple and I'm
still talking about Windows.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.540
Yeah.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:57.230
Okay, so there's a lot of myths out
there around how Macs work with

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.780
Active Directory in a large environment.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.810
And there's also a lot of issues around
Macs connecting to Exchange servers.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.080
And we're going to talk a lot about that.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.300
We've got a demo as well in
this section to show you.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.550
So typically when we go in and
we speak to large enterprises,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.900
they're like, well,
we're running Active Directory and

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.490
we're always going to be
running Active Directory and

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.410
that's not going to change.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.010
And typically one of the
first things they say is,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.660
and we're not changing
Active Directory just to accommodate

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.810
these 20 Macs down in that building.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.780
That ain't gonna happen.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.240
And then we begin to talk to
them and show how the Macs can

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.540
integrate with Active Directory.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.540
And the Macs have integrated
with Active Directory since

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.860
the days of Panther and 10.3.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.320
And even before that,
they could integrate

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.300
with Active Directory,
but there was no actual specific

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.490
Active Directory plugin.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.360
So what does the
Active Directory plugin do?

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.840
Well,
it sits inside an application called

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.350
Directory Access or Directory Utility,
depending on whether you're

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.160
running Tiger or Leopard.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.330
And there's a command line
version of that GUI application

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.360
as well called dsconfig-ad,
which allows you to script everything

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.220
that you can do in the GUI and actually
push that out to multiple Macs at

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.510
once so they can all be configured
to bind into Active Directory.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.500
Let's take a look at the plugin
first in a little more detail.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.000
What we've got here is the first
screen that you will see and

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.700
basically you put in the domain
that you want to connect into.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.640
It figures out what the forest is
automatically from DNS and then you

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.000
specify the actual computer record
that you're going to use to bind into

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.410
Active Directory with and that gets
created in the computer's container.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.420
We can specify a number of different
options here at this screen as well.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.580
So working out what the home
directory path is gonna be,

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.500
if you're gonna be using SMB to do that,
and things like the user shell,

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.010
if you're gonna allow users terminal
access and things like that.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.760
On to the next thing,
we can do specific mappings

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.970
of Active Directory attributes
into the Macs as well because we

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.440
may not have those attributes.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.970
And so you can either do static
maps here and there's also a

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.140
place for dynamic maps as well.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.670
On the administration side,
we can specifically state which

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.220
domain we want to bind into,
which servers we want to use.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.620
And we can also specify which
Active Directory groups we want

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.550
to allow to be admins on the Mac.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.830
So if you have a specific
Active Directory group that does

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.140
desktop support or desktop management,
you can add those

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.720
Active Directory groups in here.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.720
And automatically when that user logs in,
a part of that group,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.240
they will have full admin
access on that local Mac.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.840
There's also a checkbox in there
to allow authentication to any

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.930
domain within the forest as well.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.360
So if you've got trust between domains,
you can take advantage

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.920
of that as well there.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:52.340
What we're doing here is specifying
a username with a password obviously

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.700
that has privileges to create computer
records in the Active Directory.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:02.140
And you can create a specific account for
that or a specific group of users that

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.840
are allowed to create computer accounts
and use any of those records here.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.060
Two little check boxes to allow
you to specify the settings

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.400
you're about to be used to be
automatically put into the Mac.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.580
So for things like authentication,
it'll automatically search

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.360
the Active Directory that
you've just bound into.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.900
And it'll also use that for
contacts as well so that when you're

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.340
doing lookups in address book,
it'll automatically pull

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.740
from Active Directory.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.660
So what does that look
like on the command line?

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.840
Well, it's dsconfig-ad and we're
using exactly the same example

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:31.940
as you saw in the GUI here.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.280
So we're specifying the
account is going to be Macbook,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.900
the username is winadmin,
it's going into the computer's

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:45.070
container in the Mac's OU for
the domain virusland.org.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.000
Under Leopard,
we introduced some specific new options

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.160
in DS Config AD that was specifically
tied around some changes that

00:24:53.160 --> 00:25:00.310
Microsoft made in Windows Server 2003
around the way that security is handled.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:06.270
Beforehand in Windows 2000 Server,
these were not specified

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.960
security policies.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.240
In 2003, they became enabled by default.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.220
And so we can now do packet
signing and packet encryption.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.730
These are both enabled by default,
so really you only need to go in and

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.650
worry about these if you're going
to disable them or specify they have

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.440
to be required as part of the bind.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.760
We can also specify the namespace
that we want to connect into.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.260
So if you have multiple domains within
a single forest and you have the same

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.570
username in two different domains,
then we can specify which actual

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.810
forest and domain we're connecting
to with this user record so we

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.080
actually log in as the right user.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.700
and there's also password intervals.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.360
So if you wanna cycle
the machine accounts,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.780
which Windows does with
Windows machines by default,

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.400
you can also specify this,
synchronize the number of days on the

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.640
cycle so that they're all tied up.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.800
Basically what I'm trying to say here is,
is there's no reason why the Macs binding

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.000
into Active Directory should be treated
any differently to the Windows machines

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.890
binding into Active Directory.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.230
If you need anything more,
right now there's one

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.160
other option for you.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.400
So if you're using
extensively DFS SharePoints,

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.240
right now if you want to
take advantage of those,

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.280
you'll need to use a product called
AdmitMac from Thursby Software,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.320
and they handle connection
to DFS SharePoints as well.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.410
While we're on the whole
directory services thing,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:23.120
binding into any other directory system,
if it's any open LDAP derivative,

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.300
there'll be no problem.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.690
And things like e-directory
work just fine too.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.970
Talk a little bit about Kerberos.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.440
Still to this day,
I've been into Windows environments

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.980
and spoken to Windows system
administrators who say,

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.740
"We don't run Kerberos.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.290
We have Active Directory."

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.580
Sorry to point it out to you,
but all of the cool features that

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.060
you get with Windows machines when
you bind to Active Directory and you

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.800
can log into any SharePoint without
supplying another username and password,

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.760
that's Kerberos.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.440
So the Macs now under
Leopard run Kerberos,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.130
they run Kerberos on the client
machines and obviously on

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.680
Mac OS X server we run Kerberos as well.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.200
So open directory is Kerberos,
it's open LDAP and

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.560
it's a password server.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.440
Basically exactly the
same as Active Directory.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.770
So the Macs can work well
with any kind of Kerberos.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.770
MIT Kerberos is obviously the default
that we're using and Active Directory,

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.720
Open Directory Kerberos
works just fine as well.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.430
So anywhere where you
want single sign-on,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.940
you want a user to be able to log
in and then access SharePoints on

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.380
servers across the network without
supplying another username and password.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.090
Once you've bound in with
the Active Directory plugin,

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.860
it creates the Kerberos records
for you and single sign-on

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.440
is handled from there on.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.020
Talk a little bit about Exchange Server.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.320
A lot of Exchange sysadmins
work on the assumption that

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.200
everyone connects via MAPI.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:44.120
Well, MAPI is Microsoft's messaging
application programming interface and is

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.600
specifically designed for connection into
Exchange Server from Microsoft Outlook.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.930
And as long as your Windows environment
is solely a Windows environment,

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.410
it works really well.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:54.730
Hard to argue with that.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.270
But as soon as you start looking at
clients on other platforms wanting

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.420
to connect to those Exchange Servers,
the whole MAPI thing falls down

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.680
because it's not available for any
other platform other than Windows.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.410
Even Microsoft's Exchange client,
if you like,

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.430
as part of Microsoft Office on the Mac,
doesn't use Mappy.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.900
It's not available on the Mac.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.470
So Microsoft Entourage uses WebDAV, LDAP,
SMTP, IMAP,

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.410
all the standard open protocols.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.550
Having said that,
Exchange 2007 now does not

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.990
ship with MAPI included.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.740
It's a free download if you want
to add that MAPI functionality

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.930
back into Exchange server,
but it looks like Microsoft are

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.780
beginning to move away from MAPI as well.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:41.480
On the Exchange support side of things,
outside of Microsoft Entourage right now,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.510
we don't have a lot,
but as Bertrand mentioned yesterday,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.200
Snow Leopard does have support
for Exchange connection,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.750
and I'd like to invite
Brendan Langoulant up to talk to

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.750
you a little bit about that now.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.220
Good morning.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.820
Switch to the demo machine.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.690
I'm the engineering manager,
I'm responsible for

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.480
Exchange on the desktop.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.560
Today I'm going to show you a little
bit of a demo of what actually is on

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:42.430
the seed CD plus a little bit more.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.010
The way that typical users will get
to exchange in environments is either

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.470
to use entourage or to use our.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.000
There we go.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.110
So what you see here is a
representation of what's on the

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.520
Exchange server as we speak.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.380
So what we've now got is,
if I show you Address Book,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.820
this is a typical default setup.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.890
There's nothing in Address Book yet,
so it's quite empty.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.490
The same goes for iCal.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.100
And then what we've got is
a way to set up an account.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.080
So again,
I'm launching mail at saying you need

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.290
to set up before you can do anything.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.590
And you'll notice much like we
have for Gmail and other things,

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:41.860
we have profiles.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.640
And so this profile is for that
particular Exchange server.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.560
We support Exchange Server 2007.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.520
And you'll notice that we actually
automatically will set up both

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.160
Address Book and iCal for you.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.070
So now we've connected
to the Exchange server.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.840
The Exchange server is running
at Apple at the moment.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.810
And we've downloaded the same mail.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.250
So if I show you, there's the mail.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.420
They're my contacts.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.110
There's my mail.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.220
If I cycle through these.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:26.500
[Transcript missing]

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:31.660
Likewise, for Address Book,
you can now see that the Address

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.410
Book's been fully populated with
all of my Exchange contacts,

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.870
making it a lot easier to actually
migrate into an Exchange environment.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.030
We can do global address list lookups.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.820
And it will return results
as you would expect.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.620
And then I guess finally,
if I show you iCal.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.360
And so again, iCal,
it's fully integrated.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.140
We've now got an Exchange account
which it's reading using EWS,

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.090
which is not to be confused with Hour.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.880
It's a different web service.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.940
And again,
all the things you would expect

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.400
of typical iCal integration.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.250
So I can move an event.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.900
I'm clearly not going to make
that 8 o'clock meeting today.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.740
If I go back to calendaring,
and you can see the event's been updated.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.760
So hopefully,
we're really going to make a lot

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.920
of people's lives a lot easier.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.210
We think that we're going to make
IT admin's lives a lot easier.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.360
And we're really going to make a lot of
users that are inside Exchange-dominated

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.500
environments a lot easier.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.680
So thank you.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.780
That was pretty cool.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.330
I hadn't seen it until then,
so first time for me too.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.440
Just to round off this slide,
obviously we announced back in

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:56.640
February the whole iPhone SDK program
and obviously the licensing of ActiveSync

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.780
allows us to do much the same kind
of cool stuff that Brendan just shown,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.100
but using ActiveSync onto the
phone to get pushed email,

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.080
calendars and contacts from an
exchange server down to the iPhone.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.960
As a Canadian,
I'd like to say that finally we now have,

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.760
well, in four weeks we'll have
the phone in Canada too.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.340
Not that I've been able to
use any of this cool stuff,

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.540
but now we will be able to.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.690
The other cool thing about this
is obviously remote wipe as well.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.640
If the phone is stolen,
the admin sat back in the office can

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.830
remotely wipe all of the sensitive
company information off that phone.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:35.450
One last thing to talk about on the
side of Windows and integrating with

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.860
Windows is maybe the need to still run
Windows once you've moved to the Mac.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.580
And there may be typically
a single application,

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.430
a custom application that was
written that doesn't work on the Mac.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.100
The resources aren't there
to port it to the Mac yet.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.820
So what do we do?

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:56.520
Well, there are really three options,
one of which may or may not work.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.940
So the first would be Boot Camp,
obviously, included with Leopard.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.430
And if an environment requires
maybe a significant amount

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.920
of time spent in Windows,
that Boot Camp would be an option.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.030
Obviously, you'd have to boot in between
different OSs to switch back and forth,

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.490
which if you're flitting between
different applications might

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:15.700
not be a workable solution.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:21.540
On the virtualization side of things,
there are two main solutions out there.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.440
There's Parallels Desktop from Parallels.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.260
I don't know how long went into
the naming of that product.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.480
And Fusion from VMware.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.720
And both of these
products allow you to run.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.410
a Windows operating system
virtualized under OS X.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.440
and they both do it in a really nice
way so that it's pretty much seamless.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.350
You don't have to see the start
bar and the pretty rolling fields

00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:43.970
and blue sky desktop backgrounds.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:47.510
You can basically have the applications
fully integrated with the Mac desktop.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.430
So they appear in the doc.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.980
They appear in the recently
used applications list.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.420
And so really all you see
is that Windows application.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.480
You don't need any of the
other background to it.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.260
Another option might be to use
a product called Crossover.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.230
And what Crossover allows
you to do is just run a

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.300
Windows application inside OS X.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.160
It doesn't work for all applications.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.420
It doesn't work for Microsoft Outlook,
for example.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.310
But if there's one application,
you just need to run that

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.540
XE file to do something.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.470
Crossover may be a solution so you're not
running a whole virtualized OS as well.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.630
So our strategy here is really
to show how well the Macs

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.000
integrate with Active Directory,
talk about the Active Directory plugin

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.890
and the functionality
that gives you to tie in.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.440
Look at the options and after yesterday,
we got a whole bunch more options on

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.150
ways of connecting to Exchange Server.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.740
and then where our options are
around virtualizing Windows if

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.280
there's those lingering applications
that can't be rewritten or don't

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.510
have an equivalent on the Mac.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:47.240
So really there are not many
changes required in terms of

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.630
integrating with Active Directory.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.400
You're already going to have
accounts that have the rights that

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.040
the Active Directory plugin needs.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.970
Everything can be scripted so
you don't need to go around

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.300
and touch every single machine.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.400
You can just create it once and
push it out to every machine.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:09.800
Kerberos is built in,
single sign-on will work and you've

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:09.800
got options for virtualizing.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.560
With that,
I'd like to hand back to Schoun.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.600
He's going to talk a little bit about how
Macs might be managed in the environment.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.350
Thank you, Ian.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.290
All right.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.640
So let's talk about
management for a moment.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.800
The myth is the Macs can't be managed.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.440
It's anarchy.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.810
Everybody has to be an administrator.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.210
We have no group policies in place.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.230
Updates are somewhat hard to
manage and users download updates

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.840
before testing them and oh no.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:38.840
So,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.490
First off, with administrators.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:47.530
Mac users don't have to run
as local administrators,

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:47.540
right?

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.100
If you do,
you can create neutered administrators

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.100
in a couple different ways.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.080
One of the easiest is to edit the
Etsy sudoers file and take out the

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:03.080
admin group and only put in the users
that you want to run the sudo command.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:07.220
So in that case,
they really can't get in there

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.850
to run any commands as super user
because you've edited the file.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.800
You can further edit the Etsy
authorization file to change rights and

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:23.690
rules so that only certain users have
access to certain security policies.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.870
A third option that you can do
is actually put a second data

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.000
store inside the local machine.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.000
If you do that,
you can actually have administrators

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.140
who don't show up in the system
preferences who may have a home folder

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.160
hidden somewhere inside private.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.120
And that's a really good way to have a
hidden admin in there that's not really

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:52.430
part of the original local directory
data store or any connected data store

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.840
like Active Directory or Open Directory.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.480
Second, group policies.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.640
The Macs can be managed.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.740
Apple calls them managed preferences.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.430
Windows users call them group policies.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.540
It doesn't matter.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.440
It's account-based.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.480
We can do group policies based on user.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.600
We can do group policies based on group.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.260
We can do group policies
based on computers.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.080
Or we can do group policies
based on computer group.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.620
And we can be extremely granular in
the policy management that we do.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.750
And there are some excellent sessions.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.980
Again, we're going to show them
to you at the end of today,

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.630
but there are some excellent
sessions this week that

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.060
I really urge you to go to,
especially centered

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.950
around policy management.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.200
We also have integrated management.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.940
In other words,
we can have a Mac OS X server and we

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.500
can have an Active Directory server.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.800
And this is also known
maybe as the magic triangle.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.740
And basically what happens is
that we have a Mac OS X server,

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:57.500
we bind it to Active Directory,
we create a group,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.150
we take all the users from
Active Directory and we nest them

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:05.260
inside of the Open Directory group.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:09.990
We then do group policy management
on the Open Directory group,

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.960
but we don't touch the
Active Directory users.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.460
The Active Directory schema
has not been modified.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.380
We haven't had to make any changes.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.460
We just have a Mac OS X server
in the middle doing all of

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.740
our policy management for us.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.340
So how do we update the Mac?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.800
Well, we probably don't want to let
users update their own machines.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.900
Windows administrators certainly
don't do this with Windows.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.980
They have a centralized server
that they use for updating.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.160
And we want to thoroughly
test these updates beforehand.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.900
And how do we track what updates
have actually been applied?

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:52.400
Well, there are a variety of ways that
we can push out software updates.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.870
Apple has a software update service
that we're going to be talking

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.820
about in just a couple slides.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:00.700
We can use Apple Remote Desktop to
actually push out packages.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.300
And there are a plethora
of third-party tools,

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.700
Casper, LandRev, FileWave, Puppet,
RadMine.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:12.790
Some of these are open source tools,
some of these are pay-for tools,

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:17.680
and this by no means is the only list.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:17.680
There are others.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.500
So here's a screenshot of Apple's
software update service and if

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.890
you take a look at the screenshot,
this is a Mac OS X server.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.330
It was connected to the internet.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:31.360
It went out to the internet and
it downloaded every conceivable

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:36.860
possible software update known to
man over the past X number of days.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.610
It stores them on the server.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:44.510
Then all we do is tell our managed
Macs when they run software

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.300
update to look at our server.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:51.730
This is great for education where you
may have a fractional T1 line or a

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:56.320
small connection to the internet and
Apple releases an update on iLife or

00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:01.520
iWork and you have 200 Macs all going
out to get the exact same update.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.120
Why not put a
Mac West End server in the mix,

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:10.300
have it hosted and have all
that file traffic done locally,

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.750
not saturating your internet line?

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.340
Oh, and by the way,
there's no client access fees for this.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.700
You just buy the server and hook it up.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.350
Again, the scenario,
if we visualize the scenario,

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.880
we have the cloud,
we have Apple's bank of

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.940
software update servers,
and we have our lone

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.640
Apple software update server.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:37.700
It connects, goes out to the internet,
and all of our Macs then receive

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.330
the updates from our lone server.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.530
So what's the strategy
here with management?

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.950
Use proper acronyms and synonyms.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:53.030
If you're trying to correlate
group policies and very granular

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:57.720
group policies on Windows,
know the names on the Mac side.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.440
Don't get lost there.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.810
Second, create a matrix of supported
management options.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.000
In other words,
when users open up Safari,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.090
I don't want them to be able to do
this and this and this and this.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.380
When users open up System Preferences,
I don't want them to be able to click

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.530
on the Network Preference pane at all.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.280
I just don't want them to
be able to click on it.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.300
OK, well, do you want that user-based?

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.630
Do you want that computer-based?

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.690
Do you want that based on a group?

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.730
How do you want to manage that?

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:31.360
So create a nice matrix.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.290
Decide which management
settings that you want.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.100
Apple uses MCX,
Machine Control XML language,

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.220
to store these policies.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:45.480
And acceptance for the Macs in the
environment often hinges on control.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.560
There is the myth that the
Macs can't be controlled,

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.900
that they run wild.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.760
And that's not true.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.590
They can be managed with a
high level of granularity.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.760
Support.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:57.700
Set those policies.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.490
policies.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:05.500
Second, make sure your users don't
run as administrators.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:08.130
I know you don't do this
in the Windows world.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.500
and third, the Mac OS X software updates
can be handled easily.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.450
Again, no client access licenses.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.730
Buy Mac OS X server, get a next serve,
connect it up to the internet,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.220
start it on a Friday night,
it'll go out to Apple's server,

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:25.310
suck down all 500 gigabytes of updates,
not that much,

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:29.340
but it'll pull them down and then
you can decide which ones you want

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.770
to enable and the users just get
them when they run software update.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.800
So I'm going to move on to
deployment because management and

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.320
deployment sort of go hand in hand.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.110
The myth for deployment?

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:44.670
I must install stuff locally.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.970
I must walk around with my
Microsoft DVD and install

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:52.940
Office on all these machines.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.220
There's no ghost for Mac.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.300
Semantic doesn't have ghost for the Mac,
right?

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:04.260
And so when the Macs come in,
sometimes the administrators

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.300
look like Tweek from South Park.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:06.740
"Ah!

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.270
A Mac!" So there's no ghost.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.300
What am I going to do?

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.140
There's little understanding
of imaging in Mac OS X.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.290
And maybe the Windows administrators
know FireWire.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.960
So let's talk about image creation.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:27.800
We tie the images to various
hardware configurations for our Macs.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.000
Maybe we have one for portables,
maybe we have one for desktops,

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:35.240
maybe if Apple releases a new
version with some specific hardware,

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.250
we want to take a look at that one.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:39.840
And we test and test and retest.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.800
We launch all apps.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.450
Not that you would ever do this,
but a great testing scenario

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.280
to your colleague at work.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.980
There's a command line tool
that Apple has called Open.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.350
So if you open up the command
line and you SSH into a

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:00.170
computer that you're testing,

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:06.130
and you type CDE space
forward slash application,

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:11.320
so you CDE in the applications folder,
and then type open space star dot star

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:14.770
and you watch the doc on that computer.

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:19.900
You'll get every app inside the
applications folder and inside

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:24.780
the utilities folder all just
bouncing and going on at once.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.540
Number one, it's kind of fun to watch.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.220
Number two,
it really puts a load on the system.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.000
That image that you created,
you put an incredible

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.180
load on that system.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.310
Now while it's fun to do,
you can still look at the

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.440
logs a little bit later.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.040
You can look for certain
applications that may have crashed,

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:47.460
take a look at the response time,
at the CPU cycles.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.780
It's a fun little command line tool,
but it's really worthwhile when you're

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.240
testing and you're working on images.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:46:00.700
Second, once we have our images created,
how do we deploy them?

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:04.050
Again, there's no ghost.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:05.230
It's okay.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:11.950
I have a school district,
bought 4,000 Macs, one-to-one initiative,

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.670
some laptops, some desktops.

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.660
They all came with Leopard.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:23.420
They spent two weeks testing the image,
working on the image,

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.160
They push it out to all the machines.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.660
There's no client access license.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.800
There's no license fee to push it out.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.020
The Macs already came with Leopard.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:36.400
They have legal license to
use that copy of Leopard.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:40.000
All they're doing is re-imaging
it and pushing it out.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.850
And it's free.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.350
How can we push it out?

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.360
We can use Netboot, Netinstall,
Netrestore.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:50.640
Netboot allows us to
boot Macs over a network.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.080
Netinstall allows us to
actually install over a network.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.420
And Netrestore is a block file transfer.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.380
There are third-party
tools that I can use.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:05.130
We'll also talk about
packages here in a minute.

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:11.880
The other thing that I want to focus
on is something called multicast ASR.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:20.250
I have a Mac OS X server and it's set
up on a private network and I have 200

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:25.050
Macs and they all need the same image.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:29.470
I can have that Netboot
server sitting there,

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.710
all the Macs boot up
off a tiny little image,

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:35.950
and then I could have a 10
gigabyte image being pushed out,

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.500
not over multicast, or not over unicast,
but multicast.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:46.000
I can decide which method I want to use,
so I can be incredibly efficient.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.940
and if I use Multicast,
that means all the machines

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.440
don't have to be started at once,
they just start getting the bits.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.380
If they missed them,
they get retransmitted over and over.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:58.320
We could also use a third-party
tool called Deploy Studio.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:00.650
We could use an open
source tool called Puppet.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.220
RadMine does this.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.530
RadMine also will do rollback,
so if I have a problem with something,

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.170
I can go back to a previous version.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.540
These are open source free tools.

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:12.370
There's no client access licenses.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.240
Now what about packages?

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.440
Apple changed the way packages
work in 10.5 and it's really,

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.800
really cool.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.640
For example,
I could have Apple Remote Desktop in

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:29.040
my organization and I need to install
a security update for all the Macs.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.440
Maybe I don't have a
software update service,

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.800
maybe I only want to install
them on certain machines to test.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.780
I can download that one package from
Apple and I can use ARD to send it out.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.510
Or I can set up a task server
to do it over the weekend.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:49.760
Even better, if I don't wanna do that,
if I have a Mac OS X server,

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.210
I can set up net install and
I can tell all the users,

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:57.760
tomorrow morning when you come in,
after you hear the chime,

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:01.920
just hold down the N key, the letter N,
just hold it down and

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.680
go get a cup of coffee.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.900
It's not going to do a net install,
but it will actually deploy

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.290
the package that I created.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.520
And if necessary,
reboot the system automatically.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:15.700
There's no fees for this.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.930
You bought the server.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.440
So net install is a great
way to deploy packages.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.080
And if you're a shell scripter
and you have scripts that you need

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.530
to do cleanup or something else,
you can have what are called

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.760
payload-free packages.

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:32.510
These are packages that don't
really have an item to deploy,

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.380
but they run scripts for you.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.130
That's not too hard for
me to go tell users,

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.000
hold down the N key.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.330
You got five minutes,
go get a cup of coffee.

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.640
And we can use SSH to also do this.

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.580
So what's our strategy?

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:51.370
Mac deployment is unbelievably
extremely efficient.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.380
The support involves the
creation of the image,

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.540
the testing of the image,
the deployment of the image,

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:05.380
and as we saw in the previous section,
the management of the image.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.500
So you're a Windows IT admin,
how do you support it?

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.590
You automate your image deployment.

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.100
You pick one of the tools
that we talked about.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.300
Play with it.

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.000
Try it out.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:23.200
There are other tools out
there that you can use.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.900
Do your remote update planning carefully.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.310
Are you going to use
ARD with a task server?

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.700
Are you going to use net
install with packages?

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.290
We can build our own packages too.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:42.390
For example, I have an iMac and I've
installed Microsoft Office on it.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.120
And I moved a few things around
and that's how I want it to

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.500
look for all the computers.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.130
But I already created my image.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.370
I took two weeks to create my image.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.010
Now am I going to have
to create another image?

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:57.980
No.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.260
Because before I installed
Microsoft Office,

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:08.740
I ran Package Maker,
Apple's free package creation tool,

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.310
and it took a snapshot.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.170
of my hard drive.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.320
And then I installed
Microsoft Office and I did a few things.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:23.040
and it took another snapshot and
it created a package based on

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.500
the differences and it collected
all the files that had changed.

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:31.500
And then I can push that out.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.080
It's an excellent way
to be able to do this.

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.730
At this time, I'm going to turn it
over to Ian Kelly again,

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.820
and we're going to talk about the
last reality distortion field,

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.900
and that is security.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.050
Oh, and this is a big one.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:56.970
So, yeah, there's a, as Schoun said,
there's this overwhelming thing that

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:58.920
Macs just kind of like run wild.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.440
I was actually speaking to Josh earlier
and him and Joel go out and it used to

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.060
be the cockroach thing that the Macs
were kind of there lurking in the corners

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.460
of the building and if anyone came
over from IT and turned the lights on,

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.800
they'd go scurrying away into the corner.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:16.480
But now they're kind of staying there in
the light and staring right back at you.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.260
So, a lot of places are beginning to ask,
well,

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:24.240
we're getting hit with viruses all the
time and what do we do about the Macs?

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.350
There's no antivirus for them.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.310
How do we control them?

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:29.310
What do we do?

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:33.600
So we're going to look at what the
antivirus options are for the Mac.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.540
What about malware, spyware, Trojans,
those kinds of things?

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:41.550
And then what about actually unauthorized
access to the Mac and theft and actually

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.020
securing the machines themselves?

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.240
So first of all, I want to ask anyone,
have they ever received any kind of

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.420
compensation from their antivirus
vendor for downtime or lost productivity

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.740
as a result of viruses that they're
supposed to be protecting against?

00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.090
Hands up.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:07.730
So while there are very,
very few viruses for the Mac right now,

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:12.890
there have been a couple that
are like proof of concept.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:14.410
There really are none in the wild.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.900
And Macs aren't affected
by Windows viruses.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.390
They will quite happily
pass that virus along.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.910
So if it's attached to, say,
a Word document or an Excel document in

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:29.030
an email and the Mac gets that email,
it's not aware there's a virus in there,

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:30.200
it'll pass it on.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:35.360
That doesn't look good on the
company having sent a virus out,

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.040
even though the Mac wasn't
even aware maybe that there

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.220
was a virus in that message.

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:45.560
So it's important to look at
antivirus options for the Mac and

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:50.610
realize that while the risk is low,
it's important as just being a good

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.980
net citizen that you should be running
antivirus solutions on the Mac.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:57.630
How do they work into the workflow?

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:00.290
For example,
I work a lot with the broadcast

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:06.140
industry in Toronto and video editing
is not somewhere where you're ever

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.840
going to use antivirus because trying
to do real-time Final Cut Pro work

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.080
while having an antivirus chew away
on the files as you're accessing them,

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.140
it's not going to work.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.140
So there's a lot of things to be taking
into account as to where the Macs work,

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:18.820
what kind of environment they're
working in and whether antivirus is

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.590
actually appropriate in those cases.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.510
In a lot of cases,
it's more appropriate to deploy antivirus

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.280
at the file server and the mail server
and realize that you've got that barrier

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.740
between those Macs that don't have it,
for example.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.490
So what are options out there for
antivirus that work in exactly the same

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:37.520
way as they do in the Windows world?

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:43.000
Well, the first two are Windows primary
antivirus solutions.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.770
I'm a Sophos user myself and
primarily because I'm a Brit and

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:50.230
they were founded in the UK.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:55.000
But both Sophos and Symantec have
cross-platform antivirus solutions.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.750
So you can manage the Macs
from a central location,

00:54:57.770 --> 00:55:03.000
push out your antivirus updates and your
definition files to all Macs at once

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
on a schedule and have it automatically
update the same as you can with Symantec.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.670
And so there's really no reason why the
Macs should be treated any differently

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:10.940
from an antivirus point of view.

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:14.080
It's the way your
Windows machines are treated.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:16.800
One interesting thing
to talk about is ClamAV,

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.580
which is an open source
antivirus solution.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.800
It's included on Mac OS X server as part
of the antivirus for the mail server.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.180
And so it works really well for
checking and going and outgoing email,

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:33.790
but it can be very easily adapted to scan
the file system for file viruses as well.

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.240
And so that's something that a lot
of people might want to look at as a

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.960
free solution is to deploy ClamAV as
their antivirus on a Mac OS X server,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.990
for example.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:44.240
What about data theft?

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:48.420
Well, FileVault was built into every Mac,
which is encryption

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.270
on the home directory.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.130
So that's one thing.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.440
The entire contents of the
home directory is encrypted.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:57.250
So the desktop documents,
every file the user creates and

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:59.590
all of their preferences as well.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.340
We can also do things like
encrypted disk images.

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.260
So Disk Utility can create a disk image
that you can dump files and folders into,

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.280
and that can be encrypted
at 256-bit AES encryption.

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.510
And then for things like data transfers,
as Schoun touched on earlier,

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.140
we've got the VPN built in.

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:18.460
And obviously SSL,
part of the Unix foundation of OS X,

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.560
is included on every machine.

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:25.130
So for things like SSL connections
across networks or across the internet,

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:26.700
you can use that as well.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.800
There are also some full disk
encryption options out there

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.120
right now that are coming,
seem to be kind of coming to

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.440
market or very close to market.

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.880
And so there are options there for
those highly secure environments

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:41.720
where you want the entire contents
of the hard drive encrypted.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.090
Let's talk a little bit
about the keychain as well.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:47.300
So the keychain is really a central
location for all of your passwords,

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.420
and you can specify what passwords
get stored there and what don't.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:54.610
And that's things like just
connections to a file server.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.910
You can use it to store usernames
and passwords on websites.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.810
You can create secure notes
inside the keychain as well.

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.350
So if there's specific
information you just store in

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.720
there that you want kept secure,
but you keep referring to

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:07.750
it over and over again,
you just need it reminded,

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.980
you can use that in there.

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.170
You have multiple keychains.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.460
You can push out keychains.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.370
the store of your
certificate information.

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:18.420
and I think they're kind of underused as
well because they can be used a lot more

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:23.080
effectively for things like pushing out
VPN certificates and stuff like that.

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.570
So our strategy here is really
to understand that the antivirus

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.720
options for the Mac are really not
a whole world of different from

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.090
those for the Windows machines.

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.220
We have things like FileVault
and encrypted disk images

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.420
to keep things secure.

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:42.840
And basically,
the world of security isn't too

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.720
different as to how it is on the PC.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.590
The Macs are built on a
much more secure foundation.

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:51.740
And things like spyware and
malware are a lot harder to come

00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:54.160
by just because of the basis.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:57.450
If you're not running as an admin,
a user isn't going to be able to

00:57:57.450 --> 00:58:01.560
install anything without supplying
a user-level username and password.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.650
The first time you launch an application,
you're going to get a warning

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.940
saying you downloaded this
from this website on this date.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.320
Are you sure you want to open it?

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.110
It's a Microsoft Office document
from somewhere.ru that's 26K.

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.020
Are you really sure you think
this is Microsoft Office?

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:17.190
I don't think so.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.520
So there's a lot more security
built into the OS to prevent things

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.790
like your Trojans and spyware.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:27.510
Let's talk a little bit about migration,
but really the focus here is going to

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:31.740
be the case study that I'm talking about
next because it illustrates the points

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:36.070
in the next slide a lot better than
me talking for 10 minutes about this.

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:40.170
The key to a successful migration
from Windows to the Mac is

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.600
really based upon these factors.

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.200
It's important that we get
buy-in and buy-in is not

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:50.340
just like a CEO or VP level,
it's everything all the way down

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.530
through IT and to the end users.

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:55.490
Any kind of strategy
cannot involve data loss.

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.940
You can't go in and say, well, okay,
you've got that system,

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.080
that's all well and good,
but you're going to have to lose

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.290
all that data or you're going to
archive it and we'll just start from

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.690
scratch on this new system over here.

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.300
And the whole plan basically
has to be adaptable,

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:10.000
scalable, realizing that no matter what
you think or where you think

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
you're going to be in a year,
the likelihood is that you're probably

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.390
going to be a lot further than that.

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:16.790
And then reliability.

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:20.940
There seems to be an overwhelming
assumption that Macs,

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.440
because they can do
things more efficiently,

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.190
that we don't need to do
it in the same kind of way.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.200
So we're going to deploy
Active Directory and we're going to

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.030
have four domain controllers because we
need that redundancy and reliability.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.590
But if we're going to move to the Mac,
we're going to do Open Directory and

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:35.300
we'll throw an old Power Mac G4 in
the corner and that can be our server.

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.840
It's really not the way to go.

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.110
Case study I want to use is the
Ontario Government Ombudsman.

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:47.060
What these guys are is the,
they're the guys you go to to

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.500
complain about the government.

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:51.010
So as you can imagine,
they're kind of busy.

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.440
They get a lot of emails and
a lot of phone calls and it's

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.430
basically everything from,
you know,

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.980
the city came out and dug up the
street and now got a pothole at

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.910
the end of my driveway up to,
you know, wrongful arrests.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:10.730
They were a 100% Windows environment,
only 120 users,

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:15.240
and they had four full-time
IT staff to manage those 120 users.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:20.500
And basically what happened is the
ombudsman himself came in and said,

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:22.160
"I'm a Mac user.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.440
I have my nice MacBook Pro 17-inch,
and we are moving everything to the Mac.

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.700
I don't want to see another
Windows machine in this building

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.800
at the end of this project."

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.010
As you can imagine,
the IT staff were kind

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.450
of freaked out by this.

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:38.740
I mean, literally, I mean,
the guys were nervous and worried.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.660
They're like,
I don't know anything about the Mac,

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.960
but we don't have a choice.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.030
The guy said we've got to
move and it's got to work.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.200
So what do they use?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.970
Well, they had this custom
case management system.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:51.810
That's basically where every phone
call and every email gets logged into.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.970
So it gets used a lot.

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.360
It's kind of the most
important thing they have,

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.370
even above email.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.480
They use Microsoft Office extensively.

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:01.700
They do have a lot of email.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.230
It's not untypical to find
users there with excess of

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:08.500
50,000 messages and mailboxes
in excess of 10 or 15 gigabytes.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.880
There's no quotas.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.490
They were using Exchange Server,
but they had nothing in place to limit

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:17.420
users' access or use of Exchange Server.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.380
And they weren't using roaming profiles.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.820
So everyone was basically locked to
the machine they had on their desktop.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:24.540
They couldn't get up and move anywhere
else or use a different machine.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:31.310
The strategy we used around
migrating desktops was that,

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.990
first of all,
we need to get any user data that's

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.220
on the client machines up to a server.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.050
We need to have this in a
central location so that

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.690
when we move these PCs off,
we're not gonna end up with lost data.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.730
So that was a big job because
although users were told to

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:45.340
store stuff on the server,
there was no real way of

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.080
ensuring that they did.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.960
The other thing that the company
did was put the new iMacs on the

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.560
desktop alongside the user's PCs way
before they could ever use them.

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.130
So they basically had this
Mac sat on the desktop off,

01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.450
not doing a whole lot.

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:01.110
And that was a really good strategy.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.970
I think they were just doing it to
save space because they didn't have

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.600
a whole lot of room in the IT area.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.020
But the users began to say, like,
when do we get to turn these machines on?

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.670
And so it kind of was driving
enthusiasm and anticipation way

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.340
before things were ready to go.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.480
And the other thing they realized
was that we can't do training

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.100
as a kind of one-time thing.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.090
A lot of people,
when they're doing training,

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.080
they send all their users off for
a day or half a day or whatever.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.610
And then that's really it done.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:31.290
They realized that it would be a lot
more effective to do small training

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.910
sessions over a longer period of time
to allow things to sink in and the

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:38.320
users to begin to kind of come to
grips with everything and then ask

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:40.610
more questions at the next session.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.820
Thank you.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.210
and the other thing they did
was an on-floor walkabout.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.760
So when they actually went live,
they had two of the trainers

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.010
basically on the floor at all times,
just walking around looking

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.180
for someone to have a problem.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.670
And what that really helped with was
that no one ever had to get up the

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:59.160
phone and call IT or log something
into their help desk and say,

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.230
hey, this doesn't work.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.720
There was someone basically with them
within 30 seconds because typically

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.720
the solution was maybe a 20 second,
oh, you just need to click here or

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.010
close this and open it this way.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.820
And that really,
really helped the user's level

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.420
of satisfaction with the system
over the first two to three weeks.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.970
So what they did was they picked
key groups of users based on either

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:25.820
the amount of usage or the level
of knowledge and understanding and

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:29.900
targeted key areas first they knew
would drive excitement and enthusiasm

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.500
throughout the rest of the organization.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.560
and they locked everything down
way too much to start off with.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.020
They knew they wanted to lock things
down and limit internet access,

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.300
locations people could run.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.330
And so they really went overboard
from the start because it's a lot

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:45.200
easier to back off and give someone
way more freedom than it is to come

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.600
down the road three months and say,
okay, you can't do that anymore.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.360
You're not doing that.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.500
That's closed off and that's disappeared
from the dock because then people start

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.750
to get a little bit angry about that.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.790
What we did was we took all of the
users out of Active Directory using

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:04.100
built-in tools from Windows Server to
just dump a list of the users and groups,

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:06.550
imported those users and
groups into Open Directory.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.930
They hadn't been employing
any kind of password policy,

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.440
so every user had the same password
that they had five years ago.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.690
So we figured it was probably about
time for a password change anyway.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.070
And then they chose Curio
Mail Server as their new mail server.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.270
One of the reasons they did that was the
built-in migration tool will suck all of

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:26.800
the emails and calendaring information
out of Exchange and put it into Curio.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:28.600
So there was absolutely no data loss.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.400
All their meetings and
appointments came through,

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.370
the global address list came through,
and all their lists came through.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.380
They made the decision to move the case
management system off of SQL Server to

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.000
FileMaker Server and write a custom
front end based on a browser interface.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.820
We suggested they might just want to
write a browser interface to SQL Server,

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.700
but they were like, nope,
we're not having any

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:50.800
windows in the building.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.580
So they worked with a local FileMaker
developer to basically rewrite their

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.200
entire case management system for
FileMaker being cross-platform.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.700
So if they ever need to go,
let's say the new ombudsman comes

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.200
in in five years' time and he says,
what's all this stuff?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.310
We're kicking it out.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:04.980
They can move FileMaker.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.030
FileMaker across.

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:10.130
And they wanted that flexibility of
not being tied to a specific platform.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:13.380
So they managed to get rid of
the access front end and replace

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.800
it with a browser-based access.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.500
This is roughly what
it looked like before.

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:23.400
They had basically a mismatch of
servers from different vendors,

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.500
different tape drives and different
storage arrays that were individually

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.950
attached and everything was kind
of split out and there was no

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.280
real management to everything.

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:33.090
Some of the storage arrays
were completely full and

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:34.830
some of them were half empty.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:40.340
and there were a mix of 70 to 50 on
the desktop and laptop side things.

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.810
That's what it looked like afterwards,
a little cleaner.

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:48.350
So they moved to basically four XSERVs,
one XSERV RAID that

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:50.400
stored all of their mail,
the case management system,

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.060
and network home directories.

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:58.580
They went to a tape backup using
Fiber Channel and LTO4 and went to

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:04.370
the 20 or 24-inch iMac and the 15,
17-inch MacBook Pros.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.130
So as I said, they moved to a platform
independent case management system.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.870
They moved to
Microsoft Office 2008 on the Mac.

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:16.700
They're using email way more
than they ever were before.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.660
They're now doing way more
with mailing lists as well.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.620
And they moved to
network home directories,

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.940
which means if a machine
suffers a hardware failure,

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.300
they just get up and move to
another machine or IT can just

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.480
drop a new machine on their desktop
and they just turn it on and go.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.220
They imaged every machine in the
building in the space of one and a half

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:37.280
days and they now have much greater
flexibility than they ever had before.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.910
Previously, if a Windows machine died,
they basically had to wait

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:42.140
for a new machine to be built
and put on their desktop.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.220
Now they can just go to a spare
machine on the desk next to them

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.360
if the person's on vacation,
fire it up,

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.130
log in and they're good to go.

01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:54.400
The whole thing was basically once
there was three to four months of

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.580
planning and anticipation about this
and once the decision was made it was

01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.140
basically eight months start to finish.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.560
It's handled by a local company
called Digital Transitions and one

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.710
consultant from that company handled
the entire project on himself,

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:06.780
on his own.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.670
They've gone to one
full-time Mac sysadmin,

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.750
the other three are still there,
they're just employed

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:13.580
in different areas now.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:18.220
And he was formerly the senior
Windows system administrator.

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.300
He went on the training courses,
he picked everything up.

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.450
And he's actually smiling now.

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.380
I didn't see him smile
a whole lot beforehand.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.860
So that's really good stuff there.

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.480
And they're actually now even
looking at buying another XServe.

01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:32.800
They're taking things and they
just wanna spread out again.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.400
And this is way beyond the scope of what
they originally thought they wanna do.

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:38.090
They now start wanna looking at a
whole bunch of other technologies,

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:41.030
run their web services
off of the Mac as well.

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:44.140
So the strategy really was
around planning everything

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.380
out properly from the start,
making sure that communication was

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.040
with every level of the organization.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.710
It's a tempting thing to just work
with IT and forget everyone else,

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.800
but they really wanted to keep
everyone in the loop and understand

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.190
what was going on with the project.

01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.200
They had these great plans,
but we encouraged them to start small.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.190
I figured you're moving to Leopard,
you need to be very concise

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.910
about what you want to do,
and you need to understand that

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.400
when you're on the leading edge and
going with brand new technology,

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.400
you need to make sure that all
of the other software vendors

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.600
that you're working with are
also going to be up to date.

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:14.900
So it's all well and
good going to Leopard,

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.960
but you need to make sure that
Kirio are going to have a version

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:20.060
of their mouse server that runs
on Leopard before you do that.

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:23.700
There's a lot of ownership,
so they invited all the key departments

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.300
in to understand that this is how
your new systems are going to work.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.230
Let's get your input on
how it's going to work,

01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:31.270
how we're going to develop this,
how do you need it to work for you,

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:34.290
rather than just IT making those
decisions and telling the end

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:36.540
users what it was going to be.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.090
Train them before migrating so that
users can get to grips with a Mac before

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:45.200
they're having to use it on a day-to-day
basis and worry about their jobs.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.840
They can have a lot more fun
on the training sessions.

01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:51.420
And that's really the key thing
is to make sure that everyone is

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.660
enjoying it because if it's any
kind of a chore or hard work,

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:56.960
that project isn't going to work.

01:08:58.110 --> 01:09:01.200
With that, I'm going to hand back
to Schoun to round up.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.240
Thank you, Ian.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.600
So the end result, don't fear the Macs.

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:08.180
Embrace their oneness.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.480
Mac OS X, the simplicity,
the manageability,

01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:17.320
and the customization really
allow full integration.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:20.460
Strategic planning that's
based around the Mac's clear

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:25.400
advantages make first-time
integration and migration much,

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.900
much easier.

01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:29.400
because the Macs are better.

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:31.080
I might be biased.

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.240
So here are the extra
sessions that I really,

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.280
really recommend that you attend.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.430
The portable home
directories coming up very,

01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:40.360
very soon.

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:45.810
You'll see the extending and directing
or publishing directory services as well.

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:49.240
So I would really recommend
that you hit some of these

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.640
sessions and some of these labs.
