WEBVTT

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.280
How are you doing?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.200
I'm Eric Bailey.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.610
I am engineering manager
for the iTunes U team,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.790
and we're going to talk about --
this session is all about iTunes U.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.790
We're going to cover --

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.860
What's new with iTunes
U between '07 and '08?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.300
We're going to go through what
we've added in the last year.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.300
We've broken it up into things that
affect your private sites first,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.180
and then we'll talk about things that
we've done to improve public sites.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.490
A lot of those things overlap,
but we've organized it that way.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.590
Here's our agenda.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.920
We'll get into iTunes U Web Services,
talk about some things we're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
doing with Podcast Producer,
and finish up with some cool

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.190
things that the community
is developing with iTunes U.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.510
So, first thing I want to talk about
is international expansion.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.750
Before last week, iTunes U was available
only in the US and Canada,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.200
and we're excited to announce that
we're now available in Australia,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.330
New Zealand, UK, and Ireland.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.300
So we'll get to the iTunes
U and the iTunes Store.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.950
We'll talk about some of the new stuff
that's coming from those countries there.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.080
But that's something we
just announced last week.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.240
One of the things we added in last year
was a change in policy so that each

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.580
institution can have more than one site.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.060
And the reason we did this is
through feedback and through

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.000
working with a lot of you just
kind of hands-on getting into it,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.150
it was kind of difficult in some cases to
do all that you want to do with one site.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.210
And with there being a public-facing
set of content and private access

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.690
for academic technology purposes,
it was really more

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.750
practical to get into it.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.720
So we decided to give two sites.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.140
So that was a change we made.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.310
And this makes it better for those
involved because a lot of the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.760
problems with -- you want to do
with a private access site with

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.720
credentials and controlling access,
you don't want to mess that up and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.160
have stuff show up on your public site.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.180
So it makes a lot of
sense to split these two.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.750
It's often different groups on
campus working on these as well.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.620
And we also wanted to be able to expand
iTunes U in the store and give a lot

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.760
of the information that we could.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.730
So we made these changes.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:03:00.220
And we want to make it clear that if you
need a second site for your institution,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.500
send an e-mail to us and
we'll get that set up.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.660
They are linked by the service
agreement and they're linked by quota.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.740
Otherwise, they are completely
distinct and separate sites.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.740
So you'll get separate reports.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.740
You can have separate administrators.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.560
Like I said,
the only linkage is between the quota.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.170
Another thing that we
did is we added Apple ID,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.420
support for Apple ID,
so you could log in as an

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:42.670
administrator using an Apple ID or
an iTunes store account.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.520
So you can have a separate site that's
on your public site of your site.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.310
This makes it easy.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.100
You don't have to write
a transfer script.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.930
The settings on access control
are pretty simple at that point.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.320
You just want to make
pages either private,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.200
still being constructed,
or publicly available.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.400
Another big change this year for
us was being able to allow you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.740
to locally host your content.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.890
And we're doing this with feeds,
RSS feeds.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.300
So why did we do this?

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.180
Again, we took a lot of feedback
from the community here,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.340
and we said,
let's kind of follow what we're

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.540
doing with the iTunes Store and
the podcast directory and be

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.640
able to consume your feeds,
list it, index it,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.340
and make it accessible through
the iTunes U interface.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.260
We heard that bandwidth usage is a
problem depending upon kind of the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.450
shape of your network and the way that
you want traffic to go in and out.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.060
And it didn't make a sense to have
all these sort of long-distance

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.980
calls going back to Apple to upload
and download all this content.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.420
So if you want to be able to put video,
and you know the consumption

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.670
of that is going to be mainly
on your own local area network,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.080
it makes a lot of sense to keep
that hosted on a server inside your

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.650
network for the best experience.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.370
So that's one reason.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.940
There are other reasons, too,
simply for control,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.730
and maybe you're already
doing things with other feeds,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.930
and this is an easier way to get
content into the iTunes U system.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.780
So RSS and locally hosting content was
a feature we added almost a year ago,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.440
and we've seen a lot of
people take advantage of this,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.730
and it's growing, and it's really,
you'll see as we get through other

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.450
things and other presentations
this week about how important

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.390
feeds are that this is kind of,
as we see it,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.420
the way that a lot of sites are
going to get built in the future.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.170
So this is an opportune
time to announce this.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.820
We've been working on this for a while,
but at a development,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.460
it seems appropriate to talk
about these two technologies.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.000
We joined the InCommon Federation last
year for identity management.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.890
That's a federation in the
United States that a lot of

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.520
higher ed institutions are
using for identity management.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.310
And on top of that, we are running the
Shibboleth Service Provider,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.770
which enables you to use this as an
alternative to authorizing your users

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.820
with a transfer script into iTunes U.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.430
So we've been beta testing this with
a lot of help from Penn State and

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.850
Washington and Ohio State and
a couple other institutions.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.840
And with their help,
we're ready to take the testing phase

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.980
and make this available this summer.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.210
So you'll see some more information
from this on our iTunes U support

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.910
site in the coming weeks.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
But we want to just announce
here today that we're going to

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.200
be doing a lot of work on this.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.830
We're ready for this,
and we heard a lot of feedback

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.840
from you that this was desired,
and so we're happy to say it's available.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.700
You can migrate to this on your own speed
because this can act as an alternative

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.570
to a credential transfer script.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.010
You can use them in parallel.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.480
So as you get to implementing this,
you can use one or the other

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.520
and migrate away from the
transfer script if you wish.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.030
So those are some of the important
features that we brought to kind

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.420
of the private sites for iTunes U.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.760
I'm going to jump into some of the
things that we've done for public sites.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.660
And the first one is the
public feature page template.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.340
As we started to see more and
more institutions interested

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.160
in creating a public presence,
we wanted to create a template

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.710
that served their needs best.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.980
And Brent,
who's sitting up here in the front row,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.010
is one of the people
that helped us with that.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.330
In developing the Stanford site,
they gave us a lot of feedback

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.700
for what they were looking for.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.520
What we wanted to do is create
a main page for the site that

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.150
really linked to all the content,
but allowed that content to be changed

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.520
and linked to and stay fresh so that
it supports a good home base for the

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.940
institution and is easier to keep fresh.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.940
And we really encourage people to
ask for this and upgrade to this

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.300
when they have hundreds of assets
across multiple interests because

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.730
otherwise it can look sort of thin.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.750
So let's take a look at it.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.030
This is a screenshot from over
a year ago of Stanford's site

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.150
with our original template.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.300
And it was nice.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.100
It was simple.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.410
It had just six categories.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.390
But it really required you to browse
and kind of drill down and figure

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.890
out where all these things are.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.840
But take a look at this today.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.810
It's a lot prettier.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.780
And it draws on some of the things
that we can do in iTunes U and the

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.580
iTunes store that make this a better
destination for the Stanford community

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.630
and other public visitors.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.580
So let's take a look.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.230
I want to highlight categories.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.150
So the structure of this site and
all sites based on public feature

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.940
page template is going to be
rooted up in the left-hand corner.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.740
These are the sub welcome pages.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:53.740
So you can create different pages based
on however many people are watching.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.480
And you can create a page
based on whatever you want

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.460
to organize the content.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.560
Everything else on the page
becomes a link to the content

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.940
down within that structure.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.630
So for instance,
this courses section that they've put

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.470
at the top has multiple courses in it.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.520
They've chosen to feature three on
the public feature page template.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.370
And you can see in the top right there's
a link for see all which allows you

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.620
as a visitor to go see all the courses
that have been added to this section.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.640
So I'll go into that in a second.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.550
They have a top downloads
along the right,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.480
which is something they've
chose to add to this page,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.990
which is something that the
template automatically generates

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.560
from data that we're collecting on
behalf of Stanford and iTunes U.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.350
So they, as a visitor,
you can see sort of what

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.450
the most popular content is,
and this is something they

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.010
don't have to maintain.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.580
So let's jump in as an admin and
kind of see what this looks like.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.800
If you log into one of these
templates as an administrator,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.160
you can go in, edit a section,
and you'll see here that all we're

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.370
doing here is copying and pasting
the URL to a page to get the handle

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.680
for the item that you want to link
to into that text field there.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.800
And then iTunes U will go get the
appropriate artwork and titles and

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:15.370
everything and display it on this page.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.420
And what you can do is add
many things to this page.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:30.400
[Transcript missing]

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.730
As an admin,
I talked about top downloads.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.960
You can go in here and you can
set how many you want to display.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.960
Okay, you can do 5, 10, 15, 20.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.840
There's also an RSS feed here,
which you can get the URL to a feed

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.000
which mirrors these top downloads.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.120
So if you want to create
a widget or mirror this

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.580
somewhere else on your website,
you can take that RSS feed and you'll

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.610
have a replica of the top downloads.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:12:59.400
[Transcript missing]

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.720
So if you haven't checked it out,
check it out.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.980
There's a lot of great content there.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.860
So let's talk about the new
category pages in the iTunes store.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.570
We feel this is a really great way
to discover and browse new content.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.630
Search is still king,
so the main way people

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.680
find content is search,
so it's very important to update

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.930
your metadata and have rich
metadata that describes all the

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.410
tracks and content in your site.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.920
But with categories,
you can get a new way for

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.020
people to discover categories,
so let's talk about that.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.480
For content that is uploaded to Apple,
we have a web interface

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.640
for categorization,
and I'll go through that in a second.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.540
For content that you
host through an RSS feed,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.610
we have documented ways to add
categories to those feeds so that

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.900
all the content that comes in through
those feeds is now categorized and

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.320
shows up in those places in the store.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.550
And then last but not least,
you can use web services.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.110
So we've got a web service
called Category Metadata,

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.350
which is our web services,
which I'll talk about in a little bit,

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.580
to update the category courses.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.360
So those are the three ways you
can manage the category metadata.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.900
Here is a category page on science.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.320
So we've got science highlighted.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.650
So this page being dedicated to science,
we're going to have content

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.690
listed that is new and notable.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.970
So that's content that tracks
that were recently added to iTunes

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.920
U that were categorized as science.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.770
We've got content in the middle that's
collections of content in science,

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.160
where the majority of the content
is science content and is popular

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.030
from a download perspective,
and then we have top downloads

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.590
just within the science category.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.980
So if you're really
interested in science,

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.880
it's a great destination to
find more information here.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.820
We have published a taxonomy
of these different categories.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.320
We have 13 top-level categories,
and there are subcategories

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.310
within science.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.000
And as we see those buckets fill up,
we'll expand this interface to

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.670
be even richer for discovering
content in those subcategories.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.740
So let's take a look at the
editing interface that I mentioned

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.490
for categorizing content.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.170
When you log in as an administrator
to your iTunes U site,

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.770
you'll see a new link
called Categorize Tracks,

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.420
which will take you to a
page which looks like this.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.570
So it's not only helpful
for categorizing tracks,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.880
but it's also a nice way to look at
kind of an inventory of your site.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.240
This gives you a sense of how many
tracks are in different areas,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.140
and it shows it all the way
down to the tab or group level.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.620
And you can see a lot of these
are feed-based in this site.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.780
So you can click on the button
Categorize for that particular section,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.450
and you get a new page
that looks like this.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.660
You can look at these side-by-side as
you go through to kind of see where your

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.200
content lines up in terms of category.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.840
So it's important to categorize
these tracks individually if you can,

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.970
but you can also set up your collection,
a group,

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.180
within iTunes U and set an initial
category so that all the content

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.000
you add to that group automatically
gets assigned a category.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.710
If you know it's all going
to be on one subject.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.820
So if you're doing a course on physics,
it's obvious, you know,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.670
where to categorize that content.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:14.450
But if you've got a mixture of lectures
from different speaker series on campus,

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.160
it's important to tag those
individual tracks with the

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.940
appropriate category so that people
can find those on those pages,

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.280
and we will highlight those.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.820
So you can end up having groups
that have a mixture of content

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:31.000
from different categories,
and you'll have, you know,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.020
groups that are, you know,
all about one subject, and that's fine.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.120
If you don't find a category in our
taxonomy that matches your content,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.610
we recommend do not pick one.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.660
We'll discover that we have
some holes in our taxonomy,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.610
and we'll fill those up by
noticing that some of the content

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.600
isn't getting categorized.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:57.960
So that's an interface for managing and
kind of getting an inventory of all the

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.340
category data for your iTunes U site.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.340
I won't go into the RSS feed.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.290
We've posted that on our support site,
and you can figure out how to categorize

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.350
tracks using feeds and web services.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.660
So with that,
let's kind of jump back out.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.340
We'll go into web services next and
take a look at the things that we've

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.120
changed in web services in the last year.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:29.310
If you haven't worked with
iTunes U web services before,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.360
I'm just going to do a
brief basic overview.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.790
In the last year,
we introduced it a year ago and talked

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.360
a lot about it at last year's session.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.360
We've added things to it.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.290
I want to cover a few key changes
and point on versioning that

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.360
we want to get across today.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.510
If I get nothing else across,
hopefully it's about using XSDs

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.360
and versioning on web services.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.460
So the web services provide a, you know,
programmatic interface for

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.270
manipulating the structure and
layout and content within your site.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.360
So what we have is a set of tools.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360
We have a set of tools.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.160
We have a set of operations.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.300
I'm not going to go through each one,
but these are operations that

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.360
you can put into an XML document
and request the server to change

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.330
something about your site.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.560
So in the top left, we've got ShowTree,
which allows you to get an

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.360
XML description of your iTunes U site.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.720
And then beyond that,
you can do operations like add course,

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.260
delete course,
add a track or delete a track.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.840
So this is a great way for you to
automate the addition of content,

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.360
manipulate content.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.360
If you've got a -- a capture
and record and delivery system,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.340
like podcast producer,
which we'll talk about in a second,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.330
this is a way to interact with
your iTunes U site and get a

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.360
lot of content in there quickly.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.920
So here's an example of how
we describe the format of how

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.990
you send these to iTunes U.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.850
An XSD is an XML schema.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.200
It describes how you post stuff to us.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.000
And it also describes how we are
going to respond to those requests.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.870
And we introduced this in the last year,
and there was a version one,

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.050
and we've been continually adding to it.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.400
And the XSD itself is an XML document.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.150
Here's a snippet of just the
very beginning of that document,

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.820
which describes the different
operations and the different data

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.960
you're going to get back and sort
of how it's going to be structured.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.270
This is our contract with you if
you're using Web Services to know

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.200
how to express and receive the data.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.870
So last year, we announced Web Services.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.860
We didn't have any kind
of versioning scheme.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.620
We've added that.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.850
So I'm going to call what
we did last year pre-1.0.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.420
We're trying to end of life that.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.950
And ask that all of your requests
that use Web Services include

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.260
a version string.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.510
And this is important because we
don't want to break your code,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.760
and we want to be able to respond to you
in exactly the way that you would expect.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.560
And so this is a list of the different
versions we've done in the last year,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.320
and we're planning to continue to support
those so that if you send a 1.02 request,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.510
you're going to get a
response in the same format.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.320
So like I said,
this is the one thing I want

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.960
to get across because I've
heard reports where we,

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.220
Apple, updated the iTunes use server,
and something on your side broke.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.510
We don't want that to happen.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.950
So we want you to upgrade to
newer versions on your own time.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.280
And so when we update our side,
we're going to rev the version

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.450
so that if we're going to change
the format of how we respond,

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.050
that's clear to you.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.880
And by sending us that
request with a version string,

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.140
you'll be given the opportunity
to upgrade on your own time.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.490
and we won't break you.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.300
That's my spiel on web services versions.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.860
One of the other changes we made this
year is we removed credential operations,

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.900
add credential and delete credential.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.890
They were really -- the way to interact
with this was -- is to use permission.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.510
So a credential is really
a piece of a permission,

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.290
so we removed that,
and I think that cleared

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:08.740
up some confusion.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.380
And then we want to make sure that
all of you that are building sites

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.000
with feeds have a great experience,
and so we made sure that web

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.710
services have operations to add,
remove, and refresh feeds.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.330
So our other operations tend to have add,
delete, and merge.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.970
That doesn't make sense with feeds.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.460
It's really just add and remove.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.760
We want the feed to be the master
system of record of that data,

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.220
so we don't want to be
trying to merge information.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.550
So it's really add the feed to
populate this tab or remove it.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.820
And then we've added a refresh
request so that if you're...

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.020
Capturing and uploading
in an automated way,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.780
you can tell our server, "Hey,
we just posted new content.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.330
Go fetch our feed again,
and we'll update the interface

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:02.710
and re-index the content." So we
automatically do that on a daily basis,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:08.800
but if you just posted something
and updated your feed and you want

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:08.950
to get that immediately in there,
you'd want to send one of these

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.950
requests to iTunes U Server.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:15.900
So, covered web services,
podcast producer.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.640
Podcast producer is a
part of Leopard Server,

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.100
and it is a new feature in the last year.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.490
And we want to talk about it,
and there's some other

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.980
sessions that talk about it,
because it's got a great

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.600
iTunes U integration story.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.060
And if you haven't seen it,
I recommend you check out some

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.560
of the other sessions on this,
which I'll highlight later.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.160
But it's a way to automate the capture,
the encoding, and delivery.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.620
And we're going to do
a demo in this session,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.680
but it's going to be in another session
on podcast producer for Leopard,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.820
the new version, Snow Leopard.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.280
So I recommend you check that out
because there's an interesting way

00:22:54.280 --> 00:23:00.180
of looking at how iTunes U will
integrate with Podcast Producer.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.470
So the idea with Podcast Producer and
Leopard Server was you could

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.190
take a piece of content,
capture it,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:12.470
add some other information to it, tag it,
put a header and footer on it,

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.660
and then tell iTunes U about it,
post it to iTunes U.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.650
And that's great.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:21.180
But we've done a lot to add feeds
and other services to iTunes U.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.950
So what we're talking
about with Snow Leopard,

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.780
the version Snow Leopard and
the new features they're adding,

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:34.310
is to be able to have their system
produce feeds that we synchronize

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.750
with so that as soon as you upload
the content you can manage with

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.680
the web service I just mentioned,
we would be able to have

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.860
iTunes U be updated.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.010
And the other idea that you will see
in the demonstration that they do

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:52.540
with Podcast Library is the idea that
we could populate everything we need

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.860
for an entire course from a feed.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.710
So you wouldn't have to go
and provision the course,

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.560
add the feed, add different tabs for the
different types of media.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.540
One thing that Podcast Library does
a great job of is it gives you

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.740
the ability to encode different
versions of the same content.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:12.020
So you could encode iPod video,
quality video.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.690
You could encode an audio version.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.750
You could encode a set track.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.920
And you could do a high
def version of that track,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.100
put it all in one feed,
tell iTunes U about it,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.780
and a course page gets created.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.780
So that was what we
were going to do here.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.710
We don't have that available.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.840
So I want to move on to our community
development and ask two people to come

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.640
up here and talk about what they've
been doing with iTunes U and give you

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.620
a flavor for how they're using web
services and some of the other things

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.670
that they're doing with iTunes U.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.680
So first I'd like to ask Rich Wolfe
from University of Illinois.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.780
Chicago to join us.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.800
I think I need the clicker thing.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.690
There you go.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.100
Okay.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.340
Hi, I'm Rich Wolf from UIC,
and I'm here to talk about

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.700
a little application that
I have called Woolloomloo.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.190
Okay, how did it all start?

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.300
Well, if you don't follow
iTunes U admin forums,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.570
basically it started like this.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.370
We got our iTunes U site
in August of 2006,

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.300
and just like you guys,
we get our credentials and our

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.940
admin string and stuff like that,
and we plug it in,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.640
and then all of a sudden we realize,
whoa, wait a minute,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.700
there's some extra work
that you have to do here.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.840
If you have a private site,
you have to come up with a

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.540
transfer script and a portal
website and so on and so forth.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.040
And, you know, we basically,
we figured it out,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.230
but there came a point at which I said,
well, you know, someone ought to write an

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.380
application that makes this a little
simpler for the first-time user.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.480
You can just go in and
put in your strings,

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.660
and it'll just work.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.120
And I looked for that app,
and I didn't see it, so I thought, well,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.190
I'll just make it.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.040
Okay,
so let me talk about the problem that

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.760
Willamaloo basically solves for you.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.830
You get your site
activation key from Apple,

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.630
and you click on it,
and you get these four

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.470
colored strings on top.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.660
And you can see that they're basically,
you know, they're your base URL,

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.710
your site shared secret,
your administrator credential,

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.100
and your debug suffix.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.340
And what you have to do is you
have to come up with this big,

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.870
long, monster,
white URL on the bottom that

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.360
basically describes what your,
you know,

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.530
what your iTunes view request is.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.400
And the problem that you have
is that you have to do this,

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.020
and you have to come up with a
credentialing scheme at the same time.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.960
So you have this problem where
you're trying to figure out your

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.480
credentials and how you're going to,
you know,

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.100
authorize people to get into iTunes view.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.910
And you want to actually get
in your site to do things.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.210
And so that's the problem that
Willamaloo basically solves,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:37.640
right?

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.240
It basically lets you get into your
site from the desktop so that you can

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.110
start playing with your credentials,
and you can see how they work,

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.940
and you can see what URLs should be
generated so you can compare with

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.990
what your transfer CGI is doing.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.410
So basically, it's really what I think is
basically the basic administration

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.240
tool that you have to have when
you're dealing with iTunes view.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.080
So when I looked at this, I said,
when I got the basic app out there,

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.220
I thought, well, can I do more with it?

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.600
Once I got past the point of figuring
out how your credentials ought to look,

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.280
I thought, well,
is there more that I can do with this?

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.700
And when the web services came out,
and all of a sudden it

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.860
became obvious that,
well, there's all these great

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.140
things that you can do.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.260
Like you can batch create courses,
or batch delete courses,

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.090
or do things that typically
you'd do as an administrator,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.560
but are kind of tough to do sometimes
from the iTunes U interface.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.610
So actually, the XML schema and the XSDs,
these are really cool things, I think,

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.200
in the web service API.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.340
So, okay,
so I want to talk a little bit about why

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.330
I think the XML schema is a great thing,
right?

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.450
And the first thing is the obvious thing.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.180
When you use the XML schema
in the web services,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.800
basically they make sure that
the data that you send to

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.420
Apple using the web services are,
you know,

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.450
the obvious thing is that you're
going to get data validation.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.330
The XSDs do this for you, right?

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.320
They validate your data.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.040
And that's a really cool thing.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.300
But the other cool thing that
I think is sometimes not really well

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.980
understood is that the XSDs are this
really great set of documentation.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.530
Even if the iTunes U admin guide doesn't
really explain what a web service does,

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.660
if you look at the XSDs,
it's kind of like a little header file.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.510
It really does describe what the web
service does in a pretty good way.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.150
So I look at the XSDs.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.310
I mean, a lot of times I'll turn to them
first even before I look at the

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.130
iTunes U admin guide to figure
out what a web service does.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.020
Okay.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.470
The other thing that they do is
they're actually information for

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.020
applications that you might write.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.300
And that might not seem really obvious,
but when you think about it,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.740
XML is just like this big,
long bag of UTF-8 characters usually.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.170
And what the XSDs bring to
it is they kind of bring a

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.730
little typing system to it.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.520
So if the XSDs say that
something is an XSD date,

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.050
then your application is going
to know that it's an XSD date,

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:45.690
right?

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.070
And since it validates the data,
your application can just know that

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.440
something is going to be a date or
a Boolean or an integer with values

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.720
from 2 to 10 or something like that.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.960
So that's a really cool
thing that it adds to XML.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.670
And the last thing I want to mention is
this thing that Eric was talking about,

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.090
which is the API contract with Apple,
which I think is really,

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.720
really important.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.380
Because you have an
application that you do,

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.320
and then Eric and his team,
they go in and they make

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.020
some changes to iTunes U.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.810
But as long as your application
versions and says that it's using,

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.570
say, the 103 XSD file,
the information that you're going

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.560
to get back from Apple is always
going to be the 103 response.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.720
So as long as you're
versioning correctly,

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.280
the API contract exists and the
application that you have still works.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.700
And an example of that
is the – we'll move.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.890
The desktop application
still uses the 103 XSDs,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.250
but the automator actions,
which I'm going to talk about,

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.800
actually use the new 111.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.970
So that still works.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:43.730
Okay, if you want to get these tools,
I actually have them on a website,

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.810
itunes.uic.edu/willamaloo.html,
and all the tools and

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.610
documentation are up there for
you to grab if you want to do it.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.710
And I just basically give
this stuff away for free,

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.620
so you can just grab it.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.300
And with that,
I think I'm going to try and do a little

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.610
demo of how these things all operate.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.930
I think this is where I have
to ask for the laptop demo.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.280
There we go.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:13.790
Okay,
so let's say that I just got my-- oops,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.500
wrong one.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.500
Say that I just got my iTunes U site and
I've clicked on my site activation link.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.280
And these are the kind of
strings that Apple sends you,

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.720
your base URL, your shared secret,
and so on.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.260
So what I wanna do is I wanna get
into my iTunes U site directly.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:32.810
So what I'll do is I'll
open up my applications.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.390
And I'll go to Woolloomooloo,
which is way on the bottom,

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.740
because it starts with a W.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.340
And when you fire up Woolloomooloo,
the first thing that does is it says,

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.640
"Oh, I know you've gotten these
three strings from Apple,

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:48.520
your base URL, your shared secret,
and your debug suffix,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.020
so can you just paste them
in here?" So let me do that.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.180
Okay, I got him in there.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.760
And then when you do that,
willamaloo does some things behind the

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.140
scenes and it figures out a few things
and it basically sets up a little bit.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.440
And what I wanna do is I wanna
grab a copy of my site XML.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.080
So to do that, I'm just gonna click on
this little refresh button.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.780
And what that does is it goes off and
it grabs a copy of my site XML and it

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.490
should display hopefully in a second.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.190
There it goes.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.480
Okay,
so you can see that my site's come up,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.790
and Willa Maloo knows that's the site,
and you can do things like

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.130
you can drill down and see,
you know,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.760
if there's things inside your site,
and you have these forward and back

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.030
arrows that do different things.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.510
But let's say that I want to, just now,
I just want to go straight to my site

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.840
and see how this is going to look.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.900
So what I can do is I can click
on this little reveal button,

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.460
and what it does is
it generates that big,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.000
long, white URL that we saw
in an earlier slide,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.350
and it opens to your site as an admin.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.270
So that's how that works.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.250
Okay, thanks.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.150
Okay, so just in order to save time,
what I've done is I've created a

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.950
pre-baked set of settings here so
that we can do this real quick,

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.780
and I will refresh again
as a site administrator.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.540
Okay, and what you can do is you can
become different roles at your site.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.200
So you can see here that
I have different roles set up.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.380
I can have a student role,
an instructor role, different things.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.660
And you can see in the little
drawer that it basically shows

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.020
what credentials each person has.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.480
So I can, you know,
if I want to be a site administrator,

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.720
it has a certain credential and others.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.400
So what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to access my site as a student.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.920
So I'm just going to become
a student just so that you

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.120
can see what this looks like.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.040
And when I do that,
it basically goes off and it should,

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.000
with any luck,
re-access my site as a student.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.220
And now you can see all those
edit links have gone away.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.500
So now I know my student
credentials are going to work.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.000
I can see that that's going to look good.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Now, you can also use the tool to
do a lot of other fun things.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.290
Let me switch back to
a site administrator.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.380
And what I can do is, if you want,
I can open the site using

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.610
Apple's debug webpage.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.470
This is something that you see,
so if you need to generate these

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.200
credentials and send them to Apple,
you can.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.640
You can also do things
like look at site logs.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:24.290
So what I'll do is I'll set here
and I'll scroll back a couple days

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.910
to make sure I got something good,
and we'll get our logs.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.890
and you can see that it
generates all the site logs for

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.580
a set of days that you specify.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.490
You can go back 60 days.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:37.120
You can use these little tables
to sort on the type of log or

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.450
you can search for things and you
can do all kinds of fun stuff.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:45.860
One of the tools that I really like that
I'm hoping you guys will find useful

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.680
is this thing called the URL Composer.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.570
And what this does is it basically allows
you to generate any valid URL that you

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.060
would normally send to Apple's iTunes U.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.230
So, just as a little fun trick,
what I can do is I can say, well,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.870
I want to use my site administrator role.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.030
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to
enable that and I'm going to change the

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.840
basic command from browse to show tree.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.520
And you can see that it basically
generates a showtree command,

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.800
but this URL is actually live,
so what I can do is

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.480
I can cut and copy it,
go off into Safari,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.410
bring up a new window.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.830
Oops, I can close this window now.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.770
I don't need it.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.470
Paste in there.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.500
And it's an instant showtree,
so you can see your site URL that way.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.410
Thanks.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.940
Okay, so, and then there's other things
that the tool lets you do,

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:37.500
too.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.540
Like, there's a bunch of inspectors.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.820
Oops, sorry, let me go back in the tool.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.250
There's inspectors that you can use.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.140
So, you can see a themes inspector here,
so you can look at your themes.

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.400
And I'll make this so that you can change
your themes and re-upload them to Apple.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.480
And there's also a permissions inspector,
so you can see what permissions your

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.980
site actually has for this level.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.320
So, that's kind of neat.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.740
And then, hopefully,
I'm thinking about ways that

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:59.660
you can actually use this
tool to change these things.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:05.100
So, let me close up these little windows,
and then let me mention something

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.140
that I get asked about a billion,
zillion times, and that is,

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.760
this is really great,
but my basic problem is

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.620
that I'm a Windows user,
and I don't have a Mac.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:23.370
So what I've done is I've actually
taken the time to-- I've bitten

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:27.030
the bullet and I've learned enough
about .NET 2 to actually create a

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.610
Windows application for you guys that
does the basic stuff that the Mac does.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.160
So for example,
I can use this and say that

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.620
I want to open my site settings.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.100
I'll open them up here.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.000
And you can see that basically
it has the same concept of that.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.550
You can have different roles,
and you can have different

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.880
credentials and so on.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.200
And I'll just tell it to open my site.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.930
Hopefully,
if Explorer can figure this out.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.360
There we go.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.240
And we'll agree.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.580
Hi, Explorer.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:01.580
Stupid.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:05.750
But basically,
this uses your default browser,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.300
whatever it is,
and then it goes in and you can see

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.560
that it accesses your site as an admin.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.810
And you can use the same tool in
Windows to basically verify that

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:11.680
your credentials are going to work.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.140
So now let me talk about the
web services side of this.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.390
And, you know, you've basically seen
how this tool works.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.400
But what I want to do is I want to say,
well, you know, now I can do more stuff.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.430
So what I've done is, let me shrink this,
and I will close this window

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.210
because I don't need it.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.000
I'll just close you just
to not be confusing.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.800
Okay, so what I've done is I said, well,
you know,

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.560
maybe what you want to do is you
want to -- where's my cursor?

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:41.560
There it is.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.130
What you want to do is you
want to do a little bit more.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.670
So I thought, well,
what are typical things

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.200
that you need to do?

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.630
You need to delete 20 courses or
you need to change tracks for 52

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.580
courses or something like that.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.250
So what I've done is I've created a
set of Willamaloo Automator actions

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.680
that you can use with Automator.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:00.770
You can see here that
there's a whole bunch.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.030
You can do things like find
tracks in the site or generate

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.200
site logs or get XML or whatever.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.450
So what I do is I have a little
automator action here that

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.260
what it does is it allows you,
it basically looks at the contents

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:16.860
of a currently open text document and
it basically will look at that file.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.820
Let's see what it is.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.590
I have a...

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.640
- So I have a site here
with my courses in it.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:30.430
So these are maybe four courses
that I want to create on my site

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.430
because when I look at my site,
I see that, well, sorry.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.250
I see that, you know, I have this new and
noteworthy section on top,

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.940
and I'd like to add a
couple of courses to it.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:37.960
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.420
I'm going to use this
automated interaction,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.630
and what it does is it looks at the
currently open text of the document,

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.150
and it pulls the data that's in there.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.010
And then what it'll do is it'll
send it to the add courses to,

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.840
basically it adds
courses to parent handle,

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.480
whatever you have.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.270
And if you don't know how
the web service works,

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.620
parent handle is kind of this thing
that you get from iTunes U that

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.170
says basically it's a container
that you want to put courses in.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.530
So it's like a group or a
division or something like that.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.420
So I've already
pre-populated mine with this,

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.950
and let me run this script
and see if it actually works,

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.070
and hopefully it does.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.150
Okay, so it grabs a file,
and it goes off.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.700
With any kind of luck,
it'll do the right thing.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:26.690
Okay.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.380
So what I'll do is
I'll go back to iTunes,

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.990
and I'll refresh my site.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.270
And you can see that it created
all four of these courses.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.740
So if you need to do this,
you can imagine that you might

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.220
have like a million courses
that you want to create,

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.940
and it'll do that.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:51.100
So that's basically my demo,
and I'm done.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.100
Thanks.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.090
Thanks, Rich.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.570
Very cool stuff.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.340
One thing I forgot to
mention I want to point out,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.740
we talked about web services a bit.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.640
If you don't send version,
it's still going to work,

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.520
but you're going to get locked
into version 1.1 of the XSD.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:16.260
So we had communicated to our site admins
that we were trying to end versioning,

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.180
and we really want you to
use the version strings,

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.360
but if you don't, you're going to get
locked into the 1.1 XSD.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.330
So with that,
I want to bring up Cindy Franco from

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.020
Vanderbilt University.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.240
A lot of you use Blackboard,
and they've been gracious enough to

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.970
share their solution in Blackboard,
and Cindy's going to talk about that.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.640
Good morning.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.320
One of the things that we did
at Vanderbilt was we created a

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.400
building block for Blackboard.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.680
We had a hard time trying to figure out

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.980
How are we going to get all these
students to connect to iTunes U?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.520
We have audio, video,
we want to organize courses,

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.540
we want to add organizations,
but we also wanted to share

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.060
the building block with others.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.850
And one of the things that
I do is maintain relationships

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:18.800
with our users and provide some
high-level implementation support.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.950
We had a lot of content
that we wanted to get out.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.490
That was probably the most important
reason why we went iTunes U.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.690
But we also wanted to expand the
course use of audio and video.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.540
We needed secure course
content and user information,

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.230
so it was real important,
whatever we chose,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.560
that our user information was secure.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.730
And we wanted to expand
the use of new media.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.570
We looked at Blackboard,
and Blackboard's not a streaming server.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.570
We've had some issues with
people uploading some really

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:50.580
large audio/video files,
slowing down our server.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.140
We have dedicated servers,
we have clustered servers.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.130
We've tried to do everything
on the Blackboard side,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.690
but it just wasn't working out for us.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.580
We had some other campus servers.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.020
They didn't quite work.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.040
iTunes U out of the box was great,
but it didn't connect Blackboard.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.060
And we wanted our students
to go to Blackboard to,

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:00.100
we wanted them to know that if they
needed something for their course,

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:00.300
they could go to Blackboard.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.420
We had some other campus servers.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.190
They didn't quite work.

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.370
iTunes U out of the box was great,
but it didn't connect Blackboard.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.870
And we wanted our students
to go to Blackboard to,

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:09.420
we wanted them to know that if they
needed something for their course,

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.520
they could go to Blackboard.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.230
And we wanted our students
to go to Blackboard to,

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.250
we wanted them to know that if they
needed something for their course,

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.850
they could go to Blackboard.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.740
And they don't have to think about, oh,
I have to log into iTunes U now.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.390
We wanted it simple and streamlined.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.340
We did look at some other
Blackboard solutions,

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.740
but it just didn't quite work for us.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.280
So what we did,
we created a building block.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.690
This was pre-web services,
and we started in spring of '07.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:36.400
And we took a look at what we had,
what we were doing with Blackboard,

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.330
and this is the workflow
right now as it stands.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.740
Faculty logs into Blackboard.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.650
They don't have to know
that it's iTunes U.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:47.650
They request iTunes U building block.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.360
An email is automatically generated
to the iTunes U administrator.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:56.040
They get an email notice,
they set up the iTunes U space,

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:58.700
they map the course in
Blackboard manually.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.570
You have to go in and
tell it this is the map.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:06.950
An email is automatically
generated to the faculty member,

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:11.590
and then they can go
in and upload content.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.930
In between, there's this place.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.740
Do you want it public?

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.700
Do you want it private?

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.660
There's no easy way to do it.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.690
This is manual between the iTunes
U administrator and the faculty member.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.700
There are some email exchanges going on.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.700
After the content's uploaded,
the faculty member then has to go back

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.660
and create a link in Blackboard to tell,
so the students can

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.690
access the iTunes U site.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.840
With web services,
this is what we're planning to

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.700
do this summer in conjunction
with a couple of other schools,

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.700
is to streamline this.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.120
Yes.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.480
- So just three steps.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.480
The only manual place would
be the public or private.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.300
And the way we see it is
that that was difficult.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.440
We were losing a lot of
faculty with all those steps.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.530
After the second email, they just say,
"Forget it.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.270
I'm just not going to use iTunes U."

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.810
We came to this place after talking
to some of the schools and our users.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.100
You know, just figure out what was best.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:15.540
So when we were talking about
on-campus implementation,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.490
we did a lot of campus promotion.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.340
We had training sessions.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.780
There's RSS feeds, university websites,
blogs.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.750
With other users, I do maintain

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:32.180
A list of our users.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.540
People get this from word of mouth.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.590
I just found out that
someone's distributing one

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:37.500
version of our building block.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.790
I just stumbled upon it.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.620
I didn't even know that was happening,
but that was great.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.640
We go to a university website,
you can get this, but it is free.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.900
Web services is not enabled,
which is why I didn't want to do a demo.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.700
Not until we get it all streamlined.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.990
But what it does is it
passes user student role in a

00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:00.200
course and their enrollments,
all their enrollments.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.680
No student data is transferred.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.660
That was very important to us.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.020
No IDs, no Blackboard IDs.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.600
They don't need a separate Apple ID.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.990
Same thing with our instructors.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:14.700
If an instructor is a graduate student,
say, and is also taking courses,

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.400
All that information
is passed to iTunes U.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:19.580
Student logs in.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.820
They can either go directly to their
course or they can back up a little bit,

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.480
and they can actually access all of their
courses with appropriate permissions.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.620
One of the things with
our building block,

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.940
though, is when we,
what I tell people is it's

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.690
beautiful once it's working.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.840
Not just that it's our building block,
but it's beautiful.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.700
But the hardest part
is getting it set up.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.920
But once you get it set up,
it works great.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.850
So, which is why it is important to me to
maintain a list of those users and make

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:52.740
sure that everybody does have a good,
successful implementation of

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.740
our building block and iTunes U.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:45:01.120
And that's just my brief talk about what
we did at Vanderbilt and Blackboard.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.620
Thanks, Cindy.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.880
So to wrap things up
before we get into Q&A,

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.630
a couple of things I want
to make you aware of.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.390
If you don't know where our documentation
is and our support services,

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:20.640
that's the URL.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.700
Mark Malone.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.440
Hey, Mark.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.500
He's our technology
evangelist for iTunes U.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.780
And this is important,
some of the related sessions.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.000
We have a lab this afternoon
for iTunes U on the first floor.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.860
And if you have some
real detailed questions,

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:39.170
we encourage you to stop by and take
a look and ask those questions of us.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.960
There are several sessions I mentioned
earlier on Podcast Producer,

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.070
and these are those.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.660
So if you want to learn more
about the integration of

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:52.220
Podcast Producer with iTunes U,
all of those, I think we'll mention it.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.030
And I think the last one
goes into the greatest depth.
