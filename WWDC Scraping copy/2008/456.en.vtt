WEBVTT

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.660
Good morning.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.800
John Galunzi.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.900
I just want to kick this session off and
tell you what's going to happen because

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.880
it's a little bit of a non-standard
session for us at WDC in a couple of

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.230
ways and sort of lay the agenda for you
so you know what to expect and then I'm

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.840
going to kick it over to the KPCB folks.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.080
So what we're going to do is kind of like
a feedback forum except the KPCB folks

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.700
are going to speak for about 10 minutes,
just kick off,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.400
give you some information about
the iFun and about who they

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.260
are and how they can help you.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.470
And then we're going to turn it over
to Q and A and you can get to the

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.690
mics and ask questions that might be
appropriate for the whole group to hear,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.290
the whole room to hear.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.210
And then we're going to follow
up immediately after that.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.850
We'll just basically put some
KPCB folks through the room and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.060
you'll be able to meet with them.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.380
You can talk to them individually
and show them what you've got and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.960
talk to them about your specific
proposal or ideas or what have you.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.150
So just to reiterate,
start off with a very quick

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.990
presentation about the iFun
and then we'll do some Q and A.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.800
So prepare your questions based on what
you hear and then we'll break out and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.050
you can meet with the folks from KPCB.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.160
So to kick that part off,
let me introduce Matt Murphy who's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.060
a partner with Kleiner
Perkins in managing the iFun.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.780
Matt, do you want to come on up?

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.500
Hi, I'm Matt Murphy from Kleiner Perkins,
Kauffman & Byers.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.860
I manage the iFun along with several
of my partners who are here today

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.400
who we'll introduce you to later.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.600
First, I want to thank all
of you for being here.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.700
I know that you have a lot of choices.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.200
It's a busy week and we
really appreciate your time.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.340
And we're looking forward to
the conversations we're going to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.030
have later to learn more about
you and what you're working on.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.530
After spending a bit of
time around here this week,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.420
it's clear that $100
million is a good start,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.430
but given all the enthusiasm and
everything we see going on here,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.300
it's probably insufficient.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.590
But it's a starting point.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.110
So, a little bit more about us.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.500
As John was saying,
what we're going to do today is just

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.670
a real quick overview of who we are,
kind of some of the big themes that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.100
we think are important in mobile,
how to work with the iFunnd,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.700
and then we'll break.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.900
So, us.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.390
We've been in the business for
over 30 years and we tend to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.500
have found some big opportunities
around a new platform emerging.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.540
So, you go back to the PC era
or the computing era,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.970
beginning of the computing era
around Compaq and some microsystems.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.290
And unfortunately, we missed Apple,
but that's a longer story.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.360
And hopefully, being up here today,
the iFunnd and working with

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.000
all of you going forward
will be a bit of redemption.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
As the Internet emerged,
companies like Google, Netscape, Amazon,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.970
and we fully believe that in a few years
as we look back on this chart here of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.020
icons of companies we've invested in,
that as this emergence of

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.700
the mobile Internet emerged,
we're going to be able to do a lot more.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.890
And hopefully,
as the emergence of the mobile

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.130
Internet platform happens,
that companies of equal magnitude will

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.200
be built around the mobile Internet.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.700
You can see some quick
statistics on number of IPOs,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.640
number of jobs we've helped create,
revenues, et cetera.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.700
This is our team.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.850
We call it the iTeam.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.240
This is the number of people
within the firm who work at

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.590
some level with the iFun.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.840
So we're putting a lot of
people behind the effort.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.810
We think it's really important.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.300
We'll introduce some
of those to you later.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.290
So powerful trends.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.430
Why are we so excited
about the mobile Internet,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.760
about the iPhone, and about the iFun?

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.490
If you look at to date,
about 6 million units sold.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.940
And going forward by the end of '09,
who knows what it's going to be.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.180
But with a $199 price point,
with all of you, all the developers,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.740
all of the applications that are coming,
we're clearly about to hit an

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.890
inflection point and the curve
could be steeper than that.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.130
So exciting times.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.110
Also, as all of you know,
a terrific development environment

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.290
is crucial for getting more
applications onto mobile devices.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.970
And Apple's nailed that one and
that's why we're all here this week.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.910
3G.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.740
Unless you have 3G,
you've got an experience that's

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.540
still too slow for some of the
things that we all want to do.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.690
3G is now solved both in the new
iPhone as well as becoming fairly

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.270
ubiquitous around the world.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.530
User awareness and early adoption--
the whole ecosystem is buzzing around

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.330
new applications that are coming.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.930
A device like the iPhone--
we're seen people do different

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.170
things with their mobile devices
than they ever have before.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.980
And we're seeing a strong
early adopter audience.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.500
I'm sure you know some of the statistics,
but about 20% of people access the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.220
mobile internet on regular phones,
90 plus percent on the iPhone.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.690
It's a good platform to be on.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.500
And one of the most broken things
within the mobile ecosystem

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.550
historically has been discovery
and a distribution channel.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.850
It's been too hard to get your
applications out to users-- too much

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.170
friction working with the carriers,
and a really broken discovery paradigm.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.120
About 70% of people only download
an application within the first

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.540
week of getting the phone.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.180
And we all know that this is clearly
going to change with the App Store and

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.090
having a good discovery experience.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.560
And finally,
the most exciting thing to us and

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.760
the premise of the iFun is that
developers are coming to mobile in

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.940
droves that they never were before.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.000
And I think part of that is
all the things we just talked

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.600
about and other trends about
what's going on on the iPhone.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.810
And if there's any indication of that,
the fact that this event is sold out,

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.180
that all of you are here,
it's an exciting time to be

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.180
an entrepreneur in mobile.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.990
So areas of interest...
what are we looking at?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.400
Real-time social networking,
mobile advertising.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.740
I'm not going to read through all these,
but you can kind of see... there's

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.400
probably not a lot of surprises here.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.230
These are kind of the big
categories as we see them.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.400
Gaming--we've seen a lot
of different gaming demos,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.300
et cetera,
and it's a terrific device for that.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.350
But I think what we're mainly looking for
is new applications that take advantage

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.020
of a mobile experience and think
about all the capabilities within the

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.400
iPhone to deliver something that users
haven't had available to them before.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.340
And then the last one is
just totally cool new things.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.160
I think we're going to be surprised,
both in conversations with all of

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.600
you and once the App Store launches,
about the kinds of applications

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.080
that we see emerge,
the new use cases that we can't really

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.420
predict until we see it out there.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.940
So what are some of the big ideas?

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.940
We call it augmented reality and
there's an example in our portfolio.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.550
The first iFun company called Whirl.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.930
The company's Pelago and
the product is Whirl.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.920
But there's this notion that
you've always got this always on

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.200
personal location aware device.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.200
It knows who you are, where you are,
it can learn your personal profile,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.200
the kinds of things you're interested in.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.160
It's got a quasi social network
in it which is your phone book.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.800
So how do you take all that information
that's always with your device and

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.200
interact with the physical world?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.840
Get smarter about the world
going on around you through

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.500
the use of this device.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.300
Real time social gaming,
interacting with people

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.000
as you play games,
and it could be anything from a

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.810
simple poker game to a virtual world
where you're interacting with other

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.400
people's characters and so forth.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.070
Mobile identity management is basically
how do you -- you've got all this

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.900
information on the mobile Internet.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.060
How do you basically have a
common identity that allows you

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.300
to access a lot of information?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.000
Your life stream,
the information you care about in the

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.900
moment instead of having to go through 20
different accounts or try and figure out

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.300
what information you care about or not.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.760
Micro payments, I think we're going
to see micro payments,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.620
but we're also going to
see virtual currency,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.220
virtual goods, and things like that.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.330
Hyper local discovery,
so now again going back to the

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.740
personalization of the device,
the location awareness of the device,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.260
I think we're going to have a huge
opportunity to hyper target people

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.740
both in terms of their interests and
as well as in terms of advertising

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.240
and promotion and things like that.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.800
And the last two are kind of a catchall,
personalization and location enablement.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.700
Those are going to be things
that are built into many,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.000
many applications.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.110
I think the most important
thing is that the devices

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.000
themselves aren't applications.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.120
It's the fact that the device now
has those things and those can

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.780
be provided in a lot of different
applications to create new experiences

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.000
as well as the accelerometer
which you see in the icon there.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.400
Why the iFund?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.440
Well, as you see in the picture here,
it's all about the hugs.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.890
We give good hugs.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:46.260
There's been a longstanding relationship
between Kleiner Perkins and Apple.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:52.780
And the formation of the iFund
was a long time in coming around.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.950
And we launched it with the
launch of the SDK in early March.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.900
And there's some real alignment
around what we were trying to achieve.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.010
Kind of from our standpoint,
capital and company building

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.480
expertise from the Apple standpoint.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.800
Having a partner who could
deliver those things.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.070
And for them to deliver their strategic,
technical,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.760
and marketing support to some of
the best and brightest entrepreneurs

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.120
and the best and most interesting
companies that we all see.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.990
So there's a lot of kind of,
it fit our mutual goals pretty well.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We believe by being part of the
iFund that we can help you in an

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:34.740
advantaged way to be successful in
the iPhone and iPod Touch ecosystem.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.580
And there's, of course,
collaboration with Apple.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.680
And with other iPhone companies.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.160
And a lot of good press and PR, I think,
around being an iFund company.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.520
So what have we seen so far?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.840
Just some quick statistics on that.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.140
We've had about over 2,000 proposals
received so far and we're through about

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.200
90%. So hopefully you have all seen that.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.850
We're sticking to our two-week
turnaround time and we're

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.800
engaged with about 100 so far.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.560
And just to put this
number in perspective,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.740
this is about a factor of 20 more
plans than we would have seen in

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.800
kind of this three-month period
prior to launching the iFun.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.790
So I think it's clearly been
successful for us and I think

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.430
successful for entrepreneurs in
terms of connecting with a venture

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.830
firm and a fund that's really bullish
and interested in the mobile area.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.250
Just this is a little bit hard to read.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.160
Well, actually,
I think you can read it pretty well.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.920
But this is a distribution of plans.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.120
About 85% of plans we received
so far are consumer-facing.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.140
That's probably not a surprise.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.020
And the distribution within that
is actually fairly clustered,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.520
somewhere between 4% and 10% if you
look at the different categories,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.140
like social networking
or games or multimedia,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.860
content sharing, things like that.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.160
There wasn't any category
that was over-indexed.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.850
We got a good distribution of plans,
which was encouraging to us

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.080
that people have a wide range,
variety of ideas and are

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.350
trying to innovate across
a lot of different sectors.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.060
So keys to iPhone success.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.910
I want to talk a little bit about
what's the iPhone looking for as you

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.920
approach us and how to think about that.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.940
I mentioned this before,
but think about a new mobile use case.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.540
Don't just kind of replicate something
that was on the web and port it over

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.590
and say Amazon worked on the web,
therefore I'm going to

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.740
create Amazon for the web.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.060
Amazon can, sorry,
for the mobile internet.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.000
Amazon can create the
Amazon for the mobile internet.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.610
What's going to be different about
a shopping experience or so forth

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.890
that's going to tie in some of
the unique aspects of the iPhone

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.310
or location and things like that.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.680
Those are the things to think about,
a new behavior and use case.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.320
And that goes to the
second point on the do's,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.760
which is leverage the
iPhone's unique capabilities,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.820
the address book, the accelerometer, GPS.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.510
Deliver a killer user experience.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.500
Really focus on a great user experience.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.750
From the get-go,
keeping something simple,

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.850
making the user understand
why they're using it.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.310
That first 20 minutes of the day,
that's a 20-second and then

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.660
five-minute experience is
critical for being successful.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.060
And demo a prototype that will stand out.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.840
So far in the iPhone,
I think we see a lot of plans that

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.370
are ideas that seem like wouldn't
this be great if somebody built it

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.120
and if this worked and users loved it.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.170
Come up with something a little bit
more crisp than that that's a prototype

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.100
that shows how you've conceptualized
your ideas and illustrated your

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.600
ideas and why that's a big deal.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.620
On the don't side,
probably things that aren't a good fit

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.460
for the iPhone are niche applications.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.630
We've seen a lot of narrow applications
like a great new golf app or a surf

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.800
report app or things like that.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.000
Those are too narrow, too niche.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.780
It's kind of from going
back to the first slide.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.840
What we're really looking for is
kind of those foundational set of

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.890
applications on the mobile Internet just
like we did in the Internet and

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.960
the computing wave before that.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.550
Don't underestimate
the importance of team.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.850
I think in other things we often see
one person and maybe doesn't have

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.080
the right set of either technical
competence or maybe doesn't have

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.740
the right set of skills or maybe
doesn't have the right set of business

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.080
competence or business competence to
kind of build the idea they're pursuing.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.630
So think about how to build a really
great team that covers the main aspects

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:12.710
of what would be necessary to deliver
this application and this experience.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.940
And finally, don't submit an early raw
idea that's undifferentiated.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.440
Early and raw is actually
better than undifferentiated.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.260
I think we see a lot of things
where we'll see 50 restaurant

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.660
finder applications or something
like that in the iFund.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.990
And so think about what you're
building that somehow is differentiated

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.800
and can stand the test of time
relative to other competitors or

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.080
people out there in this big world,
mobile world that's

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.130
everywhere as we know.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.490
So how are you going to be
different and how's that going

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.290
to stand the test of time?

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.050
Okay, summarizing here,
three ways to work with the iFun.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.500
First, submit a proposal to the iFun.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.120
You can do that either off of
the Apple developer website.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.020
There's a link to this
page or off our home page,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.840
www.kpcb.com.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.960
You'll find this page.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.610
So go there and there's a
standard form that tells you

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.610
how to submit an application.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.840
Next, if you're not thinking
about starting a company,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.150
think about joining an iFun company.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.300
And we're here with
my recruiting partner,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.510
Jordan Ormont,
who we'll introduce you to in a minute.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.060
Here's his email address.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.110
Send him your resume.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.110
There's a lot of companies,
both that we funded and that

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.000
we're working on or incubating.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.790
And of course, as you can all imagine,
the biggest shortage is of great people.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.290
So we'd like to see your resumes.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.640
And here's some of the companies
in the portfolio right now.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.200
iFun portfolio,
Pelago with their product Whirl,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.440
and a company called iControl.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.540
And there's some stealth companies
that if you connect with us,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.730
we can introduce you to them.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.110
And finally,
if you're starting an incubation project,

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.130
there's some areas that
we're interested in:

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.840
mobile advertising, commerce, payments,
and healthcare,

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.360
where we've got some active
explorations underway.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.300
And we'd love to hear your ideas or
potentially include you in those.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.220
And you can email to my partner,
Chi-Hua Chen.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.990
All right, so I introduced our I team,
and here are the people

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.390
today that are with us,
and maybe it'd be best

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.260
if you guys... Actually,
we will come up at the end after the Q&A,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.970
and I can introduce each of you.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.300
But real quick,
Trey Vassallo has spent a good part

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.660
of the last 10 years in mobile.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.400
She was a company called Good Technology,
which was a RIM competitor

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.980
acquired by Motorola.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.720
Bing Gordon, who just recently joined us,
he was CMO of Creative Arts,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.040
so anything consumer-facing,
entertainment, games, et cetera,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.360
he's your man,
and he's much broader than that as well.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.260
Ellen Pao, deep software experience
background out of Tell Me and BEA.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:44.420
Chiwa Chen,
great consumer-facing experience,

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.020
kind of understands virality,
customer acquisition,

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.700
all those kind of things,
longtime Internet,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.640
both entrepreneur and venture capitalist.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.450
And then finally,
I mentioned Jordan Ormont,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.620
who's our recruiting partner.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.450
So they'll come up on
stage after the Q&A,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.340
and then what we'll do after
the Q&A is we'll kind of break,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.980
pick them up into different
places around the room,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.280
and we'll be, we want to discuss your,
see your prototypes, your demos,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.500
and spend up to five minutes with anyone
who's interested to do that today.
