WEBVTT

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.900
Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to today's session.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.500
So my name is Kjell Bronder,
and I'll be presenting today

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.220
with my fellow Frenchman,
Eric Circlaeys.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.420
And as he would say,
we are both podcast producer engineers.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.060
So we're going to be taking an in-depth
look into Podcast Producer today.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.060
So before we even get started,
how many of you were here last year

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.530
when we announced Podcast Producer?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.580
Cool.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.980
And how many of you have actually
played with Podcast Producer since

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.890
we shipped it in Leopard?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.440
So I'm pretty sure that you've
heard by now that with Snow Leopard,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.410
we're announcing Podcast Producer 2.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.630
And if you were at
Devo's session yesterday,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.140
you heard that there's a
lot of new cool features.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.910
But this is an in-depth session,
so we're not going to have

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.490
time to look at all of them.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.360
So we focused on Devo's
wife's favorite two.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.700
So we're going to look at the Workflow
Editor and the Podcast Library.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm sure you all know where
that sound comes from.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.820
So the Workflow Editor is our solution
to make it really easy and just

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.340
a lot of fun to write workflows.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.370
The Podcast Library is our new way of
publishing content from Podcast Producer.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.640
We'll now host all your content
and serve it up through Atom feeds.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.400
And we're going to take a look
at both of these features.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.960
But before we do that,
I'd like to make sure that everybody's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.520
on the same page about what a
Podcast Producer workflow actually is.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.840
So think of a Podcast Producer workflow
as a podcasting recipe.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.630
As any recipe,
you have an ingredients list.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.770
This is a list of the different
resources the Podcast Producer system

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.530
is going to use to create your content.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.280
So examples are like an intro video
or the watermark image that you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.610
want to brand all your content with.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.880
But a recipe isn't just ingredients.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.470
You also have a list of instructions.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.140
These are the different tasks that you
have to complete in a specific order.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.500
You can't bake the bread
before you've made the dough.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.580
For Podcast Producer,
it's the same thing.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.740
So we've broken down the type of
instructions that you can give a podcast

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.000
producer into three main categories that
I'm going to go over with you right now.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.900
The first category is the
mixing of your content.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.460
This is where you take your intro video,
your outro video, your watermark image,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.720
and you mix everything together.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.440
Once you're done with this,
you have your dough.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.800
What you have to do with dough, well,
you have to bake it.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.350
So this is where you encode your
content to all the different

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.930
formats that you want to publish.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.690
If you have an iPod audio, iPod video,
if you have an Apple TV version

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.190
you want to publish.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.600
Then once you've baked your bread, well,
you have to deliver it.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.880
So this is where you publish
your content to maybe an

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.660
RSS feed or to your blog server.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.860
So let's recap real quick.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.880
You need to mix your content, bake it,
and deliver it.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.590
So this is what a podcast producer
workflow actually looks like.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.960
Now that we're all on the same page about
what a podcast producer workflow is,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.520
let's start talking
about the first feature,

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.920
the podcast library.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.940
So let's go back to this
diagram that you see what the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.160
workflow actually looks like.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.150
If you look at the last step,
you can see that we published to

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.700
the Wiki server and to iTunes U,
for example.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.590
A lot of the feedback we got
was that our users wanted to,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.190
or you guys, wanted to publish to
different destinations.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.330
And here are just a few examples.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.280
Well, to do this with a current product,
you have to write a command

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.300
line tool that knows how to
communicate with this service,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.590
and that can also upload
your content to it.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.200
This is actually some extra
development that needs to be done

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.100
and wasn't as easy as we'd like.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.390
So we're introducing with
Snow Leopard the Podcast Library.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.990
Now you can see why we're in purple,
because all of our slides

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.090
are really nice and purple.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.160
So the podcast library is here.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.900
We're now gonna host your content for
you on the Podcast Producer system.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.740
We're gonna be serving up
the content with Atom feeds.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.000
So now your exterior services will
subscribe to those Atom feeds,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.690
and that way,
they will be automatically notified

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.100
when new content is posted.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.490
There's no more uploading
to those different services.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.350
So that's the goal of
the podcast library.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.880
And as I said, we're using Atom feeds.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.600
So why did we choose Atom?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.420
So we believe Atom is the
future for podcasting.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.880
There are a lot of reasons to that.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.750
But the one I want to go over today is it
gets over one of the problems with RSS.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.480
Today in RSS, for each episode,
you can only have one content

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.640
attached to that episode.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.640
So to get over this problem,
there are several solutions,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.870
but the most commonly used one is
to have a separate RSS feed for

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.860
each format you want to publish to.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.630
So if you're going to have an
iPod video and audio only and

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.120
a higher-def Apple TV version,
you're probably going to have

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.330
three different RSS feeds
for the same material.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.880
Well, Atom supports multiple
enclosures per episode.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.290
So this means that you can have all your
different formats in that one episode.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.080
So you can have your three
formats in that one episode,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.390
and you don't have to maintain
three different feeds anymore.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.080
So now I'm going to hand
the clicker over to Eric,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.340
and he's going to show you how the
podcast library actually works.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.900
Thank you, Kjell.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.850
Good morning.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.740
The podcast library is a very
interesting piece of technology.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.030
We completely reversed the publishing
model that we have today by leveraging

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.850
the syndication paradigm in order to
standardize the content distribution

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.540
and to improve and simplify the
integration with external services.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.870
The whole idea is to publish every
generated major to the library.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.260
The structure behind the scenes
takes care of everything.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.450
The major files, the metadata,
all the information related to your

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.370
recordings and the post-processings.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.700
Everything is stored on
the Shared File system.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.930
We are using XSAN, for instance.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.620
Last but not least,
we leverage Spotlight Server technology

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.200
to index all this data and to
benefit from the fast search engine.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:02.770
And finally, Podcast Producer serves all
these pieces through Atom feeds,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.200
which are built on top
of Spotlight queries.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.200
Let me show you how all this
works together at a higher level.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.200
So we have this podcast
library in the middle.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.180
Let's create two Smart Feeds.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.190
A Smart Feed is pretty much the
same as a Finder Smart Folder.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.150
You define a set of rules.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.400
The files matching these rules are
going to show up in the smart folder.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.140
So for instance here,
we are using Smartfeeds.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.140
These are tightly coupled.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.640
On the left, we have the workflow.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.600
The workflow is going to help us
to publish content to the library.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.960
Feed 1 is going to look at
all the physics courses,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.500
while the second one is going
to look at all the courses that

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.780
Professor Einstein actually
is going to create.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.500
So if I generate a physics course,
a 101 physics course,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.440
this result is going to
end up in the first feed.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.540
If Kjell produces a 102 physics course,
exact same behavior,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.600
this one is going to end up
in physics course Feed 1.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.200
But if my old friend
Albert Einstein produces Feed 523,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.460
an advanced course, well this one,
based on the rules,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.390
is going to end up in both feeds.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.450
I think you got the idea,
and I'd like to show you

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.390
all now how this works live.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.720
So can we move to the demo machine,
please?

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.760
So first,
I'd like to show you some of the content

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.940
I've already published to the library.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.990
And for that, I'm going to use the
Spotlight Come Online tool,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.490
MDFind.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.620
I've already prepared two
queries for this demonstration,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.070
so let's pick the first one.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.430
So this simple query is going to look
at all the podcast library documents.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.670
That I have generated so far
and which are video files.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.560
So if I just press Enter,
you see that it has a

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.090
lot of different results.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.060
Let me show you another one quickly.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:22.490
This one actually looks for all the audio
files I have created for this year only.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.870
So you maybe noticed that
the results are PPI files.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.270
So what are these files?

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.140
A PPI is a podcast library
document which has been generated

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.670
during the publishing stage,
and this is the file that

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.390
is indexed by Spotlight.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.770
So if I pick, for example,
this one result,

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:51.200
And if I use the Spotlight command line
to MDLS to look at its indexed content,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.120
You see that it has a reference
to the media file itself.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.340
This is an MPEG-4 file.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.500
It has also some
information about the title,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.660
the description, the author, and so on.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.730
It provides also some information
about the media itself.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.740
For example,
we know that this one is a Nojo

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.100
QuickTime file for the iPod.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.700
Um, I think this is cool.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.390
But it would be even better if
we could have access to that

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.920
information not only locally,
but through the network and

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.700
actually through the web.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.900
And this is where Podcast Producer and
the library comes into play.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.380
Podcast Producer in the
library now serves Atom feeds

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.700
out of Spotlight queries.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.360
So as a quick example here,
we configured a system to have an Atom

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.440
feed served out of a really simple query,
which is look at all the content

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.600
that I have created so far.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.970
So let's do quickly a curl of that query.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.460
So first, this is an atom feed.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.500
So this is a standard atom feed
with really few extensions.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.390
And the most important part of this new--

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.820
Specification is for
a particular episode,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.970
which is tagged with an entry,
we can have multiple links,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.840
multiple attachments.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.870
So, for example,
this episode has its content

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.470
encoded for Apple TV,
iPod Audio, and iPod Video.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.960
So I've been told that not
everyone in this room reads

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.280
XML and Atom through a terminal.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:43.520
So let's actually grab this feed and
use Safari to show you the result.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.500
Okay?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.540
So you see that Safari just
represents all the different

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.170
episodes and all the attachments,
right,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.640
Very simply.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.860
That's great.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.940
But it's even better when
it comes to iTunes U.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.500
So I have a question for you.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.300
How many of you have already
set up an iTunes U site?

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.140
Excellent.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.730
Well,
iTunes U team and Podcast Producer team

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.810
have worked together in order
to improve their integration.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.270
And we came up with this prototype
I'm going to show you in a minute,

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.670
which allows you to create a
course page simply by referring

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.300
to a podcast library feed.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.260
And this simplifies everything.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.520
Let me show that to you.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.110
So if I log into my iTunes
U site as an administrator,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.410
you see that I already have
different courses created.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.140
So I have my
Albert Einstein faculty member,

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.220
I have Kjell Bronder,
and some other courses here.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.790
So what I'm going to do
is edit the main page.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.900
Cool.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.730
So let's log in again.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:15.700
So now I'm going to edit the main
page and create a new course page.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.420
And instead of going
through all the steps,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.740
entering a title, description,
push some content,

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.700
and do everything manually,
I'm simply going to refer to

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.220
the previous URL I used here.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.710
So you remember my URL.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.040
I'm going just to copy-paste it here.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.560
and Boom said it.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.060
There is the feed.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.020
This is my Atom feed I've previously
demonstrated in Safari and in Terminal.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.200
And the cool thing in
iTunes U now is it supports,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.420
in that prototype,
the multiple attachments of my Atom feed.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.750
So I have the iPod audio as
well and the iPod video of all

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.720
these different attachments.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.890
So you have seen all the
building blocks of the library.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.510
Now I'd like to show you all
these in action through the

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.810
Podcast Capture application.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.200
So let me submit a new
video in Podcast Capture,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.900
a very short one.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.500
So this is going to be the video.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.760
I run Podcast Capture.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.600
I log in.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.240
Let me pick this file.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.900
Documents, demo.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.900
Pick my test library workflow.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.000
Here we are.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.000
Yes.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.490
Okay, so this workflow I chose
is really simple.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.070
It encodes in three
different formats-- Apple TV,

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:01.560
iPod Dojo, iPod Video-- and it publishes
those three results to the library.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.740
And the last stage is going to
notify iTunes U that the library has

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.960
been updated with some new content.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.160
So it should be okay in 10 more seconds.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:20.290
So if I go in Safari again, update,
update.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.000
Then you see that the new video
I've just submitted is now

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.680
available through my Atom feed.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.150
If I go in iTunes,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.960
feed.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.830
You can see that it's
actually available right here.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.440
So, Podcast Producer is an
awesome end-to-end... Okay.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.140
So, keep in mind that all these have
been generated automatically for you.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.660
The only thing that you have to remember
as an external service is how to deal

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.100
with this standardized Atom feed.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.390
Thank you very much.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.690
Eric, if you could go back to slides,
please.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.700
So let's just summarize real quick
what we saw with the Podcast Library.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.520
The Podcast Library is a new
and improved publishing model.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.550
We're basing this on
an industry standard,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.400
which is Atom.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.530
And this is going to get you
a lot of things for free.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.500
And I think one of the most
important is the multiple

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.890
enclosures in a single episode.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.680
There are also other things
that you will get for free.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.600
Something we didn't have
time to talk about today,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.000
which is the catalog browsing,
or the feed catalog browsing,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.530
is really cool, too.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.110
So this is all based on smart feeds,
which you can think of as smart folders

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.160
that are served up through Atom.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.640
And we really think this is
going to simplify the integration

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.960
story across the board.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.580
You just saw what Eric do.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.510
It was an example with iTunes U.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.720
But it's not just iTunes U.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.140
Any Atom-aware service can now integrate
very easily with a podcast library

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.050
and get the notifications that the
content has been updated on the library.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.820
So we really think this is going to
be very powerful and simplify the

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.580
integration story for Podcast Producer.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.930
So now we're going to switch gears
and we're going to talk about

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.770
Davos Weiss' favorite feature,
the Workflow Editor.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.230
This is going to make it
really easy to write workflows.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.820
So let's start off.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.000
Why do we need the Workflow Editor?

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.340
Well, for those of you who are familiar
with the current product,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.100
workflows are bundles that
are on the file system,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.670
and the heart of this
bundle is an XML file.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.840
This XML file describes the
different tasks that need to be

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.200
accomplished when the workflow is run.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.630
It also has a task dependency.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.420
For a complex workflow,
this can get a bit long.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.980
And that's not it.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.020
You don't just have the XML.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.090
You also have lots of
resources you have to handle.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.860
And you can see that this can get,
for a complex workflow,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.110
this can get quite
challenging pretty quickly.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:25.600
[Transcript missing]

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.460
And we're like, "Hmm.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.530
This is great.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.520
It's better than XML,
but it's still complicated." And you see,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.340
this isn't even a really
complicated workflow yet.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.830
And, you know, this diagram,
it's pretty complicated.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.800
And, you know,
still have to deal with all these

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.890
different resources all over the place.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.090
So this was definitely not
the solution we wanted.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.400
So Eric's now gonna come up and explain
the solution that we came up with.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:00.330
We were all so excited when we
started to work on that application.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.480
Well, the idea was to create something
very easy to use and to focus

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.390
on the most common usage.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.940
So we started with this very simplified
view that Kjell presented to you earlier,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.890
and we broke it down a bit.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.850
We came up with the idea of a typical
podcasting workflow representation

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:28.210
with five identified stages-- import,
edit, export, publish, and notify.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.090
The goal is to concentrate on the
business reason of the podcasting

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.790
workflow you are going to create.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.000
Even if this looks sequential,
the solution is flexible at all

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.840
the levels and still generates
optimized workflows for the grid.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.800
It takes care of everything.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.740
The dependencies, the parallelization,
the resources, the accounts,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.600
and so on and so forth.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.870
But I think the best way to
demonstrate that to you is actually

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.800
to show you the application itself.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.710
Can we move to the demo machine, please?

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.830
Okay.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.060
I'm sure that most of you have actually
seen the previous demonstration

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.800
during the other sessions.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.660
So what I'm going to do now is to dig
into the details of the application

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.340
and show you some of the possibilities.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.730
So let me put that on the desktop.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.660
and run the application.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.580
So the...

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.300
This window,
this podcasting workflow document

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.180
shows you a sequential list of stages.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:47.730
These represent the typical
podcasting workflow.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.260
Let me start with the first one.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.260
The first stage is straightforward.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.830
This is basically where you
are going to set the name,

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.150
the copyright, the description,
the information actually

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.300
you need in Podcast Capture,
for example,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.660
to be able to choose the workflow.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:09.340
So let me set the workflow name.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.410
Put the description.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.640
The next stage is really
the first active stage.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.980
This is where you select what
are going to be the input sources

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.400
for this typical workflow.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.920
You could create a workflow that only
supports a single movie file as an input.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.510
Or you can maybe design a workflow
for picture-in-picture which requires

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.620
two movies as an input source.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:40.620
You can even go into the details
of both these options to only

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:46.380
support a single screen recording,
screen capture.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.880
Or maybe you'd like to support only
video recording through your cameras.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.340
For Picture-in-Picture,
you're going to receive two files,

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.740
two movie files.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.540
So you maybe would like to be able
to compose these files properly

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.120
with maybe different compositions,
multiple styles,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.300
and so on as possibilities.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.500
So the same.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.960
You just go into the configuration panel.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.140
You pick between a set of
different composition modes,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.600
like the theater mode or basic overlay,
maybe some positioning, some style,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.960
and so on and so forth.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.820
And this is going to take care for
you of all the generation of the

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.970
tasks and dependency to reproduce
that when you're going to submit those

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.890
two video files to this workflow.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.240
So let me pick this one.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.790
Once you're done,
you move to the next stage.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.900
This stage is all about
branding your content.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.100
So I used to say that
this stage is simple,

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:56.100
is really simple to use and
can be also really advanced.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.420
For example,
it's simple as just dragging and dropping

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:05.610
some content to the introduction item
or simply by setting the Routermark

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.490
image on top of the content movie.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.940
But if you want to change
a transition between,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.930
for example, the bumper title,
which is this one, the second one,

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.950
and the intro movie,
you just have to click here

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.530
and also select a composition
between the set we provide.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.600
So let's move, for example, to a cube,
change the direction.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.570
You can play with the duration as well.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.440
Changing the Bumper
title is also that easy.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.980
You just double-click on it,
edit the configuration panel,

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.000
pick a composition.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
For example, here it delivers three
different compositions.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.000
The first one is the one that you all
used in Podcast Producer version 1.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.000
But you can maybe--you would
maybe like to select another one.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
So let's pick the Spiral staircase.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:56.000
You could also decide not to have
some metadata part of this titling.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
So maybe you don't care about
organization and the copyright.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.190
Maybe you want it to be a bit shorter.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.920
And finally,
I'd like to be able to configure the

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.650
watermark image and maybe put some
overlay on top of your content video.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.520
So you do it right there.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.160
So you have a watermark here.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.870
Let's put some more opacity,
resize it a bit.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.980
Maybe we'd like to have a
description crawler at the

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.140
beginning of your content video.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:31.460
Or maybe get rid of the bumper title
and use a lower third as a titling.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.720
Okay?

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.620
Well, sorry for the video.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.470
Well, once you have played with all these
different configuration options,

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.910
the next stage,
the next step is really to

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.890
look at what's going to,
how this is going to

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.040
look like all together.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.080
So we introduced two ways
of actually helping you to

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.130
look at the resulted content.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.020
So the first one is actually
a simulator that stitches all

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.760
together these different elements.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.260
So you have seen the intro movie,
the transition.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.450
So maybe if we go back again
and look at the transition,

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:17.040
you can even put the copyright back,
put the organization back.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.480
Okay, so the U is not good here.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.270
I'd like to put it on the top right.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.430
And maybe, no, I don't want to have any
overlay title on top of it.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.130
Oh, yes, I don't really like to have
this outro movie at the end,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.380
so I just remove it.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.660
Well, there is also another way to
actually look at what you've just

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.150
set on these particular items.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.660
So we've introduced the scheming.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:50.040
This is more or less the same of
what you have in iMovie and iPhoto.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.160
You just put your mouse over these items,
go left to the right,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.290
and then you have a sneak preview
of actually what's going to happen

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.380
based on the timeline you have
defined in this configuration panel.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.310
And finally, you've seen that there are
many different options.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.370
So maybe the first
time you use this tool,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.280
you would like maybe to be
guided with some correct look

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.620
and feel and correct settings.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.890
So we have these themes
right there to help you.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.100
And this is just as easy
as selecting this one.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.560
Okay?

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.050
This is going to reconfigure everything,
pick some resources that

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.150
we provide by default.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:34.500
So you can just have a look at these,
play the preview, and go through it.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.530
Once you are done,
you move to the next stage.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.840
That's very simple.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:46.040
The next stage is all about defining
what are going to be the output sources,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.760
the output formats.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.460
By default,
you can see that we encode the

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.100
output result of the preview
stage to QuickTime iPod video

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.930
and to a QuickTime iPod audio.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.840
Maybe you'd like to add another one.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.260
So if I just press plus,
select this plugin,

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.290
I could then code to a
higher quality like Apple TV,

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.000
maybe the best one, desktop.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.780
Pick iPhone cellular, iPhone Wi-Fi,
for sure, iPod 3G, iPod audio,

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.060
and so on and so forth.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.800
Let's pick this one.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.260
Maybe you'd like to use
your own encoding settings.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:24.660
So for that,
we introduced a compressor plug-in here.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.600
So you can use this compressor
plug-in to pick a file that you have

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.500
created with compressor interface
with your own in-depth settings,

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.970
and you can even use compressor
either locally with Xgrid or

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.300
remotely with compressor engine.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.710
So once this is all set,
you move to the publish stage.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.140
Today we are introducing
the podcast library.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.770
So we think this is the best way
for you to actually publish all

00:27:55.770 --> 00:28:00.270
your content and deliver them
to all the external services.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:05.240
So we have this library plugin
instantiated here where you can decide

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.900
to publish all the original sources,
also publish the previews that we

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:16.380
have done for you in the background,
and also all the major files that you

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.800
have generated in the stage before.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.840
If you really like to publish to another
external services with the current,

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.690
I mean, the old way of pushing
the content directly,

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.750
you can still do it.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.700
So, for example,
if you'd like to push the

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.930
content to iTunes U directly,
you just pick the one

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.220
you'd like to submit,
put the credentials information,

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.440
and you're done.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.790
Same for the wiki server.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.200
You select one of them,
you put some information

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.180
about the credentials,
and you select where this is

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.510
going to actually be published.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:57.120
We've also introduced another plugin,
which is the Workflow plugin.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:06.440
Maybe you would like to build a small
workflow with specific in-house actions,

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.120
but you still want to use
this great workflow editor UI.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.640
So at this stage,
you can decide to publish to one

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.200
of your small workflows one of the
previous content you have created.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.560
So, for example,
you pick the high quality,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.120
you give the name of the workflow
you have installed on the system,

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.860
you put some information about where
you're going to render all these,

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.940
and you're done.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:34.900
The workflow generated by this tool is
going then to branch to another workflow,

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.130
which is yours,
and then can be written with

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.350
your favorite XML editor.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.580
Thank you.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:50.020
The final active stage
is the notify stage.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.360
This is where you
decide to send an email,

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.970
send an iChat to the administrator
or maybe to yourself who is

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:01.200
going to use this workflow that
the workflow just went well.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.460
So there is an email.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.500
You can also maybe just
send an iChat to Jabir.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.750
On the other side,
this stage gives you also the

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:15.300
ability to notify external services.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:20.630
As I previously demonstrated to you,
we can notify iTunes U that

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:25.340
my library has been updated
with some new fresh content.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.450
So that means that if the system,
if the external service wants

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.750
to synchronize at that time,
it can do it quite easily.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.400
And my last stage is all about
the complexity of the workflow

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.900
that's going to be generated.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.650
Thank you very much.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.740
Let's back to the slides, please.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.540
Thank you.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.030
The Workflow Editor simplifies a
lot the workflow creation process

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.330
and still remains flexible.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.400
The two best examples of this flexibility
are part of the editing stage.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.700
These are the compositions
and the themes.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.530
And for that,
I'll let Kjell to demonstrate to you how

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:23.450
easy it is to create your own composition
and add it to the workflow editor.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.120
So I'm going to go back to slides,
please.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.780
So a lot of what you saw and the really
power that you saw in the workflow

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.770
editor is done thanks to Quartz Composer.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.490
So for those who are not
familiar with Quartz Composer,

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.360
Quartz Composer is a tool that
ships with the developer tools.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:42.960
So you can find it in
/developers/applications.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.950
And it's a really powerful tool
for doing video compositing.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.360
And you saw this title,
you saw this titling here

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.560
that I'm skimming over.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.060
This is all done using Chords Composer.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.590
And I want to show you how easy
it is to write your own Chords

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:59.660
Composer composition and integrate
it into the Workflow Editor.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.200
So before I even do that,
what I have to explain here is that

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.930
in order for the Workflow Editor to
be able to accept information

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.390
and give it to your composition,
we have to come up with

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.780
a certain protocol.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.860
So if I open up here the bumper title,
you'll see that there's some different

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.510
information that you can play with.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.250
And this is actually the same
information that your composition

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.340
has to know how to handle.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.740
So you can see that you have the title,
you have the author, the date, copyright,

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.520
organization, and description.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.580
The description is disabled because this
composition doesn't accept description.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.960
You also have some duration
information and offset information.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.460
So I have a Quartz Composer composition
that I'm going to open up here.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.600
And this is just the base of what
we're going to start with today.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:50.870
And you can see that I've got my title,
date, copyright, description, author,

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.230
and organization.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.180
And I also have the duration and offset.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.680
And you can see for the title,
you have it two times, right?

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.930
You actually have the title string,
and then you have the toggle

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.750
if I want to turn it on or off.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.020
I've also heard a lot of people who
are getting new to Quartz Composer,

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.500
they can be a bit overwhelming.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.740
So I really want to show you how easy
it can be and just demystify the whole

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.430
thing and show you how easy it is to
create a title for the workflow editor.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.140
So now I think you've
understood the protocol.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.500
I'm just going to dismiss
the workflow editor here.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.660
So what I want to do here is I'm
just going to take the title and

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.350
I want to just show the title.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.300
We're not going to worry
about the other metadata.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.830
So I can start off by just getting
rid of all of these other patches.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.710
So the one thing to know about
the Quartz Composer is it works,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.370
everything works in patches.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.450
You have an input on the left of the
patch and an output on the right.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.340
Inside the patch will do
something to the content.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.380
There are different types of patches,
and we're going to start

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.390
with a renderer patch.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.730
So a renderer patch draws
something to the screen.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.120
Because remember,
we're trying to show something here,

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.520
so we want to draw
something to the screen.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.220
So I have my little visualizer here,
which shows me what's

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.410
being drawn to the screen,
and currently there's nothing,

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.460
we're drawing nothing.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.700
So I want to start off
by creating a background.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.060
I'm going to create a
gradient background.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:17.870
So if I go to the patch creator here,
and I just type in gradient.

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.850
You see here that I have a renderer
patch that creates a gradient.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.040
So I'm just going to
drag and drop this here,

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:27.860
and you can now see that my
viewer is showing the gradient.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:32.090
And if we go back here and we
look at the patch parameters,

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:36.030
I can play with different things,
like the color.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:41.540
And I'm not a UI person,
so the colors might not be perfect,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:41.820
but...

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.130
Can do something a bit fun here.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:48.080
So you see how easy it is to create--
I think we said today was purple,

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:48.420
right?

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.220
So purple.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.660
So how easy it can be
to create fun gradients.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.020
Okay, I'm really not good at this,
but you get the idea.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.370
So now we've got our gradient
on the background here.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:07.200
And just move this around a bit
so it actually looks a bit nicer.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.240
There we go.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.700
So now what we want to do
is we want to draw a string,

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.240
the string which is
going to be our title,

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.130
to the screen.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.800
So to do that, we need two patches.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.500
First, we have to take a string
and convert it to an image,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.700
and then we have to draw
that image to the screen.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.860
So we're going to start
off with the first patch,

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.580
and we're going to take a string,
so I'm going to type in "string,"

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.150
and we want an image out.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.800
So there's a generator patch here,
which I'm just going to drag again.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.900
Let me just clean this thing up a bit,
so...

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.060
So here you see my
image with string patch.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.400
On the left is the input,
on the right is the output.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.280
So it takes a string in,
and you can see here in the input

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.900
parameters what's taking in.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.300
So here I can set the string,
set the font, I can set the size,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.350
I can play with all these
different little things.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.770
And it outputs an image with a string.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.390
So if you've ever played
with Chords Composer,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.220
when you're going to start,
your favorite patch that we're

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.440
going to need now is to actually
draw this image to screen.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:11.700
So in that patch is the billboard,
which is a simplified sprite.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.560
So I'm just going to
drop the billboard here,

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.220
and now I'm going to take the image
output for my image with string

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.380
composition and just drop it here.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:24.270
You see now I have my hello world
which is being drawn to screen.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.950
But, you know, this black is not really
looking that great,

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.500
and we really want to
do some compositing,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.640
so there's a blending mode
here in Chords Composer.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.350
So if I choose Over,
you now see that I'm not

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.680
replacing the background.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:55.600
[Transcript missing]

00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.810
and so on.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:01.590
So that's great.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.340
So now I can draw my title to screen.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:07.430
But what would be cool is if I could have
some kind of little animation going here.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.090
So that's where we're going
to play with the x-axis.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.740
What I want to do,
really something really easy,

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.710
we're just going to put the text
all the way on the left here and

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.140
then walk it through and just have
it slide through across the screen.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.210
So you can see when we're off screen,
we're at plus 2 on the x-axis,

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.750
and when we're off the screen here,
we're at minus 2.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.730
So let's just put this back in zero.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.460
So now what I'm going to do is
there's an interpolation patch,

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.740
which I can give a start value,
an end value, and a duration,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.940
and it will go from the
starting value to the end value

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.020
over--following a certain curve.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.640
So I'm going to bring up
that interpolation patch.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.040
We're just going to drop it here.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.280
So I said my starting value
was going to be minus 2.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.920
My end value was 2.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.470
And we'll have this take 10 seconds.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.600
I'm now going to take the result
and I'm just going to put it

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.800
in on the X position here.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.600
And you can now see,
if I start this over,

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.120
that I have my title,
which is going across the screen.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.960
So now let's tie this back into
the workflow editor and actually

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:16.110
use those protocol inputs
that we were talking about.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.870
So I'm going to just resume here.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.320
and we said we had a duration,
so I'm just going to connect

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.900
this duration to the duration
of the interpolation here.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.730
Zoom out a bit.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:34.740
We have our title here.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.600
So we can just -- this
is the title string,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.150
so we can just put that as
the input for the string.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.910
And the enable title -- well,
we're going to connect this to

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:41.840
the enable of the billboard.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.960
This will turn on or off
if we're actually drawing

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.080
that image to the screen.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.130
So now nothing's on screen
because I now have the public

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.740
inputs for my composition.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.360
So I have to turn on my title.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.800
And I can type in a title.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.120
So this is my title.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.100
We'll set a duration to 10 seconds.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.260
And we're not going to worry
about the offset right now.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.240
And there you have it.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.520
There's my title coming
across the screen.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.490
And if I wanted to go quicker,
I can just set the

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.720
duration to five seconds.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.670
And now the workflow editor can
leverage all this and do it.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.950
So let me show you how easy that is.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.000
So let me just stop this.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.080
Now I'm just going to
save this composition.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.680
So do a save as.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:30.040
And if I go to my library, Podcast

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.380
Resources Compositions.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.540
So this is a titling composition
that's doing a bumper title.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:44.900
And I'm just going to say this as,
you know, my first bumper title.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.260
Now I've saved it.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.660
So now let's hide Ports Composer.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.300
And if we relaunch the Workflow Editor,

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.650
And if we go back down here,
I can click here.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.610
And you see,
I now have my first bumper title,

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.500
which has appeared.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.640
And now you have the wonderful colors.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.600
And I can turn on and off my title.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.500
I can set the duration.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.990
So I can make this, you know,
be five seconds and be really

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.200
quick across the screen.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.190
I have the skimming here.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:12.820
And I get the preview.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.480
So that's how easy it is to write
your own composition and integrate

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.440
it with the Workflow Editor.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:42.520
Well, we put a lot of efforts on making
these two really fast and easy to use.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:47.510
And the idea was really
to hide all the complexity

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.840
So, and still generate optimized
workflow for the grid.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.040
In a nutshell,
I think we have an incredible way

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.140
of creating podcasting workflows.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:05.040
And I hope you are as excited
as we are about all this.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:10.350
But we still have some stuff we'd
like to talk to you about today.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:17.060
Last year at WWDC,
we demonstrated what we call a crazy

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.940
workflow during one of our sessions.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:24.710
The goal was to stimulate
your interest and show you how

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:26.620
powerful this technology is.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.280
So this year,
we want to continue this tradition and

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.260
get you to think about what you could
do with workflows and Apple technology.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.240
So let me move to the demo
machine and prepare some stuff.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:41.050
And for now, I'll let Kjell to tell you
about what's going to happen.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.620
So this year,
we're trying to come up with

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:49.500
something fun to do during
our session here at WWDC.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.830
And we're trying to come up with our
crazy workflow that we like to do.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.260
And I really want to insist here,
we're just trying to show you

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.500
that the possibilities are really
just limited by your imagination.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.220
The Podcast Producer allows
you to do anything that you

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.500
can write on the command line.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.440
So the possibilities
are really just endless.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.970
And so we're thinking about kind of
a fun idea we could come up with.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:50.000
[Transcript missing]

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.960
So that's what we're going to demo.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.640
So if we can move to the demo machines,
please.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.100
Eric, I think you've got some content
to show what we're going to be

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.300
inputting into our workflow.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.640
Yes.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.500
So on the left, I have a screen capture
recording that we did yesterday.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.100
So that's basic, just screen capture.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.900
And with Kjell's voice.

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.220
And on the right,
we have a transcript of that

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:15.190
speech that we wrote in XML.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.940
So I think we've already
run this through a workflow,

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.400
and I think the video will explain
pretty much what's happened.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.940
So, Eric, can you play it back for us?

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.530
Yes.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.640
The goal of this demo is to
show the power and flexibility

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:33.040
of custom workflows.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:39.680
The original idea we had was to
generate a closed captioned movie.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.690
To do this,
we wrote a custom command line tool.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:51.570
It takes a movie and a text file and
outputs a closed captioned movie.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.760
You are currently watching
the output of this workflow.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:01.740
When we were done with this,
we wanted to do something a bit more fun.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.000
So we used Quartz Composer.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.410
Eric, why don't you show them how
we can make this a bit sexier?

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.580
Sure, Kjell.

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.030
So let me do that.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.020
and here's the other results.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.640
So here you see a course
composer composition that we

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.700
threw together pretty quickly.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.500
And we're just, you know,
playing around with different ideas.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.800
And we just wanted to put something
together pretty quickly to just show you

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.450
what we could do with Chords Composer.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.220
And just, I mean,
closed captioning is great

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.460
for the purpose it serves,
but if you want to do something a bit

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.140
more fun with the text that you have,
well, you know,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.270
you've got Chords Composer
and you can do some fun stuff.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.390
So that's great.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.760
You know,
we finished at 3:00 AM in some morning.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.340
And if you were at
Dave O's session yesterday,

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.600
you learned that we're
not allowed to sleep.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.060
So we're thinking, it's great.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.600
We've got all this data.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.650
We've got this movie.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.860
Couldn't we do something a
bit more interesting with it?

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.840
And they're like, well, yeah,
we could search it.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.400
So wouldn't it be cool if we could
have some way of jumping to a part of

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.130
a movie just by typing in the text?

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.860
So we wrote a Quartz Composer
composition to do this,

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.600
too.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.700
So Eric, can you show us?

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.370
So I think I said your
name at some point.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.570
Can you try typing in your name?

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.740
Okay, that's not it.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.200
We're sitting there and we're saying,
"So this is pretty cool." But you've

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.490
probably noticed that there's one
step here that hasn't been automated.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.950
Any ideas here?

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.520
Have any of you guys
ever heard of Max Speech?

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:17.180
So we've been working with MacSpeech,
and we're going to start off the demo.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.330
And I'll explain while it's processing,
we're going to explain

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.810
what's happening here.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:28.100
So, I'm just going to put on my
headphone and find a microphone.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.170
You ready, Eric?

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:36.790
So we're just going to do a quick
screen capture of a little lecture

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.960
that we've prepared for you.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.600
Just make sure
everything's working right.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:42.620
And when you're ready.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.350
Oh, so first thing first.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.150
Just to make sure that everybody
believes here that we're doing this live,

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.660
anybody have a word they want me to say?

00:46:51.800 --> 00:47:04.000

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:05.780
Chocolate cake.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.860
There you go.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.800
And it didn't come from this side,
so it's not the Apple people.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.480
Whenever you're ready.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.380
Let's go for it.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:25.530
Chocolate Cake Welcome to this year's
class of the Essence of the Monument.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:30.890
Today, we will be talking about the
most iconic structure in Paris.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:35.350
The Eiffel Tower is the tallest
building in Paris and one of the most

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.430
recognized structures in the world.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.780
It was built as part of the World Fair,
marking the centennial celebration

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.250
of the French Revolution.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:51.860
The tower was supposed to be dismantled,
but was used for scientific

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:57.520
experiments and as an antenna before
becoming the icon that it is today.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.520
Thank you.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:47:59.200
See you next time.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.430
So while Eric's submitting this
to the Podcast Producer system,

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:08.990
I'm going to take a little minute
and explain what's going on here.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.350
So what's happening here?

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.580
So as I said,
the one step that wasn't automated

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.570
was actually taking the content and
getting the closed captions out of it.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.360
And we were thinking about it,
and we were like,

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.260
"This very successful product
on the Mac OS N platform,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.650
which is MacSpeech Dictate.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.080
It's the software that lets you
talk to your computer and will

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.770
basically just write out whatever
you're saying." And we were like,

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.200
"Well, that's exactly what we need."
So we've been working with MacSpeech,

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.020
and I really want to
thank them for their help.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:44.260
And they have a very-- They provided
us with a very early prototype.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:48.230
It's a command line tool that will
take the QuickTime movie as an input

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:51.850
and output the closed caption file.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.460
From there,
we can pretty much do everything

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.900
that we already showed you.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.600
So that's exactly what we're
going to do with this workflow.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.830
This workflow is going to put everything
through the Max Speech command line tool,

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.800
output the closed caption file.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.860
We can then generate the closed
caption file using the QT text track.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.360
We can do the Quartz
Composer composition,

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.500
movie that you saw,
and we can also render that

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.740
Quartz Composer composition that
lets you search the content.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.690
So once this is processed,
I'm now going to be able to

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:20.920
search through all my content.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.900
So now it's going to process on the grid.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.620
This takes a little bit of some time.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.020
So, uh... Eric, how's it going?

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.130
Well,
we still have to wait one more minute,

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.370
so... This is about another minute, so,
uh...

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.790
So, this is where everybody's
crossing your fingers.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.250
I hope everybody in the room here
has got their fingers crossed.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.560
No, this really works great.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.010
So actually,
everything that you saw before,

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:57.980
that closed caption movie that we did,
we didn't write it out.

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.000
We cheated.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
We used the Max Speech Dictate tool.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:05.100
And you saw it got it 100% correct.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.170
So, 118, 120, one more minute.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.330
Do you plan to do the squeak-hand, Kjell?

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.140
I don't know.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.140
I think it depends a lot on this demo.

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.430
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:24.370
So,
that's the one thing I haven't mentioned,

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.760
is this workflow is just for--
we're just showing it today.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.630
This is all very early prototype.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.800
And the goal of this demo is
really to show you what you can do.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.530
This is not a shipping workflow.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:37.260
This is something that we
wanted to play around with,

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.840
and we've heard a lot of feedback
that you guys were interested in,

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.540
and we wanted to see how
possible it was to do it.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.870
So this is really proof of concept.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.590
So, there we go.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:54.780
Eric, you've got mail.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:56.100
Thank you.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:51:01.200
So if I look at my mails now... Okay,
so I've just received an email

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.240
with all those three videos
that Kjell told you about.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:12.810
I'm going to download this one on the
desktop to show you this full screen.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.860
Chocolate cake.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:19.540
Welcome to this year's class
of the Essence of the Monument.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:24.890
Today, we will be talking about the
most iconic structure in Paris.

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:29.290
The Eiffel Tower is the tallest
building in Paris and one of the most

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.360
recognized structures in the world.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:37.790
It was built as part of the World Fair,
marking the centennial celebration

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.310
of the French Revolution.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:45.900
The tower was supposed to be dismantled,
but was used for scientific

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:51.520
experiments and as an antenna before
becoming the icon that it is today.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.400
Thank you.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.520
See you next time.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:56.750
One mistake.

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.160
Can we just see the search one again?

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.080
Because I really like that one.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.480
I hope you appreciate the
little effect that we did here.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.460
So I think I said thank you at the end.

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:16.600
There you go.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:17.700
We're all the way to thank you.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.600
Thank you.

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.020
So thank you.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.240
Can we go back to slides, please?

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.800
So that was this year's crazy workflow.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.470
Just to recap what we talked about.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.340
So we wrote a command line tool
for adding closed captions.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.010
If you have a closed caption file,
we can automate this and we can add

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:45.340
this to your movie using QT text tracks.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.650
And you know, to go one step further,
we had some fun with Quartz Composer.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.050
We sexied it up a bit
with Quartz Composer.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:54.390
Then we wrote a Quartz Composer
composition that makes you

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:57.100
search-enabled playback,
so now you can jump around in your movies

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.540
and find exactly what you're looking for.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.460
And this is all automated
thanks to Max Speech.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.270
This is an early prototype,
but I'd really like to

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.650
thank Max Speech for the
work that they did for us.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.500
So that's today's session.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.300
So the two things I really want you
to take home today-- Workflow Editor.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.500
We made a real nice tool to make it
really easy and just a lot of fun

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.890
to write podcast producer workflows.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.960
Two, the Podcast Library.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.350
This is the simplified, flexible,
and standardized publishing model.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.480
We're leveraging Atom.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.750
This is an industry standard,
and we really think this is

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:37.340
gonna simplify your integration
story across the board.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.770
As I said in the beginning,
these are only two of the features that

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.740
we're shipping with Podcast Producer 2.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.030
There are a lot more, and if you were at
Devo's session yesterday,

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.240
you heard all about them.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.960
It's really cool.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.550
So for more information,
send us an email at

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.780
podcastproducer@apple.com.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.050
While you're waiting for Snow Leopard,
check out the

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:57.340
Podcast Producer Workflow Tutorial.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.900
It takes you step-by-step
through how to write workflows.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:05.650
And it's over 120 pages long,
so it should keep you occupied

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:07.700
until Snow Leopard comes out.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.890
Here's some of the related sessions.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:13.960
There's some more deploying
podcast producer this afternoon.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.390
If you guys are interested
in Quartz Composer,

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.440
there's also that.

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.470
And we'll be in the
IT lab this afternoon,

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.700
so feel free to come by.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.360
If you have any questions,
we'd like to know what's going on.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.360
Just come and talk to us.
