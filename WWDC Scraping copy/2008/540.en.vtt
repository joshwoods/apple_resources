WEBVTT

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.370
Good afternoon.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.490
My name is Jacob Brown,
and I'm with Apple Professional Services.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.940
We've deployed Podcast Producer in
different organizations,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.520
and today we're talking about deploying
Podcast Producer in those organizations.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.210
We have...

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.820
We have two guests today,
one from Stanford University School of

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.720
Medicine and one from
Orange County Sheriff's Department.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.530
After that, Jason, one of my coworkers,
is going to come up and we're

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.460
going to talk about some
best practices for deploying

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.880
Podcast Producer on OS X Leopard.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.270
And we're talking about OS X Leopard,
not 10.6, 10.5 server.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.700
So with that, I'd like to introduce
Andy from Stanford University.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.140
My name is Andy Wasklewicz.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.680
I'm from Stanford School of Medicine.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.940
I'm the technology architect.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.930
Jump right in and go a quick
overview of the history of what

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.540
we've been doing at Stanford.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.700
Is this working or not?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.700
No.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.860
Okay, I'll stand here.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.800
So, we started, we have a rich history in
capturing classroom video.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.400
We've been working for 35 plus
years in classroom capture.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.350
You can see we started back in
the 70s when I was just a wee lad.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.240
And we moved through the
80s and we captured on the

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.700
always highest quality VHS.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.850
And just a side note for any of you
guys who are from universities that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.100
have these same type of archives.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.060
Stanford has very little
of this archive left.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.310
We actually recorded over most of it.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.110
And also didn't store
it in a proper location.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.790
So, if you have some archives
when you go home,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.120
I'd suggest ingesting them into podcast.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.180
a producer as quickly as possible.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.200
In '88,
along with many other universities,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.500
we started streaming our classes
via real streaming servers.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.930
This was a solution that the
faculty really liked because they

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.170
thought their content was "safe."
As we moved along into 2006,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.960
2007, the safe part of this kind of
changed when we found that students

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.500
were ripping all the streams and
distributing them in different methods.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.780
So, like any other university,
what do you do?

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.490
You write a policy.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.290
So we wrote some policies,
and I was contacted to come in and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.200
work with the EdTech group on deciding
next steps for classroom capture.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.700
In late 2007-2008,
we started working on some prototypes

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.600
with Podcast Producer as a replacement
for our now-aging real systems.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.490
As you can see,
the downloadable video is how we

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
actually do most of our video now.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.570
All of our courses are,
every single course that we teach

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.290
is actually captured and digitized.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.740
Grand Rounds, which is something specific
to the medical school.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.770
We also do any special events
that happen in the school,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.710
any guest lecturers, whatever happens,
we record it.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.600
We do about 6,000 to 7,000 events
a year in our educational spaces,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.300
and we capture about 2,500
classroom capture sessions.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.300
So why were we moving
to Podcast Producer?

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.840
Number one reason is the
School of Medicine is

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.520
actually restructuring itself.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.200
And one of my major responsibilities
is the Li Ka Shing Center for

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.610
Learning and Knowledge.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.840
This building is a four-story
educational building.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.090
It's a new educational gateway space.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.260
Every single space is capture capable,
meaning that of the 130 cameras

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.410
that will be in the space,
they'll all be routed back,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.140
and we expect to encode
these with Podcast Producer.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.800
It's a major factor for us moving towards
an open system like Podcast Producer.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.920
Another big impetus for us moving
towards this system is the students.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.400
We have a very active student body,
as you can tell.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.260
They are very technically savvy.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.950
They also have a level
of expectation of us.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.770
Because of the quality of work
that we've been doing for so long,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.320
and the timeliness of our
encoding sessions being posted,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.410
students have these expectations
that they hold us to.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.340
So one of these
expectations is timeliness,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.500
and what I mean by that is four
hours after the class is captured,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.520
we try to have that online.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.490
So it's a pretty quick turnaround for us,
and when we are

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.380
investigating new products,
this is one of the things

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.460
that we are really trying to
stress as a key component.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.050
As you can see,
also the students are requesting

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.310
more of video anywhere,
anytime, meaning they want to study

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.880
the video where they want,
when they want.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.110
If they're on the train,
they're going to want to study

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.400
the video where they want,
when they want.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.420
If they're on the train,
they want to study.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.620
If they're in the library,
they want to study on their laptop,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.590
they want to have access to it.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.000
So with that,
we moved on to actually asking

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.680
the deans if we could move
forward with this project.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.050
And my favorite quote
came in the meeting,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.520
where he says,
why limit the capture system

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.780
to just classroom when we
could open it up to everyone?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.930
And so after I picked
my jaw off the floor,

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.240
I realized that this kind of validated
our choice of Podcast Producer,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.260
because I knew that we could actually
handle taking in all the content that

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.340
was created throughout the campus.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.990
Actually, three days after he said this,
the hospital came to us

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.630
and asked us to ingest and
distribute 150 tapes to YouTube.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.680
Exciting.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:08:13.000
[Transcript missing]

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.280
So, quickly go over our prototype system.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.280
Pretty much like everyone else in here,
we have a classroom capture system.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.380
We actually mix right in
the back of the classroom.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.960
We have cameras and Mac minis that
are actually capture stations.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.690
I threw up the Mac Pros because
our post facility,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.480
like I said,
actually used Podcast Producer.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.310
Once they've cut their pieces,
they actually pass it

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.370
on to Podcast Producer,
and it distributes where they'd

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.400
like to with special workflows.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.170
Once the file's actually passed on,
it goes to shared storage.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.490
Podcast Producer actually
runs the workflow.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.500
We're in an investigative state.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.470
One of the unique things about our
system is we're actually investigating

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.960
episode engine for the encoding portion.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.280
Once the episode's engine's done,
Podcast Producer picks that

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.680
file up and passes it on to
wherever we're going to publish,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.560
whether that's iTunes, YouTube,
wherever it happens to be.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.420
And our students pick that up
on any device that they have.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.300
I'm going to quickly go
into what we capture.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.210
This is pretty typical of
the content that we would be

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.420
putting through the system.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:32.240
This is some stuff we captured in the
hospital of an MD training a student.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.410
You can close your eyes
if you just ate lunch,

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.130
which I'm sure many of you have.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.530
This is a surgical procedure
that would be passed through

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.020
Podcast Producer as well.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.040
The bulk of our content is
a lot of this kind of stuff.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.140
It's classroom capture.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.510
And finally, we do a,
the medical school does a lot of

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.600
research in educational spaces,
so we capture a lot of that and

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.200
distribute that as podcasts.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.040
So currently,
Capture about 35 podcasts a week.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.000
This varies from classroom
materials to those special events.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.810
We're expecting to double and
possibly triple that output in 2009.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.080
Our current workflows,
we're mostly using iTunes U.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.150
We have three instances of iTunes U.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.800
We have public, private, and community,
and most of our content actually

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.070
sits in the private location.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.940
We do very little in the public space.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.520
We're also working with our main campus
on our new YouTube implementation,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.420
which should be rolling out pretty soon.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.880
We have some custom stuff we're doing
with our School of Medicine web portal.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.940
We're also, as I mentioned earlier,
working with our learning

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.590
management team to...

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.030
Work on integration with WebCT tools.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.290
Forward-looking,
we're really looking towards Sakai as

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.720
our destination for most of this content.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.900
And of course,
some private internal portals.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.050
Some of the unique things about our
deployment are we're actually working on,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.510
in the Li Ka Shing Center,
the new educational facility,

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.700
all of the 130 cameras and signal
route back to one location.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:25.540
We're actually trying to figure out some
way to stick Podcast Producer behind this

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.810
and actually automate the entire process.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.900
At the School of Medicine,
we do a lot of simulation-based training,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.900
and these are Mach surgery
spaces that students come into,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.940
work on certain scenarios,
and then the faculty will sit with

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.680
them and use this as a learning moment.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.740
They capture a lot of video and are
interested in passing this through our

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.040
Podcast Producer system and actually
storing it in an archived format.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.420
We're also, this is very new to Stanford,
I don't know about other universities,

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.490
but we don't do a lot
of sharing on campus.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.050
So one of the things that we've
noticed is because a lot of our

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.740
work is done during the day and our
classes finish at three o'clock,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.010
is the grid will sit
silent in the evening.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.970
So what we're starting to do is try
to integrate with other groups on

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.820
campus who have some content that
they'd like to encode in the evening.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.980
So it's kind of a new for us.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.140
Quickly,
just step through our final steps.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.540
We're working over the summer
with Telstream to finish

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.680
our integration project.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.000
We're also working on some
Final Cut Server workflows

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.880
for intermediate archives,
as well as allowing our

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.500
post-production team access to the
raw content that we're capturing.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.480
We're very interested in iCal Server.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.120
We want to automate as
much process as we can.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.910
So we're really looking at iCal
Server as a possible solution in

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.040
integrating that with Podcast Producer.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.740
As I mentioned earlier,
our content management systems and

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.740
our control and switching system
within the Li Ka-Shing Center.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:11.780
One thing that Stanford hasn't done
a lot of is a ton of screen capture.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.900
So we're actually looking at using some
screen capture tools and trying to work

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.340
that into the Podcast Producer workflow.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:25.260
And the last two bullets are...
important to us and really speak to the

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.610
extensibility of Podcast Producer is
the Opencast initiative and

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.750
ETH Zurich's replay system.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.610
So the driving force behind selecting
Podcast Producer was it allowed us to

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.080
really meld it into whatever we want.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.290
And Opencast, which is an initiative
out of UC Berkeley,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.210
is adding a layer that's going
to allow us to interact with our

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.500
registrar's office and calendaring data.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.800
And use Podcast Producer as the back end.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.380
And some of the research that's coming
out of ETH Zurich with their indexing and

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:04.420
tagging is we really see as a plug-in to
Podcast Producer and allows us to really

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.960
move towards where we'd like to go.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.060
Thank you.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.530
I'd like to introduce Captain Mike James.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.910
All right, I sound,
my microphone's working,

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.100
I can already tell.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.880
Good afternoon, my name is Mike James,
and I really am a captain from the

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.080
Orange County Sheriff's Department.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.160
That's not a cool nickname I gave myself.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.690
And you might say,
how does a captain from the

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.460
Orange County Sheriff's Department get up
here and start speaking about technology?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.980
I ask that same question myself.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.800
In 1998,
we were so technologically advanced that

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.410
when I went to my first day on patrol,
my captain said, son,

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.680
here's your hardware and
here's your software,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.300
get busy.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.200
So here we are today.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.610
We're going to talk a little bit about
what we've done with Podcast Producer in

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.980
the last several weeks,
trying to enhance the image of the

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.690
Orange County Sheriff's Department and
enhance the image of what we want to do

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.100
in our community and with our deputies.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.980
I'd like to first tell you how
we got involved with Apple.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.550
It was quite a unique thing.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.760
We have about 300 mobile data computers
that our deputies use in the field,

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.360
and we feed real-time information
to them about criminals

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.060
they're possibly dealing with,
houses they go to,

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.400
information about neighborhoods
and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.340
So it's a very critical
thing we give to them.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.320
And part of that thing,
that image has to be updated constantly.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.000
And in order to update that image,
we used to have to pull those

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.670
units in out of the field,
physically touch each one of them,

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.490
go to a power source and a hard drive.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.240
And one of my technical
guys said to me one day,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.210
he goes, hey,
I figured out if we use an Apple iPod,

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.490
I can put the image on and just
USB it right into the computer.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.150
They don't have to leave the field.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.350
So that's a great thing.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.280
So we bought four Apple iPods,
which is very hard to explain to a

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.340
county government why you have iPods.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.330
So now we call those
80-gigabyte secure hard drives.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.940
And the purchase thing
goes through Apple,

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.340
and we get them, and we get ready to go.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.950
So that was the first
thing we did with them.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.750
And we were so excited by that,
we started talking to

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.370
them about other things.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:58.410
One space that Apple does very well in
law enforcement is computer forensics.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.170
And so our computer forensics
guys wanted Apple things,

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.420
and we said, yeah, we would do it.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.750
And we had a simultaneous process
going on where we were doing

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.400
Apple storage and computer forensics,
and we were doing another storage device,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.410
which I'm not allowed to say,
on another project.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.110
Well, my tech set up the Apple storage
in about 30 minutes,

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.350
never touched it before,
had never seen it before.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.330
And it's been working ever
since we haven't touched it.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:24.420
The other storage took the company's tech
three days to get it first installed,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.420
five days until it actually worked.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.470
I said, we've got to start buying
some more Apple stuff because

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.420
it's much easier to use.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.620
So that was our introduction to
Apple in a world that doesn't use Apple,

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.200
and we're going to go forward with that.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.730
Today we're going to tell you a
little bit about our challenges

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.730
with trying to get this done.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.960
We're going to show you how we
transitioned from a media tape library

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.180
into a rich media distribution system.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.330
And again, we're just at the front
edge of doing that,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.580
so it's something we're
learning day by day as we go,

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.590
running in against conflicts and issues,
and also dealing with a big

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.220
group of people who don't
understand this technology.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.900
We have very young deputies
coming up now that do,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.530
and we have very old deputies who
don't get it and don't want to get it,

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.620
don't want to understand it,
and see the benefit in it.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.960
At our academy, which we'll talk about
in our future deployment,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.270
we talked about making this presentation
go so deputies could actually learn the

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.530
material while they're in the academy,
and they responded to us by saying

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.500
they have to get it the first time.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.890
And we agreed, but it's really important
that they do get it.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.570
So that's the kind of challenges we're
dealing with when talking to them.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.700
We're going to look at the current
infrastructure that we're using today,

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.560
and again,
we started with absolutely nothing.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.920
And as of last week,
we actually have a podcast studio set

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.360
up in our office where our sheriff
and other politicians can go on.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.120
We've produced a live tape with
a teleprompter and everything.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.080
So we've made great strides
in a pretty short time,

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.790
again, with the help of our Apple pros
that help us out all the time.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.590
And then we accomplished this
using Apple's X-rayed server

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.750
and combined storage project.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.620
We're going to talk to you on the screen.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.840
You'll see a bunch of varying,
this is our current infrastructure

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.100
that we're talking about right here.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.140
So while that's up there,
I'm going to tell you some of

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.560
the things we want to use it for.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.150
Again, training is very,
very important to us.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.060
Training our deputies.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.410
Like every other kind of training,
it's very expensive.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.770
We have to backfill their
positions so the citizens we

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.320
serve don't have any downtime.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.850
And the time it takes
to train them is very,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.620
very difficult.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.900
So we're hoping that in this process,
we'll be able to train them

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.670
in a lot faster fashion,
get it to them right away, and do that.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.000
We focus in a region of
training that we call high-risk,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.800
low-frequency activity.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.840
That's activity that
you don't do very often,

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.300
but it's got extremely high risk to
both the deputy and the public and the

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.220
person you contact at the same time.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.070
So we focus on that area,
and that's where we

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.150
really hope to do this.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.330
One area that we're doing this already,
we started, is we tried to create,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.960
one of the parts of my division
is property and evidence.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.610
We have about 100,000 items in there,
including large amounts of cash,

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.700
every kind of weapon imaginable,
rocket launchers.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.060
And a high amount of narcotics.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:57.220
So last week alone,
we booked 130 pounds of marijuana.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.150
Part of that is safe handling.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.360
Every day at 3:00,
my employees get the munchies,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.540
and they're all really happy,
but I'm not sure why yet.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.260
So we're in the basement down there.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.200
I'm actually up on the third floor,
and as we walk through the basement,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.980
there's this aroma, let's say.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.390
It kind of overcomes the whole place,
and everybody wants to

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.340
work in the basement.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.350
We're not sure why.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.930
Anyway, so we focus on that.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.680
One of the reasons we picked
the Apple storage here,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.740
the way the flexibility
gave us was great.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.510
We know there's other options out there.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.840
We have other contract providers,
but no one could provide it in the

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.280
system that they gave to us that was
so easy to use and so easy to enhance,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.000
and the flexibility gave us to increase
our production as we decided to.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.460
And then lastly, it was a proven concept.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.460
It was something that they were
clearly able to show us the benefit of,

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.070
and we were clearly able to
just establish it right away and

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.770
start creating content with it.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.470
Some of the reasons we were
really trying to use it,

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.000
in law enforcement, it's usually very,
we have a very negative environment,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.020
an environment that the media
doesn't fairly report on,

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.860
we believe.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.030
They skip over lots of the
positive things and go right

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.190
to the negative things,
or our negative things,

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.220
that's the world we work in,
and that's okay.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.170
But one of the reasons we want to
do it is we found out that we could

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.580
get our message out to the residents
we serve and let them understand,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.040
hey, there really are lots
of good things going on.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.500
You hear about the few bad ones,
but there are lots of good ones.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.400
I worked in one of our contract cities,
and in that environment,

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.350
we did a survey and figured out about
90% of the residents were getting

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.100
their information about us from us.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.630
So it's really an opportunity
for us to enhance our message

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.200
and tell them what we're doing.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.340
Again, we talked about the training,
the high-risk and low-frequency,

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.540
so we'll do that.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.180
Next,
we're going to show you a quick demo.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.940
We converted a lot of this
tape library into podcasting,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.460
and so we have one here
that's our MDC training.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.470
Welcome to the Orange County Sheriff's
Department's computer-based

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.140
mobile data learning program.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.320
I'm Sergeant Mike McHenry,
and I'll be your guide for

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.630
this learning opportunity.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.380
Mobile data programs like this
one have become commonplace

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.760
in law enforcement today.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.240
But unlike most mobile
data computer systems,

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.840
this equipment and software will
offer the field officer resources and

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.240
abilities far beyond most in the nation.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.750
The Orange County Sheriff's
Department's mobile data program

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.720
was resurrected in about 1999,
with a change in some

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.680
important cellular technology.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.920
As a result of these changes,
we embarked on a fact-finding

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.560
process that ended with the
deployment of 29... All right,

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.100
that's enough of Mike.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:36.980
Lastly, what I'll show you up here,
this is our future deployment

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.650
that we're working on right now.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.170
And this system that you'll see up
there is based at our training academy.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.710
We train law enforcement officers
from throughout Southern California,

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.540
from the bottom,
from top of San Diego all

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.680
the way to the top of L.A.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.010
We're one of the last full-stress
academies in the nation,

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.330
and we train about six classes a year,
and that training is

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.010
about six months long.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.550
One of the requirements,
police officer standards

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.980
of training requirements,
requires us to tape every single class,

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.600
audit them, and then be able to tell
who was in those classes.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.560
Today,
they're accomplishing that by videotape,

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.760
and then they're going back
and trying to find rosters.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.850
And with the Freedom of
Information Act and people

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.200
looking back at these things,
we really needed to figure

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.550
out a better way to do that.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.060
So this system allows us to do that.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.190
Not only record every class,
record the instructors,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.210
record the slides,
attach the metadata to it to make sure

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.660
that the employees that attend those
classes are then logged on there.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.860
So we go back, we can do a search.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.790
Again, our Apple professionals
helped us set that thing up.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.960
We're really thrilled to get it going.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.550
We're trying to get the final
pieces of it in place and make

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.600
that purchase and get that going.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:40.760
So with that,
we're going to go ahead and get started.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:40.930
All right.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.160
Thank you.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.400
All right.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:41.700
Thanks, Mike.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:41.710
Thanks, Mike.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:41.740
Thanks, Mike.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.660
With that,
I'll introduce Jason from Apple,

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.510
and thanks very much.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.400
Thank you, Captain Mike.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.200
Do I have audio back here?

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.400
Here we go.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.900
All right,
so I just want to talk a little bit

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.870
about some of the best practices
that Enterprise Pro Services has

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.600
been doing in these deployments.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.380
As you can see,
we have a lot of great customers we've

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.700
been working with on these deployments
in a variety of different uses.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.330
It's amazing to me to see podcasting take
off the way it has and just the different

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:17.630
categories of training and things that
have been being put to use with it.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.710
So I'm just going to go over a little
bit of a component checklist on some

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:25.260
of the different ways that we've been
examining Podcast Producer deployments.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.800
Simply put,
this is kind of a checklist of what

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.000
you get when you're deploying a
successful Podcast Producer solution.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.450
Off the top of the list,
we're going to have the XGrid

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.990
system for the encoding process,
a shared file system for actually

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.000
storing all this content,
and then also the different types

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.670
of workflows and resources you can
manipulate to customize the podcast

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.910
production for your environment.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.950
As far as the Xgrid goes, again,
this is where the bulk of the work gets

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.400
done in Podcast Producer solutions.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.990
I'm sure most of you have attended
some of the other sessions,

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.740
and I'm not going to
linger on this too much,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.180
but some of the things we've been
considering when we're working

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.750
with Xgrid is how to properly size
it for a different environment.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.500
Specifically,
as we were talking with Andy earlier,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.080
we were talking about requirements,
right?

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.920
What is the expectation
that your students,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.540
your sheriffs, your soldiers,
whoever it may be,

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.050
have for the rate that this
content is going to get out there?

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.900
By the same time, by the same token,
we also have to consider different

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.920
types of formats that are going
to be supporting your environment.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.840
If you're encoding more formats,
it's going to take longer to do it.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.580
Now,
some of the ways we've been addressing

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.400
this is by adding more XGrid agents.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.800
If you have more processing
power on the back end,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.140
it's going to take a little
bit less time to process it.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.490
But an important thing to understand
about Podcast Producer is that just

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.300
because you have more agents doesn't
necessarily mean you're going to be

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.390
able to produce one podcast faster.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.260
It just means you can produce
more podcasts simultaneously.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.520
Some things we've been able
to do also to address this is

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.840
make use of different products,
for example, Telestream,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.180
which Andy mentioned earlier,
and also Compressor

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.400
from the ProApps suite,
where you're able to leverage the cores

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.880
and processing you have more efficiently,
as well as be able to pick up

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.240
additional support for formats
if you need Windows Media or

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.280
RealPlay or whatever it may be.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.440
As far as the shared file system goes,
this is the consideration of where

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.470
are we going to store this content,
but also it's coming into play because

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.490
you need something that's going to
be a fast solution for all of your

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.120
agents working on this simultaneously.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.120
So some numbers you guys
might have seen before,

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.480
when you're considering
the size of the solution,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.800
you're going to need a good amount
of space to store this content.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.340
The more formats you're encoding,
the more content you need to keep,

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.100
the larger you're going to need.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.540
I recently deployed a solution
for the Department of Defense that

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.960
was about 55 terabytes,
and something that was a little

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.370
difficult to express is how would
you get that into a raw number,

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:44.840
right?

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.640
How many hours of video,
whatever it may be.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.870
So we did some math, and we found out,
you know,

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:52.260
when the codecs were supporting and
whatever formats we were employing,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.960
it came out to about
2,000 years of friends.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.240
So if you need some space out there,
and you know, you're like Rachel a lot,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.630
you can get a good amount
of storage from Apple.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.320
The other factor in this is going to be
the amount of bandwidth you're using.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.400
So if you're starting out small,
you can use something like NFS.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.460
You know, you've got a couple agents.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.780
However,
as you get into a larger solution,

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.600
what you'll find is NFS doesn't really
scale from a throughput perspective.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.940
At that point, it's good to deploy XSAN.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.720
You get the fiber channel in there,
and not only do you have

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.540
something that's faster,
it grows better.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.770
So as you add on more
storage down the road,

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.590
you need more content,
you have a system that's

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.780
going to grow with you.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.890
Now, the main part of what we've been
doing lately with Pro Services has

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.320
been working with different types
of workflows and creating custom

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.580
workflows for our customers.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.760
A big part of this to consider
is that workflows are really

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.710
just a series of shell commands.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.480
So if you have people in-house who are
experienced working with the Unix shell,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.430
you know, they write some Bash scripts
or Perl scripts,

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.330
you can put those to
use in your environment.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.630
Out-of-the-box configuration,
most of these are being used

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.400
by the PCAST action command.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.060
This is just the default command that
is included with Podcast Producer.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.240
It has a variety of different tasks
for encoding or posting to iTunes

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.330
or to the built-in group blog.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.950
But what you'll find is that some of it,
you need a little bit more

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.200
out-of-the-box than what you get.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.940
So just to kind of reinforce
this a little bit more,

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.080
I have up here a typical blog workflow.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.450
This is what the basic
blog workflow looks like,

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.640
the one that's included
with Leopard Server.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.070
And I've kind of color-coded this
a little bit to divide this up

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.630
into different sections so I can
explain a little bit more down the

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.820
road about how to customize it.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.560
So when you're seeing the blue here,
I consider these pre-encoding tasks.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.790
And the stuff you find here is
usually going to be something like

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:36.860
prepping the content before it's
encoded or applying a watermark,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.000
your intro, outro videos, titling,
stuff that happens before the

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.420
bulk of the encoding operation.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.970
An important thing to consider here
is that most of this is sequential.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.890
You can't really parallelize
this very easily.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.060
The orange is going to be
your actual encoding tasks.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.740
So this is where the
systems are going out.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.560
They're encoding the content
into multiple formats.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.750
And then after that,
you're going to have your

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.240
post-encoding tasks of as far as,
am I going to send out

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.570
an email notification?

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.170
Am I posting it to YouTube?

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.280
Am I just going to put
it on the blog server?

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.900
To kind of get a little bit
more into the way we've been

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.380
approaching this from our standpoint,
I have this particular task encode

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.970
iPod divided up a little further.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.660
When you look at the Encode
iPod task in the blog workflow,

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.250
what it's actually doing is
calling PCAST action with a set

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.100
of parameters like you see above.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.100
It's going to specify things like
where is my working directory,

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.410
what is my input file format,
what is my output video file,

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.460
and also what particular set of
encoder settings are we using.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.570
Now, an interesting thing about
the PCAST action command is

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.210
it's actually a Ruby script.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.960
So if you're comfortable with it,
and you have a little bit of

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.400
experience working with Ruby,
you can use some of these as an

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.740
example to work your way in and
create more advanced configurations.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.940
Particularly with PCAST action,
when you use the encode command,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.950
it's actually going to go back
to the QT encode command to

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.820
do the actual binary encoding.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:05.260
So what ends up happening is
PCAST action is called by XGrid.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.660
XGrid is going to give it the
necessary parameters from the

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.560
submission from Podcast Producer.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.790
And then QT encode in the end gets
called with an expounded set of

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.140
parameters to make the encoding happen.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.290
So some things we've been looking at for
troubleshooting this process is that,

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.970
first of all,
you want to make sure your underlying

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.320
infrastructure is working correctly.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.010
In a minute here,
I'm going to have Jacob come

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.330
on back up on the stage,
and I'll show you some of these

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.980
particular tools we've been using.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.400
But a great one off the bat
is the XGrid Mandelbrot tool.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.630
You'll find this as part of the
Xcode tools that you can install,

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.900
and it's one of the
example code packages.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.800
And this will actually test your XGrid
to make sure it's working properly.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.110
By the same token,
there are some tools like Xantuner or

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.820
the Asia Kona tester that can verify your
shared file systems working properly.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.500
Once you're sure that
stuff's all working right,

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.220
go ahead and take a look
at running the workflow,

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.030
and then kind of follow the
process of the workflow being

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.880
run through the different logs
and services that are being used.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.400
For example,
PCAST agent D is where the upload

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.740
is going to originally occur,
then you see PCAST server D pick up

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.970
the content and push it off to XGrid
controller before it gets sent to

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.890
finally an agent to get processed.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.130
Some common problems we've been seeing
out in the field with this stuff,

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.210
for example,
with PCAST Agent D is commonly the

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.010
errors you're going to run into are
things related to user credentials,

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.440
right?

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.340
My user account doesn't necessarily
have the privileges to work with

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.930
the Podcast Producer system,
or maybe the podcast

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.500
service isn't even online.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.660
I'm having network trouble.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.610
I can't reach it.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.600
Once I've gotten past that point,
I can see that PCAST ServerDeek has its

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.610
own set of problems it can run into.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.700
Commonly what you'll see here is that
the Xgrid user credentials aren't valid.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.700
So something you might see here is the
Xgrid agent can't kick off the job.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.690
I'm sorry, the Podcast Producer can't
kick off the job.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.950
Similar line is maybe
Podcast Producer can't write to the

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.240
shared file system because it doesn't
have the necessary permissions

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.860
or there's not enough disk space.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.760
Once you've gotten past PCAST Server D,
you're looking at XGrid Controller D,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.690
and commonly the problem
I've seen here is either A,

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.680
you don't have any agents available,
or B, they get stuck at pending.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.040
And an important thing to realize about
the agents that get stuck at pending

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.020
is there's actually a little script in
there called art.rb inside your workflow.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.750
And what that says is whether
or not the access to the shared

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.490
file system is working properly.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.380
So the most common problem I've seen
with agents stuck at pending is they

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.050
can't access the shared file system.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.600
Maybe you're having problems
with a fiber channel card,

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.420
maybe the volume's not
mounted on the agent,

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.010
but for some reason the agent
just can't get to the system.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.300
Finally, XGrid Agent D,
the problems we've seen there

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.180
have been related to things
like privileges and permissions.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.820
You know, my shared file system,
for some reason,

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.380
maybe I don't have directory
information passed to all my agents,

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.800
and now it doesn't see the
correct set of user permissions

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.100
on the shared file system.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.500
Also, you know, it happens sometimes,
maybe you have a malformed workflow,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.290
a typo in there,
you have the wrong input or output,

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.860
maybe you need to do a
different set of actions first.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.380
So, with that in mind,
I'd like to welcome

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.150
Jacob back up on your stage,
And he's going to give us a

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.290
little demo of some of this
troubleshooting we've been doing.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:17.040
So I'm going to start with
simply the Mandelbrot.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:21.610
This is a Xcode project
that's actually located in--

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.310
Developer examples, Xgrid, Grid,
Mandelbrot.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.400
And I'm just gonna build and go.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.900
And I already built it,
so it built pretty quickly.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:33:10.900
[Transcript missing]

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:17.900
and it looks pretty.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:25.900
The second piece that we're, that,
the second part that we want to

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.920
kind of troubleshoot is to make sure
that we're actually getting good

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.780
bandwidth on our shared storage.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.250
The two tools that we use in pro
services is going to be XSAN Tuner,

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:41.070
and right here I'm going to show
you the AJ Kona System Test,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.030
which is a third-party software from AJ.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.170
And it pretty much

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.600
Since I don't actually
have a SAN attached here,

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.120
I'm going to just write
to the local hard drive.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.960
But it just gives you
read and write tests.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.010
If you have a problem
with your shared storage,

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.340
you're going to either see that the
bandwidth isn't what you expect it to be,

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.740
or it's just going to fail,
like if the XAN volume is not

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.000
online or something to that effect.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.400
And this is a real good
test just to make sure,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.580
you know, XGrid agents can all get
to the shared file system.

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.870
So here we actually...

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.860
shows you the average bandwidth.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:31.220
And if you have XAN involved, obviously,
depending on the number

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.290
of controllers you get,
you'll get much higher speeds.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.770
So it's just testing the I/O.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.530
The Apple tool would be XAN Tuner.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.240
XAN Tuner only works
with a real XAN volume,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:51.420
so that's why I had to use the AJ.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:56.410
Then the last one is actually going
to Podcast Capture and doing a test.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.600
And what I'm testing right now is
to make sure my workflows are going

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.260
to be working as I expect them.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.480
So I have four logs here that I'm
actually going to be looking at.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.130
The system log, which is going to give
me the most information.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.260
I'm going to go ahead and mark it.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.840
My podcast server D-log,
my X-Grid agent log,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.770
and my controller log.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:32.150
So when I actually submit this,
let me do a little screen capture.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.780
And here you can tell
Podcast Capture's already saying,

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:41.660
you know, we started recording.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.940
I'm going to go ahead and publish this.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.430
And I'm just going to
submit it with the blog.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.520
This is the -- what
Jason showed you was the blog,

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.100
so when you're -- you're
going to actually see each

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.910
line as it goes through here.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.190
So Xgrid successfully, or Podcast Server,
successfully sent the grid the job,

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.370
and then here you can
actually see the job going.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.840
And you'll see each line
has what XGrid agent,

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.610
the XGrid agent is actually processing.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:24.970
So here it's processing PCAST action,
the post flight, and it tells you the

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.620
actual base directory.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.890
All the information that you
were getting from the workflow

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.900
you'll see in the XGrid agent log.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:42.250
You can also verify that
the job completed in Xgrid

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.530
And the final piece is
just to go verify it.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:06.170
So this is actually in the wiki.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.880
You can just see the video.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.600
Great resolution there.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.600
So that's it.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.900
You pretty much-- you verify the-- the
XGrid agents are working as expected.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.100
You verify that your bandwidth,
your shared storage,

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.100
is up and providing you the
bandwidth that you expect.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.590
And then lastly,
you verify that your workflows

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:37.430
are actually doing what you expect
them to by watching the logs and

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.800
seeing if there's a failure or,
in this case, they all succeeded.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.110
That's--that's what I got.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.800
Back to slides, please.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.290
So this last section,
I'd like to talk a little bit

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.700
about customizing Podcast Producer.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.000
These are, again,
some of the things we've been doing

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.180
out there in the field and making use
of these deployments to make them fit

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.790
a little better for our customers.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.140
I'm going to take a look at
pre-encoding customization,

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.000
things we're doing with different
types of watermark resources,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.240
customizing things that are happening
before the bulk of the encoding process.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.380
I'll take a quick look at some ways
you can enhance the different features

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.230
of the encoding process itself,
and then I'll just talk briefly about

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.880
the post-encoding customization.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.170
As far as pre-encoding
customization goes,

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.700
you can start out small.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.700
Maybe I just want to use a
different watermark image.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.200
I don't want to have an
Apple logo on all my content.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.880
In that case,
just create a simple PNG file,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.660
make sure it's transparent,
and specify the right file in

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.880
your properties and server admin.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.620
Getting a little more advanced
and you want to work with

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.960
things a little bit deeper,
you can take a look at using custom

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.190
quartz compositions and transitions.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.740
So maybe I want to have,
instead of a watermark in

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.100
the lower right-hand corner,
I want it in the left corner.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.540
Or maybe I want a lower third that
talks about what I'm looking at.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.260
All this stuff's possible using
a tool called Quartz Composer,

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.320
which can be a little bit
difficult to work with at first,

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.560
but it gives you a lot of flexibility
in working with different types of

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.850
transitions and the compositions.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:12.080
As far as the encoder customization goes,
another simple thing you can start out

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.210
with is using custom encoder settings.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.080
Maybe you want to use a different
resolution for your encoder settings

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.640
than you do normally out of the box.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.340
So maybe instead of the
default settings for H.264,

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.400
you want to use a different resolution
or a different amount of audio

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.200
quality or change those in some way.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.040
You can track down some tools
on the Internet that will allow

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.060
you to tweak those settings.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.310
You put them in the right folder,
and they're good to go.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.300
Once you're comfortable with that,
you can look at getting

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.770
into more advanced encoders.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.700
So, again,
I talked earlier about using Compressor

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.140
and working with Telestream's product.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:49.490
We've had a lot of success working
with Telestream's episode podcast

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.710
and deploying this for customers
who want to support a larger variety

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.200
of formats than you would get out
of the box with Podcast Producer.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.730
You know, Windows Media Format,
Flash Formats, Real Media,

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.550
pretty much anything out there,
episode is worked with at this point.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.650
For your post-encoding customization,
a simple one you could do would be

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.120
maybe posting multiple group logs.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.690
Out of the box, again,
it really only caters to a single group.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.610
But to add a second group
is really just a matter of

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:20.240
duplicating your existing workflow,
creating a couple custom properties,

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.820
and then specifying in those
custom properties what group

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.810
you would prefer to post to.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.440
Moving on from there,
things you can get into for

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.200
advanced settings are things
like posting to custom websites.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.200
Andy talked earlier
about posting to YouTube.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.440
We've been working on some tools
like that to post to YouTube as well.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.600
I've seen people posting to Blogger,
different type of blog systems,

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.500
really anything you can
call with a shell script.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.300
You know, I want to FTP it to a server.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.400
I want to just put it in a
special folder and drop it.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.690
I want to work on pushing it to
my Final Cut Server solution.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.590
All these things are possible
because it's all just shell

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.750
scripts in the back end.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.800
So just to talk a little bit about this,
as far as if you're working on this

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.000
and you want to get into some more
information on Podcast Producer,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.660
we have our server evangelists
who can talk about this stuff.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.530
Also, you'll find a lot of
documentation on our site,

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.040
on the server documentation,
working with Podcast Producer.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.960
At this point,
you guys probably caught the sessions.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.060
If not, you might want to wait until
WWDC releases this content

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.310
on the iTunes for ADC,
and then you can take a

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.380
look at some of these other
sessions you might have missed.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:30.320
But we've had a lot of content coming
out on Podcast Producer this year.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.530
Also, immediately following this session,
we have a lab down in the

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.320
IT lab for Podcast Producer,
and you can find Jacob and myself
