WEBVTT

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.400
All right.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.390
Should we get started?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.690
My name is Max Muller.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.040
I'm the director of the iTunes
Store Content Engineering Group.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.700
It's my group's responsibility
for building the infrastructure

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.790
for handling all things content,
from content acquisition all the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.560
way through to content delivery
and everything in between.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.480
To set the stage for this session,
we're going to be looking at

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.770
the process of taking a final,
finished application and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.640
publishing it to the App Store.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.680
But before we start to talk
about where we're going,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.020
let's first look at where we've been.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.550
April 2003,
Apple launched the iTunes Music Store,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.200
a revolutionary online music store
featuring over 200,000 tracks,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.940
free 30-second previews,
simple one-click purchase and download,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.430
and worry-free transfer to iPod.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.710
Fast forward five years,
as one of the original

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.950
iTunes Store engineers,
I can tell you,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.790
it's been an action-packed five years.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.180
Today, the iTunes Store operates
in 22 countries.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.660
It features movies, TV shows,
music videos, audiobooks, podcasts,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.320
and iPod games.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.530
This past quarter,
the iTunes Store reached a major

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.710
milestone and is now the largest
retailer of music in the world.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.820
September 2007, Apple launched the
iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.840
Browse, search, preview, purchase,
and download right on

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.570
your iPhone or iPod touch.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.670
and this past January,
Apple released the iTunes

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.480
Store for Apple TV,
bringing simple HD movie rental

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.550
right to your widescreen television.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.560
Apple has accumulated five
years of experience in hosting,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.760
distributing,
and managing online digital content.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.220
and we're building on that
infrastructure now to deliver the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.960
App Store to you and all your friends
and all your friends' friends.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.140
The App Store is really a revolution
in online software distribution.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.940
Apple is handling all the
infrastructure for the App Store by

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.690
leveraging everything that
we've built for the iTunes Store.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.380
on the hosting side,
we host over 6 million unique songs.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.800
And we're adding a new song to the
catalog on average every two seconds.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.070
On the distribution front,
the iTunes Store operates

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.340
in 22 countries.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.620
And just for you,
adding 40 more countries,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.360
bringing the total to 62
countries that you will be able to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.140
distribute your applications into.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.960
On the payment processing front,
we have over 50 million

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.540
accounts in the iTunes Store,
and we've sold over 4 billion songs.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.390
Specific to the App Store,
Apple is bringing a seamless

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.190
download and installation experience,
along with an automatic,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.140
unified software update system.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.580
And starting in early July,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.540
Apple is putting the App Store front
and center on every iPhone

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.870
and every iPod touch we ship,
as well as integrating the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.200
App Store directly into iTunes.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.510
So in your search for Foo,
not only are you going

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.200
to find Foo Fighters,
but you're also going to

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.980
find FooBar by Acme Inc.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.660
So what does this mean to you?

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.040
This means you get to
focus on the fun part,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.080
writing great applications.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.860
Because you don't have to
worry about credit card,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.200
marketing, or hosting fees.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.210
For commercial distribution,
70% of the proceeds are

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.900
going to go straight to you,
the developer.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.020
And free apps are, well,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.540
free.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.840
So at this point,
this is what Apple's bringing

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.800
to the table for the App Store.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.340
And now we need a bunch of great
software engineers to write a

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.960
bunch of great software and get it
published up onto the App Store.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.140
So let's imagine I'm a great
software developer and I've written

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.880
an amazing application called
Touch Fighter and I've gotten

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.540
this published up on the App Store.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.780
Let's first start by looking at what
the customer experience of interacting

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.010
with Touch Fighter is going to be on
the App Store as well as within iTunes.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.780
So this is what Touch Fighter is
going to look like in a list view.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.760
Someone would have gotten to this
either by browsing or via search.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.220
Notice we're displaying the icon,
the company name,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.500
and the application name,
as well as the average

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.880
user rating from our kind,
gentle users.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.300
and this is what a product page for
Touch Fighter is going to look like.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.940
Notice at this point we've added a
description as well as a screenshot.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.750
A customer at this point with one
click would be able to purchase

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.580
and download the app and play
Touch Fighter on their phone.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.100
and this is what Touch Fighter is
going to look like in iTunes.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.740
Notice it's the same information
but would now display it

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.100
in a full rich iTunes page.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.180
With one click at this point,
the customer could purchase and download

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.240
Touch Fighter to their computer.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.910
The next time they plug in their phone,
they could choose to sync the app over

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.590
and play Touch Fighter on their phone.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.620
So this is what the customer experience
is with interacting with Touch Fighter on

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.700
the App Store as well as with an iTunes.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.880
So now let's talk about you.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.850
How are you going to be able to
publish your application to the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.810
App Store so that it can look
even better than Touch Fighter?

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.040
Well, you're in luck.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.550
Publishing your app to the App Store is
a simple five-step process.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.940
The first step is to set up
an account in iTunes Connect.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.340
iTunes Connect is your online web
portal for managing your content and

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.140
your presence within the App Store.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.780
iTunes Connect is used
by our music labels,

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.580
our TV studios,
our post-production houses,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.070
and our movie studios.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.430
If you can buy and download a piece
of content within the iTunes Store,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.190
someone from that company has
an account in iTunes Connect.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.990
The prerequisite to set up an account
for App Store publishing is that

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.900
you must be a standard or enterprise
member of the iPhone developer program.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.290
If you are currently only
developing and running your

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.760
application within the simulator,
then grasshopper,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.110
you are not ready to publish
an app to the App Store.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.840
The first time you access
the iTunes Connect,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.190
you're going to want to have your
administrator log in to the iPhone

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.580
developer or program portal.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.700
From there, they should click on
the distribution link.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.670
This will talk you through everything
you need to know about setting up

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.820
a distribution signing identity,
a distribution provisioning profile,

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.100
and it will also have a
link to iTunes Connect.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.500
Once you log into iTunes Connect,
you'll end up here.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.230
This is the home screen.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.400
For App Store users,
there are four modules: Contracts,

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.530
Financial Reports, Manage Users,
and Manager Content.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.300
Later on in the presentation,
we'll go into more detail about

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.900
all four of these modules.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.040
But for now,
we're done with the first step.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.360
We have an account.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.480
Next up, we're going to add a new app.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.320
To do that,
we log into iTunes Connect and

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.520
click "Manage Your Content."

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.510
If this is your first time logging
into the content management module,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.440
I highly suggest you download the
user guide linked off the middle part.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.220
The user guide contains detailed
instructions as well as examples

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.610
for everything that you will need to
provide to us when you submit your

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.030
application through the App Store.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.140
All of your applications
that you previously submitted

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.560
would be listed here.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.010
You'll be coming back into this
page to make edits to any of your

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.280
metadata that you provided to us,
as well as to provide a new

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.250
binary for the update process.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.170
Now, I've already read the user guide,
so I'm going to click on

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.760
the upper left-hand button
to add a new application.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.610
The first time you add a new app,
we are going to ask you for

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.740
two pieces of information.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.040
The first is your primary
or default language.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.140
This will come into play when we
start to talk about how you localize

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.140
your pages within the App Store.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.820
But for now,
what we want to know from you is what

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.600
language are you filling out all of
the metadata about your application in?

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.160
The second is your company name.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.740
This is your brand within iTunes.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.900
Every application that you
submit to the App Store will be

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.920
listed under this company name.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.660
Now, the other thing to point out about
these two pieces of information

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.350
is that right now we don't
have any facility to edit them,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.090
so you want to make sure you
get them right the first time.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.760
Next up,
we're going to enter the details or

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.580
the metadata about our application.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.340
The first question we're going to
ask you is about export compliance.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.720
The iTunes Store servers are
located within the United States,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.740
and as such,
any time you move a binary to us,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.330
we are going to ask you three
questions about your use of encryption.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.630
The first is,
does your product contain encryption?

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.860
The second, is encryption used for
authentication purposes only?

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.490
And the third,
is encryption used for the protection of

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.720
data or information security purposes?

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.850
If you answer yes to the third question,
we are going to require that you upload

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.260
a PDF copy of your CCATS file to us.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.920
If you don't know what a CCATS file is,
and you think you might need one,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.640
I'm going to refer you to the U.S.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.860
Department of
Commerce Commercial Encryption

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.040
Export Control's website for
further fascinating reading.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.080
Next up is to provide the
details about your application.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.960
This is your application name,
description, categories,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.500
copyright and version information,
as well as an application

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.790
and support URL.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.900
and finally a support email and an
end user license agreement if you

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.600
have one as well as a SKU number.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.720
Later on in the presentation
we'll go into more detail

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.140
about all of these fields,
but for now the only thing I'd like

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.160
to point out is that your SKU number
is not on a customer visible field.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.340
It's only used for you for
within your financial reports.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.820
Once you've submitted a SKU number to us,
you cannot change your SKU number.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.960
Next up are your supported devices.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.900
The App Store differentiates
applications between two sets of devices.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.640
An application that works on
the iPhone and the iPod touch

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.560
and an iPhone only application.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.860
If, for instance,
your application requires the use

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.870
of the camera or the microphone,
you are going to want to indicate

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.410
your application as being
an iPhone only application.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.130
It should be noted that iPhone
only applications will be filtered

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.490
out and not visible within the
App Store on the iPod touch.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.130
Optionally, if you have categorized
your application as a game,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:14.080
we are going to ask you to provide
the frequency or intensity level

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.180
of the following game advisories.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.500
Based on these game advisories,
we'll determine the rating of

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.880
your game within the App Store.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:31.590
The App Store has four age-based ratings,
4+, 9+, 12+, and 17+. I should

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.100
point out that iTunes will offer
parental advisory controls to limit

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.570
access to games of certain ratings.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.130
At that point,
we've provided all the metadata

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.500
we need to about our application.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.310
Next up is the actual assets.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.340
The first and most important
asset is obviously your binary.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.770
There are a few things that you
need to ensure about your binary

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.440
before you upload it to us.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.020
The first is that you have
included a 57 by 57 PNG icon.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.360
Note the rounded corners as well as
shine are automatically applied by

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.880
both the App Store and the phone.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.250
If you've chosen to pre-render your icon,
the App Store will respect the

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.500
UI pre-rendered icon key if you
set it in your Xcode project.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.860
Next up is your app ID.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.640
You register your app ID within
the iPhone developer portal.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.710
You'll use that app ID to create
a distribution provisioning

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.100
profile for your application.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.500
You should set up a separate
distribution provisioning profile

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.300
for each unique application that
you plan to submit to the App Store.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.680
Last is to actually
build your application.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.170
Little bit different than building
it for your development or testing.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.240
So in Xcode, you're gonna set your
active SDK to device.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.280
You're gonna set your active
configuration to release.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.260
You're gonna set your code
signing identity to be

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.980
your distribution identity.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.120
This is not the same as
your development identity.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.490
And last, you're gonna set your code
signing provisioning profile to

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.670
be the distribution provisioning
profile for that application.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.010
After your application has
been built in the Finder,

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.890
you're going to compress
it to a zip archive.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:21.330
This zip archive is what you will
then be uploading to the App Store.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.750
So what about if you get your zip
together and it's 500 megabytes?

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.040
Turns out the web experience for
uploading a 500 megabyte file is

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.010
what we would call less than ideal.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.760
How we solve this problem for
our music and video partners is

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.290
we actually provide software to
them that they then use to upload

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.620
terabytes of content to us every week.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.900
So we've taken that same
core infrastructure and we

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.920
built a nice Cocoa app called
Application Loader just for you.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.770
With Application Loader,
you log in with your

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.520
iTunes Connect account.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.700
Once logged in,
you will see a listing of all of the

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.900
applications that you have submitted to
us that are awaiting a binary upload.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.790
selecting one of those applications,
you can then select a zip

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.700
file and hit transfer,
at which point you can watch

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.500
the progress as your binary
will move up to our servers.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.560
If for whatever reason your
transfer should get interrupted,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.730
you can just hit resume
and pick it right up,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.500
pick it right back up right where it was.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.460
Once the application has
successfully moved to our servers,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.500
you'll get a nice confirmation dialogue
that you'll know that you're done.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.980
Now, we are going to require the
use of Application Loader.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.050
We're going to require the use
of Application Loader if your zip

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.640
archive is over 200 megabytes.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.600
However, anyone can elect to use
Application Loader if you are on a

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.200
slow or spotty internet connection.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.590
and the last thing to point out is
that we do have a hard limit of two

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.750
gigabytes where we will not accept any
archive that is over two gigabytes.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.830
Now, since we are still
within the beta program,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.440
at this point,
we don't want you to upload

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.440
a binary to us just yet.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:15.050
For today,
we're looking at you setting up

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.600
all your metadata within iTunes
Connect and we'll notify you at a

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.380
later point when we're ready for
you to upload your binary to us.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.600
Next asset that we need is a
512 by 512 version of your icon.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.230
Note, this should be from the exact
same artwork of the icon that

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.480
was included in your binary.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.300
and the last asset we need
from you is one screenshot.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.840
Note, if your screenshot
includes the status bar,

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.040
we're gonna ask you to crop that out.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.560
You can provide up to four additional
screenshots that will only be

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.690
visible within the iTunes Store.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.260
At which point,
we're done with our assets.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.980
Only one step left,
and that is to specify availability.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.370
Availability breaks down to
two pieces of information.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.650
The first is the availability date.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.180
This is the earliest date
that your application can

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.410
appear within the App Store.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.790
and the second is distribution.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.180
When you're going through the flow,
worldwide distribution is assumed.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.940
However, if that is not your intent,
for the 22 stores that we currently

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.350
operate the iTunes Store within,
you can select which of those

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.320
countries you would like your
application to be visible within.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.820
And for the 40 new
stores that we're adding,

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:35.420
you're either opting into those 40
stores or out of those 40 stores.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:41.500
At this point, if your intention was to
publish a free application,

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.160
you've supplied
everything you need to us.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.200
So now let's look at a
commercial application.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.040
For publishing a commercial application,
we add two additional steps.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.140
The first is to set up
your payment information.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.830
And the second is to set up
your application pricing.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:07.820
Your payment information,
like your account, is a one-time process.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.920
The first thing we're going
to need from you is a signed

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.590
paid applications contract.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.490
This can be electronically
assigned by the administrator of

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.160
your iTunes Connect organization.

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:22.710
Once we have that signed contract,
we need you to provide three

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.850
additional pieces of information.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.500
The first are your finance
and legal contacts.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.640
The second is a bank
account to receive payments.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.310
Note that even if you plan to
distribute commercially in 62 countries,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.620
we only need a single
bank account from you.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.580
Your bank will automatically handle
the currency conversion for you.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.760
and the last thing we need from
you is your tax information.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.840
For developers within the United States,
you can electronically submit your

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.820
W-9 form within iTunes Connect.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.910
And for developers outside the US,
you can download your W-8 bin form from

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:00.640
iTunes Connect that you'll then need to
fill out and put back in the mail to us.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.600
To get to your contracts,
log into iTunes Connect,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.310
click on the upper left
module called Contracts.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.920
First time through,
you'll notice contracts and amendments

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.570
that you are eligible for are listed
on the top part of the screen.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.910
contracts that you currently have
that are in effect are listed in

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.100
the bottom part of the screen.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.710
As part of your iPhone
program developer contract,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.440
it included free distribution.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.640
So here at the bottom,
we see we have one free distribution

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.950
contract that is currently in effect.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.570
Once we have signed our
paid applications contract,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.110
we provided our contacts,
our banking information,

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.100
as well as our tax information.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.300
The paid applications contract will
drop down into your NFX contracts.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.990
Once Apple has set
everything up on our side,

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.670
the green checkbox that you see in the
upper and the bottom left-hand corner

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.750
is your sign that you are now clear
for commercial distribution in the 62

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.810
countries that we currently operate in.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.130
That's it for the payment information.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.810
Next step is to set up the pricing.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.180
The pricing of your application,
you will be picking a price tier.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.780
Price tier will determine one price tier
maps to all the retail price points and

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.800
all the App Stores that we operate in.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.050
For instance,
if I was to choose price tier

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.520
10 in the left-hand column,
you'd see what the customer price

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.800
reflects in each of the countries.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.100
And on the right-hand side,
you'd see what your proceeds are.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.300
Note that for the 40 additional
countries that we're opening up,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.850
Those that are not within the Eurozone
are all operating on the US dollar.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.990
At this point,
we've provided everything we need

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.090
to for publishing a commercial
application to the App Store.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.340
So now let's look at a worldwide app,
either a free or commercial.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.600
In this case,
what we're looking at now is how we

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.480
localize the pages within the App Store.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.810
So for that, we had one additional step,
which is to add languages.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.940
The App Store supports the
following supported languages:

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.200
English, Dutch, French, German, Italian,
Spanish, and Japanese.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.620
For every application
that you submit to us,

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.880
you can provide the following:
application name, description,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.580
application support URLs, support email,
and screenshots in each

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.360
one of those languages.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.220
this is all about your
marketing materials.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.860
Your actual binary you will have
localized with the next code.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.220
At this point, we're done.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.470
We have supplied everything to the
App Store for publishing either

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:54.330
a commercial or free application
with localized eyes metadata.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.300
and at this point I'd like
to bring up Ricardo Cortes,

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.940
engineering manager
responsible for iTunes Connect.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.880
He's going to walk us through
publishing an app to the App Store.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.030
Ricardo.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.020
Thank you, Max.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.810
So there are three steps in getting
your application up on the App Store.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.330
We need to build it in Xcode.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.180
We need to zip it,
create the metadata and

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.580
pricing in iTunes Connect,
and then if it's a large binary,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.690
use Application Loader to
submit it to the iTunes Store.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.250
Let me go ahead and launch Xcode.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.780
First thing you want to do is make sure
that your toolbar is set up correctly.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:51.140
If you right-click on the
toolbar and customize it,

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:56.110
you want to grab the overview toolbar
and drag it onto your toolbar pane.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.680
As Max alluded to,
you need to set your active

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.310
configuration and your active SDK.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:09.180
You'll see that my active SDK is
set to device iPhone OS 2.0,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.130
and my active configuration
is set to release.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.540
The next step is to ensure
your code signing identity

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.100
bits are all set and correct.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:23.170
If you click on Touch Fighter in
the target section,

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.350
bring up the info panel.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.890
To get to it quickly,
you can type code signing.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.960
The code signing section comes up.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.020
You'll see the code signing
identity is set to my distribution

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.280
code signing identity.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.140
And my code signing provisioning profile
is set to my distribution profile

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.390
that I created within the WWDR portal.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.120
Once you've verified that you
have the code sign identity and

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.580
provisioning profile set correctly,
you can go ahead and

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.110
build your application.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.600
And as Max alluded to,
the final step after you build your

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.470
application is to zip it in Finder.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:34.200
If you right click on the built product,
you can reveal it in Finder.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.200
I already have my zip there,
I'll delete that one.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.810
And right click on the
app and compress it.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.900
I have a demo folder over here.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:50.300
I'll drag that to my demo
folder to upload later.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.100
And step one, Xcode is done.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:58.800
Next, you want to go into iTunes Connect.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.300
Let me launch iTunes Connect.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:06.610
Using the same login and
password you have for the portal,

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.410
On this page, you're brought to the four
modules Max alluded to.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.570
The one of interest right
now is manage your content.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.350
As you can see, I have a game, Solitaire,
that I previously uploaded

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.800
on the 7th of June.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.740
Its status is currently
waiting for upload,

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.500
so it's a large binary,
or I opted to choose the large binary

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.960
flow due to a spotty or slow connection.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.990
Right now,
I'd like to add a new application,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.370
so I'll go ahead and do that.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.100
question is export compliance.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.200
Touch fighter does not
contain any encryption,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.240
so I'll go ahead and
indicate that by choosing no.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.240
And continue on in the flow.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.980
The Overview tab is where you enter
most of your metadata that describes

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.140
your particular application.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.700
So I'll go ahead and enter
the application name first.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.140
I have a little cheat sheet here.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.420
Let me grab my application
description from my cheat sheet.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.840
The device is iPhone and iPod touch
for this particular application.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.350
And it is a game.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.510
Due to the fact that I chose
game as my primary category,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.940
I'm now given the option to
choose up to two subcategories.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.360
I'll opt to choose one
subcategory of action.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.750
Note that application name,
application description, device,

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.120
and primary category are bolded.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.840
These are required fields.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:13.870
You're not required to
enter the non-bolded fields.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.730
The copyright.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:43.600
[Transcript missing]

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:09.800
[Transcript missing]

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.100
If you choose game as
your primary category,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.500
you're required to now choose the
advisories that describe the game,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.270
game's content.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.070
Touch Fighter does have some
infrequent and mild use of

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.640
cartoon or fantasy violence,
so I will indicate that.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.110
The rest of the advisories do not apply.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.580
After the Rating tab,
we're brought to the Upload pane.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.540
The Upload tab, sorry.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.280
This application is a large binary,
so I'll go ahead and indicate

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.840
that with this checkbox.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:28:00.440
And move on to the next asset,
which is my 512 by 512 icon.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.390
Click "Upload File."

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.760
After you've properly uploaded
the asset to the iTunes Store,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.600
a check indicates success.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.130
After the 512x512,
it's your primary screenshot.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.700
At this point, I'm not going to enter any
additional screenshots.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.430
I'll move on to the next tab in the flow.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:53.540
The next tab is the Pricing tab.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.740
The availability date
is already set to today.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.000
I would choose Tier 5.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.310
And once the tier is chosen,
a dynamic matrix shows below the tier

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.680
to reflect the customer price and
proceeds in each of the App Stores.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:17.090
You'll see US has a customer price
of $499 and the proceeds are $350.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.100
Let's continue on the flow.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:30.440
At this point, because I set my primary
language to English,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.780
and this is the
localization I just added,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:40.200
I now have the option of adding up to
six more localizations for the App Store.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.510
I will go ahead and choose French.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:04.300
We auto-populate the application title
from the first localization you entered.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.390
The application description is
really the field you'll use to

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.290
localize this particular application
for a particular storefront.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.910
Using my cheat sheet,
my five years of French is

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.930
not going to pay off here,
so I'll let you guys interpret.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.540
And then, you know,
your support URLs might change

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.460
slightly depending on where you are.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.010
So I'll add "fr" to the end.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.430
At the bottom,
you see we auto-populate your

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.800
primary screenshot and any
additional screenshots you've

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.190
created on your first localization.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.100
You have the option here of changing
them or keeping them as they were

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.480
uploaded previously in the flow.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.020
I'll go ahead and continue.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.390
Finally, we reached the Review tab.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.440
This is where you can confirm
all the changes you've made

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.390
for all the localizations.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.270
So if we look at the
English localization,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.040
Of course we've got
the application title,

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.820
the description is in English.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.430
Device, primary category of games
with a subcategory of action.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.230
Copyright, URLs, email address,
and the generated rating of 9+.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.870
At the bottom,
the chosen tier of Tier 5 with customer

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.040
price of $499 and proceeds of $350.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.420
Scrolling up, let's take a look at the
French localization real quick.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.860
We choose the France App Store.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.900
and it loads the localization
for the French language.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.640
As you can see,
the application description

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.800
is now in French.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.090
And with that, we're ready to go ahead
and submit our application.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.200
Due to the fact that
I indicated in the flow that my

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.680
application was a large binary,
I'm now given the option of downloading

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.340
Application Loader with this link here.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.800
I've already downloaded
Application Loader,

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.780
so I will skip this step.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.430
and we're brought back to
the first page in the flow.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.700
When you enter manager
content from the home page,

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.810
you'll see Solitaire is still there,
as is Touch Fighter.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.490
I indicated in the flow
there was a large binary,

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.600
so the binary was not uploaded
through iTunes Connect,

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.890
thus the status is waiting for upload.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.460
So with that, we're done with step two.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:43.640
The last step is to upload the
binary to Application Loader.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.570
Let me launch Application Loader.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.810
The first screen you brought to in
Application Loader is a welcome pane.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.840
and it drives you through a wizard
process through the application.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.500
Your login is obviously the same
login you use for iTunes Connect.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.870
So I'll go ahead and authenticate myself.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.960
At this point,
Application Loader is authenticating

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.610
me to ensure I'm enabled to
deliver content to the App Store.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.700
It's done so,
so I'll proceed into the flow.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.300
And now what Application Loader has
done for me is it went and fetched

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.680
the applications that I'm enabled
to deliver to the iTunes Store,

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.380
namely Solitaire and Touch Fighter,
both which were in the status of

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.140
waiting for upload in iTunes Connect.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.250
I'll go ahead and choose Touch Fighter.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.700
Application Loader gives you
a little bit of details about

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.140
the application to ensure this
is the application you really,

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.540
really want to submit
to the iTunes Store.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.030
So there's the application,
version number, the SKU,

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.780
and the copyright.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.760
And now we're ready to
choose our zipped archive,

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.890
our zipped binary,
and send it to the App Store.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.580
in my demo folder,
if you recall from Xcode,

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.480
is my zipped binary.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.400
I'll go ahead and choose that.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.000
Application Loader comes with
a background activity monitor.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.500
Gives you a little idea of what's
happening behind the scenes.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.570
It's also fully threaded,
so you have the opportunity

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.900
to do multiple things at once,
including send two binaries

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.030
at once to the App Store.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:46.560
You can see I've chosen
touchfighter.zip off the file system.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.940
And the last step is to
send it to the iTunes Store.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.900
So I'll go ahead and do that.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.960
We authenticate ourselves,
ensure that you're able

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.500
to deliver the package,
then we upload it.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.800
As you can see, the package has been
uploaded to the iTunes Store.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.800
If I click Next in the flow,
I get a confirmation

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.430
page indicating success.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:28.640
Finally, if I click Done, that's it.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.800
I've uploaded my application
in Application Loader.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.900
So to review, three steps.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.510
First,
you've got to code your application.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.460
You've got to set your distribution
profile and your code signing

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.910
identity to distribution and Xcode.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:45.490
Zip it.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.250
Then enter into iTunes Connect,
enter your metadata, set your pricing,

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.620
upload your screenshots,
any localizations for

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.940
any of the App Stores.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.240
And finally, if you have a large binary
or a spotty connection,

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.640
use Application Loader to
deliver it to the App Store.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:01.840
Thank you.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.710
I'll turn it back to Max.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.180
Thank you, Ricardo.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.910
See, I told you it was easy.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.940
And I'd like to hand it
over to Elizabeth d'Errico.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.540
Elizabeth's team manages the content
for the iTunes stores worldwide.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.980
She's the director of the iTunes store,
iTunes production group.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.560
She's going to walk you through
some of the best practices to

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:31.600
how to make your application
really shine within the App Store.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:52.980
to the App Store on the device and
to the iTunes Store on the web.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:57.330
Now I want to talk a little bit about
best practices for how to present and

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.130
promote your applications once there.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.600
use us to your advantage.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.940
So when you go to the device,
you're going to be competing amongst

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.990
each other for all of the great
applications you're going to be

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.400
developing for consumers' eyeballs.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.590
The same way when you come to
the iTunes Store on the desktop,

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:21.420
you're actually going to encounter even
more competition with TV shows and movies

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.320
and music and all of the other wonderful
things that are on the iTunes Store.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.570
We want to make sure that those who
are coming in to find your applications

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.660
are actually going to find them.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.870
And there's a couple different ways
to do that that I want to talk about.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.480
These tools that we'll talk about
are the same tools that are used

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.340
for whether it's a movie studio
or a TV network or a music label.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.370
They all use these same tools,
and now it's your turn.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.960
Best ways of getting your app
noticed and making sure that

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.660
your consumers can find you.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.610
We'll talk about being discoverable
on the store and we want to

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:53.880
talk about being compelling.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.600
So once someone has found you,
how to draw someone in and

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.100
be more enticing and making
them want to learn more.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.600
And then once they have that piece down,
we want to make sure that they can

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.520
actually have all the information
necessary to understand that

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.290
they cannot live without your
application one more minute.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.700
that's the goal.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.620
Discoverability.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.740
There's a couple different things to
take a look at to make sure that you

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.260
are being as discoverable as possible
in the App Store on the device and

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.090
on the iTunes Store on the desktop.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:29.060
One is simply your application name
and the other is simply the category

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:29.060
that you choose for your application.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.910
As mentioned,
there's certainly a lot of things

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:37.600
going on in both platforms for
you to have competition with.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.160
There's a lot of things we're featuring,
there's a lot of things

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.300
that are being promoted,
but really a whole heck of a lot

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.380
of people are going in and using
search and browse in order to

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.940
find what they're looking for.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.640
So that's what we're going
to take advantage of here.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.560
Looking at search,
your name is really the first thing

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.320
that you should pay attention to.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.710
On the device itself,
as you've seen in the list view,

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.710
not a lot of room,
not a lot of real estate for a long name.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.460
You have about 20 characters
and that's about it,

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.650
otherwise it starts getting truncated.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:09.560
So just something to think about.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.860
Similarly here as you
see with the blue area,

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:16.290
that's our XML area on the desktop,
and that has segregated buckets

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.730
of information so at least you're
understanding the TV shows that

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.760
go together and your results and
your movies and your applications.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.540
However, again,
not a whole lot of information.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:24.540
So you're going to have to
think about what you're going

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:24.540
to use to get your results.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:24.540
So you're going to have to
think about what you're going

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:24.640
to use to get your results.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:24.640
So you're going to have to
think about what you're going

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:24.640
to use to get your results.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:24.640
So you're going to have to think about
what you're going to use to get your

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.760
lot of space for your name there.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.150
And then down below, by relevancy,
there's kind of a jumble of

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.900
media types all in there,
so really the only thing people are

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.080
going to be able to see when trying to
find your application there is the name.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.680
That's the only thing they
can really look at there.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.580
So a couple of things to
think about with your name.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.820
One, do not include the version number.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.330
That is a separate field
as Ricardo has gone over,

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:53.690
and that's something that will occur
in your product page separately.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.120
So this is really your evergreen
name of your application that will

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.520
live throughout its lifecycle.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.440
Do not use brands that do not
belong to you to precede your app,

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.210
enough said.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.540
Do not use long names as mentioned
because of the real estate issue.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.640
You will get truncated.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.460
Things to help you keep
things short would be to,

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.370
if you've got a lot of
serial applications going on,

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.980
if you've got Touch Fighter,
the new generation, Tux Fighter,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.220
Extreme Action, Touch Fighter,
Touch Fighter.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.760
If you can avoid it,
don't put Touch Fighter in front

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.400
of all of those because again,
what you'll end up with,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.570
especially in a list view,
is just the word Touch Fighter over

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.770
and over again and that may not
be the best way to help your user

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.860
find what they're looking for.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.000
So simple to the point, concise,
and relevant, if at all possible.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.580
If someone who remembers that fantastic
game that they wanted to go get that

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.720
had something to do with fighting,
they want to go look that up,

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.730
they will actually be able to
find it if you have the word

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.440
fight in your application,
for example.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.520
We'll talk about your application
description here in a little bit,

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.920
and that is also indexed and
categorized so that people can

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.830
find that in search as well.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.390
So you can take advantage of
the words you're using there,

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.260
too, to have a good search
experience for your consumers.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.500
and then browse.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.500
Very simply,
browse is used quite often both

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.440
on the phone itself through
use of categorization to browse

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:22.350
through and also on the store,
on the desktop in this view.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.300
Your primary category is that which
follows your application throughout

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.300
everything that you're doing so that if
you happen to be found through something

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:35.450
that's being featured or through search,
that primary category is

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.800
what will be seen every time
your application is viewed.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:42.080
Your secondary will be found
using the browse as well.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.600
So if someone's going in to browse,
they can find you in both

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.380
categorizations that you've used.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.520
So I encourage you if you
do have two that make sense

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:51.260
to take advantage of that,
use them both.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.050
It also helps us as a promotional tool.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:57.160
If we're going to do a promotion on
productivity apps or on utility apps,

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.960
it helps us to understand, okay,
this is how this person has

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.440
categorized this application.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.370
Perhaps it's something we should look
at in terms of doing a promotion.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.480
and then for games, just for the games
category at the moment,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.760
we do have a couple of different
subcategories that are afforded to

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.720
you as well as Ricardo has shown.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.040
So now that someone's found you,
what are the best ways to draw

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.340
people in more and to entice them to
learn more about your application?

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.160
Usually the best way to do
that is through visuals,

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.660
very visual creatures,
and that's something that we

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.920
have two things that you can
take advantage of to do that,

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.840
both your icons and your screenshots.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.830
Users expect gorgeous icons.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.130
So again,
when people are looking at anything

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.000
really that's on the Apple platform,
they're going to look for

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.500
something that's been well thought
out and beautifully presented.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.260
Same thing on the desktop if
you're being observed there.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.910
Again, gorgeous movie posters,
title treatments from TV,

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:53.510
lovely album artwork.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.440
All of these things are going to
be found within the store right

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.300
next to your application and people
are going to expect that your

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.300
application icon looks great too.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.890
So here's a couple of things
to do to help achieve that.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:09.080
One is to always follow the
human interface guidelines.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.960
That can help you to understand
how to use a single light source

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:16.380
and also just how to make your
icon look homogenous with other

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.320
things that they'll find from Apple.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.550
Don't scale up.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.260
That's probably the cardinal rule.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:26.250
If you've got your small 57 by 57
icon that you're putting within your

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:30.350
binary and then you're going to have
the 512 by 512 that you're later

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.780
going to put into iTunes Connect,
do not scale that tiny little

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.840
thing up into the 512 by 512 or
you'll get a lot of pixelation.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.170
So that's something to think about.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:44.790
Legibility, again,
icons are by definition iconic.

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:48.740
So you're not going to want to use
a lot of text or small imagery where

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.620
people are trying to guess and squint
and figure out what the heck that is.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.810
So you want to use something that's large
and easily identifiable and universal.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.980
This is the one asset that is not
going to be allowed to be localized.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.660
So it's something that you're going to
want to think about in terms of someone

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.930
sitting in Japan or Germany or the U.S.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.770
If they're looking at this icon,
do they understand what that

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.330
represents and what that is?

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.300
Appropriateness, so we're a family store.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.240
We don't want someone coming in
looking for Hannah Montana and Alvin

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.800
and the Chipmunks to stumble across
something that is explicit whether

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.240
there's some type of nudity or some
type of extreme violence going on.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.200
So keep that in mind as well.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.740
And don't be afraid to consult a
graphic designer professionally.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.180
If that's something that your forte
is developing and you want to get that

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:41.120
app the best that it can work and you'd
rather have someone else doing the

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.800
designs for those for your art assets,
there is on the web,

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:51.460
WWDR has an interface design
assistance page at this URL behind me.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:53.990
And that's something,
somewhere you can go to

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:57.340
find professional help,
at least for your artwork.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:02.940
make sure you send us your
flat and square artwork.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.970
And as Max mentioned,
that will be rounded and we will

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.450
add a rounding and a shine to it.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.000
and that's pretty much the icon.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.240
Screenshots.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:19.540
So screenshots are found both on
the desktop and on your application,

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.140
sorry, and on the device.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.630
And this is really the best way to draw
someone in and have them understand

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.580
what it is that your application does.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.350
On the desktop store we have
trailers for movies and we

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.970
have 30 second clips for music.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.120
This is the equivalent of
that for your application.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.490
This is really what should give
people a sense of what your app does.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:43.800
So a couple different ways to
achieve that would be again,

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.400
similar to the icon,
you want to make sure it's legible.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.900
You're afforded five screenshots.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.080
If you've got three fantastic
ones and two mediocre ones,

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.540
just send in the three.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.390
You really want to just put your best
foot forward for this and show your

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.600
best screenshots you possibly can.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.080
Make sure they're legible.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.340
Make sure that you don't have a lot
of small things going on where people

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.310
are wondering what's happening there.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.160
You want to make sure that
it represents your app.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.260
If it's gorgeous,
it really doesn't have anything

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.590
to do with what you do using
the application day to day,

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.160
you're going to want to rethink that
and present something that really

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.160
shows off what your app can do.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.760
We've talked about
cultural sensibilities.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.100
Screenshots are able to be localized.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.710
So there may be a restriction somewhere
where there's more sensitivity

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.840
to violence or more sensitivity
to nudity or just in general more

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.720
sensitivity to certain things.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.390
You'll want to think about that
and actually you can take different

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.980
screenshots and localize them.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.730
based upon the knowledge
in different territories.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:47.610
and also of course set your
iPhone language before taking the

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.800
screenshot so that you also are
localizing it not only culturally

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.740
but obviously the language as well.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.030
To take the screenshot on the new OS,
you will hold down the power button and

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:03.400
press the home button and the screenshot
will be saved into your camera roll.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.100
So that's the way you can do that.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.920
You can also use Xcode Organizer
which has a nice screenshot tab

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.990
that will do the same thing for you.

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.840
remove the status bar
from the screenshot,

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.440
as I think Max mentioned.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.240
The reason for that is if
you're browsing on the device,

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.440
you don't want to have double
screenshot funkiness going on,

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.200
so make sure that you crop that out.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:27.300
and that way you can have
more real estate for your

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.440
nice full screen screenshots.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:31.440
That's the portrait.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.000
Here's the landscape.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.780
Crop that out.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.740
and that's your
screenshots and your icons.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.890
So now that you've drawn someone in
and you've enticed them to learn more,

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.950
we want to make sure that when they
get there that the information that

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.990
they're viewing is going to help
them make that decision that they,

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.750
again,
can't live without your application and

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:57.680
have to hit that buy button right away
or that download button right away.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.680
So a couple different things to
think about when being informative.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.520
Application description is one
of the best ways of doing this.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.380
I encourage you to avoid having too
much or too little going on there.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.900
This is clearly an
example of too much copy.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:16.900
It could be a beautiful Shakespearean
sonnet about how wonderful your app is,

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.360
but no one, unfortunately,
is going to read that.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:22.660
It actually takes away from
your screenshot as well.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.390
No one can see it.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.590
So this is just way too much information.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.830
So avoid doing that.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.220
You also don't want to have too little.

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.160
Saying, you know,
this app rocks or best app ever

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.010
is where it's informative about
how you feel about your app.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:40.490
It doesn't really help people make
that decision that they are going

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.980
to want to buy your app because they
won't know exactly what it does.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.390
So just keep that in mind.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:54.320
can't use HTML tags but I would encourage
you to use line breaks and bullets in

00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:00.110
plain text to better set off some of
your copy and make it more legible.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.940
Very quickly, copyright information,
generally the copyright

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.840
holder name and the date.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:12.200
We will append the copyright symbol
so you don't need to include that.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.820
And again, if you can,
keep that as short and succinct

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.030
as possible as that will appear
on your product page and can cause

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.000
clutter if it's overly verbose.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.650
Version number, again,
the human interface

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:27.090
guidelines can help you here,
but generally a numeral is the

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.200
best way to have someone easily
understand exactly where they left off.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:34.400
And so you can serialize your versions.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.340
SKU number is not user facing,
but I just bring it up to give

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:38.790
a little more detail to it.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.040
If you have a UPC code,
that's the best way that you can

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.500
possibly give us that information.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.630
However, if you don't,
it really is just a unique

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.870
identifier for your account that
is used to track that information.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.900
And that application.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.670
And that's what you will receive in
your financial reports when you go

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:58.670
to see how much money you've made.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:00.960
URL and email.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.090
So application URL,
if you've provided it,

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.540
that will be on the page
for people to peruse,

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:09.200
to jump over if they want to learn
more information from your site

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.460
before purchasing or downloading.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.360
Support URL,
that's something that will not be

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.770
placed on the page before they buy,
but after they buy,

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.260
they will be given your support
URL to report any problems

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.190
they find with the binary.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:27.530
We will also send people to your
support URL if when we have heard

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:31.340
in our purchase history area if
someone has complained specifically

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.370
about problems with the binary,
that's a way that we can

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.980
send you that information,
send them to your support URL there.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.240
And the support email
is not being sent out.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.620
It's not going to be visible.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:47.140
You will not get a deluge of people
to your support email address.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:48.780
However,
we may contact you if we do find out

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.400
that there's a problem with your binary.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.820
That's how we'll communicate with you.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.790
End User License Agreement,
if you have one,

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.440
you can provide that and there is
a link as well on the page that

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.700
people can peruse that before
they download and purchase.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.370
There are some terms it needs
to just make sure it meets our

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:10.160
minimum requirements and that can
be found both on iTunes Connect,

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:14.660
as Ricardo showed,
by the End User License Agreement field

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.540
and also within the contract.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.930
There's some information about that.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.640
If you want someone to specifically
accept your terms and conditions,

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.040
the best way to do that is to do
that within the binary itself.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.220
Thinking globally,
we touched on this a little bit,

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:35.060
but iTunes will now be in
62 countries coming up soon.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.100
It's very, very exciting.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.150
And 40 of those countries
are just for you.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:40.120
40 of those we will have applications.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.060
Now that number in the countries
are subject to change a little bit,

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:47.500
but basically that is
the current situation.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.200
We're very excited about it.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.640
Territory versus language,
just want to touch on this for a second.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.800
Ricardo in the iTunes
Connect where he showed you

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.040
you're putting in your language,
that language could be used

00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.540
across several territories.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.180
For example, in the U.S.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.190
storefront, we allow U.S.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:05.490
English and we also allow Spanish.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:10.040
So if someone is sitting and browsing the
iTunes store in the United States with

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.360
their OS set to Spanish,
they're going to see the same

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.060
Spanish that you put into iTunes Connect.

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:19.250
So I just say that so that you don't
use any local or territory-specific

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.360
information in that localization
because it is not territory-specific

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.870
in where it will show up.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.860
Creating a single bind.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.190
So you can create a binary with
multiple localizations as Max spoke of.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.200
Being aware of cultural sensibilities,
we touched on that a lot.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.190
Localize your description
professionally or don't do it.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.940
Don't think, "Well, hey,
I've got this great description.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.150
I spent a lot of time on it and it's
native language and now I'm going to,

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.380
you know, in a third-party application,
put it up in the web and see what

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.190
comes out." Highly unadvisable.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.640
You'll have something like this
that you spent a lot of time on,

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.300
you know, "Save the universe and blast
incoming enemy spaceships by

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:58.760
tapping on the iPhone's multi-touch
display." That sounds pretty good.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.880
You put it through your translator.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.830
And for those of you that speak Japanese,
what you're essentially telling people

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:09.880
is the universe that is by hitting with
an iPhone as well as the blasting wind.

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:15.670
So I think that's first not what
you want to say and secondly

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:16.540
it's a little bit frightening.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:22.370
So I think that people would rather
see that in English and actually

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:26.140
go off of your screenshots and your
icons and other things to help them

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:30.920
make their decision and not frighten
them away with something like that.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:35.470
Considering app size,
as Steve spoke about in the keynote,

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:36.890
we do have some restrictions here.

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:41.500
We are going to restrict 2
gigabytes for the files themselves.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.750
But if you picture someone sitting
in their local coffee shop having

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.860
a latte and you've done such a good
job of drawing them in and making

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.550
things compelling and they can't
live without your application,

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:51.500
they're going to download it right now.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.730
And then, oh my goodness,
if they're on Wi-Fi,

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:56.740
it's going to take them at least
two or three lattes before they're

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.500
going to have your application.

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.070
And if they're on cellular networks,
they actually probably

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.500
won't be able to get it.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.070
And if it's under -- sorry,
if it's over 10 megabytes,

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:06.500
they won't be able to get it.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.650
So sometimes it can't be avoided,
obviously, if you have things that

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.500
make that footprint creep.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.720
But really, if you can avoid doing that,
that's the best thing.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.740
Last thing I want to leave you
with is additional promotions.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:23.580
So if we have elected to promote your
application in some way to feature it,

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.610
we are going to need some high quality,
high resolution artwork from you.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.220
As you'll notice,
most of the items here in what

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.190
we call the top area here,
the things that rotate along

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.800
those are called splashes.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.000
The items in the middle
are called bricks.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.250
And then on the device,
the little things we

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:43.170
used are called squishes,
like small splashes.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.760
So for all of those,
we do have things like title

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:49.080
treatments and background artwork.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:52.280
And we will contact you and tell you,
hey, we would really like to feature you.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.660
Here's what we're going to need from you.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:57.040
And this information is in the
user guide as well that you can

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.980
download from iTunes Connect.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:03.190
So again, and we need vector artwork and
we need transparent backgrounds

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:06.640
and layers so that if we need to
manipulate it in some way or add a

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.740
tag to it that says something like
app just added or something like that,

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.040
that we can do so.

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:17.490
and if we're really going to blow it out
and do a fully designed product page,

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:21.290
again,
we just need a large layered image for us

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.930
to work with and fit into our templates.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:26.250
And Touch Fighter is a great app,
so we're definitely

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.500
going to feature that.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:33.200
So again, a lot of this can be
found in the user guide.

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.060
And so I encourage you
to take a look at that.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.340
And now that you've seen how you
can get your application published

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.860
and how you can best promote it,
I'm going to have Max come back up.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:45.590
And he's going to talk to you about some
of the things and what happens next.

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:54.930
Thank you, Elizabeth.

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.030
All right.

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.090
So now you've submitted a great
application to the App Store.

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:01.530
So what's next?

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:04.640
The first thing to point
out is to be prepared.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.990
Make sure that at the time you
submit your binary to us that any

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:13.100
services or external URLs that your
application relies upon are live.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:16.730
Also make sure that your application
and support URLs are live as well

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:18.560
as your support email address.

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.700
Nothing says you care like giving a
customer a 404 when they're trying to get

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.820
help about how to use your application.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.110
Assuming issues were not
found with your submission,

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:31.890
you will receive an email notification
and your application will go live,

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.900
either immediately or on the
availability date that you specified,

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.070
whichever comes later.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.380
If issues were found
with your submission,

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.050
Apple will contact you,
at which point you'll have

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:44.420
the option of uploading a new
binary through iTunes Connect,

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.670
either through the page or
using an application loader.

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:53.950
Other things you should look at doing are
creating other iTunes Connect accounts

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.430
for people within your organization.

00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:59.060
If you recall,
only the administrator has an initial

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:02.270
iTunes Connect account created for them,
so they will need to set up

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:06.670
other users and give them admin,
finance, and technical roles,

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.720
as well as set their access
privileges and set their email

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.720
notification preferences.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.640
One notification that you want to
make sure that you set up and that you

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.000
receive is your reporting notification.

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:21.470
We post reports on a monthly basis.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.070
You will receive an email notification
when a report has been posted in

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:27.370
iTunes Connect for you to download.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:31.450
You will receive one report
per Proceed currency.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:35.420
Within that report,
it will be grouped by your SKU.

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:39.540
To get to your reports,
you'll log into iTunes Connect and

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.180
click on the Financial Reports section.

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:47.370
Every financial report that we
have posted for you will always

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.670
be there for you to download.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.790
This way,
if you want to come back and compare

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:55.150
sales for an application three
months ago to how it's doing now,

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.390
you'll be able to do that.

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:02.140
Other things that you might look at doing
after you've submitted an application

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.340
are making changes to that application.

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:08.400
The App Store differentiates
between two types of changes.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.900
The first are changes to
your marketing material.

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.450
This is your description,
your screenshots,

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.220
maybe adding a localization,
as well as even changing the price.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:21.520
For these,
we refer to those as live edits.

00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:24.080
Once you've confirmed a live edit,
those changes are going to

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.800
get pushed out and start to be
visible within the App Store.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.340
The second type of update is an
actual update to your binary.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.880
For this,
you're going to be using the integrated

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.240
update system built into the App Store.

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:42.780
First thing to point out is that
this is not an incremental update.

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:46.020
We're going to ask for you to
provide the entire new binary to us,

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:48.000
and that entire new binary is
what is going to get pushed

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.530
to all of your current users.

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:53.820
Second, this works like software update,
so all the updates going

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.940
through the system are free.

00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:59.720
and the last point to point out is that
your app ID and your bundle identifier

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.900
of your previously submitted application
need to match your new binary exactly.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.100
If they do not match,
we're going to reject your binary

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:12.680
back to you and have you correct
that before you can proceed.

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.870
And the last thing to point out
is that you cannot become more

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:17.500
restrictive in your supported devices.

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.990
If version 1 of your application worked
on the iPhone and the iPod touch,

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:26.400
version 1.1 of your application
cannot be an iPhone-only application.

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.590
That's what we call a
bad customer experience.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.790
The process to update your app
binary is you're going to log

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.490
in to iTunes Connect and click
on the Manage Content module.

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.890
For every application that you
currently have that is live,

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.220
you'll have an update link.

00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.960
When you click on that link,
we are going to ask you for

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:45.680
four pieces of information.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.050
The first is export compliance,
because you're moving a new binary to us.

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.920
The second are your release notes.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.340
This is the text that will be
displayed to the user in the

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:59.830
App Store and within iTunes,
explaining why they're getting an update.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.900
For each language that you have
chosen to localize your marketing

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.110
message in within the App Store,
we will allow you to provide

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.420
release notes in that language.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.330
Next,
we're going to need your new version

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.100
number and then your new binary.

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.730
I should point out,
this update is going to go

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.460
through the same process as your
original application submission.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.200
This time,
when you receive an email notification,

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.790
assuming issues were not
found with your update,

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.660
your update will now become
live within the App Store.

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:33.440
This means that new customers now
purchasing your application are going to

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.590
receive the new version of your binary.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.250
Likewise,
users that have previously purchased

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.420
your application will now be
the next time the App Store or

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.620
iTunes phone's home for updates,
your update will appear there.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.810
We will always offer the
latest update to a user,

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:53.980
meaning if I purchased a 1.0
version of an application,

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.560
and since then you've
come out with a 1.1,

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:01.380
a 1.2, and a 1.3,
when the App Store phone's home,

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:07.810
I will be offered the 1.3 version of your
application within the update process.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:15.260
So let's now look at how you can
get ready for the App Store today.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:19.440
First step is if you
haven't already done so,

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:23.430
you're going to want to apply to
the paid iPhone developer program.

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:29.580
Second step is you're going to want to
make sure that your administrator logs

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.200
into the iPhone developer program portal.

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:35.950
They're going to follow
the link to iTunes Connect.

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.640
If you're interested in
commercial distribution,

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.580
you want to get that signed paid
application contract going as well

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.690
as get all the other information
submitted to us so we can start

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:47.850
the setup process on our side.

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:52.290
And the last step that you should
get started on today to get ready

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:55.410
for the App Store is to submit all
the metadata about your application.

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:58.360
Start that process going today.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:03.480
In summary,
the App Store will be an amazing

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.870
experience for users to find
and discover great applications

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.520
that they can't live without.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.080
your applications.

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:17.900
Because for you, the App Store is an
incredible experience.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.720
Or incredible opportunity.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.460
And experience.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.930
For you to leverage Apple's
infrastructure for distribution,

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:27.740
installation, and updates.

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:32.280
For you to reach iPhone and iPod
touch users in 62 countries.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.300
And for you to use simple and intuitive
tools to manage your content and

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.310
your presence within the App Store.

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:45.430
So, early July,
the train is leaving the station.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.080
actually trains a bad metaphor.

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.130
The roller coaster is
leaving the station.

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:56.210
Early July, we want each and every
one of you to be on board,

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.070
strapped in, and ready for the ride.

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.330
So to get more information,
as mentioned before, the user guide,

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.680
iTunes Connect, manage your content,
makes for great bedtime reading.

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:10.900
If you're interested in
commercial distribution,

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.840
download a PDF copy of the
paid applications contract

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.190
from iTunes Connect.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:18.100
Also makes for great bedtime reading.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.980
Last up are the labs,
located on the first level,

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.870
operating Wednesday and
Thursday from noon until 6:00

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:28.220
and Friday from noon until 4:00.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.300
App Store experts are on hand
to answer any questions you

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.180
have about the App Store.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:36.660
Go into anything covered in this
presentation in more detail.

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:39.280
We're not doing QA within this session,
so if you have questions,

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:42.130
I highly encourage you
to go to the App Store.

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:45.060
and last up are the related sessions.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.640
This morning was the iPhone application
development fundamentals at 9:00 a.m.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.040
If you slept in and missed it,
at the conclusion of the conference,

01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:56.980
certain sessions will be
posted online for attendees.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.170
Tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.050
is the iPhone application user interface
design and tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:04.000
is internationalizing your software.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.110
And with that,
I'd like to say thank you for

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.360
coming and have a good week.
