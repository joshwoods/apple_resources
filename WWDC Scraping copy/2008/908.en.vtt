WEBVTT

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.800
All righty.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.040
So welcome to the -- there we go.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.100
Welcome to the client management session.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.740
So here we'll cover managed desktop,
system imaging and Apple Remote Desktop.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.630
I'm Juussi Mantere.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.240
I'm one of the engineering
managers in the team.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.180
And the agenda for today,
we'll go over Apple Remote Desktop.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.860
We'll cover client deployment
using system image utility.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.110
And we'll talk briefly about client
managed desktop and go over external

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.800
accounts and we'll wrap it up with Q&A.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.210
So let's get started.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.650
So what this really is,
this is a tool chest inventory.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.090
So what are the tools at your disposal
for either getting systems onto your

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.080
users' desktops or how to manage
them long-term either actively or

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.300
passively and how to provide mobility
or portability for your users' accounts?

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.000
What are the tools?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.640
We have Apple Remote Desktop,
we have system imaging, server admin,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.050
record manager,
all these tools at our disposal.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.220
But really the key thing is the user.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.020
So we use these tools to
make the user's life easier.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.560
So either getting them the
management support they need or

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.620
getting them the inventory reports
that your management wants,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.170
but still the key is the use of
the desktop that they're using and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.540
how to make that the best desktop
possible for their particular purpose.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340
And we've had sessions like
this in the previous years.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.940
So last year we did a session on client
management on Apple Remote Desktop.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.180
So please log on to IDC on iTunes.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.040
And on iTunes we have videos
of previous year's sessions.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.920
So we're not gonna go into depth
on all of these technologies,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.020
but if you are interested in
more in detail look at these.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.990
Please review the sessions from
last year and they're available

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.980
for free on IDC on iTunes.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380
And could we start the clock please?

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.270
Yay, I just gained five minutes.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.140
First, we'll cover Apple Remote Desktop.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.730
So let me introduce Mark Whitemore,
who is the engineering manager

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.000
for Apple Remote Desktop.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.400
and welcome.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.340
I'm going to give you a brief overview of
the features of Apple Remote Desktop and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.120
talk about where we are right
now with version 3.2 and what's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.280
coming up next with Snow Leopard.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.240
So let's start off and talk
about software distribution.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.440
So we have a feature
called Install Package,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.140
lets you install
packages on your clients.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.260
We have a feature called Auto Install,
which allows you to install packages

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.420
on machines that are both on the
network and off the network using

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.870
a server that's always on that will
be able to contact those systems.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.720
We have -- I'm going to talk
a little bit more about that

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.740
in detail in just a moment.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.370
We also have a File Copy command
and Delete Files.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.310
So digging a little bit
more into Auto Install.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.030
So the scenario here is you have
machines that are both on the network

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.360
and off the network and you need
to get packages installed onto them.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.270
And the best way to do this is to
have a server that's -- a machine

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.340
that's going to act as a server
for you that's always running.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.270
And you install another copy of
Remote Desktop onto that machine.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.840
and you configure your
administrator to use that.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.330
We call that a task server and you
configure your administrator to use

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.040
that machine as your task server.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.710
And you select your package on your
administrator and it delegates that

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.110
package over to the task server to
complete the installation for it,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.010
copies the package over there and
the task server then contacts all the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.030
clients and installs the package on all
the clients that are currently online.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.960
If you have a machine that's
offline like this MacBook Pro,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.430
once that machine comes online,
it's going to contact the task server

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.410
and then the package is going to get
installed on that machine as well.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.590
Let's talk about the
asset management features.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.100
We have software reports,
hardware reports,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.600
application usage reports,
and user history reports.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.340
And you can run these reports on all
machines that are online at any time.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.920
And you can also,
by setting a report cache

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.740
generation policy on your clients,
have these reports generated

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.740
on a regular basis and uploaded
to a task server machine,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.980
just like what I talked about
a moment ago with auto install.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.000
You can also export the data into a
tab format or a cum-delimited file.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.670
And we also have a remote spotlight
search feature that allows you

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.710
to search the spotlight databases
on all your client machines.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.210
So let's talk a little bit more about
how the offline reporting works.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.980
So just like with auto install,
it's best if you have a machine

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.140
that's going to act as a server and
it's going to be on all the time

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.140
and you install another copy of
your remote desktop on that machine.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.570
You don't have to have the admin running,
you just have to have

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.860
the software installed.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.570
Then you configure your admin
console to use that task server.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.500
Then you set a reporting policy for all
your clients so that they'll generate

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.900
these report caches on a regular basis
and upload them up to the task server.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.800
Once those reports are
on the task server,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.630
your admin can then run its reports and
it'll get the report data from the admin.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.090
The advantage of setting up this
offline reporting is that even if

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.200
one of your clients is offline,
you can still get reports.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.300
Let's talk about the remote
administration features.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.860
So we have a send Unix command so you can
send Unix commands or Unix scripts to all

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.440
your machines and get the results back.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.540
We have a set startup disk that allows
you to set the startup disk to a

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.300
local volume or to a network volume.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.950
We have various system control features.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.860
You can sleep, wake, restart,
shut down a machine, empty the trash,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.440
lock and unlock the screens.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.030
We have some user control features
that allow you to log out users or open

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.460
files for them or open applications.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.550
And we also have a lights out management
feature for X servers that support

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.820
this that allow you to restart,
power on or shut down a machine

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.060
regardless of the OS state.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.480
So even if the machine
is kernel panicked,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.130
you can still restart it.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.870
So let's talk about remote assistance.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.340
You can observe or
control a remote screen.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.010
You can also observe many
screens at once in a single view.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.000
You can share your screen out
to a number of other machines.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.860
We have a guest access mode that allows
the end user to either allow or deny a

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.230
control request from an administrator.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.260
We have a full screen mode so you
can see the other user's machine

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.060
on full screen on your machine.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.830
We have a curtain mode that blocks
anyone from seeing what's going on on the

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.160
machine that you're remotely controlling.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.760
You can drag and drop files for
copying using screen control.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.470
And you can also get or
send the pasteboard buffer.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.100
We also have a widget for doing
remote desktop observation

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.800
or screen observation.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.050
And there's an interactive text
messaging client as well for environments

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.920
that aren't appropriate for iChat.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.100
Let's talk about automation.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.830
We have a rich Apple script dictionary,
lots of automator actions,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.780
and just about any management command
in the product can be scheduled.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.690
and lastly all the setup
and configuration features

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.840
for Remote Desktop.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.190
We have task templates so you can
put all your favorite settings for

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.180
your tasks and when you create tasks
later you can easily populate that

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.040
task document with your settings.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.940
We have labels so you can label your
machines much like you would label,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.080
set a label on a file in the finder.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.790
We have user defined list views so
you can create your own list with

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.780
a set of machines from your library
and set what kind of information

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.080
you want to see in that list,
for instance what version of the

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.410
operating system it's running,
how much RAM it's got.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.440
You can also create smart computer
lists that will filter your entire

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.660
library using some of this criteria.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.460
For instance,
create a list that shows you

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.860
all the machines that have
less than one gigabyte of RAM.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.600
And then you can create
groups to organize your,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.790
the tasks that you've created and
the computer lists you've created.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.400
In addition to this,
we have a user mode for the

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.010
Remote Desktop application so
that you can let unprivileged

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.740
users run it and you can restrict
what features they have access to.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.640
We have network scanners for finding
machines on your network for you

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.960
to add to your computer library.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.730
We have directory-based authentication
and a setup assistant that

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.410
allows you to configure some
of the more advanced client-side

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.380
features from the admin console.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.740
So Remote Desktop 3.2
is the current version.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.130
It was released in October of 2007.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.800
It brings Leopard compatibility,
greatly improved screen

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.920
sharing performance,
greatly improved keyboard

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.340
mapping for screen control,
as well as improved

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.600
file copy reliability.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.560
and what's coming up next
is Remote Desktop 3.3.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.900
It's gonna be a free
upgrade to existing users.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.230
And I'm gonna talk about all
the things that we're gonna be

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.520
improving with this version.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.440
So first off is improved management
for offline reporting settings.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.750
And I talked about the offline reporting
settings just a moment ago when I was

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.530
talking about how it's advantageous to
have your clients generate these caches

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.780
and upload them to their task server
so you can do your reports at any time.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.920
So first thing I'm gonna talk
about how things work right now.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.900
On the left side is the preference
pane in Remote Desktop that shows you

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.200
where the settings are for setting
your default reporting policies.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.750
So currently, this is in the same
tab as the task server.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.630
Now the truth of what the
reporting policy is on each

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.330
client is set on the admin.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.250
And what that means is that if you
have a client that is generating a

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:48.780
report that you don't want to do and you
remove the preferences on that client,

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.110
the next time the administrator
that had originally set up that

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.830
policy authenticates to that client,
it's going to push that schedule

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.200
back down again and you're
going to have the same issue.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.390
Now also from your administrator console,
you don't have any visibility

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.100
into what other report policies
other administrators have set up.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.330
So in the next version,
we're going to move the reporting

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.350
settings out of the Task Server tab
and into its own tab so that

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.750
they're a lot more discoverable.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.940
We're going to move the truth of
the offline reporting policy onto

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.500
the client rather than on the admin.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.010
So if you have a client
that is generating reports

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.180
that you don't want it to,
you can delete the preferences and you

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.890
don't have to worry about another rogue
administrator pushing that policy back

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.170
down to the administrator and getting
the reports generated all over again.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.730
and the next thing that we're
going to change is we're going to

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.790
have a single reporting policy.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.000
No longer are we going to have
different reporting policies

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.890
coming from different admins.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.400
We're going to have a single reporting
policy that all administrators

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.470
can view and set the settings on.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.820
So everyone will be able
to see the same policy.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.460
Also,
this is the computer get info window.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.560
You see that you see all
the administrators who can

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.760
manage this machine now.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.380
And not only that,
but you also see who is interested

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.700
in getting these offline reports
loaded up to their task server.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.750
And you see what task server
is associated with each

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800
of these administrators.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.940
So this is all new in 3.3.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:19.090
So the next thing that we're going
to improve is our NAT support.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:26.370
So in the current version,
Remote Desktop only allows,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.070
each machine has to have a unique
IP address and the reason is that

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.000
it hard codes the port that it
communicates to the client on,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:34.780
3283.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.240
So that means that behind a NAT,
currently, you can only have one machine

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.670
for it to the WAN side.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.100
So in the next version,
we're going to allow the administrator

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.920
to have machines with the same
IP address but with different ports.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.340
So now you can configure your NAT router
to port forward to all your machines

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.430
behind it and just with different ports.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.290
So while it's great that you
can now manually configure your

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.600
NAT router and manually enter in
these ports into Remote Desktop,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.320
in some environments it may be even
better to have this happen automatically.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.870
And you can do this if you have
a supported UPnP NAT router and

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.790
you configure a client to register
its network services into a wide

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.970
area of Bonjour Server which
you can configure using Leopard.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:30.120
and when you do that,
the client is going to learn what the

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.060
WAN side of the port is that got opened
up automatically using UPnP and it's

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.990
going to register that information
in the wide area Bonjour server.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.100
Now your Remote Desktop Administrator
using a Bonjour scanner and also looking

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.760
at that same wide area Bonjour server is
going to learn what the wide area dynamic

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.800
port is that was set up and then without
any other additional configuration,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.840
it's going to be able to connect to
that client behind your UPnP NAT router.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:03.880
And it will also as needed,
re-resolve that DNS address,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.800
that wide area Bonjour address so it
will always be able to find that client.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.670
So even if the dynamic
port mapping changes,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:14.390
Remote Desktop will still be able
to re-resolve and find that machine.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.160
So in addition to improving
the offline reporting settings

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.530
and improving our NAT settings,
we're also going to have support for

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.620
managing machines across back to my Mac.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.350
We're going to add support
for IPv6 addresses.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.420
And just like as 3.2 came in Leopard,
3.3 is going to come in Snow Leopard.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.460
So just as a review,
3.2 is the current version.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.390
It's out right now.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.200
3.3 is going to be our next
update with Snow Leopard.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.580
There are more resources
available online at

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.340
www.apple.com/remotedesktop/resources.ht
ml.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:58.070
And we're going to be in the IT lab at
5:00 to answer any additional questions.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.470
So I'll hand it back to Juussi.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.200
Good job.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.020
All right, thank you, Mark.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.080
So next topic, system imaging.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.040
So how do you get these clients
that you want to manage with ARD,

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.600
how do you get them
onto people's desktops?

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.280
So system imaging,
what do you use it for?

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.020
Basically,
whatever source you have to create

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.120
images from either DVD or user volume,
you use system image utility to

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.320
create master images out of those,
either install sets or

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.060
volume restore sets.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.030
And then with server admin,
you have the tools that you

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.600
can deploy these images with.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.840
So this, and you can finally customize
content with Package Maker.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.810
So if you have applications that
don't use the Apple installer

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.070
to deploy their packages with,
you have other tools available to you.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.080
So what's new with the system imaging?

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.230
So this covers what we have
new in Leopard or to be

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.880
delivered in Snow Leopard.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.740
So with Mac OS X Leopard,
we basically rewrote the application.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.120
So now the application is
based on automated actions.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.780
So any step that you have
to do to create a image,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.200
either from volume or DVD,
is now an automated action.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.660
So you can use these workflows either
inside system image utility itself,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.380
or you can use these in automated
workflows inside either automated

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.200
application or other applications
that support workflows.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.440
And also, in addition to all these
powerful tools that you have,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.700
we created a image assistant.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.180
So image assistant lets
you create really in one,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.920
two step,
create images that you can deploy

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.380
without having to customize
or otherwise tweak the images.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.690
So it's really easy to use and
hopefully will let other people who

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:52.860
are not necessarily that technically
savvy create their deployment sets.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.580
And we also added pieces into
server admin where you can now

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.810
monitor the status of either
systems that are installing an

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.660
OS or doing a volume restore,
or you can see which systems

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.340
are currently netbooted.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.160
And for load balancing,
we also added support for

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.220
Exa and read-only volumes.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.360
So this would come in
handy where you have,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.800
let's say multiple Exa's
acting as netboot servers,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.680
and you have Exa and volume
that's backing all the netboot

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.170
images or netinstall images,
but on some Exa's,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.750
those volumes are read-only.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.170
So now we can actually offer netboot,
netinstall images off

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.430
of read-only volumes.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.730
Last but not least,
we now have ASR support inside

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.650
system imaging in Snow Leopard.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.200
So this basically gives you
ASR multicast support or ASR sources

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.620
such as HTTP disk images.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.250
And this is configured
via an automated action.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.500
So let me just give you a brief
look on how the tools look like.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.240
And here's the first thing you'd see
when you launch the system image utility.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.520
So you land in the
Image Creation Assistant.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.620
And here we have just two sources.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.660
One is a volume source.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.500
One is a hard drive.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.000
And you can create either net install
or netboot volumes from either

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:16.500
install disk sets or the volume sets.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.940
And what you can do then with the
workflow action-- so if you actually

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.920
go on to customize these images,
first you can define where

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.640
this image is created from.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.740
So you can pick an installation
type or an image type,

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.340
either netboot or netinstall,
pick where it's created from.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:39.410
And if it's an install volume,
like you have a DVD at hand and you want

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.300
to customize which packages are actually,
by default, delivered to your users,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.130
you can customize the package selection,
either entirely eliminating

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.000
some packages so that they're
not selectable by the user,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
or by changing the default set that the
user would get when they install this.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
So you can either add or delete options,
don't install all the printers,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.930
only install some particular printers,
or don't install all languages.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.980
So that's a very flexible way
to customize the disk set.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.000
And you can also add packages.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.170
So if you do have application
packages such as Remote Desktop or

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.000
other applications that come
bundled as a package model,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
you can add those into your
installation set as well.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.330
And you can also add custom scripts that,
if there isn't a direct way to tweak some

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.000
settings on the systems that you create,
you could use scripting,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
shell scripts or Rubio, Perl, Python,
whatever have you,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.700
to finally lay down the bits that
you exactly need on the target

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.000
systems just the way you'd like them.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
And for netboot images,
if we create those from

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.050
DVDs or DVD sources,
we have to create a

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.000
user account for those,
so we have support for that.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.980
And we can also change some
of the system settings.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.000
So if we need to bind some of the
systems into directory systems,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
we can configure that via the
system configuration settings.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
We can also rename some of the
systems based on their MAC addresses.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:13.040
So if you know that you have 15 machines
and they've all come up as Macintosh 1,

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.000
2, 3, 4, that's not very helpful.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.920
So you could take down the MAC addresses
of the systems and actually call them

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
something that's meaningful to you.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.450
Or if you so choose,
you can just call them the

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:28.000
Final Cut Lab 1-2-3 or 4.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.070
And then...

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:37.720
You can also create installation
sets that effectively could

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.600
wipe out your users hard drives.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.550
So this is for automated installation.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.940
This is useful for lab scenarios.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.190
Like if you have a lab or classroom
that has 50 to 100 machines,

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.200
you'd rather not have to go one by
one to machine and click through

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.100
all the panes for the installation.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.990
But if you know that your target
machines will have some known

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.680
elements such as a named hard drive,
you could fork off the

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.110
installation based on that and say,
well,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:10.320
if I see a hard drive called erase me,
then just go ahead with the installation

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.280
and wipe out the target and lay down
the bits without you having to do

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.040
anything on the machines themselves.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.280
So the next time the systems come up,
they'll actually be booted into the

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.830
installation that you just finished.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.250
and another system deployment or
system configuration setting we

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.290
have is for partition in the disk.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.120
So you may want to change
the disk configuration,

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.060
for example, adding a bootcamp partition
on the target systems.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.330
So you can also-- not only
can you just erase the hard

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.870
drive and lay down new bits,
you can also reconfigure the disks

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.180
into partitions that you'd like to see.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.830
You might have two partitions for
the OS and another partition for

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.660
user data depending on your needs.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.940
And we also support
filtering for the images.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.940
So some images are not
applicable to all Mac clients.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.400
So you might have installed images
that are applicable to only,

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.970
let's say, Mac Pros.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.200
So if you do create a
Final Cut application bundle

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.080
that's an install set,
you may not want to offer

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.140
that to a iMac or MacBook,
but you may want to restrict

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.350
that only into Mac Pros.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.050
And you can also filter the
images based on Mac addresses.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:27.740
So if you know that you're testing an
image that you will deploy down the road,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.500
but you really want to serve it
from your production service,

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.190
you can set the image settings so that
they're only available to particular

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.770
set of machines that you want to
use for your deployment testing.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.730
and finally,
we have a create image where you

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.340
can define where this image will be
stored and what it will be called.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.800
And what's new to Snow Leopard then?

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.610
This is the action where you configure
the ASR multicast restore source.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.700
So either ASR multicast streams
or HTTP images stored on a

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.680
server can be defined here.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.410
And you also have options to
discover the restore sources

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.140
dynamically on the network.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.430
So if you create a disk
image that doesn't have any

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.950
ASR sources defined in it,
the client can discover these sources

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.940
when it's actually on the network.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.500
And you'd send a Bonjour beacon
on the network advertising the

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.440
availability of restore sources.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.250
So if you start up a multicast stream,
the restore image will automatically

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.230
pick that up and you could select
that as your restore source.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.560
So this is new to Snow Leopard
and will be part of the

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.150
Mac OS X Snow Leopard package.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.360
And then Packagemaker.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.740
So this is not necessarily
part of system imaging as such,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:49.550
but quite a few people have not
really used the tool and some people

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.880
don't know what to do with that.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.020
Well,
one interesting thing with Packagemaker

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.190
is the remote source for packages.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.560
So with Packagemaker in Mac OS X Leopard,
you can actually source the

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.310
data payload for your install
images off of a web server.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.150
So imagine that you
create an application,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.630
you create a new installer
that installs the latest,

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:16.200
let's say Firefox or could
be Office or could be CS3.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.300
And you know that, well,
this is up to date for today.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.040
And maybe there's gonna be an update
down the road that you'd want to install,

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.120
but you'd rather not go back to
the initial disk set and have

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.590
to recreate it all from scratch.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.290
So with Packagemaker,
you can actually point to the network

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:36.210
live copy of the installation set and
that would be always kept up to date.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.320
So no matter when you install this,
this system,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.540
you'll always get the latest,
most current version of applications that

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.840
are using the web-based package payloads.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.180
So that's definitely something that
will be useful for deployments.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.920
And, yay, go Packagemaker.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.640
and where you'd actually access
this in system image utility is

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.800
through the add packages action.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.560
So you can add to the
remotely stored packages,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.640
the pointer to that will be contained
in a standard package that you add,

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.240
but then the payload itself will
be carried down at a later stage.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.190
So that's briefly an overview of system
imaging and as I mentioned we went into

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.400
a little bit more detail last year.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:26.090
One new thing that's kind of new to us
is MacBook Airs and wireless Netboot.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.190
So let's see, does this play?

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.540
There we go.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.940
So here we have a MacBook Air.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.580
And actually, here's the MacBook Air.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.950
And what's new with MacBook Air is like,
we can actually do wireless Netboot.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.810
So that's a boot picker on MacBook Air.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.150
So you hold down Option key,
and if your wireless infrastructure

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.060
is configured so that you see Netboot
servers on the wireless network,

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.260
you now get a picker where you can
choose the network you bind it to,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.650
and the Netboot images on your
network will be available there.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.350
So this is no different
than booting a standard Mac.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.700
So if you do have
MacBook Airs on your network,

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.920
and you don't want to have everyone use
the install assistant that comes with it,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:15.400
you can actually serve Netinstall and
Netboot images to your MacBook Air users

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.840
by using the standard OS X server as
long as your network infrastructure

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.970
is configured for wireless use.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.270
So here's actually a server that's,
or a client that's hooked

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.510
up to our demo server.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.730
So this is not smoke and mirrors.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.300
This is actually works.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.040
So MacBook Air wireless Netboot.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.490
That's a first for Apple here.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.250
So, yay.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.820
Let's now go on to a brief demo.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.430
And let me introduce Brian Nesse,
who is the lead engineer

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.030
for System Image Utility.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.210
And if you can go to demo one, please.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.740
and I will be doing a
lot of work on this.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.470
So, real briefly here,
I'm just going to quickly show you SIU.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:11.620
This is, as you see, I already mentioned,
this is the assistant mode

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.880
that you see when you come up.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.240
You get your,
this is an install DVD source.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.350
This is a local hard drive.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.290
You can choose whether you
want to make an install image

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.420
or Netboot image out of it.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.040
Real simple.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.640
Two clicks,
you're basically creating an image.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640
Real simple.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:43.320
But what I'm really up here to show
you is our new little action here.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.630
So when you go to the customize
and get the workflow editor here,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.710
you'll see it basically comes
up and says define image

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.750
source and create image source.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:57.630
What we're going to do is kill this guy,
because we don't want a source per se,

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:04.560
and we're going to drag
in our new action here.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.370
Get expose out of the way.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.600
Let's do that.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.880
Okay,
so we tried to make this real simple.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:25.010
Just click the button to add,
you give it a URL to your server.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:35.030
Give it a somewhat descriptive name
so that you know what you've got.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.660
As Juussi mentioned earlier,
we can also tell it to look for multicast

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.640
streams that are out on your network.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:53.680
And then as before,
you simply run and you've

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.810
got yourself an image.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:02.930
So to show you what you're going
to see on the other end of this,

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.330
and I will quickly go
to server admin here.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.490
You'll see we have a couple of clients
here that are currently booted into our

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:18.120
server showing that they're trying to do
net installs or prepared to be installed.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:24.120
And through the magic of ARD here,
I will go control one of these machines.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:30.120
And so here we are.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:30.120
Going to progress.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.880
So as this is the standard Mac installer,
I'm sure you've all seen it many times.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.340
Just going to select
your target destination.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:47.840
And you'll see here's our new panel
that we've added that supports the

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.660
action previously demoed there.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:59.210
These are some server or some
streams that were added in,

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.120
in the action.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.430
So you see you've got your descriptive
name up here and a little clue down

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.280
here as to what it's pointing to.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:16.200
See we've got a couple of ASR images
or streams here and another image

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.790
that's being served up over HTTP.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.870
We also checked the
ASR multicast browser,

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.500
so let's quickly go and...

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.320
Start up a couple of streams here.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.450
And if you look here,
you'll see them pop up because

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:41.730
it's constantly browsing
and it will find them and

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:50.960
These are basically any streams
that you had out there that you set

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.020
up for this thing to go look for.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.610
And that's basically all
I came to show you today.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.390
So back to Juussi.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.840
All right, thank you, Brian.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.990
So that's what's new and
fresh with system imaging with

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.940
Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.400
So let's then move on to Managed Desktop.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.980
So you've now deployed your systems and
then how do you manage these systems?

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.980
So Managed Desktop, again,
it's a directory-based way of

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:32.600
deploying settings into the systems
that are bound to directory systems.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.340
Managed Desktop is also
used in parent controls.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.670
So if you ever go to
System Preferences and enable,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.620
let's say,
application launch restrictions,

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.260
that functionality is
part of Managed Desktop.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.600
The parent controls is a UI front
end for some of the features that we

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.840
have in both in Workgroup Manager and
then the client side on the OS.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.530
And there have been
releases since Mac OS X too.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:01.240
So in Jaguar,
Jaguar was the first release

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.640
of Mac OS X that had client
management for OS X clients.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.760
With Mac OS X, 10.3, Mac OS X Panther,
we introduced mobile accounts.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.340
And in Mac OS X for Tiger,
new to the platform where preference

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.140
manifests on portable home directories.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.140
And last, with Mac OS X,
Mac OS X5 with Leopard,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.440
we introduced hierarchical
groups and external accounts.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.780
And there were numerous other
features in every single release.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.360
So if you look briefly at the history,
it's like this was the

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.110
original Mac industry,
but now we're going to talk

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.390
about Mac and Mac OS X,
and I'm going to talk

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.710
about Mac and Mac OS X,
and I'm going to talk about

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.160
the Mac and Mac OS X interface.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.120
So let's start with the
Mac and Mac OS X interface.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:52.100
Yeh, how many of you are still using 10.2
or 10.3 clients on your networks?

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.990
For the love of anything that's holy,
please move on because

00:31:59.500 --> 00:34:14.400
[Transcript missing]

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.130
So we did a bunch of
demos last year as well,

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.220
so I implore you to go to the
ADC site and view some of the

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.590
previous sessions from there.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.280
So we're not going to
cover the same crowd.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.220
So what I'm going to show you here
today is using Remote Desktop and

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.350
some of the command line utilities to
actually query the management status

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.480
of some of the systems on the network.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.130
So I have some of the clients
on the network here that I've

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.360
configured for management.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.520
And what I'd want to find out is,
do I have all the active

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.090
management settings live?

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.980
So if I go to Workgroup Manager,
here's my user list.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.350
So I have...

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.640
as soon as work with
management comes back.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:03.330
So I have some users that I know that
should be managed and I also have groups

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.640
that I have done the management through.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.140
So I have this allowed
applications group where we have

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.880
the white listed applications.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.610
So I can see that this seems to
be a user group where they can

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:21.370
only use rudimentary applications,
no access to terminal or system

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:25.240
profiler or anything else
besides your basic four apps.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.550
They can chat, they can send email,
they can browse and they have

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.980
iCal and they probably should
have address book support.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.510
So let's add address book
here just for the heck of it.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.500
and others.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.200
So now they get to use
address book as well.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.000
That's just right.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.740
And this is implemented --
this group is a nested group.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.620
So when we looked at the
members of this group,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:55.390
there are no direct
members of this group.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.010
It only contains another group where
then we have the individual users.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.010
So this is one example
using hierarchical groups.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.780
So then let's go to the client.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.160
And actually,
I have already logged on these clients.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.060
So it seems like everybody's
sitting at their desktops.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.980
So that's fine and great.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.320
And there they are.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.300
But let's see if they're
actually being managed.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.660
So one way to find that out is using
one of the Unix command line tools.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.500
So I could use System Profiler.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:26.170
So let's send a command to the
client and see what comes back.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.560
So I just used the Managed Client
System Profiler module to discover

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.600
what management settings are there.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.080
So apparently I have
some window settings,

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.120
and then I have some
application settings.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.230
But this is really unmanageable.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.020
Let me see if I can roll it up for you.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.420
Nope.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.040
Quick jump to universal access.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:48.720
Enable zooming.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.250
Yes.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.720
There we go.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.080
So this is highly unreadable.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.200
Well, first of all, it's XML.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.440
It's PList,
not meant for human consumption.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.650
So let's see what else
we can do with this.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:08.240
Another Unix command that could be,
so that was using the system profiler

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.400
and the Managed Client module in that.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.400
And mcxquery is another tool for
Managed Desktop where you can query

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.500
either hypothetical scenario where you
know that with this user logging into

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.150
this machine with this work group,
what would the management

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:26.420
settings be for that user?

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.810
So Managed Desktop now has an
option to also query the active

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.180
state with the mcxquery tool.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.640
So let's see what that comes back with.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.240
Well, that's a little bit more readable.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:41.240
So here we have a tab-delimited
list of some of the settings.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.030
So apparently we have family
controls enabled and we have

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.500
some login window settings,
but something's not quite right.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.200
rights.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:56.870
So let's do another query where
we can actually use the plist

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:02.140
output or the non-human consumable
output of a managed client.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.880
So we use the query format for XML.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.030
So we get much more detail
into what keys are being set.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.600
So OK, that's probably something
that could be parsed using

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.220
either Python or Perl or Ruby.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.200
So that could be further processed with,
let's say, an auditing tool.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.260
And here I'm going to use an
auditing tool called defaults.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.810
So this is not recommended
for production use.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.670
So here's just-- oops,
I want to send a Unix command.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:39.820
So what I'm doing here,
so I'm using the MCX query tool and

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:48.950
I'm going to output the management
values into a temporary file.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:22.500
[Transcript missing]

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.880
and actually go to the manage group
that I had and go to preferences.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:32.800
So I can now use the details view
and see that this is actually

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.740
the keys that were managed here.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.690
And one of the keys is family
controls enabled so now I know

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:44.720
which domain I could use.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.570
And now if I go back to
the remote desktop side.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.880
and then run this command.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.510
So I think what I'm doing is trying
to read the managed applications

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.140
list from these three machines.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:03.370
And it turns out that there's no
management active for one of these users,

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:09.400
so this user sitting on Mac Mini 3
doesn't have any management enabled.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.010
And that's kind of curious
because I thought everybody

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:12.780
was a member of the group.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.680
And apparently I just thought that.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.100
What I can do now with Remote Desktop,
I can actually see who

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.400
are these people here.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.720
So that was our Mini 3 system.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.260
Let's not make that so jerky.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.000
So here we go.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.240
So on Mac Mini 3, I have Ms.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.220
Stein there.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.620
And apparently there's something
wrong with the group memberships.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.820
Well, that's at least what I guess first.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.390
So if I look at the groups that are here,
so students is member of

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.990
the applications group,
but apparently Ms.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.660
Stein is not part of the students group.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:49.440
So by using the tools here,
I was able to tell that this particular

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.890
user is not -- is not properly
set for this -- for our setup.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.820
So I'd need to add this person
into our restricted group and

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.560
the life will be good again.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.190
Oops.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.050
Drag.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.090
There.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.220
Save.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:10.450
And that's how you can use like various
tools that we have at our disposal

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.840
using Workgroup Manager to manage,
using Remote Desktop for reporting,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.080
and using the Managed Desktop backend
tools for querying state of management.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.300
And using Unix tools to then report on
those and find anomalous conditions.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.830
So that is the demo for Managed Desktop.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.310
So if you can go back to the slides,
please.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:43.030
And now let me introduce Bruce Gaya,
lead engineer for Managed Desktop,

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.230
and he'll cover portable home directors.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.500
Let's talk about portable
home directories.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.160
Whoops, wrong way.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.000
There we go.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.900
Okay, portable home directories,
mobile accounts, external accounts,

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:05.150
what they're all about is taking
a network account and the whole

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.500
user's home directory and making them
portable so that the user can log

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.510
in and use that home directory when
they're not connected to the network.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.970
Also, when we talk about the account,
all the management of the

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.490
account goes with these users.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:23.490
So this is a good way to manage
a local user as a network user.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:28.580
Mac OS 10.3 Panther was where
we introduced mobile accounts.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.490
At that time,
we had a mobile account with a

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.300
cached account with credentials
so you could log in offline.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.680
But the home directory that
you created locally did not

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.180
synchronize with the network home.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.800
In Mac OS 10.4 Tiger,
we introduced portable home directories

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.160
and that really is all the things of a
mobile account plus home synchronization.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:55.460
So now, in Tiger,
you can create a portable home directory,

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:59.070
take your portable computer,
use it offline, make all sorts of changes

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.340
to your home directory,
come back to the network and

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.370
it will synchronize all the
changes you made locally back up

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.030
to your network home directory.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.130
Starting in Leopard,
we introduced external accounts and more.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.110
An external account is a mobile account,
is a portable home directory,

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:18.310
but instead of living on the
internal disk of a computer,

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.570
it lives on a disk itself.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.080
So the disk itself contains
the account information and it

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.090
contains the home directory.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.330
Now I said and more there
because as we progress from 10.3,

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:31.390
10.4, 10.5,
we've been adding more management

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.700
features so now you can really
control home directory creation

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.590
and synchronization very finely.

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:42.530
So here's some new management
things we put in for portable

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:43.840
home directories in Leopard.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.820
First of all, FileVault.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.340
Starting in Leopard,
you can require that FileVault that

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:55.270
when a user creates a mobile account,
that the home directory will

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.040
be protected by FileVault.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:00.420
FileVault is essentially an
encrypted file system for just

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.120
the user's home directory.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.130
So protect the information in there so
that you can't get in there without an

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.210
account password or a master password.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.930
Starting in Leopard,
the account can now be on an internal

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:17.680
or an external hard disk as well as just
under the users folder of the boot disk.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:23.600
And when it's on an external disk,
we call that an external account.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.780
We added account expiration.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.380
So what this is is that if you
set up mobile accounts across

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.710
your network and you have a
whole bunch of network machines,

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.600
one day a user will come into
machine A and they'll log in and

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.720
because of the management settings
they'll create a PhD there and

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.460
they'll be happy and log off,
sync back to the network.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.040
They come back on another day,
they log into machine B,

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.110
they get another mobile account,
they get the fresh

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.940
information from the network,
they log off,

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.030
they sync back to the network,
they're happy.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.000
They go to another machine,
third day and you can see what happens.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.660
By the end of the week they've got a
mobile account on all these different

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.580
machines and they're taking up resources.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:03.580
So starting in Leopard you can now have
these accounts be reaped and deleted or

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.990
expired after a certain amount of unuse.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:13.850
Okay, we also added MCX and
HomeSync preference manifests.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.620
Okay, now you can actually have quite
a bit of fine-grained control

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.090
over PHG creation and sync.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:22.130
A whole bunch of keys are now exposed
so that you can actually change

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.900
things to your own site requirements.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.060
We added a sync server.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.400
A synchronization server is a process
which runs an OS X server and it

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.660
keeps listening to the FS event queue.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.470
And so you have to think about
how a synchronization works.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.520
How a synchronization works
is there's two big phases.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.100
One is you figure out what's changed
and the second one is you copy stuff.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.160
And it turns out that figuring out
what's changed can usually take

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.490
more time than the data that's
copied because prior to using the

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.820
synchronization server in Tiger,
you had to walk through the entire

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.490
folder hierarchy and do this big
enumerate on the server and locally

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:55.990
to figure out what's changed.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.390
Starting in Leopard,
we used a sync server so this figuring

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:04.310
out what's changed phase is much quicker
and so the entire synchronization

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.090
process is much quicker as well.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.490
Okay, so how do you set this stuff up?

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.460
First of all, run Workgroup Manager.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.500
This is what Workgroup
Manager looks like.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:21.780
You can either select a user group
computer or computer group in Leopard,

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.850
and what you do is you select that,
select this preferences icon,

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.020
select the mobility icon,
and you start going.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:33.460
We get right away to the
mobile account creation pane.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.870
What you have to do here is
simply click this checkbox which

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:40.210
says create mobile account when a
user logs into a network account.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.480
You seem to have lost that,
but we'll let that go.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.340
There it is.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.280
Okay, and once that's checked
and you hit Apply Now,

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.570
then basically this user is set to
create a mobile account when they log in.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.900
We get to the options pane.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.160
This is where you get to
decide if you want to have

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:58.550
the user use FileVault or not.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.710
I've checked it here because I want
all the users on this network because

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.660
I'm managing the guest computer.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.790
I want all the users on the network
when they create a mobile account to

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.740
have it all encrypted with FileVault.

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.690
At the bottom here is where you get
to decide where the home directory is.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.000
The bottom, a pop-up,

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.300
has a couple of states.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.690
I have it set here to
any external volume.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.190
So what I'm doing here is
I'm setting up for having my

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.900
users use external accounts.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.510
So when they log in,
they'll get a dialogue and at

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.950
that time they can present a disk
or attach a disk and they'll be

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:35.580
able to create a mobile account,
a PhD or an external

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.710
account on that disk.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:43.000
One other thing,
you can set synchronization rules.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.260
This is the login and logout sync pane.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.300
And how this works is at the
top you can decide what folders

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.400
are going to be synchronized.

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.730
and at the bottom you can decide
what things inside of those folders,

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.830
which files or folders you
don't want to synchronize.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.000
If you look at the match column there's
a whole bunch of different match types.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.880
This is full path there.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.780
You can say starts with, ends with,
that sort of thing.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:06.980
Also, there's another pane called the
background synchronization pane.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.020
It works the same way.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.420
It has two panes at the top.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.080
You decide what to sync,
and you decide what not to sync.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.780
So there's always a
question which comes up,

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.130
is what should be synchronized?

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:21.170
Synchronization takes time,
so you should try to minimize data.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:23.440
The less you synchronize,
the less time your user will

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.580
spend waiting for synchronization,
essentially.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:30.160
There's a user education issue.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.160
If you decide not to
synchronize pictures,

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.980
which should have a capital P there,
you should tell your users so that they

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.300
don't put important data in pictures.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.950
Because if it doesn't synchronize,
it doesn't get replicated

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.110
up onto the network server,
and if they lose that mobile

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:45.690
account or they lose that disk,
they won't get it back.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.930
So while it's good to
reduce what you're syncing,

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:54.600
you also need to tell your users.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.000
What should you sync at
log in and log out sync?

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:00.640
That is designed to
synchronize preferences.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.580
What should you sync during
the background sync or put

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.560
in the background sync set?

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.840
That's designed to sync everything else.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.290
And here's a hint that I'll give you.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:11.290
For Leopard clients, don't put the same
file in both sync sets.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.260
And I'm going to tell you why.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:18.350
You can decide in Leopard when to sync
using the Home Sync Preference Manifest.

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.110
Now, I've loaded all the manifests
here and the one I've selected

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:22.140
here is called Home Sync.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.100
If I selected that and
clicked on the pencil icon,

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.840
I'd come to a dialog
which looks like this.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.940
And this will allow you to set various
keys that decide when things are synced.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.340
The thing I want to point
out here is that in Leopard,

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.680
the log in and log out sync set
and the background sync set can

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.600
actually synchronize at log in,
log out and in the background.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.940
So we found that was a
bit perhaps confusing,

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.200
so I'm going to show you this is the
Leopard version of Workgroup Manager.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:52.140
And we've changed the name.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:54.960
Of the log in and log out sync
set to the preference sync set.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:55.600
That's right up there.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.640
It's now called preference sync.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.120
And we've changed the name
of the background sync set

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:02.440
to be called Home Sync.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:03.360
Right up there.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.490
But more importantly, there's a bunch of
check boxes at the top.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.410
And now you can decide very finely
in Snow Leopard when you want these

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.320
different preferences to sync.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:15.950
Now, I want to point out this
is just an HI change.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.650
Okay, this is just an HI change,
it's not a functional change, okay?

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:23.530
So, Leopard clients and Snow Leopard
clients basically work the same,

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:26.700
but we want a work group manager
to really reflect what is actually

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.490
happening in synchronization.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.200
Okay,
some command line tools of interest.

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:39.000
HomeSync is a little application which
sits inside of managedclient.app.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.190
When you're synchronizing,
actually HomeSync is running.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.450
It has a command line interface.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:47.200
If you call HomeSync -s from the
command line while you're logged in,

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.950
you'll get a HomeSync now right then.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:54.400
But my favorite tool is
called CreateMobileAccount.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.340
And CreateMobileAccount will allow
you to create a mobile account

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.160
and its variations of portable
home directory and an external

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.190
call right from the command line.

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:09.750
Most interesting parameters are the
-h home path and under -h you can

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:13.470
actually specify any path to the home,
which means that you're not limited

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:17.260
to creating the home under /users or
you can create it wherever you want.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.200
Any path will do.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:25.730
Under create mobile account -u you
can specify a sync URL and that's a

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:29.200
URL like afp:// that sort of thing.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.860
And that allows you to have a
mobile account which synchronizes

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:37.200
to not just to its network home,
but perhaps it can synchronize to

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:40.190
another file server completely or a
different spot on the network home.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.810
I was talking to an Active Directory user
site and they wanted to have their

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:49.200
Leopard clients synchronized to a
folder inside their network home.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.770
So if you create it with the
create mobile account tool,

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.200
it will allow you to do that.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.240
Another trick, which you only hear
about at WWDC I think,

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.530
is that if you have an existing loader,
if you have a local account and

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:03.210
you run create mobile account
against that with a sync URL,

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:06.200
you'll actually create a local
account which will synchronize

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.200
against any share or network home.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:17.660
One other fun thing is in Leopard
we support these URLs -afp,

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.200
nfs, smb.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.200
Starting in Leopard we're
going to support the file URL,

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.600
which will allow you to synchronize the
home to somewhere else on the network

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.190
hierarchy and perhaps to another volume.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.170
So I'll let you think about that.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.940
the implications of that.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:34.050
OK, time to do a demo.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:39.300
Okay, I need to go to demo one.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.810
I think it's on, there we go.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.600
Let's start from scratch here.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.950
Close everything.

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.840
I'm going to launch WorkRoute Manager.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:56.460
I have to log in as diradmin.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:08.110
Okay, these are the users and what
I want to do is set it up such

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.690
that one user will create an
external account when they log in.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.060
I'm going to choose John Appleseed,
I'm going to click on Preferences,

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.280
and I'm going to click on Mobility.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:22.960
I get the creation pane
as I showed in my slides.

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.230
Click on always and then create
mobile account when this user logs in.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:26.940
That's fine.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.010
With default sync settings.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:28.900
That's great.

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.770
Under options, there's the options pane.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.900
I click there.

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:33.830
Click on always.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:38.170
It's going to encrypt
this home with FileVault.

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:43.870
And down at the bottom I'm going to
say user chooses any external volume.

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:45.840
and just say apply now.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.740
That's pretty much done,
but I want to set up some

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.480
other rules just for this demo.

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:52.460
So let's go to the sync rules.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.300
And this is Snow Leopard.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.260
So what I'm going to do is say always.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.330
And for the preference sync,
I'm going to say don't

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:02.260
sync it log in and log out.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.520
Just in the background and manually.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.600
And I'm going to do the
same thing for whole sync.

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:06.940
Click on always.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:08.480
Unclink these two.

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.180
So sync in the background
and sync manually.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.970
So apply now.

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.870
Okay, that's all there is to it.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:15.640
This user setup.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:19.710
So now I'm going to go
over to demo number four.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.860
Did you get it?

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:24.600
Oh, Brian's MacBook Air.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.550
Yes, that's it.

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:27.600
I need to log out.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.700
and we see we're at login window.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.760
And by the way,
these things that say network

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.220
accounts available and the
title are coming from managed

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:44.510
preferences using the guest record.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:50.280
So I'm going to click on other and log
in as that user who is John Appleseed.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.140
There we go.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.880
And this is the dialogue you get.

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.900
Create a mobile account with
a portable home directory.

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.700
But here it says no volumes attached.

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:12.060
So I happen to have a
USB 2.0 volume here.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.660
It's formatted with HFS+
and all I do is connect it,

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.970
which can be easier said than done.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.980
There we go.

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.370
And as soon as that disk spins up.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:42.120
and I'm going to just click
Create Now and it starts

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.700
creating the File Vault Home.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.270
File Vault is very important,
especially on an external

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:54.180
account because if that disk
falls into someone else's hands,

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.340
it's very easy to get all
the files off that disk.

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.840
You just sort of turn off
ownership and anybody can read it.

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:05.770
So I would recommend using File Vault on
basically all portable home directories

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:08.090
and especially on all external accounts.

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.680
Yes, we go, and we're done with
the FileVault creation,

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:25.290
and now we're starting a synchronization.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.960
And this is -- we'll be taking
the stuff off the server,

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.300
the user's network home,
and copying it down to this MacBook Air,

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:39.430
and specifically to this disk,
which is sitting right there.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:42.290
And by the way, the network is wireless.

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.540
and the rest of the team.

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.300
Okay, the sync is complete.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.020
And now we are logged in.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.200
We see this user is here
and what do you know,

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.180
he has the desktop and
the home directory.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.280
Now let's make sure that
the home is where I think.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.800
So I select the home.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.790
There's the home.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.930
You see it's file vaulted there.

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.910
If I get info on that and you read here,
it will say it's located

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.810
on volumes Aristophanes.

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:14.340
If I look on this external volume here,
Aristophanes,

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.780
I see there's a folder called users.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:20.490
And inside of users,
open that and there is the home.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.700
John Appleseed.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.160
It's actually on this disk.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.190
Now if I take this user and try
to drag him to the eject it,

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:27.920
that's actually prevented.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.640
So that's a good thing, right?

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.940
So now I'm going to log out.

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:35.790
And once the log out is complete,
the account and the home I just

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.230
created will be right on that disk.

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:39.240
File vault has to run.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.100
Now one thing I want to
mention is you didn't see any

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.320
log in and log out sync here.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.240
You didn't see a log out sync.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.280
And that's because I turned
it off in Workgroup Manager.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:50.670
So, let's return to the login window.

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:53.640
There we go.

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.380
And there's my new user, John Appleseed.

00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:01.590
I'm going to disconnect
him from this machine now.

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.700
Disappears from that machine.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.330
And let's go over to demo B.

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:08.060
You got that?

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:08.600
Yes.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.720
Okay.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.250
I have a USB connector and I'm going
to connect this up here like this.

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.020
There we go.

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:22.700
There's John Appleseed.

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.760
Okay.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.640
So let's, thank you.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.730
Now I can log in using
the home right here.

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:38.240
and it should skip the log in
and log out sync that does that.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.690
Here we are again.

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:46.150
Here is Aristophanes users
and there's the home.

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.940
Something I wanted to do to make
it a little more distinctive,

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:51.690
I'm going to give this
user a special picture.

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.980
Let's try that one.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.420
OK, just to show that some
of these things stick.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:00.170
And now I'm going to log out,
get back to login window.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.900
File vault's going to clean up a bit.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:05.490
Again, skipping the login and
logout sync so it's quick.

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:10.650
We get here and there's John Appleseed
and he has his special icon.

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:15.140
And now all I have to do is disconnect
this and I'm off to go use another

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.960
computer with my home right here.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.400
and back to Juussi.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:33.220
- So thank you, Bruce.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:38.490
And that's a brief overview of the
different management options you have

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:43.980
to manage your either Leopard or Tiger,
hopefully not Panther or Jaguar clients.

00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:46.780
There are many ways to
manage these things.

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:50.600
You could use either Remote Desktop,
your Swiss Army knife.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.220
You can use system
imaging to deploy clients,

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:59.440
Managed Desktop to enforce settings
on a directory-based environment.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:05.380
And you have account portability
with mobile and external accounts.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.060
So last year we covered
some of these features.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:14.060
And if you go to the ADC site,
you'll see some of the sessions there.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:17.380
For any further information,
please get in touch with

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.380
our technology evangelist,
Mark Malone,

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.200
or you'll find more information
on Apple's site for all of that.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.340
And if you're interested
in more information,

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.210
please go to the ADC site,
and you'll find more

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.530
information on the OS X server.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.780
There are a bunch of sessions.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:35.600
There was one session earlier today
for portable home directories.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:39.710
So if you missed that,
please log on to ADC once the sessions

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.640
are up and available on iTunes.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.740
So if you're interested in external
accounts and some more detailed view,

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.660
check that session out from this morning.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.340
Upcoming sessions, we have a session,
there is a session tomorrow

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:54.120
for client management.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.880
If you use scripting with ARD or using,
let's say system imaging

01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.110
with Ruby or whatnot,
there are session on that.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:04.300
Directory services,
if you do use managed desktop,

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:09.760
you probably want to know about how
directory services can be troubleshot.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.330
You may have some issues with
Active Directory integration or

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.520
open directory anomalies or whatnot.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:20.680
So this is where you'd actually get
some tools for your environment.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.180
And there's a panel on
Friday for OS X administration.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.840
So if you're interested in that,
that's one to attend.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.280
And we have a bunch of
labs lined up as well.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.680
Right after this session,
there's an Apple Remote Desktop Lab at

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.610
the IT Lab.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.800
All these sessions are at the IT Lab.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.900
Directory services,
we have two labs for those,

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.690
one on Wednesday and another one Friday.

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:47.300
For Mac administration lab,
there's one on Thursday in the morning.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.830
And for client management,
there's another lab

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:52.270
on Thursday afternoon.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.820
So with that,
that concludes our presentation.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.170
And we move on to the Q&A portion.
