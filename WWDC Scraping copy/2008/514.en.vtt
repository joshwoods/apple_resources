WEBVTT

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.300
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.600
My name's Dave O'Rourke.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.240
We're here to talk about what's
new for Podcast Producer,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.440
or if you prefer the wrong slide,
the Podcast Producer overview.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.780
This is your choice.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.240
I'm gonna let the final
people get their seats,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.040
and then we'll get started.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.740
Um, I'm really excited to be here
today because I get to do

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.360
something we so rarely get to do.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.520
I get to talk about Apple's future plans.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.220
So we have a real simple agenda for those
of you that want to follow along at home.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.480
We're going to go a little
bit over podcasting.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.090
Some of you are new.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.300
Some of you might not have heard of it.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.590
We'll talk a little bit
about what podcasting is,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.720
where we think it is,
and essentially a brief

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.840
state of the union.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.330
We're going to be talking about what
the existing product is for Leopard.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.090
I heard some outlandish
statistics about how many people

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.720
in the audience might be new.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.010
So for those of you who are not
yet familiar with Podcast Producer,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.500
you'll find this section
very interesting.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.410
And for those of you who do
know what Podcast Producer is,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.390
you can check your email.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.640
Then we'll talk about
why you're all here,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.180
probably,
which is to preview what's coming.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.300
And we'll go over a brief summary
so that you don't forget any of

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.710
the morsels of information I've
shared with you this morning.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.620
And we'll have Q&A at
the end of the session.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.720
Oh,
why am I looking behind me constantly?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.900
So, video and audio podcasting has
been taking the world by storm.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.280
My wife lives on podcasting.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.080
Anyone listen to Physics for
Future Presidents from UC Berkeley?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.200
My wife can't get enough of podcasting,
and I've heard from iPod sales

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.950
and other things that there's
other people like my wife.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.990
There's a broad range of topics.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.290
You can listen to Physics for
Future Presidents from UC Berkeley,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.900
or you can listen to World of Warcraft,
The Instance, every week to get your

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.980
latest fix on the game.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.840
Podcasting subscription rates are
going through the absolute roof.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.990
The download stuff,
the bandwidth consume,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.830
all of it's just up and to the right.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.880
We're in the early stages of
adoption of this basic technology,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.070
but people are embracing
it and endorsing it.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.660
This is a chart showing occasional
and weekly subscriptions.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.080
The scale on the left is millions
of podcast subscriptions per week.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.910
This is just phenomenal.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.600
One of the reasons I think podcasting is
so huge is the web took off because one

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.620
person could reach a global audience.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.690
And podcasting has that same dynamic.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.100
One individual at home with a
microphone or a video camera

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.990
can generate a half-hour,
15-minute, 12-minute,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.820
17-minute podcast that the
entire world can access.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.320
So podcasting has a global
impact that's just phenomenal.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.170
We showed a chart last year that I wasn't
able to find in time for the presentation

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.090
about the number of subscriptions coming
into the iTunes U Store by geography.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.170
And it's just phenomenal,
just absolutely phenomenal,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.530
worldwide phenomenon.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.830
The other reason people like
podcasting is it has the best features

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.620
of an old technology called VCR.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.680
You can time shift the content.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.440
So people really resonate to podcasts.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.160
They can find the topic
that they want to find.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.680
They can download it.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.350
And they can listen to
it whenever they want.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.800
They can listen to it on the subway.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.600
They can listen to it while
they're riding the bus.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.300
Or they can listen to it
while they're in this session.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.490
But please stop.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.590
So iTunes U has helped facilitate
this particular phenomenon,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.950
and we offer a destination
for universities that they're

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.310
using to get their content out.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.920
We have 64 universities in
six countries posting content,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.780
25 are being on-campus providers,
and 60,000 free audio and video assets.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.840
And that's just today.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.660
I think by next week it'll be like
$600 billion or something like that.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.160
I'm not sure,
but I'm a little fuzzy on the math.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.430
We feel at Apple that
we offer all the pieces.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.540
We offer the devices that people
want to watch the content on,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.880
all the way from an iPod shuffle
or listen to the content,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.080
and all the way up to a MacBook Pro.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.050
Podcasting is not just about the pod.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.090
The pod is the mobile portion of it,
but you've got the phone,

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.810
and you've got people's
notebook computers.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.170
What were the statistics we shared
in Bertrand's Day of the Union,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.980
or I believe it was the number of
students coming on campus with a laptop?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.710
Well, a laptop's just a big iPod,
so you can listen to the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.410
content where you want,
when you want, on the device you want

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.490
to listen to it on.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.840
We have a lot of software
to help you make podcasts.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.980
We have Podcast Capture front
and center in the icon farm here.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.310
But we also have QuickTime,
we have iMovie, and we have GarageBand,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.300
and we have RSS.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.530
We offer all of the software
technology you need to do podcasting.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.180
And we have a portal for you
to distribute your content

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.760
through if you're a university.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.640
So we have all the pieces of
the technology pulled together.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.500
We also have developer
adoption of Podcast Producer,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.070
and podcasting starting to creep
out into non-standard places.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.980
One of the most exciting
developer briefings I got to

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.520
attend this year was Tamberg.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.510
How many people in this room
are familiar with Tamberg?

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.270
There I'm offering integration
with Podcast Producer directly

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.420
out of their content server.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.950
When we sat down and
designed Podcast Producer,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.720
I'm sorry, I didn't think about
video teleconferencing.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.650
But it's a natural application to
take your video assets from your

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.280
captured video teleconferences
and make them a podcast,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.600
or make them an online asset library.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.330
And Tamburg is announcing
support for Podcast Producer,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.040
where you'll be able to directly export
your archived video out of their content

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.160
server to a Podcast Producer workflow.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.950
We've been working with Telestream,
who was here last year,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.880
and they've given us some very
valuable feedback over the year.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.410
And they have Episode Podcast,
which is a product you can go buy today,

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.760
which brings their
codecs to the platform.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.810
So if you want to go to
the legacy standards,

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.060
such as Windows Media and Flash,
you can use their product to

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.320
get your different formats.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.840
We're working with a
number of universities.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.540
Whoops, went too far.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.620
We're working with a
number of universities.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.760
This is not all the universities.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.130
This is just some examples of people
who've been rolling out Podcast Producer.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.980
I know John Hopkins is on here.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.840
They're already using
it for medical things.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.710
The Army, I don't believe,
is listed here, but the Army is using it.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.390
We're working with a number of
institutions to deploy Podcast Producer,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.030
and they're very excited about it,
and they're doing new and

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.820
novel things with it that we
never anticipated being done,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.120
which in my... I've
been at Apple 18 years,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.040
and in my sense,
it's always been gratifying when

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.920
we see customers doing things with
technology we didn't anticipate.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.510
That, to me,
is the key of a successful technology.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.160
But podcasting's still changing.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.960
This is still a
relatively new phenomenon.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.120
We're seeing the growth
curve of a new technology.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.030
For all the growth we're seeing,
the potential's huge,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.460
still absolutely huge.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.500
So that means it's going
to continue to change.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.580
We're still seeing institutions and
individuals learn how to best use it.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.630
Some people started by just
doing slideware on a podcast,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.100
and that works well if you
have an engaging audio track.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.490
It doesn't work so well when you don't.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.240
So people are still best learning
how to use this technology,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.840
and we're going to see innovation in
this space from you guys and from Apple.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.860
And producing a podcast until Leopard
came out was more craft than process.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.840
I mean,
I walked through the steps manually.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.850
My wife's a lecturer.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.860
She lectures at
San Jose State University.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.410
And she said, I want to take my lectures
and make it a podcast.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.370
And before I started
working on Podcast Producer,

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.790
I sat down with her, and she said,
what would I need to do?

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.960
And we spent a day walking
her through the process.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.030
And at the end of the day,
she was very excited,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.900
but didn't have the time to go through
all of the steps to produce a podcast.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.780
And she says, well,
can't you automate this?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.960
And so podcasting requires
merging first-class content,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.950
like lectures my wife gives,
with multiple disciplines

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.180
that my wife lacks.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.370
And Podcast Producer allows
San Jose State University to

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.740
merge their experience with
the disciplines with my wife's

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.890
first-class content for her lectures.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.360
So there's a wealth of tools to capture.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.750
These are some of the tools I showed.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.460
There's Live Capture Tools.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.420
There's Final Cut Pro, iMovie GarageBand.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.140
Third-party utilities are
plentiful and all over the place.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.250
There are multiple
methods for publishing.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.140
This is one of the disciplines
you have to master.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.700
How am I going to publish my content?

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.600
And there's multiple methods
for people to view this content.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.680
This is becoming more.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.530
With RSS and Atom Feeds,
you can use pretty much any

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.320
device to view the content.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.600
And all the pieces of technology exist,
but as I've said, until Leopard came out,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.420
you had no way to automate
and scale this process.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.310
You might be able to produce
one or two podcasts a week,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:54.820
but you certainly can't do that.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.830
I certainly couldn't
produce 50 podcasts an hour.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.300
So with Leopard,
we shipped Podcast Producer.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.620
Podcast Producer fully automates
the ingestion of content,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.370
the processing of that content,
and the publishing of

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.780
that content to the world.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.980
We provided all of the tools you needed.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.620
We provide remote camera capture control.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.220
We provide direct file submission
for those of you using Final Cut or

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.620
iMovie to make your content.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.090
We provide a workflow architecture for
you to standardize the recipe that you

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.950
want your videos to be processed with.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.900
And we use standard server scale
technology because we heard from

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.310
you when deploying this product
that you think a lot of people

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.300
are going to download your stuff.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.430
How do I make sure that I have
the server infrastructure to

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.680
deliver all of the content?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.770
We integrated with the administration
tools so you didn't have to learn

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.560
a different suite of tools to
set and maintain the servers up.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.500
And we made it secure because
we heard from some professors,

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.000
not all professors,
that they didn't want the students

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.060
turning off their lecture in
the middle of the lecture.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.300
So the system's secure end-to-end and
is fully authenticated and authorized.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.840
So an example in action,
and this is the canonical example.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.450
This isn't the only way
to use Podcast Producer,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.030
but it's an example that we
constantly reference internally

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:07.510
as we're designing the product,
is you start with some content.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.550
You launch Podcast Capture,
and you can either pull files

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.600
in from any of the applications,
or you can start a camera,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.180
or you can use the built-in camera on
the Mac that's sitting in front of you,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.600
and you have some content that
you want to publish to the world.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.950
Using Podcast Capture,
you upload that content to

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.960
a Podcast Producer cluster.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.090
This is a machine with a shared
file system and a set of grid

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.400
nodes that will process the
video and execute the workflows.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.740
When it's done processing the video,
that cluster pushes the results

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.140
to another set of servers,
which are going to host the content.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.800
This could be iTunes U.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.240
This could be your email server,
if you're going to send

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.960
email notifications to your
customers or your clientele.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.360
You can have a web server we push to.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.120
You can push to a
QuickTime streaming server.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.480
Or you could just push it to an archive.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.520
We have a lot of people, surprisingly,
using Podcast Producer to

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.340
just take the content in,
process it,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.360
and store it away for future reference.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.020
So you can do anything
you want with a workflow,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.800
but it goes from the content ingestion
point to being processed by the cluster,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.880
and then out to other
servers to host the content.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.660
And ultimately,
you're publishing that content so that

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.450
people can consume the content on the
devices that they want to watch it on.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.140
So this is the canonical example
that we constantly reference at

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.630
Apple as we're designing the product.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.420
But you can be very
creative with this model.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.660
But it is take the content,
process it on the cluster,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.460
publish it to the servers.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.470
And then people watch it where they want,
when they want.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.110
But that's all dry.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.870
So at this point in time,
I'd like to invite my

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.540
coworker up on stage,
Shel Bronder.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.700
And he's going to give you an actual
live demo of the existing product.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.580
Thank you, Shel.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.900
Good morning.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:46.950
Good morning.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.980
So I'm going to show you how easy it is.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.330
So I'm going to pretend to be
Devo's wife and show you how

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.290
easy Podcast Producer makes it.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.440
So let's launch Podcast Capture here.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.650
I'm going to log into the
Podcast Producer server here.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.850
So I'm just going to type in my password.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.550
So now I'm at the screen where
I get to choose what kind

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.360
of podcast I'm going to do.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.890
So today,
I'm going to do a little keynote

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.740
with some audio on top of it.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.500
So I'm just going to
prep my keynote here.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.230
So I've got some slides
that I want to show you.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.580
So let's just get that all ready.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.040
Just use a little mic here.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.160
And now I'm going to select the screen.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
I'll come back to this stage
in a few minutes to show you

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.700
what other choices you have.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.760
And I'm just going to choose
the unknown device here.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.110
And we're going to go for record.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.060
So Podcast Producer is an awesome
end-to-end solution for podcasting.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.300
It allows users to easily capture,
encode to multiple formats,

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.910
and to deliver their content to all
these different kinds of devices.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.780
So there you go.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.250
Now I did my little recording
here back in Podcast Capture.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.240
Pause it using a hotkey.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.480
And now I'm going to publish my
content to the Podcast Producer system.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.690
So all I have to do
here is click Publish.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.670
Here it's going to ask
me for some information.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.960
I'm going to choose the workflow
that I want to submit to.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.260
So today I'm going to demo
the blog in iTunes with Intro,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.670
and I'll explain what this is
doing once I've submitted it.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.520
We'll say this is a Podcast Producer.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.180
We'll put it as a title,
and we'll give it an end-to-end solution.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.090
If I can type.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.530
And so once I've entered
this information,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.960
all the end user has to do is click Done.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.700
The video is now being uploaded
to the Podcast Producer system,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.600
where the system is going to chew on it.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.410
What is going to happen in this workflow?

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.350
In this workflow,
we're going to add an intro video.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.030
We're going to watermark
the main content.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.720
We're going to use the titling
information with my open

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.200
directory information to create
a nice little bumper title.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.670
And then we're going
to add an outro video.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.280
So while this is processing,
I want to come back to the first

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.070
screen we saw in Podcast Capture
and show you the different types

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.580
of podcasts you can create.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.480
So let me just hide Keynote here.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.420
So here in Podcast Capture,
you have the video.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.750
So this allows you to do local
or remote video capturing.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.240
So remote capturing, for example,
is a DV camera that's hooked

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.900
up to a headless Mac Mini.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.080
Your site administrator will have bound
this to the Podcast Producer system

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.540
at the beginning of the year.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.820
And then any professor or any
other user in your institution can

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.660
then remotely start that camera.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.100
So if we had a camera
in the back of the room,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.760
I wouldn't have to go all the way
to the back of the room to start it.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.540
I could just do it from here.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.670
Audio is the same idea.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.290
I can do local remote audio recordings.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.400
File upload.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.350
So this allows me,
if I have some processed

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.210
content that I've already made,
I can just drag and drop it on top of the

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.940
file or in here into the Podcast Capture.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.580
And it'll upload it to the
Podcast Producer system

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.000
that will then chew on it.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.540
And you just saw the screen capture.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.500
So, let's look at the problem.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.800
The one technology that
Podcast Capture leverages is XGrid.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.740
And you can see here in the XGrid admin,
well, our job's already finished now,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.070
but you could follow the different
progress of the job here.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.700
So I'm going to hide this,
and you see that I've gotten an email.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.860
So I'm going to hop over here to-- well,
I did make it on to the stage.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.010
And we've gotten an email here
from the Podcast Producer system.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.070
And I've got a little link
here to the WWC08 blog.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.240
So I'm just going to click here.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.180
And you see that the content
here is already on the system.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.300
So if I click here--

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.240
have a little intro video,
which I'm sure a lot of you

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.270
have come to know and love.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.000
Here's the dynamic titling
that was generated on the

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.230
fly using Quartz Composer.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.600
Producer is an awesome end-to-end
solution for podcasting.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.930
It allows users to easily capture,
encode to multiple formats,

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.500
and to deliver their content to all
these different kinds of devices.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.190
So that's how easy it is.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.040
Thanks, and back to you, David.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.020
Thank you, Kjell.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.890
So for those of you already
familiar with the product,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.540
you already knew that,
but this is for those in

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.670
the audience who are not.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.870
But that's a great demo.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.920
Thank you so much.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.200
So I get a lot of questions about
Podcast Producer software in Leopard,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.170
so this is going to be a
brief decomposition of all the

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.760
elements of Podcast Producer.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.740
The Podcast Producer is
a suite of technologies,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.420
not any one thing, that are deployed in
unison with each other,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.730
that all leverage and support
each other to accomplish the

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.390
goal that you just saw on screen.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.260
So it's both desktop
and server technology.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.500
All the desktop components are
built into Leopard Desktop,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.220
and all the server components
come for free with Leopard Server.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.990
The icons on the screen represent
what I consider the three main

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.220
elements of Podcast Producer.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.730
The icon on the left with
Podcast Capture and the command line

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.150
represent the desktop client tools.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.630
These are the software tools
that you use to submit video

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.260
into the system to be processed.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.940
And I want to emphasize,
Podcast Producer is not just a GUI.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.500
Everything you saw Kjell
do can be scripted with the

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.800
Podcast Command Line tool,
so you could automate this process

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.020
and use CronJobs or other things
to do automatic and unattended

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.270
submission of the video using
the Podcast Command Line tool.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.670
Man podcasts for those of you who
have Unix installed on your laptops,

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.670
and you can see the man page.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.830
The middle element is the server
cluster that represents the

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.780
processing engine of the system.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.230
There's a set of software running
on the server that keeps the whole

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.640
system secure and manages the
grid and manages all the cameras.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.150
And finally, on the left is something
you've all become,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.660
or I mean the right, something you've all
become familiar with,

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.520
which are workflows.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.000
Workflows are the instructions
to the grid about how you want

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.040
your video to be processed and
where you want it to be published.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.610
Take the three combination of
those technology elements and you

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.070
can all produce a podcast in an
automated and scalable fashion.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.890
So a little brief talk about
the desktop technology.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.700
So there is a new faceless
background task on the desktop,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.360
and this is the camera
recording software.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.590
Every time an instructor starts
or stops a remote camera,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.510
this little server or this
little background process is

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.950
listening on the Mac Mini in
the back of the conference room,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.340
and it tells the local camera to
start recording and to stop recording.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.050
This is a new network service
that's built into the desktop,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.500
and it can be configured and uses the
server for all of its instructions.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.820
When it's done, it uploads the finished
video for processing.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.220
One of the things we heard is if
you're going to do lecture capture,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.560
the camera in the back of the room
has to be able to upload one video

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.120
while it's recording another,
and we've designed it to do that

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.490
so that you can have the camera
machine in a lecture room recording

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.510
back-to-back sessions all day long,
and it will just spool all the

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.720
content to the local hard drive
and stream it up to the server for

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.850
uploading and later processing.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.230
It's designed to run on
a low-end headless CPU,

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.040
such as a Mac Mini.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.600
It'll run on a Mac Pro just fine.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.800
If you want to put a Mac Pro in
the back of all your things,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.690
our sales staff would be
perfectly happy to do that.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.740
But it also works on a Mac Mini.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.430
There's the command line tool,
which I spoke of.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.580
This allows you to script or automate
everything you can do in the GUI.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.520
You do not need anything
beyond the command line tool.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.160
We've seen customers actually wrap this
to present a little more customized

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.660
HI for their particular site,
so using Cocoa and stuff.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.910
You can build your own
little custom podcast capture

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.960
application if you want to,
simply by leveraging

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.940
the power of this tool.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.340
And there's the
Podcast Capture application,

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.090
which you just saw Kjell demonstrate.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.990
It allows the four main types of
video capture that we support,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:50.120
the single source remote video,
the audio source, the screen capture,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.350
and the file upload.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.840
There's a server technology to this.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.010
There's a new server process.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.500
What does that server process do?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.710
Well, it talks to all the cameras.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.190
It maintains the access control
list for all the cameras.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.210
It submits all the jobs to the grid,
monitors them for completion,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.900
and it maintains all the
security elements of the system.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.600
The cameras are talking over an
encrypted session to the server.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.070
The server's enforcing access
control so that the biology

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.460
department can't start recording on
the physics department's cameras.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.200
And it just keeps the
whole thing working.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.420
It's the conductor of the system.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.660
It keeps everybody
coordinated and organized.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.390
And there's other Leopard server
technologies that we leverage.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.760
We leverage the wiki to serve RSS feeds.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.430
If you don't have your
own RSS feed server,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.600
you set up the Leopard wiki server,
and that will be your RSS server for you.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.880
You can set up the Leopard
email server to do all that.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.900
You can set up the Leopard email server
to do all of your email notifications.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.890
And you use Xgrid for
all of the scheduling.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.900
Podcast Producer does
require a shared file system.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.060
When you're on the grid,
all of the grid machines

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.330
need access to the video.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.400
We do that via shared file
system rather than slinging the

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.330
13-gigabyte uncompressed one-hour
DV video around over the network.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.100
We put it on a single place so
that everyone has access to it.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:09.000
And the two shared file system
technologies we support are XSAN and NFS.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.740
And we're fully integrated with
Leopard Server Administration,

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.600
so you don't have to learn a new
suite of tools to manage this system.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.320
I do want to talk briefly about Xgrid.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.160
Xgrid is the power behind this system.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.360
Next to workflows,
Xgrid is the most important

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.400
technology in the system.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.840
As I came to realize in
Bertrand's keynote today,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.520
Xgrid really is GCD.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.420
It's Grand Central Dispatch
for the Network.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.240
It allows you to leverage
multiple CPUs in a scalable way.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.140
When pressure is applied to the system,
it...

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.330
Reduces the number of
jobs it's scheduling.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.570
When pressure is relieved on the system,
it increases the number

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.280
of jobs it's scheduling.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.520
And Xgrid's been shipping
now for two years.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.200
I wonder where Bertrand got the idea.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.700
So XGrid is Apple's large-scale
computing architecture.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.700
It's built into Leopard
Server and desktop.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.700
And it can be used to schedule
complex jobs across multiple CPUs,

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.430
complex jobs like podcast
producer workflows.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.640
As the jobs are run,
Xgrid's monitoring what CPUs

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.910
are busy and what CPUs are idle,
and it's constantly trying to keep

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.660
all of the CPUs on your grid busy.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.390
This is a valuable resource
that you've invested in.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.620
You've purchased these
CPUs to process video.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.560
Xgrid guarantees that
they're fully utilized.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.340
Podcast Producer workflows
are X-Grid jobs,

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.760
nothing more, nothing less.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.410
They're just a very specifically
tailored job that processes video.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.780
So Podcast Producer workflows inherently
scale because there is no such

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.560
thing as a non-grid-based workflow.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.740
All workflows are a grid,
even if you only have one XGrid

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.730
node running on your system.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.270
If you add a second node,
without even restarting the job,

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.160
XGrid will schedule the next
task on an available CPU.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.680
So we are very confident
that Podcast Producer can

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.810
scale for your needs,
and one of the things that

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.280
gives us that confidence is the
fact that we're based on XGrid,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.190
a two-year-old technology that we've been
shipping through two major OS releases,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.370
and it's proven very effective for us.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.180
Workflows.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.480
Workflows are the DNA of the system.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.360
The workflow that Kjell
demonstrated had instructions.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.090
Add an intro video, add a watermark,
add an exit video, do a title, encode,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.840
publish to the web.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.390
That had to be coded into a set
of instructions that the grid ran.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.700
So workflows are scripts and descriptions
of what you want done with your video,

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.710
and this is how you
automate your processing.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.730
As I've said,
workflows are X-Grid job templates.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.380
The simplest concept you can think of
is it's an X-Grid job template with

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.030
the file name left for the last moment,
and we just substitute the file name.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.460
It's actually more complicated than that,
but that works for the presentation.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.080
And Xgrid jobs are scripts that
define a set of command line tools.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.360
What's really impressive about
Xgrid is Xgrid can run any Unix

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.100
command line tool or script.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.020
If you want to run grep
as part of your Xgrid job,

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:01.760
you can.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.660
If you want to run ls as
part of your Xgrid job,

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.220
you can.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.330
So Xgrid isn't anything special.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.560
It's just a way of running a series
of Unix command line tools on a grid.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.200
So this makes
Podcast Producer enormously flexible.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.660
It can be customized to meet your needs.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.260
You can either purchase software
from third parties or provide

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.160
tools that do things for you,
or you can write your own tools and

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.510
make them part of your workflows because
XGrid can run any tool Mac OS X can run.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.900
They can be composed
using any text editor,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.610
using XML syntax like shell scripts.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.320
And what we do is leverage
Mac OS X technologies like

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.400
QuickTime and Quartz Composer
to do the video processing.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.730
So this makes our video processing
platform very powerful and very flexible.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.360
So, and because they're just Xgrid tools,
and Xgrid only can run any

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.890
Unix command line tool,
you can publish to any source you want.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.380
You don't have to publish to iTunes U.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.120
You can publish to your
own internal website.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.210
If you can come up with a Unix
shell script that knows how to

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.490
post to your custom web server,
you can add it to the workflow and

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.740
make that part of the workflow.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.460
We provide support for HTTP, podcasting,
QTSS.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.600
But you can publish content
to any host you want.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.860
All you have to do is write a
command line tool or script,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.200
and then make that command line tool
and script part of your workflow,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.280
and it will publish to
your custom hosting site.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.200
So virtually any shell script can
easily be turned into an XGrid job,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.000
and therefore a
Podcast Producer workflow.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.520
So if you can script on Unix,
you can use Podcast Producer.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.740
Now, if we just took the core set
of Unix command line tools,

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.980
what was missing before Leopard was
a set of tools to process video.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.860
So one of the things
Podcast Producer added is a new

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.220
suite of command line tools that
wrap the QuickTime APIs to do video

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.840
processing as a batch process.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.170
So some of the editing tools we
provide are listed here on my left.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.570
Merge and Join allows you to take
two separate QuickTime movies

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.030
and make them one movie.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.180
Title allows you to add a
title to the QuickTime movie.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.150
Watermark adds a watermark.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.300
QC Effect can apply any Quartz Composer
composition that you can conceive of.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.460
Trim and Split allows you to shorten
the video and split it into two.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.770
Extract a track.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.990
If you have an audio
track and a video track,

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.890
you can use the Extract Track command
to just extract the audio track and

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.970
make that a separate file that you
post to your audio-only customers.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.270
Delete track.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.470
Delete a track.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.320
And you can add a track.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.800
So if you have a second audio track
that you want to add to the video,

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.330
you can use Add Track to add the track.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.920
The next set of tools we provided
that QuickTime did... that we didn't

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.400
have command line alternatives for
is to annotate a QuickTime video.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.070
This is adding metadata
to the QuickTime file.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.060
Set the poster frame so that the right
title screen shows up for the single

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.740
frame preview that your customers
are going to see on your website.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.720
And encode for various destinations.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.780
This is the powerful tool that allows
you to encode for all of the different

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.150
types of devices that your customers
are going to want to view your data on.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.670
We provide a set of publishing tools that
make it easy to publish to a group blog,

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.200
the QuickTime streaming server, iTunes U,
email, iTunes podcast.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.000
I want to emphasize these tools
are just the tools we've provided.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.330
You can write your own tools
and use them in any workflow.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.030
And we provide a set of utility tools.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.440
We provide a pre-flight script,
a post-flight script,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.090
and an archive command which will copy
the resulting files to a dedicated

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.040
file system for archival purposes.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.480
And I'm excited today to
announce a new feature that

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.040
we're already shipping in 10.5.3.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.030
We've added a new tool for posting to
user blogs and not just group blogs.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.990
So we're going to continue
to fill out this tool supply.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.500
We've been doing this with
Google Suite over the years.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.500
And with third-party
help and Apple's help,

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.000
this will become a richer and more
powerful set of workflow tools as you

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.470
deploy and leverage Podcast Producer.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:45.690
We've also published a workflow
tutorial that walks you through a very

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:49.490
impressive demo from soup to nuts of
how to write a workflow from scratch.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.980
This is available for download
right now at that link.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.960
And this is a detailed
-- how many pages is it,

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.660
Shell?

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.360
120-page detailed description on
how to write your own workflows.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.040
And the workflow itself is
quite impressive and useful.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.660
So it's not a mythical example
that we came up with a workflow.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.380
It's an actual workflow that we had
customers tell us they wanted to see.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.300
We provided that as an example,
and we provided a thorough

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.500
decomposition to train you how
to write your own workflows.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.440
So we feel Podcast Producer is
as much as you need.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.240
It's designed to be modular
in scale because it's based on

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.830
scalable technologies from day one.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.840
We leverage technologies
like XSAN and XGrid,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.600
so you can build clusters of
CPUs that work as a single unit

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.930
to process all of your videos.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.960
So scaling your system is
as easy as buying a new CPU,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.430
or if you run out of hard disk space,
adding a hard drive.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.090
So you can start small and go big.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.640
So architecturally,
we can run on a single dedicated CPU.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.020
We actually test on a Mac Mini just in
our cubes with little 15-second videos.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.120
This whole system can run on a Mac Mini.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.120
I wouldn't want to run 50
videos through a Mac Mini,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.280
but you can test the
system for functionality.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.400
And it can be configured to have
some or all of its elements running

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.260
on the same CPU or different CPUs.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.330
If you want dedicated functionality,
you can have the Podcast Producer server

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.220
running on one CPU,
the XGrid server running on another,

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.500
your mail server running on another,
your file server running on a different.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.960
You can just factor this
out as much as you want.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.810
So you can start from this,
which we consider a relatively

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.110
small Podcast Producer system,
and scale all the way up to this.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.720
If you want to talk to our sales
team about purchasing this,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.610
they'll be very excited.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:30.390
So in summation, the existing Leopard
Podcast Producer system we feel is

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.890
an enormously powerful solution.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.550
It can scale to meet all of your needs.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.230
You can go from processing two or
three videos a week to processing

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.890
two or three videos an hour,
all the way up to 50

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.770
or 60 videos an hour.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.170
We leverage Xgrid and the power
of Mac OS X to do all of the work.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.500
So there's a third-party developer
opportunity here to deliver new

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.580
and novel tools that are going
to be used as part of a workflow.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.770
And this also means you're not limited
to the workflow tool set that we provide.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.660
You're only limited by what you
could implement on top of Unix.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.550
We use QuickTime and Course Composer,
which offer what we feel is

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.050
the industry's most powerful
video editing platform.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.610
The combination of these two
technologies are fantastic.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.190
And Leopard Desktop and
Server is all you need.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.840
10.5.3 has some exciting new features.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.940
We've introduced a new
user blog posting tool,

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.620
and we've introduced a
new workflow tutorial,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.340
and we're going to continue to work
with customers and enhance the product.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.660
But I don't think all of you
were in the audience to hear

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.900
that particular presentation.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.130
So we're now going to talk about
what I'm very excited to talk about,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.130
which is the new stuff.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.200
So the first thing I'd like
to announce is that we'll be

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.880
shipping Podcast Producer 2
with Snow Leopard Server.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.360
We've addressed a lot
of customer feedback.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:45.120
Some of this you saw on Monday's session,
since Kazu stole my thunder.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.490
Thank you, Kazu.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.680
And the top feature for
Podcast Producer 2 are these seven icons,

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.290
which I'm going to go over one by one.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.600
The first feature is one
that's been highly requested,

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.150
which is the ability to
record two sources at once.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.540
We've received a lot of
requests for this feature.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.600
We will support recording from a
remote camera and a local screen,

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.260
all from Podcast Capture.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.940
So my wife will be able to start the
camera in the back of the room and start

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.230
recording her keynotes simultaneously.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.250
That will all go into a workflow,
and we'll composite it into

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.040
a picture-in-picture video.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.260
This allows for lecture-style
presentations results

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.900
in the final podcast.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.800
And you can use Quartz Composer
to design your screen layout,

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.150
and we will, of course,
provide some sample Quartz Composer

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.890
templates for what we feel are common
picture-in-picture delivery formats.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.700
So some sample screens of how this
is going to look in Podcast Capture.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.040
We've replaced the file upload
button in the lower right corner

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.300
with a dual source screen.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.480
So my wife will just click
on the dual source screen.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.760
She will then pick the
two sources of video.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.870
The one will be the lecture
camera in the back of the room,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.050
and the right one will be the
desktop that she's currently

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.380
presenting on from Keynote.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.190
And all of that will be recorded,
unified, and turned into a single video

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.080
by a Podcast Producer workflow.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.120
So to graphically demonstrate this,
two sources, a Mac Mini in the back of

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.880
the room with a camera and a
PowerBook with a presentation on it.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.060
Start both of those recording
with Podcast Capture.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.060
When she's done recording,
Podcast Capture will

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.120
upload it to the grid.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.990
The grid will process the video,
and out will come a movie file that can

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:27.560
be played back in QuickTime Player with
a picture-in-picture presentation.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.400
Again, I want to emphasize,
this particular format of a

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.060
thing is just one sample thing
you can do with CourseMaker.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.720
You could do anything you want
with these two video sources by

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.180
coding your own custom workflow.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.440
The next thing is the second most
requested feature that we're going

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.400
to provide for Podcast Producer.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.190
And that is a
Podcast Producer workflow editor.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.430
How many people just love XML?

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.760
So workflows, if you haven't gotten
this point by this time,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.930
workflows are powerful and complex tools.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.940
You can do anything Unix is capable
of with a Podcast Producer workflow.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.490
So there's infinite freedom to compose
a workflow that meets your custom needs.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.280
This is one of the reasons we
feel our product is so compelling.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.220
We know there's no limits built into it.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.410
However,
with power comes responsibility and,

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.980
for programmers, debugging.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:26.820
So XGrid workflows are
specified using XML syntax.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.820
Computers love the XML syntax.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:29.610
It's easy to parse.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.100
It's fast.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.940
It's unambiguous.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.960
It's all the goodness that
a computer programmer loves.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:39.900
But XGrid jobs are also parallel,
and not a lot.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.380
As you heard us talk about multicore,
not all programmers and not all people

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.400
who can script can think in parallel.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.820
So XGrid job descriptions require
mastering two technologies.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.470
They require understanding XML,
and they require thinking

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:54.920
about a parallel grid job.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.390
And you've got to do that simultaneously
while composing a workflow.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.680
And we wanted to do better.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.220
My father can't create a workflow,
and I wanted to fix that.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.320
And so we have.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.530
But before I show you the demonstration,
I first want to show you some pseudocode

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.550
of what a workflow looks like.

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.090
This is perhaps the simplest workflow
you could possibly conceive of.

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:19.910
The first step of the workflow is to take
the original movie and add a watermark.

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:24.360
The second step is to join
the watermarked movie with an

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.090
intro video and an exit video.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.200
And then the next step is to encode
the video for four different sources.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.970
Now, the reason I've highlighted this
box in this way is all of these

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.680
will happen in parallel on the grid.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.650
If you have four idle CPUs on the grid,
all four of these jobs will

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.100
be running simultaneously.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.500
If you have two idle grids on the node,
it'll run the first two,

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.240
and when one finishes,
the third will go on,

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.640
and it will just deal
with it like a queue.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.680
And then the last step is to take
the video that you just encoded

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.880
and publish it to a source.

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:54.800
And again, there's no reason for these
commands to run serially.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.400
They will run in parallel on the grid.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:04.900
That's probably unacceptable code,
even though it's pseudocode.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:12.240
But that workflow turns into
something that looks like this.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:16.560
If you catch the syntax error,
you can get an iPhone 3G today.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.510
So we wanted the podcast workflow
editor to be simple and powerful.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.480
We wanted administrators to be able
to quickly deploy a new workflow.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.130
When my wife calls up the
administrator and says,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.480
hey, I don't like the way
the workflow's working,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:31.890
change it.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.170
We wanted that to be easy.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.810
We want full access to all
the QuickTime components that

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.130
you can do for encoding video.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.240
We wanted to be able to
incorporate your custom artwork.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.550
I personally really... One of the
funnest things I got to do on the Leopard

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.160
thing was all the intro videos we did,
and you saw our final result.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.260
That was really, really fun.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.310
But I don't think you guys want to
use that video on all of your stuff,

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:53.930
so we're going to allow you
to do your own artwork and

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:54.990
not force you to use ours.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.590
And we needed the workflows to
support single source and the new

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.720
dual source functionality that we've
incorporated in the Podcast Producer 2.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.380
But this is all kind of dry,
so I'm going to invite my

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.870
coworker up for a second time,
and he's actually going to

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.020
show you the workflow editor.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.000
Hello again.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.410
No flickering today.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.840
So I'm going to walk you
through the new Workflow Editor.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.010
So I'm just going to
launch it here in the dock.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:30.080
And you're going to see that
we've created a really simple

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.020
workflow creation path for you.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.350
And I'm going to walk you through the
seven different steps today to show you

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.050
how easy it is to create a new workflow.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.420
So I'm going to start
off right off the bat.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.310
The first thing the application
is asking me for is some

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.120
information about this workflow.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.090
So this is the information that's
going to be presented to the end user.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.700
So the name,
this is what's going to pop up.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.140
You saw earlier in Podcast Capture
when I selected different

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:51.890
names of the workflow.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.520
Well, that's the workflow name.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:57.870
So we'll call this my third workflow.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:04.210
Um,
I almost said this is still super easy.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.080
And that's all I have to do to
get that little information.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.320
We're going to go to
the second step here.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.280
So the second step is the import stage.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:11.990
This is the funnel.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:17.270
This defines what kind of inputs
my workflow is going to accept.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.340
So as David mentioned,
the new feature that we're

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.270
also shipping with Snow Leopard
will be the dual source video.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:26.990
So here I can tell the workflow only
accept one source or accept dual source.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.620
So since this is a new feature,
I'm just going to leave

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.590
it on dual source.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.360
And then we go to the editing stage.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.900
This is the branding
stage of Podcast Producer.

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.040
This is where you get
to brand your content.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.680
And you see there's four elements here.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.520
You've got the first element,
which is the intro video.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.680
You've got the second one,
which is the bumper title

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.050
that you guys saw earlier.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.410
The third one is a preview of
what the content will actually

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.020
look like with a watermark on top.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.820
And the fourth is the outro video.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.960
And you see they're all linked
together by transitions.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:59.460
And I can even just skim
over here like in iPhoto,

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.960
and give you a little
preview of what's in there.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.570
But it's really easy to use.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.760
And I've got some branding content that
my art department's provided for me here,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.860
an intro video and a watermark image.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.700
And all I have to do
is take my intro video.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.420
I'm just going to drag it here.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.660
There you go.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.860
My watermark.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.910
And I've watermarked my content.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:22.880
So that's how easy it is to just add your
own intro video and your own watermark.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.720
I also wanted to change
this here to a dissolve.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.470
And that's it.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.840
You know,
I'll just change my transitions.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.430
So this is great.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.980
So with the skimming,
I can see the different kind of things.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.360
But it would be awesome if I could
put this all together and kind of

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.320
get a preview of what it looks like.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.740
So we've got this Preview
button for you right here.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.630
And this will assemble the content
and give you a preview of what the

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.820
content will actually look like.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.600
So there you see the dissolve,
the flying title.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.850
And I can skim through here.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.690
And you see there's a
little-- this is a preview.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.220
This is the stage before,
which is providing the sample content

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.290
of what it will actually look like.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.740
And you see the watermark
that I added in.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.660
Somebody dancing around in a cube.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.500
And an outro video.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.640
So that's the branding,
and hopefully you can

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.950
see it's really easy.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.750
So the export stage is where I define
how I want to deliver and what formats

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.640
I want to deliver this content.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.290
So by default,
the workflow editor has chosen an

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.400
iPod video and iPod-only format.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.320
Well, I'd like to add a little
higher definition format,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.320
the Apple TV one.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.440
So I'm just going to click
the plus button here,

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:33.960
choose QuickTime,
choose Apple TV in the pop-up here,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.680
and there you go.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.340
I've added my Apple TV encoder.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.630
In the publishing stage, by default,
you already have the podcast library.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.800
So David's going to talk
about this in a few minutes.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.780
But I'd also like to upload
this content to iTunes U.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.230
So in the plus here,
I'm going to choose iTunes U.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.400
I'm going to upload the Apple TV version,
so I'm just going to check that one.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:05.160
I'm going to give it my site credentials,
my site address, thatapple.com.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.900
My tab ID is 20, still 20/20,
and my admin credentials.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.590
And there you go.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.010
Now my workflow is going to upload
the Apple TV version to iTunes

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.480
U each time the workflow is run.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.990
The last active stage here
is the notification step.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.660
So by default,
the podcast workflow editor will

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.130
send an email to the administrator
and the submitting user to notify

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.200
them that their content has been
produced and has been published.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.260
If I wanted to,
I could also send an iChat

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.650
message or things like that.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.100
The last stage here is a quick summary.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.690
It just gives you an idea of the
complexity of the workflow you have,

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.280
just to give you an idea
about--so you know how much of

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.580
a bigger grid you actually need.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.950
So now that this is done,
I'm going to save off my workflow here.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.430
So up here in File, I'm going to Save.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.700
So you see now it's prompting
me for a master password.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.140
So why is it doing this?

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.580
Well, you saw in the publish stage,
I entered iTunes U information

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.400
with some account information.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.360
Well, that's sensitive data.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.280
I don't want to just store
that flat on the file.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:11.250
So we're going to encrypt this with
a master password for your workflow.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.890
So just the account information
will be encrypted for you.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.780
So we'll just accept that.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.100
And here I can say,
call this Demo Workflow.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.050
And I'll save it to my desktop.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.880
And there you see it's on my desktop.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.840
Now that's great, it's on my desktop,
but that's not very useful

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.080
with a Podcast Producer system.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.820
How do I get this onto the system?

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.560
Well, you may have seen when I was in
File here that there's Upload Workflow.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:37.760
So if I select that, I can specify a
Podcast Producer server address

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.100
with my administrator credentials,
and that will upload the

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.490
workflow automatically to the
system and deploy it for me.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.140
So we've made that really easy for you,
too.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.080
So just to show you that
I'm not cheating here,

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.360
I'm gonna hide this,
and I'm gonna open this

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.140
workflow in TextMate,

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.240
You might not be able to see,
but here I'm going to-- this

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.390
is the account information.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.490
So what I want to show you here is that
we've encrypted all the information.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.340
The password's not stored in the clear.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.020
We can go down to the template.plist.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.210
You've got tons of all the
XML that we were talking before.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.370
We also see I've got the intro movie,
and I've got all the content

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.580
that I've added has been
incorporated into the workflow.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.730
So it's a standalone workflow.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.330
So all of the data is in there already.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.360
But that's great.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.750
So it's really easy to make a workflow,
but what does produced content by

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.250
this workflow actually look like?

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:34.370
So I've already run a workflow before,
and I'm going to show you

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.170
the output of this workflow.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:41.120
So here in iTunes U,
history of mathematics,

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.090
I think it was History of Pi.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:49.100
Does anybody want to see that?

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:53.160
Okay, so I've just downloaded the content
that was published up to iTunes U.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.100
And here's what the
final content looks like.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:04.000
So this is the intro video I added.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.900
It's the flying title with the dissolve.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.990
I want to talk to you today
about two of my favorite things,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.410
AppleScript and math.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.440
And when I was learning AppleScript,
I came across this list of

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.330
predefined variables in the language.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.580
And one of them kind of left
off the page at me a little bit.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.580
I mean, really, pi?

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.740
What is pi doing on a list of variables?

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.990
It's not a variable.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.080
It's a constant.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.430
It's the ratio of the circumference
of a circle to the diameter of

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.240
every circle in the universe.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.030
It's got the same value of pi, 3.14159.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.180
You know what it is.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.130
But in AppleScript,
AppleScript knows that.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.850
But you can also change it.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.300
And it finally occurred to me
that this might actually be

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.880
useful in a couple of situations.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.260
For instance, depending on when and where
you're writing your AppleScripts,

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.230
back in the day,
somebody created a molten sea that was

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.180
30 cubits around and 10 cubits across.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.910
So if you were doing biblical
AppleScript programming,

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.440
you might start off your
AppleScript like this.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.740
Set pi to 30 divided by 10.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.730
You want to move forward a little bit.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:06.860
In Indiana in 1897,
they unanimously passed a bill

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.920
declaring that in Indiana,
the value of pi... was going to be 3.2.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.620
So every AppleScript programmer back then
in Indiana started their script this way.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.920
Set pi to 3.2.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.920
Now, you don't have to depend on
AppleScript's idea of the value of pi

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.900
because AppleScript knows what it is.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.920
But we know what it is, too.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.910
It's 3.14159.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:28.900
Everybody knows that, right?

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:34.900
2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4,
6.

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.920
You can look this up on
Google if you don't believe me.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:44.920
2, 6, 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 8,
8, and so on.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.910
You know what?

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.150
When I was in high school,
I was a bit of a geek.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.920
I know that's hard to believe.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.920
And I learned pi in 200 places because
I thought that would impress girls.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:53.920
So I learned pi in 200 places because
I thought that would impress girls.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:53.920
So I learned pi in 200 places because
I thought that would impress girls.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920
So I learned pi in 200 places because
I thought that would impress girls.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.260
Let me tell you something.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.330
It doesn't impress girls.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.740
So that's how easy it is to create a
workflow with a new workflow editor.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.400
And I encourage you to all check out
Steve Heyman's stuff on iTunes here.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:15.990
Thank you.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.320
Thank you, Shell.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.600
Can we go back to demo machine, please,
or slide machine?

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.400
Thank you.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.290
So that was the workflow
editor demonstration.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.340
We're very excited about that.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.240
I encourage you also,
there's a session on Thursday at 10.30.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.830
I believe it's in Nob Hill,
but I'm not sure.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.990
It's at the end of my slides.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.630
We'll go into much more
detail of the workflow editor,

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.130
and we've just scratched the
surface here with what this

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.280
workflow editor is capable of.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.470
So that's the workflow editor.

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.020
We're very excited.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.490
You can do lots of cool things with it.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.480
But we're going to talk
about some other features.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:48.680
I had seven icons up there.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.660
We've only covered two.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.030
The next feature we're also equally
excited about is the podcast library,

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.370
although this is harder to demo,
but I think you'll all understand it.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:01.220
It's a single-click RSS and
Atom feed repository.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.760
If you want to host your own RSS feeds
and you don't have one set up already,

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.560
the choice was to set up a separate
wiki server and Leopard server,

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.430
but we heard from some customers
that they'd rather just have podcast

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.430
producer be an all-in-one solution,
so we are providing a built-in,

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.230
automatic, and fully functional RSS feed
server that's automatically

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:21.020
managed and maintained for
you in Podcast Producer 2.0.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:25.220
So there's no longer a need to have a
separate server hosting your RSS feeds.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.360
You'll get one by default.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:27.440
It will just work.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:32.530
All workflow content,
and this is really...

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.700
Enormously exciting.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.340
We're going to harvest
all of the results.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.100
It won't be just the
results of the workflows.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.700
It will also be the original content.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.470
If everything that
Podcast Producer touches

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:47.540
will be archived,
sorted,

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.700
and cataloged into this RSS feed server.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:55.730
And we're going to leverage another
cool Apple technology called Spotlight.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.690
And you'll be able to configure
the repository to have separate

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:01.990
RSS feeds that equal a spotlight query.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.040
So how many of you would like to have an
automatic feed for Professor O'Rourke,

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.720
automatically maintained?

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.950
So regardless of what
workflow I upload to,

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:17.200
Spotlight will find those workflows,
see that I was the submitting author,

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.000
and all of my video
will be in an RSS feed.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:24.500
By using the power of Spotlight and RSS,
there will be separate feeds that you

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.780
can customize by any searchable criteria
that you can conceive of in Spotlight.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.040
So the feeds can also be
directly served to iTunes U.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.920
I don't know how many people have
gone to the iTunes U talks this week,

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.210
but iTunes U is also now
offering the option to not copy

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.640
the content up to iTunes U.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.700
You can just have a pointer
point back to your content.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.410
Well, we've been working
with the iTunes U team,

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:52.540
and they'll be able to directly
scrape these feeds and get the preview

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:54.730
video and all of that without you
having to manually synchronize that

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:54.730
information up to your iTunes U tab.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.310
So we're working with the iTunes
U development team to make sure

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.100
that they have full integration
with the Podcast Producer library,

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:05.000
which is an automatic hosting service
that just automatically works and

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.620
maintains your RSS library for you.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.090
In addition, we're going to base-- not
only are we going to use RSS,

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.410
but we're also adopting a
new standard called Atom.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:18.630
And for those of you who don't know,
Atom is a multiple enclosure

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.170
version of an RSS feed.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.060
So today, if you want to use RSS and you
want to have an iPod version,

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.390
an Apple TV version,
an audio-only version,

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:29.860
those are all three separate RSS feeds.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.810
Atom allows you to consolidate
that into one feed and have

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.540
three separate enclosures.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.890
So you can have one bundle that
represents all of the possible forms,

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.090
and the client, using an Atom feed,
will pick the correct version

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.930
of the video that they
want out of the Atom feed.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:46.110
So you can have RSS,
or you can have Atom.

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:46.860
Your choice.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.390
Both will be maintained for
you and automatically served.

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.660
So this is an architectural
feature of Podcast Producer 2.0,

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.970
and we're very excited about it,
because since all of the video

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:00.270
can be served up over Atomfeeds,
it now makes it much easier

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.880
for third parties to access
your Podcast Producer content.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.520
What if you had an Atomfeed viewer, say,
built into Moodle,

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.060
or an Atomfeed viewer built into Sakai?

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.560
You could just enter
the URL of the Atomfeed,

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.690
and those services would
go and automatically fetch.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.750
Every time you run a workflow,
a new episode shows up,

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.200
Sakai would get updated through
the Atomfeed notification.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.520
But again, this is harder to talk about
than it is to demonstrate.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.280
So Kjell's come back up on stage,
and we're going to give our

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:27.750
last demo for this presentation,
which is the iTunes

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.110
U and RSS Atom Library.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:34.610
So this is going to be
a really short demo,

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.160
but hopefully that's
the whole point of it.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.360
And you're going to see how easy we've
made it for us for you to integrate with

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.480
iTunes U now with the podcast library.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:46.070
So how many of you here have already
administered an iTunes U site?

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:49.000
see a few hands, I think you're really
going to love this one.

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.490
So here we are on my iTunes use site
and I'm logged in as an administrator.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.860
I'm going to edit this page because
I have this course I want to add.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.340
So before I do that,
I'm actually going to show you the feed.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.040
So I have this monuments of Paris class.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.430
You see there's three enclosures.

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.450
This is what David was talking about.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:08.470
This is an Atom feed we're
just showing in Safari.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.440
You see there's three different classes
and each class has three enclosures.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:16.080
There's an Apple TV,
audio only and an iPod version.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.500
Now,
I want to bring this feed into iTunes U.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:23.690
So all I'm going to do here is
I'm just going to grab this URL.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:26.000
I'm going to copy it here.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.000
And I'm going

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.710
Let's just hide Safari.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:33.600
So now I'm going to edit
my--back here in iTunes U,

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.870
I'm just going to edit my page.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.550
And you see I have an empty
European Monuments session here,

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:42.680
so let me just make this
a bit wider for you.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.920
And we're going to create a new course.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.570
And you see here,
normally you have your simple

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:52.090
course where you add in your title,
your short name, and identifier.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.140
And here there's a new pop-up that we've
been working with the iTunes U Team,

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:58.020
and they've developed this new feature.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:01.000
And I just select the feed course.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:10.500
And I'm just going to put in "HDP" and
paste in here the URL to my Atom feed.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:11.900
Hit OK.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:15.670
Now the iTunes U store is actually
going to scrape that Atom feed

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.300
and create my page for me.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.920
So I'm done editing here.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:21.040
And you see, there you go.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.020
It grabbed the picture that was being
served up through the Atom feed.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.640
It's created my Monuments of Paris class.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.370
And if I go in here,
you now see that I have three different

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:33.050
tabs for all the different formats.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.340
iTunes U detected that there were
three enclosures per episode and that

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.560
there were three different versions.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:44.220
So now I have my Apple TV tab,
my iPod audio, my iPod video.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:48.210
You see it also grabbed the
picture and the title of my

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:50.110
podcast and the description here.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.420
I didn't have to do anything.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:56.020
And what also happens now is anytime
content will be submitted to the library,

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.150
since it's an Atom feed,
the Atom feed will just update and

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:02.790
iTunes U will automatically detect
that there's new content and it'll

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:04.270
just appear in your iTunes U site.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.980
So that's how easy it is to integrate
iTunes U with a podcast library.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:08.770
Thank you.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:14.800
Thank you, Kjell.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.000
Back to slides, please.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.570
Thank you very much.

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:20.810
So while we've done a lot of
work working with iTunes U,

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:22.820
that's a natural and powerful fit.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.530
Well, I want to emphasize,
we've adopted a standard of Atom so

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:27.450
that anybody can do what iTunes U did.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.730
You want your own website
to scrape our Atom feeds,

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.280
just read the Atom spec,
which is already published,

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.690
and you can pull content from the
iTunes library with no special

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:37.620
programming or tools required.

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.480
The next feature we've added
is we've improved the scale and

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.000
high availability of the system.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.900
Podcast Producer's already
a fully scalable system.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.500
A side effect of our scale architecture
is there's a lot of redundancy,

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.350
because XCrit schedules
jobs on idle CPUs,

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:57.370
and we assume that the pool of
CPUs is constantly changing.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.400
We were already insulated
from a single CPU failure.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.300
That just meant you had one fewer
rendering machine available,

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.320
but the jobs kept running.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.760
And XSAN's already fully redundant,
so if you use XSAN as

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.280
your shared file system,
there was no single CPU failure that

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.400
could bring down your shared file system.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.500
you

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.900
But in 1.0, there were two processes
that couldn't be clustered,

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:21.180
and that was the Podcast Producer itself
and the Xgrid controller.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.920
With Podcast Producer 2,
those will be both available in

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.820
a fully redundant configuration.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:28.860
We will require XAN,
but you can deploy two separate servers,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.460
point them at the shared file system,
and if one server goes down,

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:34.400
your Xgrid jobs will continue to run,
and if another server goes down,

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.390
your Podcast Producer cameras
will continue to record.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:42.110
So for higher-end configurations,
we think this is excellent.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:45.300
So this keeps your systems running
even in the event of a CPU failure.

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.740
And if you factor them
out across four CPUs,

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.330
two CPUs for the Podcast Producer server
and two separate CPUs for

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.750
the X-Grid controller,
four CPUs total,

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:58.100
you could actually have two CPUs fail
and still have the system running.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.600
The next feature we've added is a
web-based podcast capture application.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.030
We've heard from a lot of
you that Mac OS X is the most

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.900
fantastic OS on the planet,
but that you occasionally have

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.600
to use a non-Mac OS X platform,
and you'd like to be able to

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.290
start a camera from that platform.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.900
So we're gonna offer a
Safari-based application.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.400
It'll work with any modern web browser,
but we think Safari's the best.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:23.000
And it can be used from Mac OS X, iPhone,
or other lesser platforms.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.600
It'll be included as a standard
feature of Podcast Producer 2.0.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.070
And here's some sample screenshots.

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.220
So you'll have your standard
login dialog in Safari.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:31.890
Dr.

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:36.600
Watson logs on, hits the login button,
and he gets the three familiar choices.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.890
Now, why is there three?

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.220
Because screen capture's not
possible from JavaScript.

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:44.520
So you can only upload a file, audio,
or video, but you'll have most of the

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.100
full functionality of the
Podcast Capture application.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:52.390
We will support dual video from here
from two separate video cameras.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.900
The next feature is another
highly requested feature.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.800
For those of you who don't know,
we also have a very successful

00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.060
service called the Podcast Processor.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.100
We're a very successful
suite of video editing tools.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.100
And Podcast Producer does video,
they do video.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.600
We've received a lot of questions about
further integration with that tool suite.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.060
And I'm happy to announce today
we are beginning to do that

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:10.790
with Podcast Producer 2.0.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.490
So this will allow you to leverage
your already existing investment

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.090
in Apple's Pro video tools.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.750
We will be supporting Compressor
as an alternate encoder to the

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.290
QuickTime encoders that built in
and freely provided with the OS.

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.170
And we will be supporting
Final Cut Server as a destination

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.500
for uploading your video,
so that you can automatically,

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.430
through the Podcast Producer library,
get all of that valuable content

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:34.650
into the Final Cut Server as an
asset library management system.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:39.600
The next feature we're going to be
including is improved authentication.

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:43.740
This will add
authentication for Kerberos,

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:47.290
and we'll be supporting
Active Directory secure authentication

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.760
using Digest authentication
from the Podcast Capture application.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.200
Both the command line tool and the
GUI will support either Kerberos,

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.870
Digest, or the existing authentication
methods in the 1.0 product.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.030
We've heard from some customers,
they do want single sign-on

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:01.040
with Podcast Capture.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.550
They want to log in once at login window
and just launch the Capture app and have

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:06.360
it not require further authentication.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:10.100
We will support that
in Podcast Producer 2.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:12.880
So in quick review...

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:17.470
The top features for Podcast Producer 2
are a workflow editor,

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:21.680
dual video, the podcast library,
high availability,

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.540
improved authentication,
web-based submission,

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.320
and improved integration
with the pro apps.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.440
My team is not going to sleep
for the next several months.

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.830
We think Podcast Producer is
the most powerful automated

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:39.680
processing platform available today.

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:43.260
It works for small systems,
and it can scale up to very,

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.100
very large systems.

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.080
With Snow Leopard,
we're going to extend our lead in this

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.340
space by adding seven of the key features
that you've seen in this presentation,

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.430
and we think this will improve
our lead and validate your

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.460
investment in Podcast Producer 1.0.

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.060
And it will remain a flexible platform.

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:03.270
Because we're based on Xgrid,
we can run any executable Unix can run.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:06.300
You are not locked into our
suite of workflow tools.

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:10.940
This is both a feature for deployers
and an opportunity for developers.

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:15.090
You can develop for this platform
and fill out the tool suite where

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.500
Apple does not provide solutions.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.930
You're also welcome to compete with
us where we do provide solutions.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:25.700
So with more standards, more integration,
we believe Apple's platform strengths

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.320
will make Podcast Producer 2
the best podcast producer

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.930
production system you've ever seen.

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:35.520
I have the mother of all
related sessions slide.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:40.130
Integrating iTunes U into your workflow,
you should attend that yesterday.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.800
What's new for Podcast Producer?

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.320
You're here now.

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:48.930
Best practices for
large-scale XSAN deployments.

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:54.820
If you're going to be deploying
Podcast Producer and using

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.170
XSAN as your shared file system,
I highly recommend

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:56.170
attending that session.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:56.170
Podcast Producer In-Depth is
the session tomorrow at 10:30.

00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:59.300
You'll see more of the library
and more of the workflow editor.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.540
It's a very, very exciting demo.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.920
We have some possible surprises.

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.440
I recommend everybody attend.

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:11.330
Deploying Podcast Producer is a practical
hands-on review of people who've

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:14.760
deployed Podcast Producer already,
and you can learn from their lessons.

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.100
Integrating and extending
Course Composer.

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:22.110
Course Composer is so powerful,
and so many people don't know about it.

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:23.980
With Course Composer
and Podcast Producer,

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.700
you can do anything you
can conceive of visually.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.100
I really recommend, if you have the time,
that you go look at the Course Composer.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.110
I'm blown away every time I see someone
who knows how to use Course Composer with

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.860
what they can do with Podcast Producer.

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:40.720
Deploying Final Cut Server and
integrating with Final Cut Server,

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.420
where they'll be talking about
their further integration

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:42.420
with Podcast Producer.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.480
So for more information,
you can contact our server evangelists.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.540
And I appreciate everyone's
time and your attendance.
