00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.530
Hi, everybody.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.140
Welcome to session 520,
Deploying and Scaling the iCal Server.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.160
I've got a good crowd.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.240
My name is Wilfredo Sanchez Vega.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.580
I'm the engineering manager
for the iCal Server,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.800
and we're gonna be talking about
how you can fit this into your

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.240
environment back at the office,
maybe even at home.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.660
So iCal Server is Apple's
calendaring solution.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
We introduced it with Leopard
just at the end of last year.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.000
We talked about it last year
at WWDC and the year before.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.830
It's all based on open
internet standards,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.940
so we're not trying to lock anybody
into any kind of proprietary protocols.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.550
We've got a very strong commitment to
doing everything using open standards,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.450
and we're actively involved in
driving some of these standards

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.960
because they are emerging.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.420
We interoperate as a result of
that with a variety of clients,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.360
including, of course, iCal.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.630
But as you'll see,
there are actually a handful of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.830
other clients that are starting to
enter the space that interoperate

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.190
with our server as well.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.710
And the entire project is open source.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.490
So today you can actually go out
there and get our source code,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.810
fiddle around with it,
and add whatever you need in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.000
order to make it work for you.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.120
And ideally contribute something back.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.590
So what we're going
to talk about today is

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.390
Some of the features of the iCal Server,
so you can kind of see exactly what

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.010
you're getting into if you deploy it.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.240
Talk a little bit about what's new in
some of the software updates that we've

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.270
been shipping since we launched Leopard.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.580
This being a brand new product and
a new part of the server product,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.100
we've been doing actually quite
a bit of work in the software

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.220
updates to address the comments that
we're getting back from our users.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.490
And we're going to talk a
little bit about what you're

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.500
going to see in Snow Leopard.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.350
Cyrus is also going to update you
on the status of all of the relevant

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.190
standards that we're working with.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.150
There are many.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.730
And then we're going to get into
some of the nitty-gritty about

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.440
how the iCal Server deploys.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.320
And the whole talk will be
actually hopefully not too long

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.510
so that there will be plenty of
time for some Q&A at the end.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.200
So just first up,
quick review of what kind of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.080
standards I'm talking about.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.470
First up is iCalendar,
which is just a text file

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.880
format that describes events.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.050
It's simply this event
happens at this time.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.090
It maybe recurs every Monday, Wednesday.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.340
And when it ends,
you can also describe to-do

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.900
items and that sort of thing.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.280
We've got another format called iTip,
which is a iCalendar transport

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.880
independent protocol,
and that enables you to talk

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.560
about scheduling a meeting.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.550
So if I want to invite you to a meeting,
I can actually send you a message.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.920
It looks a lot like iCalendar.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.480
The only difference is that it
adds a little bit of glue to

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.130
tell you that I'm inviting you,
I'm accepting a meeting,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.390
and that sort of thing.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.780
We've got HTTP, which probably everybody
here is fairly familiar with,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.260
but this is the protocol that
drives the entire iCalendar.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.990
So you can see that I'm using a lot of
web and a great deal of the Internet.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.070
And in order to actually make
that useful for authoring,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480
you've got to have some more stuff,
and that's WebDAV.
