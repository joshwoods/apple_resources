00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.640
The tools we have range from
tools for provisioning iPhones,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.930
for configuring iPhones efficiently,
for developing applications for iPhones,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.760
and for doing all that while keeping
your networks and your data secure.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.470
The things we're going to be
covering are actually divided

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.510
up into three presenters.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.990
We have three presenters from Apple here.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.610
The first presenter will be Ron,
who's going to--he's

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.860
from our tools group.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.840
He's going to talk about the tools
that Apple has to provision iPhones,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.440
that is,
making them initially loaded with

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.490
the keys that will allow them to
run your apps that will allow you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.680
to track that iPhone with that user,
and to configure them, that is,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.010
how to automatically set the
configuration settings on a phone

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.340
for your employee for a whole
variety of things so they're not,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.250
you know, flipping through manually
setting up their phone.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.870
After Ron,
we'll have Steve come up and talk

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.680
about iPhone app development.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.010
And, of course, this entire conference is
on iPhone app development,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.030
and there's a ton of sessions.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.050
One of the things Steve's going
to focus in on is why and how you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.840
would develop Web applications as
opposed to native applications.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.780
And, of course,
those of you from IT know that there are

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.560
many situations where a Web application
is much more efficient way to roll

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.390
out functionality to your employees.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.190
There's no installation involved.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.200
You simply change the
Web site and the app changes.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.540
And Steve's going to talk about some of
the techniques and the tools for making

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.850
Web-based applications on the iPhone,
when you would do that,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.150
when you wouldn't do that,
and how you can make those apps be great.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.060
And then finally, Curtis is going to
come up and talk about,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.230
okay, now you've deployed phones
in your organizations.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.560
You have deployed applications on them.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.820
So, you've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.970
You've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.260
You've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.520
You've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.880
You've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.100
You've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.320
And then, of course,
you've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.330
And then, of course,
you've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.210
And then, of course,
you've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.950
And then, of course,
you've deployed them on your devices.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:06:13.000
[Transcript missing]

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.040
The types of challenges that we're
going to talk about today for the

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.800
IT groups--how do you provision
these things in your organization?

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.010
How do you configure them?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.320
How do you roll out a new configuration
once they're already in the field?

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.560
That's what the first talk
from Ron is going to be about.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.060
How do you do this securely?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.440
What kind of VPNs do you need
to deploy to keep things secure?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.160
How do you make sure that
your SSL certificates are set

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.900
up correctly on the phone?

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.360
Actually,
the third presentation will cover that.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.250
In addition,
should it happen if an employee loses

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.940
an iPhone or the iPhone gets stolen,
of course,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.900
you want the capability to remote
wipe that phone so that you don't

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.080
lose track of that corporate data.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.340
So let's get started.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.140
First presentation on
configuration and provisioning.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.680
This is going to be all about
the tools we have for doing that,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.140
including things like the
iPhone Configuration Utility,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.340
which you will get to know and love.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.770
And to come present that is Ron Lusang
from Development Technologies.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.890
So, Ron.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.890
Great.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.670
Thanks, Bud.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.780
Morning, everyone.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.600
My name is Ron Lusang,
and I'm a member of the

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.980
Development Technologies Group here
at Apple.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.490
And for the next 15 minutes or so,
I'd like to introduce you to a utility

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.720
that we created specifically to
make it easier for you to introduce

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.250
iPhones into your organizations.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:53.710
And we call it the iPhone
Configuration Utility.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.710
And here's what it looks like.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.340
It looks a lot like iTunes.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.920
That's because a lot of
the metaphors are the same.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:05.190
We have a library of items that we want
to manage and might have some connected

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.920
iPhones that you want to push items to.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.260
And of course,
we'll see the detailed information

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.370
about whatever library item
or connected iPhone you have.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.430
But instead of managing ringtones,
music and videos, we manage devices,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.090
kind of a record of all of
the iPhones that you've ever

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.340
connected to this computer,
applications--so these are the

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.600
applications that you'll push
over to your iPhones--provisioning

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.290
profiles and configuration profiles,
which I'll describe more

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:38.290
about later on in my slides.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.790
Now, of course,
iTunes--the target audience for iTunes is

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:49.140
very different from the target audience
we had for iPhone Configuration Utility.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.260
We actually had three target audiences
for iPhone Configuration Utility,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.610
the first being those who
are doing IT administration,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.790
so people who need to keep
track of all the iPhones that

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.910
they've deployed throughout their
organization or who need to set up

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.240
the iPhones that they're giving out,
possibly installing

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.540
applications and such.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.270
The second audience that we concentrated
on are those who are doing QA testing,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.780
specifically for these in-house
applications that we're looking

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.470
forward to hearing about.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.650
And there are those who are doing
network and security administration.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.150
So those are the individuals who provide
these great--the great access and network

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:34.330
services for their employees but need
to ensure some security policies are

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:41.780
enforced on those iPhones in the case,
as Bud mentioned,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:41.780
that the iPhone is lost or stolen.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.970
So with the rest of my slides,
I'll just go one by one through each

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.050
of these three audiences and talk about
what iPhone Configuration Utility can

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.200
do to help them work with iPhones.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:02.260
And of course, we'll go in order,
starting off with IT administration.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.100
So as I said, for IT administrators,
you really need to keep track of all of

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.480
the iPhones that you're responsible for,
including who you gave the iPhone to,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.000
of course,
and probably you'll have to set up the

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.440
iPhone with some in-house applications.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.240
So iPhone Configuration Utility
lets you do exactly that.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.400
You plug in an iPhone,
we create a record of that iPhone

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.600
so that you can keep track of it
and keep track of who you've given

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.140
it to and install applications and
something called provisioning profiles,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.920
which I'll talk more about in a minute.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.630
So this is what you'll see once
you've plugged an iPhone into

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.600
iPhone Configuration Utility.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.000
It's a device summary.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.530
You'll see we still have the cool
iTunes tabbed style UI with the

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.990
summary tab and then a provisions tab,
applications and a console tab.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.440
Here in the summary,
you can see information

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.180
about this iPhone,
like the serial number or the UD ID.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.600
You can even associate contact
information either by typing

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.760
it in yourself or using the
people picker from address book.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.700
This is the same people
picker from address book,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.150
by the way,
that could be hooked up to your

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.860
back-end organization's LDAP directory.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.970
And you can use that to associate
contact information as well.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.930
From the Summary tab,
I'd like to jump over to

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.850
the Applications tab here.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:33.190
Here you can see all of the applications
that you have in your IPCU library and

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.870
all of the applications that are already
installed on this connected iPhone.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.740
So from here you can install new
applications or remove old ones,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.340
update existing ones.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.490
And we have a similar UI for
provisioning profiles here.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.410
So I think this is a good
time to introduce provisioning

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.960
profiles in more detail.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.560
So as a sidebar,
provisioning profiles are the

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.760
key to allowing an application
to run on the iPhone.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.860
So this is why it's important that
iPhone Configuration Utility allows

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:09.850
you to install both applications and
their associated provisioning profiles.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.640
Provisioning profiles have two
important pieces of information.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.200
The first being the
application creator's identity.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.450
This is a signing certificate,
which you use when you're signing the

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.800
application that you're installing,
that you intend to give out.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.380
and this gives your users authentication
so that they can know that this

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.680
application actually came from you.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.780
The second important piece
of information is a list of

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.660
Universal Device Identifiers,
or UDIDs.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.680
These are the ones that I mentioned
earlier that we saw in our Summary tab.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.680
And what this gives the iPhone,
as well as you as IT individuals,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.200
is authorization so that the application
that you've signed with this provisioning

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.730
profile will only run on the iPhones
that are in this list of UDIDs.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.240
So this is a very important
thing for IT management.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.560
And of course,
this wouldn't make much difference

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.090
if somebody could go in and fool
with the contents of the file.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.660
So provisioning profiles are
also signed to prevent tampering.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.560
So that's all I wanted to say for
right now about provisioning profiles.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.080
Curtis will talk a little
bit more about this later.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.970
I'd like to jump back to our
summary of our device records.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.530
So here we've selected our
device records library item

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.500
instead of a connected iPhone.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.960
You can see we have the
same information here.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.080
The Summary tab is there with all of the
contact information we've already set.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.940
We have the Provisioning and Applications
tab still so that you can see once

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.440
you've disconnected these iPhones,
the summary information,

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.960
all this information we've gleaned,
is still there and is

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.500
kept there as a record.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.230
We even show you when the last
time this iPhone was connected.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:06.340
And with all of this information,
it's very useful to be able to export it.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.970
So, IPCU--iPhone Configuration
Utility--lets you export these

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.930
records for either backup purposes or
sharing with other IT tools you have.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.980
They're simple XML files.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:26.060
You can even share it with other
users using iPhone Configuration

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:26.060
Utility on other computers.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.850
And we can also export
all of these records,

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.790
multiple records,
as a single file which you can send

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.240
to Apple's developer connection when
you're requesting provisioning profiles.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.470
So this gives you that list of
UDIDs that I mentioned inside

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.070
of a provisioning profile.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.360
So that's just a few of the
things that iPhone Configuration

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.090
Utility can help with for those
who are doing IT administration.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.970
Again, just keeping records of your
iPhones and installing provisioning

00:14:54.970 --> 00:15:00.130
profiles and their applications,
as well as being able to export

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.590
all of this information to a
usable format for other purposes.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:11.200
So stepping away from the
IT administrators for a second,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.120
we can focus on those
who are doing QA testing.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.260
So if you're testing
in-house applications,

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.640
we've already seen something that
IPCU will do to help out here.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.050
That's installing those applications
that you're going to test onto

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.570
those iPhones you're testing with.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.600
Apart from installing applications
and provisioning profiles,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:34.600
though,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.290
If you're going to do QA,
chances are you want to find out what's

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.830
actually happening on the iPhone that's
running your in-house application or

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:48.320
need to do some network diagnostics about
what an iPhone is doing out in the field.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.480
And for that,
iPhone Configuration Utility

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.560
lets you view device logs.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.860
So here again,
we see we've selected a connected iPhone.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.500
And in that fourth tab there,
the Console tab,

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.480
you can see the record of
what the iPhone was doing.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.780
This includes your application
logging as well as anything that

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.840
the iPhone itself has logged.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.120
And it looks a lot like the
console output you're familiar

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.460
with from console on Mac OS X.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.910
So, a short set of slides for QA testing.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.360
The next audience I'd like to
concentrate on are those who are doing

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.890
network administration or security.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.470
So as a network administrator,
you're providing all of this

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.960
great access via VPN or Wi-Fi,
as well as network services

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.100
such as email accounts or
Exchange ActiveSync accounts now.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.130
And in order to provide these services,
most network administrators

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.560
really require that the end
user devices are secure,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.190
that they can ensure some security policy
is really enforced on those end user

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.940
devices in case they're lost or stolen.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.880
and you can prevent sensitive data
from falling into the wrong hands.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.290
So the way we do that with the iPhone
and iPhone 2.0 software is using

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.900
something called configuration profiles.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.530
So here I'll take a sidebar and
describe more in detail what

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.060
a configuration profile is.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.200
So a configuration profile is simply
a file full of device settings.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.500
So the simple XML plist files
that contain settings for

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.700
things like email accounts,
security settings, networking setup,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:38.580
pretty much anything you could set up
directly on the iPhone for an end user.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.890
But the real power in configuration
profiles is that you can also set up

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.530
things that you wouldn't want your end
users to configure by hand or things that

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.100
there's no UI on the iPhone to configure.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.250
and configuration profiles are
installable by either email or

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.340
Safari directly on the iPhone.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.420
What this means is that you don't
ever have to connect an iPhone in

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.540
order to install these files and
configure it-- configure that iPhone.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.460
You could create a configuration profile,
post it on a secure web server or

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.940
send it out to your users as email,
and they can install it on their iPhones

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.940
without ever tethering the device.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.500
and of course,
iPhone Configuration Utility allows

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.590
you to create configuration profiles.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.420
So, anything that a configuration
profile can set up on the iPhone,

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.880
iPhone Configuration
Utility lets you configure.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.810
Things like passcode policies which,
you know,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.450
so you can actually require that your
users have a passcode on their iPhones,

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.060
even setting the strength of
the passcode that they use,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.940
or the maximum age in days.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.720
We can set up application restrictions
so that you can prevent your

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.360
users from watching too much
YouTube or surfing on the net,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.080
surfing the web.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.910
You can,
and in exchange for accepting these

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:05.100
security policies on your behalf,
the end users can get access

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.240
to things you've set up such
as pre-canned email settings,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.960
or you can embed certificates in
these configuration profiles which

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:18.840
you can use to simplify setting
up VPN access or Wi-Fi access.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.570
You can even set up
Exchange ActiveSync accounts.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.420
And again,
a lot of this would be pretty scary if it

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.080
weren't for the fact that you could sign
these configuration profiles as well,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.040
so that you can give your
end users authentication,

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.880
knowing that the configuration profile
that they're installing actually comes

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.270
from their IT or network organization.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.360
And here's what it looks like to set up
a configuration profile inside of IPCU.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.490
Here we've chosen the Wi-Fi tab.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.260
I'm not sure how clear
it is in the back there.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:01.170
But you can set up for this,
we're setting up Wi-Fi where we can

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.360
describe which SSID we want to use.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.140
We can even choose certificates
for our authentication method.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.010
We can even use it for
our trust settings.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.260
So this is just a snapshot of some of
the things that you can set up with IPCU.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.940
And in order to give
access to more people,

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:28.040
instead of having only iPhone
configuration utility for the desktop,

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.960
we also came up with iPhone
configuration utility for the web.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.290
It's the same configuration
profile creation and signing

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.290
features that you saw just now
in iPhone Configuration Utility.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.380
implemented as a web application.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.900
And it's the back -- oh, here we go.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.470
You can see it's all the same tabs
but this is all running in Safari.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.990
We even support all the signing features,
and the backend runs on Mac OS X,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.790
Windows XP, and Vista,
and the browser piece supports IE7,

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.660
Firefox, and Safari.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.700
So this way, since configuration profiles
can be installed without

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.870
ever connecting an iPhone,
a lot of network and security

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.970
administrators can end up
configuring iPhones that

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.030
they never touch or even see.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.440
So this is really powerful.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.140
Now you can even set up these
configuration profiles over the web.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.000
I thought you guys would be
excited about this web stuff.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.440
What is this?

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.440
Yes.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.440
Thank you.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.420
You can put web on anything.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:40.380
So that ends my tour of the
iPhone Configuration Utility.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.000
That's just a quick look at some of the
things we can do for IT administrators

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.480
who need to keep track of all of their
iPhones that they're administering,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.270
QA engineers who need to be able
to install those applications that

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.380
they're testing and get access to
the console logs on those test units,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.520
and, of course,
for network and security administrators

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.950
who want to provide all these great
network services and access to their

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.230
end users but need the guarantee of
security on those end-user devices.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.900
Now you can use iPhone Configuration
Utility to create configuration profiles

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.350
either on the desktop or via the web.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.330
And with that,
I'd like to hand it back over to Bud.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:21.870
Thank you.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.880
applause

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.830
Thanks, Ron.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.200
I highly recommend for more information,
there's a couple of sessions,

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.310
one on enterprise phone management
with configuration profiles.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.540
Learn all about what's in
a configuration profile,

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.600
what are all the different settings you
can affect with that and how that works.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:53.560
And there's also a deployment lab
where you can go and actually get

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.790
some hands-on and try this stuff out.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:55.790
Next,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.930
We're going to talk about
iPhone app development.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:05.670
And we're lucky to have
Steve Cotterill come from our

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.060
own IT organization at Apple.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:15.910
And of course,
we use iPhones extensively inside Apple.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.220
And so our IT organization
has a lot of experience with

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.000
how you roll these things out,
how you make them useful,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.640
how you make them secure.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.860
And what Steve is going to
talk about is building apps,

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.280
custom apps or in-house
apps for the iPhone.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.260
He's going to talk about when
you would build a web-based

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.380
application for the iPhone versus
a native app for the iPhone.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.880
What are the criteria you
would use to decide that?

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.990
What are some of the tools that are
in technologies available for building

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.200
web applications on the iPhone?

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.370
And finally,
how do you make those applications great?

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:53.420
Well, I think the first thing is to make
sure that you're using the right tools.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.350
So Steve?

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.390
Oh, my mic's on now.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.160
Okay, great.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:07.830
Hi, everybody.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.540
As Bud said, my name is Steve Cotterill.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.100
I work in Apple's
Enterprise Technologies Group,

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.610
and as he mentioned,
we've been building some of

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.980
the iPhone apps that we use
for ourselves and the company.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.790
And today I'm going to talk
about iPhone application

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.430
development for IT app developers.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:31.390
I'm going to focus on, first,
the design of IT applications,

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.400
what you should bother
putting on the iPhone,

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.380
what application platform
you should target,

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.730
and how you can actually make that
application a really great application.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.060
Then I'm going to talk a little bit
about some development technologies,

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.150
what technologies are available,
what tools we have to help you,

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:54.390
and offer some of the tips that my
team has come across in the last year.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.420
Finally,
I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.730
how you can deploy these applications,
and specifically what you can do to make

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:05.980
it really easy for your organization
to deploy applications very quickly.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.610
So let's start with design.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.680
So what should you consider
putting on the iPhone?

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.220
It seems kind of simple,
but the answer can be elusive.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.560
As Bud mentioned,
everybody is going mobile.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.010
And like I said, it's simple.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.990
You need to build mobile applications
to address the needs of mobile users.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.990
And that means the people in your
organization who are mobile all the time,

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.640
like people that are out in the field
doing sales or virtually anybody on a

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:44.000
university campus or anybody in your
organization when they're out on the go.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.550
So you need to build applications
that help users with quick,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.880
quick tasks.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.090
Some examples are looking up something,
getting like a dictionary

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.000
reference or following the
status of something in progress.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Getting any kind of updates on what's
going on elsewhere in the organization.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.330
Apps that help you make
more informed decisions,

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.940
keep you notified of what's going on.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.910
Or applications that let you control
what's going on in your organization from

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.000
wherever you happen to be in the world.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
These are the real
advantages of the iPhone.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:23.320
Just to sum up real quick,
the takeaway from this slide is if it

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.140
could make a good dashboard widget,
it would be a great

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.000
candidate for an iPhone app.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.630
application.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.780
So once you've figured out
what you want to build,

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.050
you have this question, "Well,
how am I going to build

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.040
it?" And on the iPhone,
you have two platform options--yes, two.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.840
So the first is the native SDK,
which we all know about.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.540
But the second is you could
build it as a web application.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.220
Some of you--I'm not sure.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.900
Maybe half the room is already, "Yeah,
I'm not going to bother with native.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.560
I'm going to do web." But maybe
half the room is asking,

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.000
"Now that I have an SDK,
why do I have to keep building web

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.650
applications?" And the answer is
the same reason you would build a

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.680
web application for the desktop.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.650
There's no installation to worry about,
instant deployment, instant update.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.340
These are the things that within Apple we
value because we really need all of

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.040
our users to be on the same version
of our software at any given moment.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.490
So if you need help making this decision,
I just put up some of the

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.380
platform features available.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.040
Like I said, if instant deployment,
instant updates,

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.540
and cross-platform compatibility
are important to you,

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.720
you can't beat a web app.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.170
If, however,
your application needs access

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.560
to some of the new spiffy
APIs like location services,

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:45.330
camera services, audio or 3D graphics,
or if it needs to be able to work

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.630
without an internet connection,
you really need to build

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.760
it as a native application.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.020
It's just not an option.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.530
But for everything else,
most of the features that you

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.090
want for your applications are
available in both platforms.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.910
They both integrate with all
the other apps on the phone.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.310
You can build the same iPhone look
and feel into your applications

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:09.640
using Interface Builder if it's
native or Dashcode if it's a web app.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:13.420
Both platforms support the ability
to have a custom application icon

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.590
added to the user's home screen.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.750
They both now support
multi-touch gestures.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:26.390
And with hardware-accelerated
CSS animation on the iPhone for web apps,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.350
your web apps are just going to
start to look just like native apps.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.300
If you're not sure which
way you want to go,

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.500
I suggest looking at it this way.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.460
If you think about how often you
plan on updating your application

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.540
versus how often you think users are
going to be using your application.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.160
And if you plot your application
somewhere in this space,

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.660
you'll see that the more often
that people use it and the

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.910
less often that you update it,
it would probably be a good

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.230
candidate for a native application.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.200
But if users aren't going
to use it very often,

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.360
but you're going to update it a lot,
it would probably be worth it to

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.300
develop it as a web application.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.700
Now, I have some examples just so
you get a better feel of how

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.360
things fall in this graph.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.110
The stocks widget on the phone.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.450
I don't even think it has been updated.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:19.940
It doesn't need to be updated.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.090
What we've got works fine.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.210
The only thing that would ever
cause it to need an update would

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.440
be if our data source dropped out.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.220
We'd need to change where it points.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.060
But it's never needed updating,
and the people that use

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.020
it use it all the time.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.780
It's a great application for native.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.000
A lot of IT applications,
specifically business

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.360
forms and business reports,
need to change with your organization.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.390
So if you start selling a new product,
if your governance laws change,

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.900
anything like that,
you need to update that application.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.510
And in some cases,
that means that every time

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.600
somebody uses the app,
they need to get a new version.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.180
And that means it's better as a web app.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:04.680
The trick to this is noticing that
this slide is not evenly distributed.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.900
There's this hot spot where
native activity is really,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.940
really effective.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.120
And that's because even the
most popular application,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.050
the one that gets used
by users all the time,

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.550
if you change it too often,
eventually it's not worth making users

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.860
update a new version all the time.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.260
So a web app is a better choice.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.390
And on the other side,
even if you plan on never,

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:32.990
ever changing your application,
if nobody's interested in using it,

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.210
it's probably better as a web app.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.740
They can visit it when they need it.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.810
So,

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:47.460
Like I said, and as Bud said,
in Apple we focus on web

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.170
applications for the enterprise,
largely because it is critical

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.140
that everybody be on the same
version and we don't want to make

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.250
people have to go through any
setup or installation beforehand.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.180
So most of my talk from now on is
actually going to be focused on web apps.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.640
But before I leave native,
I want to talk about what makes

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.590
a great iPhone application.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.250
Great iPhone applications are
the ones that help the user

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.250
with getting something done.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.220
Getting something done
quickly without distraction,

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.470
without taking up too much
of their time so that they

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.860
can move on with their lives.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.410
Great applications are focused.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.280
They're not trying to solve every
problem that a computer could do.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.150
They're just trying to help you with
a specific task while you're mobile.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.850
They're fast.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.100
They need to load
quickly and run quickly.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.600
They need to load
quickly and run quickly.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.070
And they need to be ready to be
interrupted by a phone call or

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.840
because the user really needs to turn
off their phone in class or whatever.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:50.000
And then they need to be
able to resume immediately.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.800
They are formatted not
only for the screen,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.180
which we all know is
not a desktop screen,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.150
but they're formatted for
use in a mobile setting.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:05.260
That means that your colors should
be readable at an arm's length in

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.930
sunlight and your touch controls
should be big enough to touch and your

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.060
text should be large enough to read.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.030
Great iPhone apps adopt the
UI conventions set forth by the

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.260
iPhone to provide a familiar
experience to users so they don't

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.730
take any time to learn how to use.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:29.200
And finally,
great iPhone applications integrate

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.400
with other iPhone applications.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.270
You should provide links to dial phone
numbers if you have them or write new

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.030
emails if you have them or get maps.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.390
These things users will
greatly appreciate.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.040
I have some great examples
from applications.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.880
One, the first I'm going to
start is a consumer example.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.100
Everybody could take out your iPhone.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.000
Please don't do it now.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.910
You could all see this.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.990
It's fandango.com.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.310
If you're not familiar,
because I think they only work in the

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:06.540
U.S., fandango is a website that offers
movie tickets and show times for users.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:11.390
Being a standards-compliant website,
it works wonderfully on the phone.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400
It works beautifully.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.280
You can go there.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.900
You can do everything that
you could do normally.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:22.520
But fandango decided to build a
version of their site for the iPhone,

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.970
and this is it.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:31.280
And why this is great is it's literally
a hundred times lighter weight.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.080
The size of the website
that has to be downloaded,

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.420
the size that has to be hosted,
the size that has to be transferred

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.860
and then loaded onto the phone
is literally a hundred times

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.220
smaller than the original Fandango.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:48.360
It loads a hundred fewer
files from your web server.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:53.120
And all this adds up to seven
times faster loading on Wi-Fi.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:54.800
Well, probably seven times on anything.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.780
But it takes five
seconds to load on Wi-Fi.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.600
So this is an application that's focused.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.260
They didn't deliver everything
that Fandango's website has.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.860
There aren't photos or trailers,
but they have what you

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.110
need when you're on the go.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.760
They have movie show times and they
have the ability to buy tickets.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.000
It's very fast, as I said,
loads in five seconds on Wi-Fi.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.510
It's formatted,
uses the same UI that people are

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:27.600
familiar with on the iPhone using
the table view style navigation.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.700
And it's integrated.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.940
If you find a theater
and buy tickets there,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.040
then you can call to get directions
or you could just go to the

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.280
Maps application and get directions.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.040
For an enterprise example,
for large organizations,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.540
we think a great example is a directory.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.040
My group built the Apple Directory app
that Scott Forstall

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.690
demoed last year at WWDC,
which some of you may like

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.610
because it shows that you can
actually develop web apps,

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:01.040
but some of you may hate
because it was secretly telling

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.450
you we don't have an SDK yet.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.040
But now we do.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.660
So we thought this was a good example.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.060
We took the very same Apple Directory web
application that we provide

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.720
to our employees to look up
anybody else in the company,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.130
and we built it for the iPhone.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.780
And it's fast.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.960
Most calls come back
within three seconds.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.870
It's formatted.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.880
It fits perfectly on the screen.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.120
You don't need to zoom or pan.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.460
It offers the exact same
UI that's in your contact list.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.820
It's an integrated application.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.990
It's based on a contact book.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.770
So if users have already
dealt with contacts,

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.760
they already know how
to use this application.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.230
And it's integrated.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.890
You can touch a phone
number to call a person.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.630
You can email a person directly
by touching their email address.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.770
Or you can touch their office
location to find out where they are.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.580
Now, phone books and movie
times are really fun,

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.790
but IT data is a lot more
complicated than that,

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:02.240
right?

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.380
So you're saying, "Well, that's great.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.950
You guys made wonderful applications
that do this cute little toy stuff,

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.310
but what about my data?

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.340
My data is ugly.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:13.090
So how are you going to help
me?" So I wanted to show

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.390
you a real business example.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.470
What we did was we were asked earlier
this year to port a sales report for

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.400
the company from a web to the iPhone.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.800
And we did it using the same data,
the same database as the original report,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.990
so there's no conflict in numbers.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.170
We focused it, though, for real-time use,
and we format it to be

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.200
used on the mobile device.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.690
And I'd like to show you how we did it.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.850
So this is an example of
the original sales report.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:49.560
It's not the real thing,
but it's an example.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:56.500
It shows actual and forecast sales
figures so far for a store so far today,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.240
this week and this quarter,
across the revenues that we

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.100
make and then the rates of sale,
the products that we sell,

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.600
and the services that we sell.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:11.600
And we use this to judge how we're doing.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.400
So we went back to our
previous business model,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.500
which was a web application, and we said,
"Okay, it has to make it onto the phone.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.500
We could just put it on the phone,
but that's not readable at all."

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.340
So we went back and we said,
"Okay, we're going to have to put a

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.960
little bit more effort into
it than that." So we said,

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.370
"Well, what do people need when they're
checking -- if they're going to check

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.430
this sales report on their phone,
what do they care about when they're

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.330
not at their desk?" And we realized
that they don't care about how we're

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.240
doing this week or this quarter.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.500
They care about how we're doing now.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:41.500
So we dropped that data.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.500
And they don't care about how
individual products are selling.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.500
They care about what kinds
of products are selling.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.490
So we summarized that data.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.500
And that gave us a much
more manageable data set.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.500
So again, we said, "Okay,
a good day's work, right?

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.500
We solved that problem.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.500
Works okay on the phone."
But that didn't please everybody.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.830
So we said, "Okay,
we need to format this for mobile

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.500
use." And what we did was we
completely reimagined the data.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.860
It's the same data,
but we've completely changed

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.400
the visual representation.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.400
We've chosen to use icons instead
of category names to save space.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.270
And that made room for these bar graphs,
which let you look at comparable numbers

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.300
immediately and know how you're doing.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.290
So in this case,
we're beating the pants off our forecast.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.850
So this is -- oh, yeah,
and we separated it into a revenue

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.300
section and a unit section.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.120
So this gives users a less cluttered
view and some visual cues to

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:41.300
help them read the data without
actually having to read the data.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.650
Which means that they can see
how we're doing and then put

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.530
it back in their pocket and go.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:50.070
This is the unit side where we
show some of our product families

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.180
how they're selling and some of
the services how we're doing.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.230
So we thought this was a pretty
good example of an iPhone app.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:01.470
It's focused just on today's data,
and we've summarized the data

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.400
to be what the user cares
about when they're on the go.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.080
It's fast.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.030
The whole app loads within five seconds,
and real-time updates

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.240
come within two seconds.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.000
and it's formatted.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.570
It's built pixel for pixel.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:16.750
This is the screen size.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.870
You don't have to zoom in or pan.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.940
Minimal scrolling.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.980
It's pretty nice.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:27.010
Now I'm going to talk a little bit
about developing these applications.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.890
And I'm going to do it from
the perspective I know best,

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.330
which is,
what do we do inside the company?

00:39:34.500 --> 00:40:56.600
[Transcript missing]

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.180
and David What we're really
excited about now are the new

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.180
web development technologies
that are available in iPhone 2.0.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.920
You can now do multi-touch
gesture events in the DOM,

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.140
in JavaScript.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.370
You can respond just like on click,
you can respond to on touch or on pinch,

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.100
I think.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.700
I don't know if they have a pinch.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.160
But you can react to multi-touch events.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.950
And then with hardware
accelerated CSS animation,

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:26.720
people will forget that
they're using a web app.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.460
They'll think they're
using a native application.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:35.110
And the new feature in WebKit is
client-side persistence.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.760
So if you need to store any files
or anything from a web application,

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.170
you can do it on the phone.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.100
So next I'd like to talk
about the dev tools.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:49.710
Now, if you saw the keynote yesterday,
Scott mentioned we've got a great

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.660
set of developer tools for you
to build native applications,

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.240
but he forgot one of my favorites.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.140
He forgot Dashcode.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:00.020
Dashcode is an amazing IDE for
building web applications,

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:01.940
and it's even better now.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.560
I don't know if you've
taken a look at it recently.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:08.830
And the iPhone simulator isn't just
for simulating your native apps.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:13.500
It has the mobile Safari in it,
and you can test your web applications

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.780
in the iPhone simulator as if you were
actually testing them on the phone.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.640
So Dashcode is a dual-mode editor.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.620
You can put your applications
together by writing them in code,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.360
or you can just drag and drop
components to edit--assemble

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.800
your application graphically.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.560
It's very much like
Interface Builder and Xcode.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.080
It has many iPhone templates
to get you started building an

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.360
iPhone application very quickly.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.400
And it has a rich component library.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.910
I can't say enough
nice things about this.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.390
The Dashcode team has done some amazing
work building reusable components that

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.480
you can put into your application so
that you don't have to worry about

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.090
how lists work or how buttons work.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.170
And they've got great sliding animations,
even flip animations.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.180
You can make it look like you spent
twice as much time on your application.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.300
and David Schmuck,
and I'm going to give you a little

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:05.700
bit of background on what DashCode is.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.790
DashCode has a great
debugging environment for

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:11.700
JavaScript and web applications,
which I know if you've done

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.780
any web app development,
you should be very pleased to

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.700
know that you can actually debug
JavaScript applications more

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:17.700
like native applications now.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.910
And if you want to,
DashCode even lets you do one-click

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.640
deployment to a web server.

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:26.010
All you have to do is
just work in DashCode,

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:31.430
test in the simulator,
and then hit share, and then it's out.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.430
Everybody knows about it.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.400
The iPhone simulator, like I said,
has the exact same version of

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.830
Safari that's on the phone.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:41.250
So you can see how the viewport
and rotation events and multitouch

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:45.190
gestures affect the application
when it's actually deployed.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:48.520
You can even see the real on-screen
keyboards that users see when

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:53.560
they're using their iPhones and
check out the home screen icon,

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.720
which you may build for your web
application so users can save

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.180
it right on their home screen.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.600
So, over about a year of--yeah,
a little over a year--of iPhone

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.100
development for the enterprise,
we've picked up a few tricks.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.960
I don't know if you know these yet,
but number one, if you can help it,

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.630
build a one-page application.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.840
One HTML page and then everything
happens asynchronously,

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.440
dynamic.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:22.380
This will save you a lot of bandwidth,
save you a lot of time.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.700
It's a lot easier to carry data
from screen to screen when you're

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.180
not actually having to take it
from one screen to another screen.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.860
And users get a better experience
because they don't have to

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.900
load more than one page.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:37.000
Once the app is there,
they don't have to wait ever again.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:40.460
and David Seifert are all great people.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.460
Separate your static content
like CSS and JavaScript.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.440
If it's not going to change, pull it out.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.850
Make them separate files and then
deliver them to your users with

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:51.240
HTTP compression so you can get
them to the users much faster.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.600
The iPhone will support it.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.020
It will unfold the code.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:58.520
It will load much faster, much quicker.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.660
New in WebKit every day practically
are some great technologies

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.050
to help you render with CSS.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.360
That means that you can
use things like borders,

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.440
gradients, transparency and shadows
-- these are just a few,

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.240
there's masks and reflections
too -- to actually build your

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:22.120
UI without loading a single image,
which is, I don't have to tell you,

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.040
much more lightweight.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.740
And then for the images that
you just can't get rid of,

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.860
the whiz-bang graphics that
you just can't replace,

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:34.100
you really need to use the
CSS sprite technique where you take,

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.360
if you're not familiar,
you take a little bit of a little bit of

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.170
a little bit of a little So you take all
of your different graphics and you stitch

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:42.330
them together into a single image file
and then you use CSS to determine which

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:47.300
part of that image shows on the screen
in any given position or any given time.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.500
That means you load one
image file instead of how

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:53.220
many images are in your app,
50?

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.600
I don't know.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.600
And it makes your app load much
faster and then it's precached.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.450
You know,
if you loaded the one image that's

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:05.360
all the images in the application you
don't have to load it again later.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.460
demo of how that, yeah, sorry.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:14.140
So finally, I'd like to talk very
briefly about deployment.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:18.900
As Steve mentioned yesterday,
enterprise IT groups can deploy

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:26.870
native applications for their
users on an internal site.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:30.510
Users visit the site,
they can open--they can

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:35.130
download the--your in-house
applications to their computer,

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:39.020
open them in iTunes and then
sideload them through it

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:40.880
to their tethered iPhones.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.770
And that's great.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.970
So we know how you can deploy
native applications without having

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.330
to be part of the public app store.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:54.220
You could be part of the public app
store and secure your application with

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.930
employee passwords if you wanted to.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.230
But as I said, we do web app deployment,
and we found that after we built

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.010
our first web app for the iPhone,
we had to find a place to host it,

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:10.120
which was actually surprisingly
difficult for a computer company.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:13.580
We have to find a machine,
and then we have to get into the network,

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.600
and then we have to get a domain for it,
and we have to go through

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.760
all this red tape,
and then we have to expose

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.080
it to the outside world,
because we wanted to make

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.080
it convenient for users,
so we had to poke a hole in the firewall,

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.000
and then we had to secure that hole so
only Apple employees could get into it.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.080
More bureaucracy.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.940
And then finally,
we had to tell everybody where we put it.

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.390
We had to send out a company-wide email
that we've got this great new app,

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.000
and now you can go there,
and here's a link to it.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.810
And then we had an app.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:45.340
Which was okay, but before we finished
building our second app,

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.950
we kind of realized this
process won't scale.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.340
We can't do this every time.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:53.460
This is twice as much time as it
took to develop the application

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.800
just to get it out to people.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.320
That's no good.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:48:01.990
So our solution was to build an
enterprise mobile application portal.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:08.300
We gave one URL for users to go to to
get all of the internal software that

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.480
we were going to deploy on the iPhone.

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:12.400
It means one entry point for security.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.390
Security is much happier now.

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.700
And it's one host for
our iPhone applications.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:21.930
So now that we have one host ready to go,
we can deploy applications

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.170
almost at will.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.200
and the rest of the team.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.840
And that means that users can bookmark
it right on their home screen.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.040
All their Apple apps are right here.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.780
They just touch it, it opens in Safari.

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.150
If they're not authenticated,
we stop them.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.980
Then you have to explain who you are.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.120
We take a name and password.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.800
There are actually several
options for authenticating users,

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.420
and Curtis will talk a lot
about that in just a minute.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.060
Once you've presented your credentials,
then we present you with the

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.400
mobile portal with links to all the
applications that we have to date.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.300
And then they're one one
touch away from the user.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:00.540
So to recap, focus your applications on
solving particular problems.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.980
You don't need to do everything.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:05.040
You just need to do something well.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.640
Load your applications
quick and run fast,

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.760
even if you're on 3G iPhones.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.580
Quicker is better.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.100
and format for mobile use.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.880
Remember, not just the screen,
the mobile context.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.060
Users are outside in the sunlight,
maybe they're driving in their car,

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.980
god forbid, but whatever it may be.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.770
Use familiar UI concepts and
people won't have to learn.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:32.140
One of the things that we are
doing now is cutting training time

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:36.790
out of all of our software by sort
of standardizing the experience.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.700
And you can integrate with the phone,
mail, other applications like Maps.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:46.060
Users really appreciate
those convenience touches.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.740
Definitely, definitely,
definitely go to Dash Code.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:56.440
Dash Code is gonna save you so much time,
it's not even funny.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.810
And the iPhone simulator,
it's not just for native applications,

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:02.710
it'll help you test your web app too.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.860
If you have a
server-oriented architecture,

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.910
your iPhone applications can
just hook into that if you

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:10.660
just build Java serverlets,
like we did.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.600
If you don't have a
service-oriented architecture,

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.600
this is the payoff.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.160
If you've been sort of holding out like,
well, I don't see why I should go through

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.450
this extra trouble to build a
service-oriented architecture if

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.300
I still have to do all this extra work.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.380
This is the payoff.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.030
This is where you get to reuse
stuff and then move for free.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.810
Cuts development time in half.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:33.760
And finally, if you're considering
developing web applications,

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.610
more than one web application
for your organization,

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:40.460
a web portal, a mobile web portal is
so nice for your users.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.280
All right, thanks, Steve.

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:54.560
This is a developers' conference.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.300
There are a ton of sessions
on developing for the iPhone.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:07.090
What we thought we'd do is put up a
few here that focus more on developing

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:11.030
web applications for the iPhone.

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:14.290
So if you have an interest in that,
I suggest you check out

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:14.290
these sessions here.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:21.600
The final speaker is going
to talk about secure access.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.590
So you've deployed iPhones,
you've deployed applications.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:29.710
Hopefully you thought upfront
about all the security issues.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.590
How do you securely connect to
phones in your organizations?

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.320
How do you make sure
the data is kept secure?

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:41.430
And luckily we have a ton of
technologies to help you do that,

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:47.600
ranging from VPN technology
to SSL to things like 802.1X,

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:53.540
things like remote wipe or
setting--configuring pin strength

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.380
or pin policies for your users.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:01.510
So to talk about that,
we have Curtis Galloway who will

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:04.520
come and fill us in on security.

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:05.540
Curtis?

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.460
Thanks, bud.

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.500
So I'm Curtis Galloway.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.500
I'm in the iPhone Engineering Department.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.800
And I'm going to talk a little
bit about security on the iPhone.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.680
So secure access for deploying
the iPhone in your organization,

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.930
you have your servers
with your data on it,

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.780
and you have iPhones
in your organization.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:39.870
And you want to be able to make sure that
the data on your servers is not getting

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:42.700
out of where you think it should be.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.140
You want to keep control of
that and keep control of your

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.760
assets that are based on that.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.720
The most basic part of that is
securing your wireless network,

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.600
because that's the primary
way that you're going to

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.580
access data from the iPhone.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:02.280
And we've already had
on the existing iPhone,

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.610
we have some amount of that,
but there's some new features about that.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.220
When you're outside of your -- Yeah.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:09.960
-- local enterprise,
you're going to access your

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.980
corporate network through VPN,
so we have some improvements there.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.460
And certificates are another
way of increasing the security

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:21.650
on the phone by improving the
identification of your users and of

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:24.400
the resources that they're accessing.

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:27.320
And also,
you're able to set security policies

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:31.620
for iPhones that are owned by your
enterprise so that you can have

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.970
increased control and confidence
over how they're being used.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:40.000
So first of all,
for Wi-Fi access security,

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.430
we've previously supported WEP,
WPA Personal, WPA2 Personal.

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:48.760
And in the new iPhone software release,
we've added enterprise-level

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:50.340
support for authentication.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.280
So now we have WPA Enterprise,
WPA2 Enterprise,

00:53:54.280 --> 00:54:00.260
and 802.1X authentication with EAP TLS,
EAP TTLS, and EAP Fast,

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.200
as well as PEEP and LEAP.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:05.580
And so that gives you a lot more
flexibility for authenticating

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.200
users on your local Wi-Fi network.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:13.050
So now you can, within your enterprise,
have a secure wireless connection

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.420
to access your corporate assets.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:21.660
On the VPN front,
we've previously had support for L2TP,

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:27.580
IPSec and PPTP with name and password,
token-based authentication.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.790
And that's been okay,
but a lot of you have been asking for

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:34.840
increased support for Cisco IPSec,
and so we have that now

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:38.100
in our enterprise-level
VPN support on the iPhone.

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:44.100
So you can use name and password,
secure ID tokens, crypto card tokens,

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.100
and certificate-based authentication
with your Cisco network.

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:53.360
And we think that is going to give you a
lot more flexibility with the equipment

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.260
that you're able to use for VPN access.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:03.600
In the VPN configuration front,
you can use the iPhone configuration

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:10.170
utility to configure your user's
VPN access so they don't have to

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:13.600
go into the UI and select it and
configure all that stuff on their own.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.620
You can simply create a configuration
profile for them that has all of the

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:22.690
settings for your company VPN that you
can deliver to them either on the web

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:29.520
or via e-mail or with tethered usage
of the iPhone configuration utility.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.690
For certificate usage,
we allow you now to install

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:37.490
root trust certificates for
your organization so that if you

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:42.640
have your own signing authority,
you can add your own root CA certificate

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:47.170
so that users can trust all of the
certificates generated by that.

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.410
That's very convenient.

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:53.370
And we can also allow you to
pre-install server certificates so

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.540
that they can trust your servers
implicitly without having any warnings.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:02.400
And identity certificates for
credentials for both VPN and Wi-Fi,

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.610
you can pre-configure those and
deliver them in a configuration

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:10.050
profile for the phone.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:16.120
For certificates,
we support PKCS #1 and the common file

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:21.900
formats for that for root CA certificates
and server identity certificates,

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:27.200
and also PKCS #12 for user
identity certificates,

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.400
which include the encrypted
private key inside of them.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:35.770
And those are easily generated
by a lot of different forms.

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:38.970
You can export them from keychain
access on a Mac if you already

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:40.400
have Macs in your organization.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:46.360
Most certificate authorities can already
generate these files and export them.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:50.730
And the iPhone configuration utility
can also import them and include

00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:55.170
them in a device profile so that it's
all packaged up together for you.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.980
and you can import raw certificate
files through Mail and Safari.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.600
So if you just have the
certificate file by itself,

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:06.600
you can add that as an attachment
and you're able to import that

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.350
just as if it were a configuration
profile with one certificate in it.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:11.390
So that's very convenient.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:15.510
It doesn't require any additional
tools for generating those.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.400
As you can see,
the iPhone configuration utility

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.290
gives you a tab to manage credentials.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:26.390
You can include multiple
certificates in a profile.

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:31.200
So if you have an identity certificate,
a root CA and some server certificates,

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:35.280
you can add those all together and
include them in one profile that you

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:38.590
can easily install on a user's device.

00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.900
And if you want to deploy the
certificates by themselves,

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:45.140
they just show up as
an attachment in email.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:48.070
So that's a very convenient
way to distribute them.

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:52.880
And then it gets installed just as if it
were a profile and looks just like that.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.880
It can be managed on the
phone in a similar fashion.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:59:47.900
[Transcript missing]

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:53.060
And we also have the ability to
do a remote wipe of the device.

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:58.400
So if it's lost or stolen,
we have that out in the world somewhere,

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.340
you can use Exchange Server to
actually send a wipe command and

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:07.040
guarantee that that device is
going to have all its data erased.

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:11.300
The actual flaming is a premium feature.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.340
So in summary, we have a number of new
features in the iPhone 2.0.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:24.300
We have secure Wi-Fi access with 802.11
Enterprise and 802.1X authentication.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:29.500
We have VPN access
improved with Cisco IPSec,

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:34.000
which can be configured
through configuration profiles.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.540
And certificates for trust and identity,
you can include root CA certificate.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.170
You can include user
identity certificates.

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:46.500
And we have the ability to set
security policies for your devices

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:51.340
for application installation,
for device restrictions and for remote

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.900
wipe to ensure the security of your data.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:58.890
That's it.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.670
Thanks, Curtis.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:12.160
And again, for more information around
security on the iPhone,

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.210
we have a number of sessions here.

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:18.910
And, you know, in conclusion,
I want to say that we're

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:22.900
very excited about the iPhone
moving into the enterprise.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:30.400
And we've had the pleasure
inside Apple of using the iPhone

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.700
for our enterprise for almost
the better part of a year now.

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:38.210
And you heard from our IT group
on some of our experiences

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:40.700
there and some tips and tricks.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.700
But we think we're just
at the start of this.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.530
And there's a ton of sessions
throughout the week and labs and

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.660
things you can go to to find out more
