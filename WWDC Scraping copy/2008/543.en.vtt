WEBVTT

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.860
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.700
My name is Matt McManuus,
and I'm from the

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.340
Final Cut Server engineering team.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.700
So today we're going to talk
about deploying Final Cut Server.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.620
So Final Cut Server is a
new technology from Apple.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.190
Just to give you an idea,
how many people actually

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.830
have Final Cut Server now?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.040
So about half of you,
so you probably have a few

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.310
questions about how you might
actually deploy it and use it.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
And for the rest of you,
you probably have some questions about

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.790
exactly what it is and what it does.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.440
So today,
I'm going to go over two main objectives.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.590
The first one is to

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.300
teach you about the mechanisms that are
involved in deploying Final Cut Server.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.530
And secondly, I'll show you some steps
involved in an actual deployment.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.620
So to do these, I'm going to go through
the following areas.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.500
I'll give you a brief
introduction to the product,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.840
and then I'll go over the key
components of Final Cut Server that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.760
are used in a deployment.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.130
Then we'll talk about the seven
steps of deploying Final Cut Server.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.840
I'll talk about post deployment,
so the care and feeding

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.870
of Final Cut Server.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.000
Then we'll talk about
some other considerations.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.450
And finally, we'll have some Q&A.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.210
So Final Cut Server was designed
to address two key areas.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.860
The first one is media asset management.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.270
And the second is workflow automation.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.520
So we'll talk about the
media asset management first.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.580
So the problem there is just the huge
amount of content that you find in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.080
a typical installation these days.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.080
Maybe it's on an XSAN or on a
FireWire drive on a shelf somewhere.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.730
But more and more,
there's all this file-based

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.660
media to deal with,
and even other media as well.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.200
So Final Cut Server enables
media asset cataloging.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.250
And that comprises of a few key areas.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.930
First of all, Final Cut Server is able
to catalog all file types.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.980
So any file type at all,
not just media files.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.220
It can also catalog Word documents, PDFs,
graphics, anything.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.940
And when it catalogs them,
it creates what we call

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.060
an asset out of it.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.910
And we'll see that in a
bit more detail later,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.150
as well as how you get stuff
in and out of Final Cut Server.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.400
We also have customizable
metadata for all of our assets.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.950
So you can actually choose what
metadata you have for a given asset,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.750
and you can add additional fields.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.340
And finally,
there's also the ability to read

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.930
metadata from both QuickTime files and
XMP metadata from other file formats.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.570
For certain file types,
we're able to automatically generate

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.290
small clip proxies and thumbnails.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.190
So in the case of a QuickTime file,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.950
will use Compressor to make a
H.264 smaller version of it,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.830
so you can actually use those
proxies to browse quickly and easily.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.600
And we have the ability to synchronize
automatically with the file system.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.740
So you can add devices
to Final Cut Server,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.440
which we'll see.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.200
And then as files are
added to those devices,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.420
Final Cut Server can
automatically catalog them and

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.950
add assets for the new files.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.930
Now once you've got
everything catalogued,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.290
you need to be able to find it.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.040
So in Final Cut Server we've got
the ability to have some powerful

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.320
search tools that allow you to search
on either a given metadata field,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.900
or where an asset is located,
or a number of other

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.600
different parameters.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.840
There's also the ability to have some
access controls and access restrictions,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.960
so you can limit what a given user
can see and do with the system.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.740
There's also the ability to then
integrate with archival systems.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.290
So you can move assets from, say,
an online XN environment

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.570
to a tape-based archive.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.040
Now,
workflow automation is another key area.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.510
And for this, we have what we call a
watch and respond system.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.990
And the idea is that we have
these actions or responses,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.220
for example,
a copy or a move to a device.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.090
And then we can apply those actions

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.770
to various events.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.700
For example,
if I change a piece of metadata,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.920
it might trigger actions which will copy,
convert to a H.264, send to a web server,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.130
and send an email.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.350
There's a simple way to
configure some of the workflow,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.300
and we'll see how we can do that
from the Assistant Preference pane.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.820
And as required,
you can build out some much

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.500
more complex workflows in our
advanced administration area.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.840
Now another key area is collaboration.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.300
So Final Cut Server enables
users to collaborate.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.960
There's the ability to have checking
in and checking out of assets,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.100
including Final Cut Pro projects.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:34.700
[Transcript missing]

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.680
which then enables me to revert back
to a previous version as required.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.650
And you can also set up
automated notifications,

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.300
so you can be notified when, say,
a project is checked in.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.930
And then you can use these to build
out a review and approve process.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:08.200
Final Cut Server is deployed
typically in an XServe environment.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.660
The requirement is Leopard.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.810
So Leopard Server or Leopard Client.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.930
So for sort of mid-size to
larger size installations,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.760
there might be an XServe
with a compressor farm

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.550
attached for the transcoding.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.750
and perhaps a XAN backend
or attached RAID storage.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.090
But the design of it is that it
can also run in small work groups.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.740
So if you've just got a few users,
or if you're a user who has, say,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.550
a Mac Pro and a laptop,
and you want to catalog and

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.710
share files and use some of the
features in Final Cut Server,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.140
you can install it just on a
Leopard client onto a Mac Pro.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.650
It's a client-server-based architecture.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.940
So you've got the server,
which installs on Leopard,

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.090
but the client is Java-based.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.950
And that can run on
either Tiger or Leopard,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:21.410
but it can also run on
Windows XP or Vista.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:28.530
So it enables your Windows users
to actually access the assets

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.910
and participate in perhaps the
review and approve process.

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.760
I'll talk a bit more
about the architecture.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.440
Once you've got
Final Cut Server installed,

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.790
You then connect it to devices.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.040
So the devices might be
XSAN or a network file server,

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.900
or perhaps some local storage.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.690
And once you've connected
to these devices,

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.330
the Java client accesses
Final Cut Server.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:08.040
And then can upload assets or
move assets from device to device,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.800
or perhaps download assets
to their local machine,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.080
or check out projects
to work on them locally.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.400
and this is all done over
the Ethernet network.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.440
Now, if you've got remote users,
you can give them access

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.420
to your assets as well.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.900
And the recommended approach
to do this is using a VPN.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:39.830
We do not recommend putting
Final Cut Server onto the open internet.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:48.790
Your assets are a bit too valuable to
be able to risk that type of access.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:58.250
So to talk a bit more about what's
actually part of Final Cut Server,

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.220
there's three main processes
that are installed.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.900
We've got this when you're
on the actual server.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.890
So we've got the store D,
or what we call the store server.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.640
That's the brains of Final Cut Server.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.410
So that coordinates all
of the client interaction.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.500
and the other things
that it's actually doing.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:30.770
It's got a PostgreSQL backend database,
so all of the metadata for the

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:36.170
assets and configuration and other
things are stored in that database.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.800
And there's also the LDS,
or the device server.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.700
And that takes care of the heavy lifting,
so the talking to devices and

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.360
to the transcoding engines.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.130
So to give you a bit more detail,
the client,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.380
the Java client when it's run up will
talk to the store server or store D,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:05.670
and all of the communication for
the searching or the changing of

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.480
metadata is done through that,
talking to that process.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:16.190
And then the delivery of assets or
the thumbnails comes from the LDS.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:24.000
Now Compressor is, which does all of the
transcoding in Final Cut Server,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.640
will talk to the LDS.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.510
And the LDS also talks
to the various devices.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:38.370
So any exchange with devices or moving
of content is done by that process.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:47.200
So, there's two ways to
administer Final Cut Server.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.990
The first way is through
the system preference pane.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.420
And that's available on the
server on which you installed

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.820
the Final Cut Server server.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:09.400
[Transcript missing]

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.600
You can access an administration area.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.830
And this allows you to do some
much more advanced administration.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.070
It's very flexible,
but that flexibility does

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.810
come with some complexity.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:31.250
So what you might find is as you deploy,
you might do a subset of deployment

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.300
actions in the system preference pane.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.840
For example, add devices or add some
simple automations.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.790
And then you might tweak
or add some more advanced

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.390
Workflows or change metadata
in the Java administration.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:13:00.330
So now I'll talk about some of the
key components of Final Cut Server.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.330
So firstly, we've got devices,
and then we've got the assets,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.030
productions, metadata,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:32.900
[Transcript missing]

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.850
So the devices, as we've seen,
can be added to Final Cut Server.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.440
and the devices can be
of a few different types.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.720
There's a local file system,
so you can add any directory on

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.320
the local machine as a device.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:02.820
You can also add a XSAN as a device,
as well as the network file systems.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:08.580
So there's support for AFP, SMB, NFS,
and FTP.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.230
And finally, there's a special device
type in Final Cut Server,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.710
and that's the content base.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.620
Now the Content Base is a managed
device which allows files to be

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.210
stored in a non-hierarchical way.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.380
and it also allows for files
to be stored without worrying

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.560
about file name collisions.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.990
Essentially, it's a bucket for files.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:48.250
So examples of how it's used is in
Final Cut Server there's a device

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.720
which is set up to store all of the
proxies which are generated for assets.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.540
So that proxy's device is a content base.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.270
In addition, the versions.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:04.460
So all of the versions of an asset
are stored in another content base.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.970
An example of how you might
actually use a content base in a

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.410
production is for a graphics library.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.250
So you might have a graphics
library which might have,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.700
say, 50,000, 100,000 images,
and you can just add them to a device

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:31.180
which is a content base without having
to worry about the file structure or...

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.960
Worrying about if, you know,
this file name is going

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.500
to overwrite this one.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.980
It's all taken care of
by Final Cut Server.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:48.160
So there's also a special idea that we've
got in Final Cut Server with Advices,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.830
and that's edit in place.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.980
So when you've got a device
which is not edit in place,

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:03.020
and the user tries to use a file,
the file will be cached

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.670
on a local machine.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.430
What edit in place allows is
if a user wants to use a file,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.780
for example,
they're using a QuickTime file

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.910
in a Final Cut Pro project,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:29.430
The edit in place allows a link directly
to the asset on a mounted file system.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.470
So the key example here is XAN.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.700
So when you add an XAN device,
edit in place is set up automatically.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.710
So when the file is used,
it's not cached, there's nothing which

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.730
goes across the network.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:51.070
A direct link is provided to
where the file is on the XAN.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:59.180
Now,
it is possible to add edit-in-place paths

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:07.100
[Transcript missing]

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.010
You can actually set that
up for edit in place,

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.680
so when users use the files,
they're not downloading locally.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.640
They're pointing directly to
where they are on the AFP share.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.150
and archive devices.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:33.990
So you can actually set up any of the
device types as an archive device.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.780
For example, SMB, AFP, all of these,
when you add a device,

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.680
there's the checkbox you
want to enable as an archive.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.130
So once you've actually
got an archive device,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:55.890
it becomes a target for moving a file,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.120
is the founder of XAN,
a software development company

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.540
that has been working on the
XAN system for over a decade.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.140
So now let's talk a bit about assets.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.010
So once you've got these devices set up,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.640
You can actually start to create assets.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:22.310
So an asset is created for
every file that is catalogued.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:31.730
An asset has a few very
key things about it.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.330
So it's got all the metadata.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.600
So we can see here some various metadata.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:44.160
So I've got title, category, description,
plus any additional metadata fields

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.360
that you want to add to the asset.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.580
In addition, the asset has resources.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.600
So it has links to files.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.860
The most important link for
a given asset is what we call

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.310
the primary representation.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:10.610
And this was the file that caused the
asset to be created in the first place.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:19.080
So it also has other resources,
which are the proxy representations.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.000
So for example, here we've got a clip
which has a thumbnail,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.970
a poster frame, and a clip proxy.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.950
So to read it, so the asset,
every asset has metadata

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.950
and it has these resources.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.000
An asset,
you can actually check it in and

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.330
check it out using the client.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.090
And you can also archive an asset.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:59.860
There's a special class of asset which
are created for Final Cut Pro projects.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.320
So when you upload a
Final Cut Pro project to the system,

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.580
it creates this
Final Cut Pro project asset.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:15.990
And the key difference with these assets
is they have what we call elements.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.230
And the element corresponds
to the contents of the bin

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.490
of the Final Cut Pro project.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:32.200
and each element has a
link to a master asset.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.600
So when you upload a
Final Cut Pro project,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.700
any assets which aren't already
managed by Final Cut Server will

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.180
be created as new assets.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:54.110
And the elements will be added to
the Final Cut Pro project asset.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.870
So here we can see I've got an element
which has a link back to a master asset.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:10.190
And it has,
tells me what project it's being used in.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:18.060
So, before I move off assets,
I'll just be clear about how

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.300
they can actually be generated.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.290
So,
you can do it in a few different ways.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.650
So, for a given device,
you can set up what we call a scan,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:34.080
and a scan will just catalog or
find any content on that device

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.510
or on a subfolder on that device.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.140
and you can set up these scans
on some kind of schedule.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.480
So perhaps every five minutes, every day,
whatever you desire.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:53.550
So every new file that these scans find,
it creates the asset.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.600
You can also create assets
when you actually upload a

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.700
file using the Java client.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:05.190
You can create assets when you put

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.440
A special folder,
which we call a watch folder,

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.570
and that can generate assets.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.790
And we'll see a bit of that later on.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.880
And finally, assets are generated
through this mechanism,

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.930
through uploading a
Final Cut Pro project.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.720
Final Cut Server analyzes that project.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.730
It sees what media files are
being used in the project.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:36.730
and it uploads them to the device if
they're not already on a managed device,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.430
and it creates assets for them.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.540
So that's assets.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.860
Now we'll talk a bit about productions.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:55.570
and productions in Final Cut Server is
just a container for assets.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.410
So you can make a new production,
and you can just add assets to it,

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.520
either manually, drag and drop,
or when you upload, you can choose,

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.290
I want to add these assets
into a given production.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.950
So these just allow you to
collect assets for a given task.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.960
So for perhaps a show or
some other little project,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.780
a production can be made
to collect all of that.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:32.120
And just like assets,
they have metadata associated with them.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.060
So let's actually talk
about that metadata.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.470
Metadata is very key to Final Cut Server.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.450
So we've seen that the metadata can be
used for either assets or productions,

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:52.590
but it also drives a lot of
actions inside of Final Cut Server.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:59.940
One might say it's a
metadata-driven piece of software.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.840
The key about metadata is there
are a few different levels when

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.390
you actually construct metadata
for assets or productions.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.860
At the top level are metadata sets.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.110
So a given asset or production

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.310
belongs to a metadata set.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:30.420
So when I upload a QuickTime file,
I actually choose what set

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.380
I'm gonna use for that asset.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:39.500
or when I do a scan,
I'm actually deciding for all the files

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.830
which are cataloged from the scan,
what metadata set they're

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.410
going to belong to.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.200
So sets are at the top level.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.970
Now sets can contain groups.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:59.780
And you can have multiple
groups for a given set.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.600
And then to the groups,
you can actually add the fields.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.770
So the description, keywords, job number,

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.840
So you've got the sets, the groups,
and the fields.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.870
And then for the actual, for the fields,
you can have lookups.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.550
And so a lookup allows
you to have a pull-down,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.400
and then allows you to do a few things.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:38.590
So you can actually restrict the choices
available for a given metadata field.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:45.670
It can simplify the searching
when users want to find assets.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.740
and it can also ensure that automations
are actually triggered correctly.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:57.210
So you might have a given automation
which is triggered off a given lookup.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:06.400
Now, metadata is also used to do
a few other special things.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:13.430
So there's some special metadata
groups that allow you to do things like

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:26.500
[Transcript missing]

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.990
And to administer the metadata,
you've got to use the

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.540
client administration.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.560
So if you want to add fields,
so forth and so on,

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.770
it's the client administration.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:50.100
And another key component is the
ability to then map from metadata in,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.990
as we saw, QuickTime or XMP,
into internal fields and back out.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.690
If that's an area of interest to you,
then I can highly recommend

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.530
a talk we've got tomorrow,
which will be discussing

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.020
that in some great depth.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.970
So now let's talk about
access restrictions.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.180
So with access restrictions,
you can limit what a given user

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.620
can actually do with the system.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:27.530
So the way these work is that you define
permission sets in Final Cut Server.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.600
and the permission set can restrict
access in the following ways.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:38.570
The first way is by
restricting on asset metadata.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.190
So I can say that this
given permission set

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:52.440
can only see things which are either,
say, approved, ready for review,

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.000
or completed.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.110
So when the status equals
any of those three things,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.600
then the user who is tied to that
permission set can only see those assets.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.600
And I'll show you some of that later.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.910
In addition,
you can restrict on production metadata.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:21.910
is the founder of Final Cut Server.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:21.910
He's been working with
us for over 20 years.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:21.910
He's

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:30.060
You can also restrict
on devices themselves.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.950
So for a given device,
you can say that this permission

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:39.820
set cannot delete from this device,
cannot even see assets on this device,

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:45.620
cannot create assets on this device.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:53.230
And finally, there's the ability to
restrict based upon traits.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:59.470
And this allows you to do some
things like turn off given metadata

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.910
sets for a given permission set.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:12.040
Once you've actually got
some permission sets built,

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.570
and Final Cut Server has about
five or six out of the box,

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.970
then you can actually
tie the permission sets

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.600
to Mac users and groups.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.620
So on Leopard Server,
this would tie directly

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:31.770
into Open Directory,
and on Leopard Client,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:36.400
You can do the same sort of
thing using the users and groups

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.190
in the system preference pane.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:47.130
So a user who's been put
into one of these groups,

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:51.550
will then get the permission set
that's been mapped to that group.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.900
And again, I'll show you some of
that a bit later on.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.300
The next key area I want to
talk about is transcoding.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:10.800
So Final Cut Server uses
Compressor for all of the

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:15.010
QuickTime and audio conversions.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:22.290
The great thing about this is you can
actually set up a compressor cluster to

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.090
increase the speed of the transcoding.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:37.250
And Final Cut Server handles all of the
still image conversion locally by itself.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:45.190
- I'm using some system processes,
but the idea is that if you

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.190
want to farm off all of the

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.510
QuickTime and audio conversions that
can be put off to a compressor cluster,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.890
and the Final Cut Server machine
will then take care of

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.180
just the image transcoding.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.900
You can make custom compressor
settings in Compressor,

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.910
and these can be added
to Final Cut Server.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.600
And you can also restrict what
compressor settings are actually

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.360
used by Final Cut Server itself.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.450
So you can say that
in a given deployment,

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.200
we're only actually going to use
four or five different settings.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.870
So you can actually turn
off the other settings.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:32.640
or perhaps as a play out server
which needs a particular kind of

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.940
QuickTime or some other format.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.400
So you can make sure that any
copies to that device only have

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.240
that particular setting available.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.710
and he can also extend Compressor
with the use of plugins.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.100
So if you wanted to go
out to different formats,

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:58.240
for example, Flash, MXF, GXF,
you could use the

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.720
Episode Pro plugin from Telestream.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:08.120
Or if you wanted to write out, say,
a DPX sequence,

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:11.160
you can use a Glue Tools plugin.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:18.160
Finally, you can use QuickTime components
to extend the ability

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.200
to read certain formats.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.800
So one example here
is with Windows Media.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.720
So you can actually use the flip for Mac.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:34.900
QuickTime component to enable
reading of Windows media files.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:44.700
Finally,
I want to talk about automations.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.300
Automations are tremendously powerful and
enable you to build out the workflows,

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:53.090
but there's quite a bit to them.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:01.750
The idea is that you can create
responses to perform actions,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:08.500
So copy and delete, or email,
and we'll see some examples of those.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:14.750
And then the responses are
triggered from either a watcher,

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:20.340
which is just a folder on a device
which Final Cut Server is looking at,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.310
or a schedule,

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:30.590
which is going to do something on either
a periodic or an absolute point in time.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.400
And finally, my favorite, subscriptions.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.880
And we'll go into a lot more
detail on subscriptions.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.110
So,
you can create some simple automations,

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.020
as we've seen using the
system preference pane,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.860
and as we've discussed,
go into far more detail using

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.310
the client administration.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.560
So let's talk a bit about responses.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.020
There are 14 different
responses available.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.160
For example, copy.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:09.150
So this response enables you to copy to
a given device and optionally transcode.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.740
So I could copy to a web
server and transcode to H264.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.510
Or copy to my Playout server
and transcode to ProRes.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.100
There's the ability to send an email.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:31.350
So you can send an email to a given user.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:38.760
and the powerful thing about this
response is it has metadata substitution.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.540
So you can actually
substitute in metadata from

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.690
the asset to build the email.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.440
There's also a scan response,
which I've discussed,

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:58.260
and this can be set up on a schedule
to catalog content on a given device.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.920
and an archive response,
so this can be triggered to

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.780
move an asset to an archive.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.780
One example of this is
you can actually have a,

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:19.940
set up a system to be able to, say,
archive everything older or everything

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:26.130
which has not been accessed for,
say, over 30 days on the XAN to archive.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:31.160
So you can build out
these sort of workflows.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:35.360
And there's also the delete response,
which you can attach,

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:37.870
which will delete a file.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.860
A set metadata response,
so you can actually set

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.500
metadata on a given asset.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.190
and my favorite,
the execute command or script response.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:36:00.650
So this enables you to execute a
executable on the local server.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.550
and again we'll be going
into much more detail on this

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.940
execute command or script in our
integration talk tomorrow at 10:30.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:20.210
And there are about seven or eight
other responses that you can call upon.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.250
So once you've actually
built out these responses,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.800
they can be triggered
in a number of ways.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.740
So we've seen the watches.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.720
So it's a

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:41.140
Any new or modified file on a
folder or subfolder of a device?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.760
can then do these various actions.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:48.470
So there might be a watch folder set up.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:53.800
to then convert to a given
format and send to a device.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.440
or to go into a content base,
send an email to the

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.630
reviewer to review it.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.410
There's also the subscription.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:14.790
So this is where we subscribe to
events on assets or productions.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.360
and we can filter on metadata.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.200
Now let me go into a
bit more detail here.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.820
So we've got the idea of events.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.950
Now, an event is something
like asset creation,

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.220
or

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.900
asset modification or asset deletion.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:41.720
So these are events in Final Cut Server.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:47.070
So when you set up a subscription,
it's actually looking for these events.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.630
So it's looking when assets are modified.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.000
And then you can further pare
down exactly what it's going

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.390
to trigger based upon metadata.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:09.510
So an example which I'll show
you later is to be able to...

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:18.750
sent out an email based upon when an
asset is set to say ready for review.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.570
So there's a subscription to
when an asset is modified,

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:29.760
and it's looking for when my status
field has changed to ready for review.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:37.700
And when all of that is matched,
then it actually does these responses

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.910
which have been attached to it.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.620
And finally, there's the schedule,
which is, as I said,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.430
can run on an absolute or periodic time.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.980
So that's the key components
of Final Cut Server.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:02.100
Now I'm going to talk a
little about deploying.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:10.390
And I've got here seven steps
of deploying Final Cut Server.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.770
These are the steps which I've built
up based upon my experience with both

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.850
Final Cut Server and its predecessors.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.760
and they're certainly not
to hard and fast rules.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.260
But what they allow is you to build
on the previous steps to actually

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.510
get to a successful deployment.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:42.770
So the first step is perhaps
the most critical one,

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.570
and that's actually planning.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.510
Because the actual,
you'll sort of see as we go through this,

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.520
that there's all these other
things that you need to configure,

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.270
and if you actually know what
you're trying to do before

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:03.810
you install the software,
you're much better off.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.500
Now the next step is just the
installation and initial configuration.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:16.400
So this is installing the software
onto an XServe or a Mac Pro.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.480
and doing some initial configurations.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:25.110
So, setting up a compressor cluster
and connecting up to it.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.470
or setting up what your
outgoing SMTP server is.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.680
Just these initial configuration steps.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:42.000
Then it's a matter of configuring
the metadata and transcode settings.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.140
So it's a matter of working out
what metadata you want to track,

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:51.760
you know, what metadata is used in
the facility at the moment,

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.640
and what you want to have in the assets.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.970
And then what Transcode
settings do you want to use?

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:03.890
So what are the house settings?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.230
What are the settings that are
required for my different devices?

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.850
All of that.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:18.970
Then it's adding devices and
setting up scans for those devices.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:25.560
And the reason that I do it
this way is that when I add

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.600
devices and setting up scans,
I'm actually going to be

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.130
using the metadata fields and
the transcode settings that

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.800
I created in the previous step.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:45.960
So once the devices are set up,
and the scans have started to happen,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:51.190
you can then add,
create the permission sets.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:59.370
and then configure your open
directory users to then tie

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.930
users to those permission sets.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:11.510
Then the next step is to start
configuring the workflows.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:19.810
So, to set up the watch folders,
or to set up the various

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.790
responses and triggers,

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:28.940
And finally, once all that's done,
configure the backups and

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.890
various notifications that
you want to get as an admin.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:41.760
This is not to say that once you've
actually gone through this deployment

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.500
that you can't change anything later.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.100
There's plenty of
post-configuration that can be done,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:54.090
and tuning which is done to actually get
to the kind of system that you're after.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:43:01.050
But these are just some steps to enable
you to go through the initial deployment.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.020
So let's talk about planning first.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:16.020
So the key point here is
there's certain questions that

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.390
You need to be able to answer
before you can move on.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.900
So that's things like, you know,
what are the devices that

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.700
I'm going to connect to?

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.100
What's the various
underlying infrastructure?

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:34.240
Then what transcode
formats am I going to use?

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.240
Or what various formats are
going to be used in the facility?

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.230
What are the users and groups?

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.260
So you might have, say,
some producers and some

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.860
editors and some managers.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.060
So it's a matter of thinking
about what sort of access do you

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.370
want to give to these people?

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:03.320
So you want to say the editors will want
to have access to perhaps all of the

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.980
raw material and other bits of material.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.750
And then the producers may
only see things which have been

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:18.990
completed or ready for review,
or perhaps an education environment.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:24.210
You can have different
groups for each class.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:28.510
and add the users to a given class,
and they can only see the content

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:33.470
which has been set up for that class.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:42.280
Then it's a matter of asking, you know,
what metadata do I want for my assets,

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:48.660
and what mappings do I want
to have from external formats?

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:57.490
So if you're using, for example,
a P2 camera or some other file-based

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.030
camera which supports metadata,
do I want to actually see

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.380
those fields in my assets?

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.930
Which ones do I want to get?

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.230
How do I want that to work?

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:13.300
What are the workflows?

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:19.060
How does a job get from
inception to completion?

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.870
or how do I want things to be submitted,
or what's my review and approve cycle?

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:35.060
Finally, you need to work out what the
backup and recovery policy will be.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.230
And I'll talk a bit
more about backup later.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:41.720
But that's, you know,
how are you going to get the system

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.960
back up and running after a fire?

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:56.460
I've got an example here,
which is Acme Productions.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.400
Just a typical production house.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.310
They've got some Final Cut Pro editors,
they've got some producers using

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.820
either MacBooks or Windows laptops,
and they need to output for a

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.290
Playout server and a website.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:15.760
So if I was actually going
to plan this deployment,

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.840
one of the first things I'll do
is actually make a system diagram,

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.560
which will sort of outline
the various devices.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.230
And the great thing here
is I can very easily see,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.140
oh, okay,
I need to add my web server as a device,

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.260
my Playout server.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.700
It needs these formats.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.030
And, oh, my XAN.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.560
And, oh, there's my compressor.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.640
All that sort of stuff.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.950
These allow you to sort
of quickly identify,

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.580
okay, here are my devices,
here's how it's going to set up.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.340
Then I'll build out some
sort of workflow diagram,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.320
so sketch out what the workflow is.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.670
Often I'll use paper and pen,
but I might sort of have,

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:59.060
so here's how a job gets
from start to finish.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.850
And here are the various
forks or various things.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.060
And so when I actually build
out these workflow diagrams,

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:09.200
I can quickly identify, oh,
I need an email response here,

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.770
and it's got to be triggered
by this piece of metadata.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:20.500
Or perhaps I need a copy response here to
then go out and convert to this format.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:28.190
So, it's by diagramming the system
and then talking to the users

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:35.700
to then work out the workflow,
that you can then start to build out

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.470
a list of the various things that you
want to configure in Final Cut Server.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:50.900
So now I'm actually going to
show you some of the next steps,

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:56.750
and we can see how they are on a real
Final Cut Server client server thing.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.290
So here is Final Cut Server.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.400
I have it installed already.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:11.290
The key note about the
installation is when you install,

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:17.340
there are a few key
things you need to decide.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:22.530
There's the idea of different profiles.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.930
There's like four or
five different profiles.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.160
Film, production, education.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:34.520
What these do is they set up
different metadata sets and groups.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.920
So we've seen what they are.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.240
They just allow for
subtly different profiles.

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:52.720
is the founder of Final Cut Server.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.010
He's a great guy, he's a great guy.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.010
He's a great guy.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.800
And the other key question in
the installation process is

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.160
where are my proxies going to go,
and where is my default

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.530
media going to go?

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:11.590
Now, I'll talk about this a bit later on,
but the key answer there

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.790
is it's very important.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.810
It needs to go on some rated storage.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:23.580
So either system drives on
an XSERV which are rated,

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:30.020
or on a direct attached promise
RAID unit or some other RAID unit,

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.120
or on some sort of XSAN.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.780
So here we have Final Cut Server.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:44.590
So this is the client
for Final Cut Server.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:53.350
and we can see here that
I've got my various assets.

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:53.350
So I've actually got

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.880
A few devices already connected
to this server and I've actually

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.160
started to scan those devices.

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:07.990
And so if I have a look at one of these,
I've got my asset with

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.880
my various metadata.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:15.840
and I can use my search tools
to be able to find things.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:22.780
So if I wanted to find all of my, say,
pipeline masters material,

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:29.450
I can use just my search tools
to find all my pipeline material.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.660
And once I've actually
built out a search,

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:38.450
I can also,
here I've got an advanced search area.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.190
So I can choose particular fields
that I want to actually search upon.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.140
So I can say, you know,
I want to see all my pipeline

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.880
material which is stored on my XN.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:56.810
Or I'd like to see any assets which
have been created in the last two hours.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.250
So once you actually start
to build these searches,

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:02.700
you can actually save them.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:09.260
So I can save my pipeline
search as a smart search.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.740
So I've got a button down
the bottom right-hand corner.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.440
Save a smart search.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.640
And it can say pipeline.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.250
And so now I've got my save search.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:33.610
Or I can see some other save searches,
my raw files and my assets,

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:35.700
so forth and so on.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:41.550
Now what I want to do is my step three,
which is configure metadata

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.360
and transcode settings.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:51.210
So right now,
I have some metadata for my assets.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:56.600
I've got my different metadata groups.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:58.600
Here are the groups.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:03.600
I've got asset, I've got a P2 info group,
where I'm mapping in

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.550
is the founder and
CEO of Final Cut Server.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:11.280
He's been working on a
number of new projects,

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:16.280
including the first one,
which is called Final Cut Server.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.010
He's been working on a
number of new projects,

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:25.010
including the first one,
which is called Final Cut Server.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.370
He's been working on a
number of new projects,

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.370
including the first one,
which is called Final Cut Server.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:31.990
So let's say I wanted to
add some fields and groups.

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:38.840
I can quite easily do that by going
to my Java administration over here.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:49.300
I get a little warning saying,
"Do I really want to do this?" Yes, I do.

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.800
I think I know what I'm doing.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:57.550
And so I've got the option here to add a

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:05.480
"My fields and my groups and do various
mappings as well as create lookups."

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:14.000
So let's say I wanted to create a field
in the group for my Acme productions.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.400
So I can quite,
let's say I wanted to have a job

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:23.200
number and also have a client lookup.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.240
So I've got different clients,
so I want to give the

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240
clients different access.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.950
So to do that, I can...

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:37.150
create a metadata field and call it, say,
job number.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:40.670
I've got different
options for my data type,

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:47.100
so it might be a Unicode or perhaps in
this case it's going to be an integer.

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.420
Give it different categories.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:55.840
So I've got my job number field,
and now I can add another

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.940
field which might be a client.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:02.210
I'll give it category of none.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.040
Fantastic.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:12.360
And then for once I actually
have these set up,

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.860
I can add different lookups.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
And it can make a lookup for client.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.460
And it might have, you know, XYZ.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:29.300
XYZ.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.390
Another one called ABC.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.980
ABC.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.720
So I've got two simple clients there.

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:43.860
Save Changes.

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:48.200
And now I can create my group for Acme.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:51.540
Make a metadata group, Acme.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.750
I can then choose my fields.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:55:01.270
So I've got my job number field,
and my client field.

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:08.260
And to the client,
I can actually assign it the

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.640
lookup which I had just made.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.660
So I can say, field lookup, client.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.760
I can add some actions.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:28.810
And then I can say that it's going
to be in my media metadata group.

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:37.250
So if I do that, and now have a look at
one of my media assets,

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:40.100
I'll now see I've got my Acme.

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.060
Metadata Group.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:46.250
This asset has metadata set of media,

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:52.670
And if I look at my Acme group,
I'll see I've now got my job number.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:56:01.600
[Transcript missing]

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.280
So that is the creating of the metadata.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:12.270
Then it can create transcode settings,
if I so chose,

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:14.220
in Compressor and add them in.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:20.290
We're running a bit short on time,
so I'm going to keep pushing through.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:29.140
So then the next step is
the adding of devices.

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:33.160
And as I said, the two different ways
of the administration.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.620
So if I go into--

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.900
My system preferences.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.620
I've got my
Final Cut Server administration.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.860
And so I've got a few
different options here.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.720
So I can assign my group permissions.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:04.280
So here I've got my permission sets
which I've created in Final Cut Server.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.390
And these are the local groups.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:31.800
And I can also add devices here.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:31.800
So let's say I wanted to add a -- this
content folder on my desktop as a device.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:31.800
So I can add Hit Plus,
and here we can see the

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:31.800
different device types.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:31.800
So I've got local network or XN.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:31.800
So this is going to be a local device.

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:36.120
I can call it content.

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:40.700
And I can just drag
in my local directory.

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:44.090
So now I've got it added as a device.

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:49.680
And in the next step, I can actually say,
is it an archive device?

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:53.520
No, not in this case,
but this is where I would set that up.

00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.140
Here I can set up the scan settings.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:04.180
Now, when I set up a scan
in the preference pane,

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:07.750
I'm scanning the entire device.

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:14.350
If I set up scans using
the client administration,

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:20.760
I have the ability to scan
different subfolders of a device.

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:28.330
Now the reason why that's important
is when I set up this scan here,

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.590
I do an ad-only scan every minute.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.280
I'm setting up a metadata set.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.930
So these are the various
sets that I have available.

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:38.020
Audio, document, graphic, media project.

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:41.880
And I can make additional sets,
but all of the assets on this

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:48.680
device are going to be cataloged
and added to my media metadata set.

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:57.790
So, if I wanted to have a bit
more fine-grained control,

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.580
What I'm able to do is to, in the...

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:11.500
Client administration to be able
to specify a subfolder on a device.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.910
And for that subfolder,
I can assign a different metadata set.

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:20.660
So for example, on an XN,
I might have graphics,

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:23.740
and I might have clips,
and I might have audio.

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:28.650
And I want different metadata sets
for each of those classes of asset.

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:36.990
So I'd set up different scans
pointing at my subfolders of my XN.

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:41.390
In addition, when I set up scans in
the Java administration,

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:45.790
I can do additional things
like set up filters.

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:51.640
So I can say,
only scan things which match

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:55.830
something ending in PSD or MOV.

00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.890
So if you want to scan items on a
given device and you only want to

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:06.090
grab the QuickTime files or the other

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.340
"If you want to use content, you know,
particular content,

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.380
you can restrict the scans in that way."

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:19.570
So the other,
so once we've actually added a device,

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.310
so I've actually set up my scan here.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.240
And in about a minute,
I'll actually see the scan

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.540
progressing in my job page.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.480
So the job page shows everything
that the server is doing.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.600
So whilst I'm waiting for that,
I can actually start to

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.530
think about my users.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:55.740
So if I want to say I've got my client,
I only want to see their stuff.

01:00:56.090 --> 01:01:02.330
So stuff which is XYZ,
which is marked as ready for review.

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:08.090
So that's all I want my clients to see.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.220
So I'm just going to mark two
or three assets like that now.

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:18.600
Ready for review and client is XYZ.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:28.090
So what I can then do is
build a permission set

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:39.440
which then restricts the permission
set to only allowing assets where my,

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.660
where I've got, so I can,
if I look at my permission sets,

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.390
I can duplicate my reviewer set.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.800
You might call this XYZ.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.600
And then in my asset filter,
I can say the status,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:08.100
I only want them to see ready for review.

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:16.210
So here I've set up my status
equals ready for review.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:34.500
[Transcript missing]

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:50.100
[Transcript missing]

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:59.800
So I can do things like add
my client to that filter.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.010
It will now show up in my permission set.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.910
So the steps from that point is,
I've got my permission set,

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:11.890
it's restricting to only seeing
those two or three assets.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:13.800
Then I create a group.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:22.860
I put my person from XYZ in that group,
so when they log in as that user,

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:25.800
they'll only be able to
see two or three assets.

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:30.180
Whatever has been marked
as ready for review,

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:34.180
where client equals XYZ.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.980
And so once I've actually
added my devices,

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.700
added my users and permissions,

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.820
It's then a matter of
configuring the workflow.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:56.670
So setting up my watches and my scans.

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:04.290
And a very simple example of
that is if I wanted a folder,

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.280
On my device here,
I could set up a folder

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.500
and send to play out,
for example.

01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:23.320
So then if I go to my
system preference pane,

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.850
I can really,
I can easily set up a new automation.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:37.390
And so this is gonna be
a file system watcher.

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:44.680
And I can give it a name, you know,
send to play out.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.420
And I can choose, you know,
what device I'm going to watch.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:51.910
Well, I'm going to watch my content
device and I'm going to look at

01:04:52.380 --> 01:05:00.520
the folder I created on there,
which will be sent to Playout.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:13.000
is the founder of Final Cut Server.

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:14.110
He's the founder of the
company that runs the

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.640
So I can add a copy response and
choose where it's going to go to.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.040
So it's going to go to my web server.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.300
It might go to a subfolder
on my web server.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.900
And then I can choose my
different transcode settings

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.070
that are set up for that device.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.810
So we can see here that we've got,
you know, four responses to choose

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.670
from in the pref pane,
and I can go into much

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:41.230
more detail in the...

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:49.200
[Transcript missing]

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:54.640
And finally, is the making of backups.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.180
Now with the backups,
Final Cut Server will

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.760
backup the database.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.300
And that's all.

01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:10.210
So you can actually set up point-in-time
backups by saying backup now.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.860
or you can actually schedule a backup.

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:17.470
So you can say, you know,
back up at 1:00 AM every night.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:24.000
And so once you've actually
set up those backups,

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:26.710
you're able to restore the
database and the various

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.240
preferences associated with it.

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.250
But that's it.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:35.550
So a very important part of a
backup is the ability to then

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:37.270
backup the other material.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:42.060
So that might sort of be
included in some system-wide

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.590
backup or other bits and pieces,
but when you need to restore,

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.680
you can restore the

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.680
is the founder of Final Cut Server.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:57.100
He's the founder of the backup
using the restore mechanism here.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.780
And as long as all of the files
which Final Cut Server was

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.000
It'll be just fine,
just as it was before you left.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.700
So if we go back to the slides.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:25.800
[Transcript missing]

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.110
So, monitoring is very, very important,
and there's a few different

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:31.800
mechanisms to do that.

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:37.350
So, there is the ability
to look at a job page,

01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:41.140
and a, there's also,
you can look at the logs in

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.880
the client administration.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.700
and you can look at the system logs.

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:50.440
In addition,
if particular trans codes are failing,

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:54.110
then you can look at a
compressor batch monitor.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.610
So,

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:02.370
And then if you want to actually
monitor particular failures,

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:07.380
so say you wanted to be notified
when a job to your very important

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.270
playout server had failed.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.990
You can set up a subscription
and an email to subscribe to

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:21.770
failures going to that device,
and send an email to an administrator.

01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:28.910
So you can configure alerts on events,
so a job failure, so forth and so on.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.860
And you should also use external
system tools to actually monitor the

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:37.800
health of the servers themselves.

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.920
And there's plenty of options
for doing that sort of things,

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.220
but things like, you know,
you want to know the disk usage,

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.400
the bandwidth utilization, etc.

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.960
Now the job page, so this is an example
of some jobs failing.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.440
Red is bad.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:01.580
And then if I double click on a red job,
I can actually see what the error was.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.060
So here I've got an error
submitting to Compressor.

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.030
So then I can actually
have a look in Compressor,

01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:10.640
and in this case,
my Compressor cluster had failed,

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.290
so I had to resolve that issue,
and then I can continue my transcoding.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.040
And there's also the logs in the
client administration which show

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:26.810
you exactly what the server is
doing at a given point in time.

01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:35.320
Finally, just a few other
considerations before I finish.

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:39.980
So the first one is scalability.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.970
So how does the system scale?

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:51.610
As we've seen,
Final Cut Server has a database backend.

01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:58.230
As assets are added to
the Final Cut Server,

01:09:58.310 --> 01:10:05.260
the resources required
for the database increase.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:15.000
It's a matter of increasing both the
memory and potentially the disk speed

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:21.970
and the processor speed to actually
be able to serve out more assets.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:30.640
It's hard to give some exact
figures on number of assets,

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:37.730
but the system has been tested
to go beyond millions of assets.

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:43.680
But there are some considerations
for search performance when you

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.640
do get to that kind of level.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:51.110
So there's two different searches,
you know, matches and contains.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.760
Matches quicker, contains slower.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.060
Because contains has to look across
all permutations of all fields,

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:02.710
whereas matches is much quicker.

01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:08.830
You can definitely get to a lot of
assets as long as the underlying

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:12.080
infrastructure is able to support that.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.800
and then how many users.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:18.520
Again, it's very dependent on
what the actual usage is.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:27.780
So what are the various usage patterns,
or are people using edit in place,

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.950
or are they actually
downloading through the network?

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:36.860
Support a large number
of users on a system,

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.330
but it depends on the
underlying infrastructure.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:42.600
And then finally, how much throughput?

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:44.800
Well, the great thing that we're
seeing is compressor can be

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.120
used to increase throughput.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.190
So as your throughput
requirements increase,

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:54.910
you can just add more nodes
to a compressor cluster.

01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:02.120
And just to talk a bit about hardware,
so again, the system is very scalable,

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.760
so you can install onto a Mac Pro,
or I've got it running

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.800
on a laptop over there.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:14.740
But for a medium to large deployment,
you really want a nice, fast 8-core XRF.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:21.070
You definitely want rated storage,
because you really don't want your

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:28.390
proxies or your other versions
to go away because a disk failed.

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:32.320
and roughly,
we're suggesting sort of about

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.580
eight gigabytes for every
quarter of a million assets.

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:41.270
and as required,
you can actually use technologies

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:45.960
like Ethernet link aggregation
to actually increase the possible

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.940
bandwidth to your system.

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:55.400
Finally,
I'll just talk a bit about one way

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.600
of setting up the hardware which
enables for a backup to be used.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.510
So, if I have Final Cut Server running
on an XServe,

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:11.440
And if I have all of my proxies
and other variable media on an

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.880
attached RAID unit or on an XAN,

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:21.900
If I'm backing up the database,
as we saw through the preference pane,

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:27.030
to that attached RAID or that XAN,

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:35.280
Then when that XServe fails,
I can very simply install

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.270
Final Cut Server on another XServe,

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:46.510
You know, restore the database,
and because all of the

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.510
references are the same,

01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:52.220
Then my system is back up and
running exactly as it was.

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:59.600
So it's not high availability,
but it's a very quick way

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.590
to restore operations.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.040
So that is,
that's all I'm going to talk about.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.980
So as I've plugged a few
times in the session so far,

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.540
we've got to talk tomorrow,
which is talking about

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.540
integrating with Final Cut Server.

01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:19.850
And that's in Russian Hill at 10:30.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:23.850
And we're going to go into much
more detail upon the integration

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:30.130
with things like Podcast Producer,
with Ruby on Rails, and with Spotlight.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.100
And then how to use things like
the Execute Script Response,

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:39.750
and much more detail upon the
Watch and Response system.

01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:44.920
and in relation to that,
just in the session in here afterwards,

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.450
there's actually a session on
how to build Rails applications.

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.710
So if you're going to come tomorrow,
you've got any interest in Rails,

01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:55.150
I can highly recommend that one.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.970
And we've also got two labs.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:02.500
So we've got a lab right after
this downstairs in the IT lab,

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.410
and there's one tomorrow at 2 o'clock.

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:12.000
Now, I think that I have,
just to summarize very quickly,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.960
we've got, so the key components to
Final Cut Server that we saw,

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:22.950
so we've got the media asset management
side and the workflow automation side.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.370
We've got the flexible
configuration options,

01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:32.200
and we've seen the possible steps
that you can use in a deployment.
