WEBVTT

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.300
Thanks everybody for coming.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.880
This is going to be a, oh there I am too,
more of a cursory overview,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.100
sort of an introduction into
our little Apple playground.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.460
Eric Ediger, technology supervisor
of the Media Arts Lab,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.020
TBWA.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.330
We're an all-Apple,
all-the-time advertising

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.390
agency and Apple is our client.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.780
So we'll talk a little bit about
some of the work that we've done.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.260
To start off with the introduction,
to kind of put it in perspective,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.270
advertising is kind of
like the music industry.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.720
It's owned by several
large conglomerates,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.680
most of which you may or
may not have heard of.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.870
At the top is Omnicom.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.100
And Omnicom is sort of this big,
one of the big six holding companies,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.590
one of the,
I think the largest holding company

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.110
in the world for advertising.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.730
They're into all kinds of weird and
strange things like public relations,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.180
advertising, marketing,
all that kind of stuff.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.440
If you've read a magazine or watched
TV for 15 minutes at any one time,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.100
you've probably seen something
that Omnicom has been involved in.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.900
They also own many advertising networks,
influential networks, including BBDO,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.570
DDB, and of course TBWA.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.120
And TBWA is a network,
it's basically a global

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.420
network of creative agencies.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.960
It's one of the most renowned
agencies in the world,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.460
one of the most decorated.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.770
In We got Agency Network of
the Year from Adweek Magazine.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.050
And if you're an enthusiast or
if you know anything about it,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.800
then you've probably heard
it one time or another,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.120
TBWA Chai Day.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.800
The TBWA Chai Day and Apple relationship
goes back about 25 years,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.100
all the way back to the
1984 ad and some other ads.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.780
So we've been around for that long.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.480
So we'll talk a little
bit about that as well.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.160
If you've been around
for any length of time,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.590
you've seen some of this advertising.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.740
We've been involved in it all,
including the famous,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.770
now infamous 1984 ad.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.150
So just to kind of give you
an idea of where we're at.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.310
Now, TBWA is slowly shifting the
paradigm of how agencies and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.500
brands communicate with audiences.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.300
They're using something
called media arts.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.040
And in 2006, they created something
called the Media Arts Lab.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.900
And the Media Arts Lab basically
was set up to house and explore new,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.300
creative, and innovative media.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.000
And it was a really, really, really,
really, really, creative technologies,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.520
new Apple technologies.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.360
And we're kind of a petri
dish of experimentation.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.200
We've got just about everything that
Apple has released commercially.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.040
We take it out of the box.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.420
We think of ways to integrate
it into our business.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.940
So we try to be fully integrated
with Apple products and services,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.880
hence our mailbox.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.510
So, to kind of give you an idea,
you're probably asking yourself, "Okay,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.160
two things.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.920
Number one, what is Media Arts,
and what is the Bear logo?" And so,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.800
like Apple,
we're very California-centric.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.780
We did a little agency video
that I'm going to show right now,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.800
and you're going to be introduced to
a gentleman by the name of Lee Clough.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.800
Lee Clough is the
godfather of advertising.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.730
He's essentially the
Steve Jobs of advertising.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.030
He was there since the
beginning of the 1984 ad,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.800
the Taco Bell dog, the Energizer bunny,
pedigree campaign.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.790
He's been there to oversee, basically,
some really great advertising.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.260
So, a little bit about that and the Bear.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.170
Keep in mind, as you watch this,
we are an advertising agency.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.850
We're a little bit
eccentric and creative.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.700
So you're from California, right?

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.890
So you understand this California thing.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.380
It's always been a place where
people kind of think creatively,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.760
and this idea of media arts, I mean,
this is the right place for

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.020
that kind of thinking to go on,
don't you think?

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.730
Yeah.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.740
I mean,
you probably had something to do with it.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.740
I mean, you're the bear, right?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.500
[Transcript missing]

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.250
There's this misunderstanding that
media arts is like all about new media,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.780
but it's really not.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.500
Everything is media.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.230
We love television,
we love making a film to go to Sundance,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.680
but then if you come to
visit the brand on the web,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.700
that might be a different
kind of experience,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.700
you know, when you go on the web.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.710
The thing about all media arts
is there's all this media,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:50.150
but then it now is in the hands
of the artist to make sure that it

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.150
all has to be artistically done,
because people are very discriminating.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.600
And you have to understand that
everybody now is an audience.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.300
They aren't just, you know,
kind of these slugs sitting

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.400
on a couch having to watch
three television channels.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.140
They have a total array of
media at their disposal.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.160
And they're an audience waiting to either
reject you or applaud if you do something

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.890
smart or entertaining or witty or funny.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.080
"The key to Apple is to kind of think
in kind of a total media mindset.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.370
Apple's always been
brilliant at packaging.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:36.780
When you open an Apple product,
it's media, it's communicating something,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.190
it makes you feel something.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.190
I mean, do you get kind of emotional
when you open an iPod box?"

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.040
Everybody says you're here
after everybody goes home.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.400
You're kind of a hard-working bear.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.970
♪ Mr.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.980

Just wanna have fun.

Just try to have fun.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.230
What Media Arts is?

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360
You can explain this to
me later if you'd like.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:43.080
So what we're hoping to take away
today is sort of a broad brush overview

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.580
of all the integration that we use,
Apple technologies,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.170
everything from address book to XServe,
all kinds of technologies from

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.470
Apple TV to XServe Raid and everything
in between including iPhones and

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.930
MacBook Airs and all that kind of thing.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.950
What we're going to skip today,
hopefully you didn't come in here for any

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.400
kind of service oriented architecture,
sub-enterprise resource

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.000
management or anything like that.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.350
I actually, that's not a web picture.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.240
I actually put that together
on a dry erase marker,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.730
dry erase board about a year ago trying
to figure out how do we align ourselves

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.570
using Apple technology with the business
vision and all that kind of stuff and

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.780
realize that it's not really necessary.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.460
The Apple, the technology allows
us to deploy systems,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.170
to beta test and to do all
the things that we need to do

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.670
without all this IT news speak.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.180
So we'll cover kind of the basics.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.890
Kind of the four areas,
well actually I want

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.540
to talk about this too.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.430
That's kind of an interesting
philosophy that Apple's taken

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.250
toward the enterprise environment
so we'll talk about our experience

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.880
with this particular philosophy.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.280
communication, productivity,
of course creativity.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.120
We are an advertising agency.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.450
And then how do we
administer all of this stuff?

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.920
How do we wrap it up and keep it working?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.730
And then we'll have a
little Q&A afterwards.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.890
You can ask me all kinds of things.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.480
So pens and paper handy as
we go through the first one,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.350
which is communication.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.820
Now a conversation about
communication in Apple obviously

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.810
has to start with the iPhone.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.020
And there's been a lot of
interesting announcements.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.410
But if you look back a year
and you remember all of the

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.260
headlines that were coming out,
everybody's sort of telling companies

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.640
to stay away from the iPhone.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.160
It's not enterprise ready.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.940
It's not ready for the workplace, blah,
blah, blah, all this kind of stuff.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.030
Well, we embraced it day one.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.150
In fact,
it was a mandate that the executives

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.720
made it very clear that if the
iPhone didn't work on day one,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.820
that I would be looking
for work on day two.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.990
So we made sure to have that.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.420
We made sure to have that working.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.700
And we did that with a lot of
involvement from our infrastructure.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.760
We had immediate corporate IT support.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.920
We had it hooked up to email.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.960
We used IMAP so that we can
sync between workstations.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.370
Obviously, the announcements this week,
this takes on a whole

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.430
new meaning with sync,
push, push calendaring, address server,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.460
all this kind of stuff.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.230
So we also had Wi-Fi access
in the building immediately.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.580
We began forwarding our extensions to the
iPhone because there's no reason to carry

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.970
around two phones when you've got an
iPhone that does all this amazing stuff.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.610
We've now moved into
web app development and,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.120
of course, application development.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.360
We were syncing with
all of the Apple apps,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.720
iCal and Adverse Book,
and we'll talk a little

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.140
bit more about that later,
too.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.990
But the interesting thing happened
when we actually sat down and we

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.610
figured out ways to integrate the
iPhone more deeply into our business.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.840
And at TBWA Media Arts Lab and
TBWA in general,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.410
we have access to a lot of
web content-based information

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.960
services for HR and IT.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:06.340
And now using the Cisco VPN clients
on the new iPhone software package,

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.100
we can access things
like an employee manager,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.390
a static asset management database,
and even, I don't know if you can see it,

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:12.990
the Novell.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:13:10.800
[Transcript missing]

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.700
So we have this sort of,
this big comprehensive set

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.040
of tools available to us.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.780
So the notion of no
IT departments required,

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:29.370
that might sound a little extreme,
but you can do whatever is required

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.490
of you as an IT administrator
with the iPhone from the

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:32.490
comfort of your own hammock.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.300
So, giving another nod to some
of our communication tools,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.130
some of the obvious.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.390
There's iWeb, there's Mail,
there's iChat, Safari,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.790
and then some not-so-obvious
ways to communicate:

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.970
.Mac, which is now MobileMe,
the Apple TV, iTunes,

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.100
and a Mac Mini there.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.790
You'll be seeing a lot of the Mac Mini.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:16:22.800
[Transcript missing]

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:28.060
But again, we'll move on and we'll talk
about a Mac Mini and iChat server.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.740
I love the Mac Mini because it's
an affordable piece of equipment

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.820
that will run OS X server that
you can beta test small groups,

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.700
deploy software,
and if something breaks or

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.500
if something starts burning,
you're not going to ruin or worry about

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.060
damaging a piece of real hardware.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.900
It's great.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.300
You can have multiple ones set up,
and we've got a few.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.870
So you'll see the
Mac Mini a couple of times.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.160
And when we use OS X services
like iChat server,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.760
we can create an internal
directory that's secure,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.130
and with some of the
features like auto buddy ad,

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.510
when new people are
entered into the directory,

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.860
they're automatically populated
to everybody's buddy list so

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.590
that you have immediate access
to everybody in the directory.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.600
Of course,
server to server federation means that

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.110
if you're using another XMPP compliant
server or Google or something like that,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.250
Google Teams and Enterprise,
that you can also federate and access,

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.620
your users can access and
chat with people on the

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.710
Google Teams and Enterprises as well.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.650
or any other XMPP compliant server.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.950
So that's communication,
we move on to productivity now.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.760
And the productivity part
of this is basically good

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.900
communication with good tools.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.320
And the good tools are somewhat obvious.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.900
Everybody, we know Mail, we know iCal,
and some of the ones listed there.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:07.270
And some not so obvious ones, again,
the Apple TV, the Mac Mini directory,

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:12.040
app utility, not to be confused
with directory utility,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.190
and iTunes.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.900
And so to give a nod to the
workhorse as the foundation,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.430
of course, Mail,
it's kind of hard to remember

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.190
what was life like before email.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.290
We use IMAP,
we sync between workstations, webmail.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.960
We also set up as our default RSS reader.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.140
So Mail becomes, again,
it's a one-stop shop for any

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.800
of the aggregate news updates,
any of the web publishing that we do,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.460
mail contents to this page.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.290
Address book,
we tie that into our LDAP system so that

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:49.090
we have access to our worldwide contacts.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:55.360
iCal, of course, has ushered in a whole
new era of collaboration.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.660
And this is between teams,
this is executives and assistants.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.570
Now scheduling meetings is
not an oxymoron anymore.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.400
You can really schedule
knowing who's available,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.440
what's available.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.800
And with this directory
application utility,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.500
it's not, I haven't really heard
it talked about a lot,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.510
but it's really neat because
it offers resource planning.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.840
You can have a map of where people are,
you can see what's available,

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.060
who's available.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.020
You can do everything from conference
rooms to conference phones.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.840
We'll talk a little bit more
about that in administration.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.780
But most of it's based
on open source coding,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.560
and so it syncs really well.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.220
And of course, when I say sync now,
I mean push, because I don't know

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.320
if there's a push logo,
but it syncs really well with that.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.940
It syncs really well with
all of the Apple hardware,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.440
everything from the Big Iron,
the XServe RAIDs,

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.700
all the way down to the iPhone.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.660
So to give another nod to
some of our workhorses,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.740
we use iTunes Keynote and
Aperture to great length.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.300
And iTunes is one of those not
so obvious productivity tools.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.100
But it really has saved us
a lot of time and money.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.170
We don't often have a lot of time to
get songs together for commercials.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.370
Literally,
sometimes it boils down to one day to

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.000
get a song together for a commercial.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.420
And iTunes allows us to
do that very quickly.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.770
Part of the way it does that, of course,
is we can find music

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.720
from almost any artist,
and we can own it seconds later.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.420
It's become far easier to find it on
iTunes and pay the buck to download

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.320
it than it is to track down the CD,
rip the CD, if you can find it,

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.680
and get the right tune.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.750
The artists that Indie Spotlights allows
us to find new artists and new material,

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.220
a lot of the artists that we
find for our advertisements,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.610
they don't have a record
contract when we find them.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.690
Of course, that changes dramatically once
they're used in a commercial.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:51.060
And then we can find artists
that match a specific genre.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.800
So instead of having to go to a music
search warehouse and pay all that

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.650
money to search music over time,
we can do that.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.660
We can scour through thousands and
thousands of songs to find the one

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.600
that sort of expresses Apple's vision.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.250
And you probably recognize
some of these here.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.690
Some of these.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.060
Well, I could hum them,
but I don't know if it'd be the same.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:31.040
Let's try one more click.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.710
That's a little bit about iTunes.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:29.880
That's how we've integrated
it into our workflow,

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.010
something that's not one of
those obvious productivity tools.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.010
The next one is Keynote,
and Keynote has become sort of the

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.200
The empty bucket where we
throw all of our ideas,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.100
and it doesn't matter
what the end result is.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.740
It could be print,
it could be a presentation,

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:39.740
it could be a commercial.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.100
All of the ideas start in Keynote.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:49.560
And it's simply replaced PowerPoint--
it actually did that a while ago--

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.700
as the de facto presentation tool.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.940
It's sort of clean,
tasteful-looking presentations,

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.900
hopefully like this one.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.120
It's versatile.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.160
You can export to a number
of different formats,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:07.350
Swift files, QuickTime, PDF,
and you can also-- it's got

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.760
great iLife integration.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.730
So you can pull music, video,
pictures from iPhoto.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.200
So Keynote's there every step of the way.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.900
The other sort of
unsung hero is Aperture.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.000
And Aperture has been a real lifesaver.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.130
It's, again, it's one of those,
"What was life like

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.060
before Aperture?" Well,
as one of our senior designers says,

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.000
it's been a life-saving
addition to our process.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.760
And what life was like before
Aperture during our photo shoots,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.100
basically,
when we do a silhouette photo shoot,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.700
a lot of people think that that's CGI.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.800
And there is some CGI involved in,
you know,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.340
creating the mask and the silhouette
at the end of the commercial.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.360
But before that,
we actually shoot live people dancing.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.930
We turn on the music,
we audition dancers, they go dance,

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.240
we take pictures.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.960
And we take up to 30,000
photos per silhouette shoot.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.800
And each one of those used to be printed
out on an 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.010
So we would, you know,
scour the floor with

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.060
30,000 silhouette shoots.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.590
And art directors would come around
and mark off the ones that they wanted.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:23.280
To find the final eight that are
eventually used in a silhouette campaign.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.130
So now,
selects are made during the shoot,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.440
and as the process goes on,
selects are even made faster,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.340
sort of on the fly, as it were.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.520
And a process that used to take two to
three weeks now takes a couple of days.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.390
And the results, again,
some of the work that we've done,

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.810
everybody probably recognizes,
it's hard to get away from it now,

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:45.310
but this, all of these silhouette ads

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:51.690
are a product of using Aperture
to get all of those great shots.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.160
Now the Apple TV.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.000
Again,
something that was created for the house,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:04.120
something that was envisioned as a
centerpiece of your multimedia center.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.080
And we opened up the box and we said,
okay, how can we implement this?

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.660
What would save us time, energy, money?

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.900
What would make our lives easier?

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.410
Well, what we found was is that it
doesn't require any IT help.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.220
So your assistants,
your low-level people,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.860
your non-IT people can set
this up without any help.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.340
It's got a gorgeous interface.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.610
It doesn't conflict or interfere
with the meeting content.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.880
There's one-click formatting
from either iTunes or QuickTime.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:43.470
And what we did is we used the
TV functionality for TV shows

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.660
to organize all our content.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.960
So if you can see it up there.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.440
So we have shows, season number,
episode ID, episode number.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.840
That's pretty fine-grained control
over how you organize your content.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.510
So instead of burning DVDs,
in which case you would

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.100
burn a DVD and then,
oh, crap,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.120
now I've got to reorder the content.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.560
So you have to reorder it,
and then you've got to burn it again.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.960
Or you can just go on the fly
and give it a different name,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.600
give it a different ID number,
reorganize it.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.640
And, of course,
it's high-definition ready.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.000
You don't have to mess with the settings.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.500
It just works with any kind of,
let's see, what have we got?

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.000
We've got 60-inch plasmas.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.720
We've got little tiny screens,
and it works with everything.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.240
So we found that to be really intuitive.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.680
And also it allows us to
hold on to a complete digital

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.620
archive of what we've presented.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.580
So what we presented last week,
the week before, the month before,

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.390
assuming you have the room on it,
you can always see what

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.020
was presented before.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.820
So we've got one of these in
every major conference room.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:55.810
And when we go to Cupertino and
we present to the decision makers,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.900
we use an Apple TV, and that's how we
display all of our stuff.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.660
So now we can't live without it,
actually.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.440
So that's the Apple TV.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.960
And there goes productivity.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.390
So now we get to creativity.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.750
We're an advertising agency,
and we make stuff.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.700
That's essentially our purpose there.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.820
And we take the same kind of
philosophy as the Apple engineers,

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:28.020
where we go from mind to concept,
handheld concept, very fast.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.900
The idea is that we want to find
out right away if something works

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.200
or if something doesn't work.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:39.540
So we're set up to throw a lot of ideas
against the wall and see what sticks.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.100
And Final Cut is really
where the magic happens.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.060
And yes, we use Adobe CS3.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.150
We use Adobe for our print ads.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.550
We use it for mechanicals.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.240
The Adobe CS3 suite is
definitely something that we use.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.800
But Final Cut is where we can
really quickly test things.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.480
We can do things in-house.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.880
We can edit it in-house.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:05.180
And we can get stuff, again,
from mind to concept very quickly.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.280
And I've got a video here.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.550
It's another little
quick video about that.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.720
So that's a little,
just a sort of a insight to how we

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.220
shoot stuff and how we demo stuff.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.080
And we really do shoot
right there in our kitchen,

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.490
depending on the day.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:09.490
We then,

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:18.830
Then we have our editors,
we edit in-house, we do a, again,

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.410
it's getting that mind to concept fast.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.000
It's kind of a,
Apple allows us to create sort

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.670
of a culture of creativity,
where we can really come up with a

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:33.170
lot of ideas and there's a lot of
cross pollination between advertising,

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:36.250
the creative people and even
the administrative people,

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.260
even the IT people,
we get a chance to create a little bit

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.280
and to get into the mix a little bit.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.180
So that's a little bit about
the creative and again,

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.920
if you've watched television
for more than 15 minutes,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.460
you'll probably recognize
one or more of these.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.980
And this is what Final Cut,
Apple technology makes this possible.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.700
It allows us the flexibility,
the freedom to really come up with

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.070
a lot of these ideas and throw
them up against the wall there.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.750
So now to the administration part.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:14.810
This is where it gets really interesting,
I promise.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.460
Behind all the administration,
behind all of this, of course,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.320
is OS X Server.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:26.020
And all of the peripheral applications,
software, hardware,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.100
everything that we use,
it all ties in very nicely.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.070
And so we'll kind of go
piece by piece through it.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.860
We'll start off with the iChat, iCal,
and Time Machine, which is kind of more

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.840
the workhorse day-to-day.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.600
The really unique thing
this time with Leopard is

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.350
Apple took a different approach,
and it allowed you to set up

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.480
an advanced configuration,
a workgroup configuration,

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.880
and a standard configuration.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.260
And if you do advanced configuration,
you can't do standard.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.540
And if you do workgroup,
you better be careful if you do advanced,

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.660
because you're not sure what might
happen if you push the wrong button.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:09.640
But the standard and workgroup
server preferences are very simple.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.740
It's very straightforward.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.130
You create the accounts
in your directory,

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.010
and you turn the services on,
and you turn the services on, or off.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.600
As we'll see, the big buttons,
not a lot of mucking

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.350
around going on here.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.090
And that's kind of a change from
the server client dynamic that

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.730
we're all used to as administrators.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.720
And to talk about iChat Server, again,
we use a Mac Mini.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.980
We're 100 people.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.720
We don't need the
investment in the big iron,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.840
and that's another
thing to take away here,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.640
is that you can invest in some.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.690
Without breaking the bank,
you can set the stuff up.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:53.500
And some of the preferences, again,
a big on and off button, and it's huge.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.620
It's like a big light switch.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.880
And there's not a lot of mucking around.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.810
Again,
automatically make all users buddies.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.000
Okay, we like that.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.380
Okay.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.770
Enable server-to-server communication.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.310
That's great, too,
if you want to federate with other

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.510
XMPP servers we talked about earlier,
like Google, Enterprise Teams,

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.400
that sort of thing.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.230
Of course,
if you want to log and archive all chats,

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.120
that's great.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.920
The unique thing, though,
or the unique or interesting thing,

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.450
is that the server admin,
the typical server admin

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.220
that's been there all the time,
it's not much different.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.880
There's not a lot of fine-grained
stuff to mess around with.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.300
You've got the same host certificates,
authentication.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.620
You can choose what servers you want to
federate with and which ones you don't.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.790
But the XMPP federation allows you,
again,

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:47.020
if you've got groups or if you've got
servers running on a different platform,

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:56.050
as long as it's XMPP compliant
and not behind a firewall,

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:56.440
Apple says you should be
able to federate with it.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.260
Talking about the server
admin preferences,

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.500
again, this is a unique position
that Apple takes.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.810
In the standard and workgroup mode,
the server preferences

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.230
allow you to auto-buddy add.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.040
We saw that earlier.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.260
If you use the advanced configuration,
that button is not there.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.680
How do you do it?

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.560
Well, you need to know this
little command line.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.070
And that then populates everybody's
buddy list with the new members.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.380
So where did I find that?

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.060
I found that in the
discussions.apple.com.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.980
So we'll talk a little bit about that,
too.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:39.520
The discussion groups have been sort of
an integral part of our beta testing,

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.020
of our implementation.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.240
We go there often.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.180
We post.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:43.680
We reply.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.920
So that's a good place to go.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.300
I-Cal Server.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.110
Again, Mac Mini.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.070
We can put this on an X-Serve.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.250
Again, we're not that big yet.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.800
We're still beta testing a few things.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.600
We've got some various pods on it.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.730
The server preferences, again,
big light switch.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.820
On.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.250
Not much else to think about.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.260
Limit calendar event size,
limit total calendar.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.180
I don't know what kind of
executives you're used to,

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.540
but my executives don't like
to be told that they have a

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.530
limit to what they can do,
so we don't mess with that.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:26.420
And the server admin preferences
are not much different.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.940
Again, very, very simple.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.790
There's the data source or data store,
which is sort of automatic.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.300
You shouldn't go messing
around with that anyway.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.200
Your maximum quota is authentication,
host name, port, SSL.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.650
The real magic with iCal happens
on the client preference side,

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.490
and that's what we're looking at now.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:51.000
This is the iCal preferences,
and you can set up an account.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.510
You can set how often you check.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.920
You can set your availability,
the server settings.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.820
That's not very exciting.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.880
The real magic happens with delegation.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.120
This is where you decide whose calendar
I see and who sees my calendar.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.110
And do they see it,
or do they get to see it,

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.440
and they get to add to it?

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:12.480
And so,
I think that's a really important thing.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:14.740
Yeah, that's the delegation.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.160
And so what's interesting, again,
is the power is on the client side,

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.590
not the server side.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.990
So that's a little bit of a
different position for that.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.950
And speaking in terms of calendaring,
there's -- we're kind of in

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:33.010
a unique time because now,
again, with the announcements this week,

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.060
there's been a lot of talk
about push calendaring,

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.220
push e-mail, push calendaring,
push address books.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.140
Everything's push.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.690
Well, not everybody up to this
day supported CalDAV,

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.700
and so the way that we were
able to sync our iCal calendars,

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.040
we used something called Busy Sync.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.380
And that allowed us to pick the calendars
that we want to publish to Google,

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.540
and then it's a two-way
sync configuration.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.040
Whatever you added on the web interface
showed up in your iCal and vice versa.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:07.090
And down the road, when and if, you know,
Google decides to support

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.650
CalDAV or MobileMe,
which will currently support that,

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.520
obviously, that might change.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.140
But currently,
what this allows us to do is

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.600
have our iCal clients and our
Google web interface be the same,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.800
so that no matter who -- where we are,
using Google Teams and Enterprise,

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.330
if that's what you use,
then it all syncs up great.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.840
The directory app utility.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.520
No, directory, yes,
directory app utility.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.840
Not to be confused with
directory utility utility.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.870
This is great because, again,
you authenticate to the server,

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.260
to the directory.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.840
It has your information, email,
your Jabra account,

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.010
which should already be auto-added,
and then it's got a map down there.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.700
So if you wanted to come talk to me,
you could hit the map,

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.860
and then you could see where I sat.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.460
You could also see conference rooms,
conference phones.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.380
Where are these things?

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.760
So, again,
it's great for resource planning,

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.660
and it ties right into iCal server.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.260
You can see who's available,
when they're available,

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:16.030
and it's... I like to map things a lot.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.550
Always know where you are.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.810
Again, a lot of information in
the discussion groups.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.220
Time Machine, okay.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.110
Time Machine.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.510
We have a couple of different
configurations for Time Machine,

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.450
but again, server preferences.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:39.820
Allow, not allow.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:41.630
Skip system files.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.860
We have our own build.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.530
We use NetBoot to restore machines
that we're setting up that are

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.750
brand new or that have gone
busted and need to be replaced.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.090
So we skip system files.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.340
We're only interested
in a user's home folder,

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:02.440
typically sans music and movies,
but that's all set up client side.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:08.720
And the server admin
preferences are even simpler.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.990
There's not a lot to mess around with.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.350
You enable Time Machine backup
destination and you set

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:17.720
the correct permissions.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.920
Just as an aside,
I don't know if you can see it there,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.910
com.apple_vpn.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.180
I tried changing that to
what I thought was correct,

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:32.690
which is com.apple_backup,
and that kept going back to access

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.820
VPN because it shares the same group ID.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.940
I think it's 251.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:41.500
So the access VPN, the backup,
and the chats groups all share

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.580
the same group ID number,
but it works.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:47.240
So that may be fixed in
an upcoming solution.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.170
So we also have a
couple of time capsules.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.070
We have two terabyte time capsules
that we use to backup people daily.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.000
We use the airport utility.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.000
We use the airport utility
to administer that.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.520
And it's great.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.330
We don't use any wireless.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.380
We're not set up for wireless then.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.760
So we use all ethernet.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.440
We use groups.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.700
And even if you use groups,
it's great because it's

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.400
network access storage.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.450
It allows people a secure place
to backup so that one person can't

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.740
log in and get access to what
somebody else has been backing up.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:24.460
But it also still affords
a public area to put stuff.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:25.760
So that's why it's called do not use it.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.980
Do not use.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.430
But we use groups, no guest access.

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:34.580
The users, you log in for the first time,
you select it as your backup drive,

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.360
and you configure your
client how you want it.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:41.110
And then it works pretty well.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.090
So now, some of the workhorses
for our asset management:

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.650
Apple Remote Desktop, LandRev.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.920
Apple Remote Desktop, again,
one of those things,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:03.800
if you've ever worked at a help desk or
if you've ever had to manage a help desk,

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.090
how you manage remote sites,
that all changed with

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:05.090
Apple Remote Desktop.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:05.090
And so,

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.480
The way we use it,
it's kind of a very quick side.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.730
I always have it open,
and I've got it labeled so that

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:14.830
I can see at a really quick glance,
okay, red is old machines,

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.920
green are new machines.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.490
You can list it.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.710
You can do reporting, smart lists.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.180
You can also do command line.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.500
You can install applications.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.880
It's really quick.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.720
It's really quick,
and I wouldn't say dirty.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.240
It's actually been a
lifesaver in some instances.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.880
And, of course, it allows you to control
multiple machines with one click.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:48.420
and LANREV, and I'm going to get off
the notes for a minute.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.720
LANREV is kind of an interesting
tool because it's true

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.800
enterprise-worthy asset management.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.640
You can, the interface,
despite what it looks like up there,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.660
it's actually really intuitive.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.230
It's really elegant.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.380
You can do computer tracking,
server flexibility.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.920
We've got staging servers
in L.A., New York,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.930
and San Francisco.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.880
They all talk to one another.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.940
It's customizable.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:21.020
The developers are really good
at adding features that you need.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.220
There's a lot of custom fields
that you can put information in.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.080
License management,
who's got what applications,

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.800
how many do we have, what's legal,
what's not legal.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.020
Software distribution,
it's really convenient.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.180
Hardware management.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:41.280
And just yesterday,
over at the Hotel Monaco

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.700
in one of the rooms,
we've been looking for a machine that

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.600
went missing on the last lease return.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:52.640
And one of my colleagues
had LANREV pulled up,

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.320
and he says,
I've been trying to track this

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.990
machine for about three months now.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.200
And he had it set so that you
could take pictures of the desktop.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.650
So we looked at the desktop,
and we tried to figure out, okay,

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.580
who's got this machine?

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.480
Where are they logging in?

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.120
That sort of thing.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.700
We finally narrowed it down.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.100
We found out who it was.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.700
And I just thought it was amazing.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.980
So computer tracking is
not just in the office.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.390
If this machine goes missing,
and essentially if they do

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.010
anything except wipe the machine,
if they delete accounts

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.300
and add a new account,
you'll be able to track this machine.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.570
So I'm actually,
I can't wait to get back to the

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.200
office and give this person a call.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.000
We'll find out what his opinion
is of the missing machine.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:42.240
So this is our edit bay room, and it's,
that's a, it's not a very nice picture,

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.680
but you get an idea,
this is one of our machine rooms.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.620
We have XSERV RAIDs, XSERVs,
that's our Qlogic.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.320
This is what we use for
our testing and broadcast,

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.310
pre-production stuff.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:58.240
All of our Final Cut edit bays
are connected by fiber optics.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.680
We use, again,
Qlogic Sandbox 5200 series switches,

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.080
blazing fast.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.430
The XSERV RAID volume
mounts on the desktop,

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.580
they use it for scratch disks.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.300
We back it up using an HP tape
library backbone software,

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.340
nothing too fancy about that.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.680
And if you're new or if you're,
if you've not experienced XSAN,

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.520
XSAN is great.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:30.140
It just simply allows you to put
together a lot of separate data storage.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.320
In this case,
we've got three XSERV RAIDs.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.620
You put them together,
and it's very fast and it handles

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.910
a lot of data really well.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.700
So that's administration, I think.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.760
We're at the conclusion.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.980
So hopefully,
what we're gonna take away from here,

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.260
number one, the iPhone,
it's gonna change the

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.960
way that you do business,
it's gonna change the way, in fact,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:08.850
it has for us with 3G, with the speeds,
with the web interface, with email,

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.720
with push, active sync,
all of this stuff.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:16.200
It's now truly an enterprise
ready piece of technology.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.360
I've been immersed in
it for now for a year,

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:23.240
and it's hard for me to remember, like,
what did I have to do before this?

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.900
Well, I had to answer a lot
of cell phone calls,

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.020
carry a laptop around,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:33.120
And now with application development,
and Apple is, I think they're pushing,

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.400
I think the number is 10
million for this year,

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.220
and I've heard even estimates 18 million.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:39.640
Who knows, that's a lot.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:46.770
So I think you can expect your user base
to start demanding iPhone integration.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.640
My advice is start talking about it,
to your executives before they

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.950
start talking about it to you.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.030
Let them know that you're on the ball,
and that you know this is

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.340
something great to have.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.920
Also,

00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.710
Beta test.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.900
Test early, test small, and often.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.150
That's the great thing,
and that's why I brought up

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:06.420
the Mac Mini all the time.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.980
It doesn't take a big investment.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:13.580
You don't have to invest in the big
iron to set up small deployments,

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:18.260
small pods, and if it goes bust,
you're not hurting anybody but

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.200
yourself and your time and energy.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:25.060
Once you get something set up,
you can expand it beyond.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:28.000
Then you can invest into the XRs,
the XR raids,

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.600
or whatever sort of enterprise-class
storage system that you have available.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.840
We can beta test more efficiently
because it doesn't take a lot of money.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.410
It doesn't take an army
of people to do this.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.510
The Media Arts Lab is two
people in the IT department.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.110
TBWA, I think, has a lot more.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.610
Also, mix-and-match technologies.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.990
Apple technologies are
meant to work in concert,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.640
just like the Apple get a Mac says.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.220
They work together, and hopefully,
as we saw earlier,

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.600
when we combined A and B to get C,
that it was something new and

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.620
unexpected and practical that
helped us either communicate or

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.060
be productive or be creative.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:20.650
An experiment with different
kinds of implementations.

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:22.180
You know, if you take the time to
try things and test things,

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:22.180
I think you'd be surprised
at what you find.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.040
Get to know the groups.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:26.920
Everybody needs a helping hand, support.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.710
And that's what the discussion
groups are there for.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.600
Discussion groups are a wealth
of experience and expertise.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.600
It's open all the time.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.410
It's free.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.960
And I typically ask questions
under a different name and answer

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.310
questions under my own name.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:45.430
So I'm definitely up there.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.520
It definitely is something worth doing.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.480
And there's the discussions
again at Apple.com.
