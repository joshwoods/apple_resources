WEBVTT

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.680
So while I'm bringing our panel up,
if you'd like to begin lining

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.890
up at the microphone so we can
call on you if you have questions

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.170
about what we're going to do.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.220
First, I'd like to bring up Greg Neagle,
Senior Systems Engineer for Disney.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.520
In reverse order, Nigel Kersten,
Systems Administrator,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.800
Mac Operations for Google.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.600
And Joel Rennic, Consulting Engineer,
Manager, Enterprise for Apple.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.830
Thank you.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.100
My name is Schoun Regan.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
I'm the provider development
manager for Apple,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.690
and we're going to have a good time.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:12.700
So the first question that I have
for our esteemed panel here is the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.190
favorite line from their favorite movie.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.750
And while they're thinking about that,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.650
We're going to give a chance
to answer in just a minute.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.670
If when we have topics that come up,
if somebody has a different way

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.170
of doing something or you would
like to add to the conversation,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.770
Chris Bledsoe, he's right over there,
has a handheld mic so he'll

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.580
be playing Phil Donahue,
running around, sticking it in your face.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.690
Just raise your hand and Chris will
sprint over there as fast as he can.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.770
We ask that you don't stick
your leg out and trip Chris.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.030
So the first question was,
who's Phil Donahue?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.580
Thanks for playing the feud.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.150
You can get a lovely
home version of the game.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.200
and I'll see you next year.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.710
All right.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.320
All right.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.900
Favorite line, Greg?

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.000
I've got a bad feeling about this.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.470
Nigel?

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.310
I don't think you want to do that, Dave.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.980
Is this being recorded?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.760
Well, that won't do the voice very well.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.510
Say hello to my little friend.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.200
Nobody's up at the mics yet?

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.800
So we'll start-- Session's over.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.340
Thanks.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.920
Yep.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.420
We'll start it off this way.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.920
Greg?

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.110
So I have a question for Nigel.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.700
Actually, Nigel and I have been talking
on and off during the session,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.530
and I think Nigel has a really...

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.280
important idea about best practices
about the future of systems

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.960
administration and something about
his position at Google makes him kind

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.460
of uniquely qualified or at least
in the right kind of environment

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.930
to express this really well.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.220
So I'm just going to -- it's not
really a question to Nigel so much as

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.830
an opportunity for Nigel to elaborate
on his grand unification plan for

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.020
how all Mac systems administration
must be done in the future.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.400
Since Google is going to own
everything shortly anyway,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.560
it will be done his way.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.980
So Nigel.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.080
Thank you for that buck, Greg.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.910
So I guess what I wanted to get
across was that I spent the best

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.090
part of a decade in higher education
before I finally escaped and came

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.820
to Google about a year or so ago.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.420
And one thing I really noticed,
this was my first experience working

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.480
with a software development company,
not working in education,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.150
not doing consulting for
advertising firms and the other

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.220
sort of bits and pieces I'd done,
but working for a company whose core

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.580
business was software development.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.580
And so we have a lot of infrastructure
at Google and some of you might have

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.740
seen at Google I/O Guido van Rossum
came out and demonstrated bits of how

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.620
Google does code reviews internally.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.840
We have a lot of big tools already in
place that are for software development,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.920
for code reviews, release processes.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.880
And coming there as a
systems administrator,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.060
these things are amazing.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.760
And this is the sort of stuff we
don't do as systems administrators.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.780
We still sort of manage
things in quite a complex way.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.360
And I think that's what
I'm really interested in.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.890
We don't do these things
in quite a clunky,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.940
manual manner.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.070
We don't tend to do peer review
and release processes as well

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.360
as software developers do.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.720
And I think there's an awful lot we
can learn from software development

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.900
as systems administrators that
we're not necessarily doing now.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.710
One kind of side correlate to this
is that just the same way that

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.990
programmers rarely write assembly
or machine code anymore and use

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.460
highly abstracted APIs because it's
faster and it's more efficient.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.340
I think that's the way systems
administration is heading.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.030
Tools like Puppet and CFEngine that
are based around managing resources

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.690
on your machines and not just
managing everything at the file level,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.340
like a big tripwire system.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.770
You're a member of the reformed
Rad Mind Administrators Club.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.160
Which Greg has not yet
been made a member of.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.090
Along those lines is something that we've
been trying to do when we reach out to a

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.850
lot of customers that we've talked about,
is building that whole methodology and

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.400
kind of heritage of administration on the
OS X side that I think has been missing.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.820
Partially because a lot of you were
thrown into this environment not having

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.900
necessarily come from a traditional or
a real system administrator background,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.100
but being thrown into OS X to do it just
because you were the one that didn't

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.000
raise your hand fast enough to say no.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.420
And so we miss a lot of things,
and a big part of the conversations

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.500
that we have when we go out,
especially around client management,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.360
are the creation of things
like service level agreements.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.700
And kind of defining the relationship
between you as the administrator,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.130
the users, and management,
and understanding where the

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.980
boundaries of all that are.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.380
All too often in the past,
the Mac administrator was the

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.090
person that made everything work.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.830
And so if it was the phone that broke,
or if it was the iPod,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.130
or if it was the internet,
you were called in just to make it work.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.780
And so you had no real concept
of where your boundaries were,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.760
and you were getting pulled into
a lot of different directions,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.860
and perhaps spinning your
wheels into doing things that

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.190
just shouldn't have been there.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.660
Constantly I get a lot of questions about
how can I prevent my user from doing

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.120
this or doing that or something else?

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.000
And he said, well,
why don't you just enforce a policy?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.170
If you can't do it
through the system itself,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.580
say, hey, don't do that.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.730
And that's where, for the stupid things,
you can actually draw a

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.640
service level agreement.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.940
And define what's actually handled
by HR as a fireable offense,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.780
if they do that,
and what's actually handled

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.660
by policy on the system,
and what's handled by you as an admin,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.170
and so that you're not having to
run around and try to do everything.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.510
These two gentlemen up here have
much different system administration

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.820
methodologies for their users,
whereas Greg,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.360
and he'll correct me if I go astray here,
is a much more locked-down environment.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.470
You control a lot of the
pieces using RadMind,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.280
making sure that everything's
the same way all the time.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.800
Nigel is much more of a, you know,
you're not going to be able to do

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.800
everything the same way all the time.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.980
And you're going to
have to have a lot of,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.980
I think Gartner calls it the
consumer of the cafeteria approach,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.440
where you kind of hand the machine out,
and you wave,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.260
and you really hope that they
do some of the right things.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.940
And you can put some pieces and
some administration in there to

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.680
kind of whack files and put them
back into shape when things change.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.910
But it's a very different methodology
for kind of managing this.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.200
You know,
we're kind of coining some terms in here,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.690
fences, not walls.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.280
And that's where Nigel is,
with more fences around

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.500
appropriate behavior and asking
you not to do other things.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.740
We see this a lot in
the high-tech industry.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.380
If you're a high-tech developer,
you want to have root access on your box.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.780
You get paid a lot of money,
they want to make you happy,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.380
you're the lifeblood of the system.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.380
So they're happy to give that to you.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.380
But then how do you manage them?

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.880
How do you guide them into the
appropriate level of behavior?

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.370
On the other hand,
if you're working with some

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.260
of the creatives that don't
care about root access,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.710
they just want everything to work,
and they're not really aware of

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.310
how the things work under the hood,
it's almost best if you try to

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.160
remove as much of the complexity
as possible away from them.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.150
So that all of the stuff
is being done on the spot.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.230
All of the stuff is being
done under the covers,

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.160
and they can't get dangerous,
and they can't break things on their own.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.420
And I think all too often people spend
too much time trying to get somewhere

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.430
in the middle when they really need
to sit down and kind of define which

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.160
kind of methodology are we going into.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Because there's definitely
pluses and minuses on both.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
Yeah, I'd agree with that.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.070
And just to add to that,
the system administration still tends

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.160
to be reactive instead of proactive.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.580
You don't go to the desktop
until the end of the day.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.580
You don't go to the desktop
until the user has a problem.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.580
How do you know the user has a problem?

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.580
Well, they call the help desk.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.260
Well, there are several tools
that Mac OS X already has

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.580
built in to alert you,
launch D scripts,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.580
watching items if something goes wrong
before that user picks up the phone.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.580
So you can be proactive.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.510
And I think going along with
what Greg and what Nigel do,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.570
that also is an excellent way
to better manage your time.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.580
So with that said, thank you.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.580
With that said,
we'll go ahead and start over here.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.900
Yeah,
I'm curious with the panel if you guys

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.580
have looked at idle framework and seen
if that works in your enterprise or not.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.640
It's a framework.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.000
It's ITIL.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.670
So when I escaped from
Higher Education Australia,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.410
we were constantly being
threatened with the ITIL stick,

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.590
but I managed to leave just
before it landed on my back.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.070
We do get some questions about this,
especially if they've come from

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.020
that more very methodical system
administration side of things.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.390
And typically,
how many people know what ITIL is?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.870
Actually,
that's a lot more than I expected.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.010
Most Mac administrators don't.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.470
But you're right,
that is kind of setting a service-level

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.540
agreement and kind of setting some
of those basic standards in there.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.210
What I don't like about ITIL is it's
so massive and so encompassing that it

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.000
really swallows a lot of people whole.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.440
So of those that knew what ITIL was,
who's actually implemented it?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.300
That's a much smaller set of hands.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.800
But we are looking at that.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.650
So at Apple, when we talk about,
and specifically we've built

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.970
this around client management,
we're kind of looking at scales

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.790
and differing ways of codifying and
identifying how well you're doing.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.770
Because a lot of the,
probably a big question a

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.510
lot of you have here is,
well, what is everybody else doing?

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.940
What's the complete scope
of what I could be doing?

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.510
You know, some people might be doing a
little bit of managed policy,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.880
some people might be doing an
awful lot of managed policy.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.060
What's a good level?

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.000
What's a good scope?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.310
So we've actually gone
through and kind of,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.600
in the spirit of ITIL,
but not really ITIL,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.500
kind of condensed it down to about
eight or nine different categories

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.690
and are ranking people on them.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.470
And they go from one to five,
but that doesn't necessarily

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.840
mean that five is better.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.240
For example,
if you're following Greg's model,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.530
you might have a very,
very high level of policy

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.000
locking everybody down.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.800
And so we might say on the policy level,
you're a five.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.620
But on Nigel's model,
where it's a little more free-flowing,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.720
we might knock you
down to a one or a two.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.820
That doesn't necessarily
mean that you're bad,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.110
but it does mean that you
have a different methodology

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.170
of approaching this.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.900
And so what we've been trying
to do at Apple is to go through

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.360
and actually provide a dollar
value behind each of those.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.600
So if you want to go and
do a five on deployment,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.450
which is getting them imaged at the
factory or whatever else and pushed out,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.210
then your costs per support
are going to go down,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.680
because you're doing a lot less
work when the box arrives in.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.150
If you want to do a high
level of policy management,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.100
your costs might go down as well,
because your users aren't getting into

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.680
things they shouldn't be getting into.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.960
On the other hand,
if you do a low level of user management,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.340
your productivity might go up,
or your user satisfaction might go up.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.470
So there's definitely
trade-offs between all of these.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.060
But we're trying to develop a body
of evidence that shows if we do this

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.290
kind of methodology for deployment,
we do this kind of methodology

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.620
for directory services,
this kind of methodology here,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.020
that I can kind of ballpark how many --
and we might equate it back to dollars.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.770
We might equate it back to number
of administrators per machine.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.300
I mean,
because that's a lot of the numbers

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.650
that people like to throw around.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.420
Gartner says 1 to 250 for the PC.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.230
We'd like to say 1 to 500 for the Macs.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.020
And we have some customers that
are well into the 1 to 1500,

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.250
1 to 2000 range.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.330
And so I'm looking at that ITIL stuff.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.520
People that are hardcore
ITIL get mad at me when I say,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.650
well, it's complicated and
big and all the rest.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.750
But I agree,
more of that needs to be in here.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.820
And Chris keeps waving his
hand like there's a comment.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.080
Yeah, comment on the ITIL,
because I took a look at it and went, ah,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.410
and wanted to run out of the room.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.160
There are a number of resources
out there for doing that.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.310
There's a number of resources
out there for doing what could

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.090
be better called ITIL Lite.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.460
And basically they say, do this first,
do this second, do this third,

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.910
because you'll get more of the
value out of ITIL than just

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.160
starting from one end of the,
what is it,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.400
eight volumes or something now and
working your way to the other end.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.930
So if you're heading in that
direction and someone says

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.200
you need to start doing ITIL,
start looking for those

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.800
kinds of resources out there.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
Baby steps.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.690
If I can make a quick comment.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.450
I found that I think assistant
administrators It is useful to use ITIL.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.680
I think the intimidating part is figuring
out you might only need three of volume

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.260
one and forget the rest of the volumes.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.710
And then the other thing is I think
when you're talking to the CIOs

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.960
and CEOs of implementing ITIL,
it's strategic never to mention ITIL.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:27.130
Because, you know,
they Google it and then they look at

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.060
the volumes and I think they get shit.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.560
Overwhelmed, yeah.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.640
And they're shit scared.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.480
Sorry.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.630
I didn't have -- Okay.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.640
Yes.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.330
Just wanted to start a conversation here.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.290
How many people are allowing their
users to be admins and -- Stop there.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.290
Okay.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.380
Admins.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.790
Okay, wait.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.560
Forced to let them run as admins.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.600
Okay.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.090
Forced by the people
who sign your checks.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:01.730
Why?

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.600
Why do they need to be admins?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.600
Adobe!

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.000
What is Adobe?

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.770
Why do you need an admin to be,
to use Adobe products?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.200
Okay, truth finally wins.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.200
Faculty with laptops.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.590
All right, so, so, no, no,
so there are legitimate reasons to,

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.950
to give admin to your users,
but make sure that it's not you're

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.200
just taking the lazy way out.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.200
Sorry, lazy person in the back there.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200
Yeah.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.190
Once you give a user admin,
you can never take it away.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.190
What's the other piece here, question?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.200
And how many people have root enabled?

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.200
So, so we're, we're not done with this.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.150
All right.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.200
So, root.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.900
So, following up part, part C,
how many people could be an admin

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.650
but run as a non-admin because
they know that's a better way?

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.660
Ah, well, this is starting to get better.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.840
So when a lot of people
ask me about this,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.400
should I run as an admin or a non-admin,
I run as a non-admin.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.940
I know my admin user password,
but I run as a non-admin on my box.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.450
And that way,
when a user comes up and says, you know,

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.720
I really need admin
privileges because of this,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.520
I can say, well, I run as a non-admin,
so let's talk about why you need this.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.170
Or let's create an account
that you don't log in as.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.610
It's not your normal, everyday,
day-to-day account,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.120
but you can elevate those
permissions if you want to.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.560
And that way,
it gives you even more of a firewall

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.640
between a non-admin and an admin account.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.060
I see.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.800
I set that up on a couple users
and then they just ended up running

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.670
as that local admin account.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.980
And you know, some users were good with
that and some users just,

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.590
well, hell, I'm going to do it this way.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.580
Well, so okay, and so there's also the
concept of neutered admins,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.040
right?

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.340
So you can play with the
rights and the rules.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.300
You can do it in some cases.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.360
Yeah, but it gets so, so crafty.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.670
You've got so many holes.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.800
It's Swiss cheesy.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.040
Yeah, he's sitting over there.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.520
All right.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.020
I mean, it's much better to take a
non-admin and elevate him than

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.020
try to go the other way around.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.170
I'm sorry you have
trouble figuring that out,

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:13.620
Joel.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.000
Well, I'll just say who's up front
and who's in the audience,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.570
all right?

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.520
The problem gets to be,
particularly when you've got high-end

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.750
creative types like lots of scientists,
that to really do it right and

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.800
take away those privileges,
skip the lazy comment.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.140
You have to figure out exactly
what they need and make sure

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.980
that you've got it all there.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.880
You've got the patching in place.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.300
It is a lot of work to make sure
that you can take away those rights

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.140
and they can still do their job
without complaining to management.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.280
I do agree with you,
but I think Joel's comment,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.400
and I do this too,
you should run as a non-admin

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.460
day-to-day so you know what
it's like to be a non-admin.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:03.800
I'm there.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.500
I'm doing it.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:04.880
Yeah.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.470
Good.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.410
So that way,
if there are things that prevent

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.060
you from doing your job and you
think that those might apply to

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.720
other people in your organization,
you can then work on those issues.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.830
For my users at least,
and everybody's environment is different,

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.440
except for the developers,
there's almost no reason any

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.400
user in my building needs admin.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.600
Even Leopard, you needed to be an admin
in order to add printers.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.840
Well, if you reconfigure CUPS,
you can fix that.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.800
There's stuff you can do to
work around some of those issues

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.980
so that there's really no real
reason to give the end user.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.350
In my environment,
there's really no reason except for

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.700
the developers to give them admin.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.430
But you're right.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.480
Your environment's different.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.850
You need to know what they need
to do and how they need to do it.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.190
But don't jump to,
I'm just going to give everybody

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.780
admin because that's easier,
because it's really going to cause

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.140
you problems further down the road,
in my opinion.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.300
And I'm just curious,
how many people edit

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.680
the Etsy suitor's file?

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.790
Okay, so in essence,
you're taking away an

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.200
administrator's ability to do sudo,
right?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200
No.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.160
No.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.200
Or adding more.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.200
Yes.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200
It's usually adding.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.800
Yeah, Apple could help on that.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.800
Just a quick follow-up to Joel's point.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.170
I mean, I'm running a deployment where
it's exactly what you said.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.580
You know,
I consider it kind of a pilot project.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.560
It's an entire lab.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.770
They know the admin password,
but they're running it as non-admin.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.120
And my concern is that
it's a human factor,

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.800
so I don't, you know,
we can just pass it off.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.680
But at the point where they're
prompted for the password and

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.800
they just automatically enter
it without thinking about it,

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800
what did we really gain?

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.800
So I consider it a baby step.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.400
And it came up in an earlier session
that can we get a little more

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.800
dialogue out of the login window?

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.050
And it was,
I forget which session it was,

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:53.800
but it was shot down.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.120
It was like, no,
that's not going to happen because blah,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:56.800
blah, blah.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.180
But I kind of feel like, you know,
sometimes we get the info as

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.800
to what the authentication is
for and sometimes we don't.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.800
So I just didn't know if anybody
had any comments beyond that.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.790
I do feel it's a step in that direction.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.800
But I was in the same session.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.790
I was sitting in the back and they did.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.870
They just kind of,
we're not going to do that, right?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.900
Alright, John?

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.090
John Welch: Okay, yeah,
I was going to say if

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.140
Apple... John Welch:
John Welch from the Zimmerman Agency.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.140
John Welch: Zimmerman, yes.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.140
John Welch: Yeah,
I know I tripped you up there, Greg.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.140
I'm sorry.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.640
I change companies.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.140
I do it every so often just for that.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:32.670
Yeah, Apple could kind of help out with
not teaching people how to be admin

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.800
password monkeys by maybe going
back to adding printers without

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.300
a password and that kind of stuff.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.840
Sometimes there's a lot of that,
and I understand about

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.860
reconfiguring cups.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.250
John Welch: Everyone that likes that,
there's a person that hates that.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.590
John Welch: Well, I... John Welch:
And that came specifically because

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.680
there was a large amount of complaining
from the educational environment

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.970
that non-admins could add printers.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.890
Yeah, you can manage that.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.640
Now, the complete X,
I'm as angry as you are about it

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.060
because it wasn't completely finished.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.420
And that's because there are too
many different groups involved.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.140
So you can easily allow a non-admin
user to add printers and leprechauns.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.020
Little chunk of text into etsy.cups.com.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:15.620
It shouldn't be as hard as that.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.210
It should be a better,
and that's something that there are

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.890
a lot of feedback was given on that.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.380
And I think that should be changed.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.540
But there's no black and white on this.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.250
No, no, there's not.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:24.690
I agree.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.040
No, the thing,
the comment I was going to say is,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.330
and this is something,
it's not as bad these days

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.680
as it was a few years ago.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.730
But I still see a lot of comments on
the mailing list that show that a lot

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.770
of Mac admins are doing what I call,
you know, admitting by running around

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.870
with a Firewire drive.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.410
And the thing that saved my sanity
over the years in the many and

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:50.370
bizarre environments I've worked in is
being relentlessly lazy about stuff.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.760
And your comment about, you know,
not waiting for the user.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.270
And it's like,
I didn't write a massive SNMP article

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.780
because I was bored that day.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.820
It's because that saved
my bacon over the years.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.710
When they say their server's done,
I'm like, yeah,

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.030
I knew about 20 minutes ago.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.840
Leave me alone.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.960
And I see people who, you know,
think that somehow if they

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.820
do everything manually that,
you know, they're working harder,

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.000
people appreciate them more.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.140
And it's like, you're not doing stuff
you should be doing.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.760
If you're running around with
a Firewire drive and tweaking

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.810
everybody's desktop settings or
doing that kind of stuff all the time

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.760
instead of embracing things like SSH.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.900
And ARD and other methodologies,
you're really killing yourself on

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.200
the ability to look at the bigger
pictures of infrastructure improvements

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.780
and that kind of thing that do take
real time that you can't just do 15

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.530
minutes here and 15 minutes there.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.180
And I actually don't think there's
much of an excuse for that anymore.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.780
You could say maybe five years ago
Apple didn't have documentation

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.100
or good tools in place to let
you do this sort of stuff well.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.500
And the people who did sort
of built home-built systems.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.700
But, you know,
you can pretty much follow the

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.720
standard Apple way as far as
imaging and deployment goes.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.960
And it's a good way of doing things.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.170
I also would request from Apple that
you guys at some point put a more

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.320
detailed guide on how to do installers.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.650
Because while I don't mind
beating people with that stick,

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.390
it's kind of fun sometimes.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.040
There isn't a lot of things that
talk... That's excellent feedback.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.360
We'll take that into consideration.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.780
You don't even work for Apple, Nigel.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.140
You don't even work for Apple.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.800
Shouldn't you be under the waterfall
of money with your hat out?

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.540
So I actually think installers and
I mean I'm sure this is feedback a lot

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.910
of people have given at various times,
developers and sysadmins alike,

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.530
but I think package management
is still one of the main weak

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.800
points of the Mac platform.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.990
Yes, without a doubt.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.660
Well, in Puppet,
in what you and Jeff talked about,

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.740
is a nice alternative.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.720
Well,
we're still using the package format.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.050
So I sort of more mean that there's
limitations on the package format itself.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.330
It seems, if any of you hang out on the
installer dev mailing list,

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.760
it's, you know,
there's a lot of bugs in there,

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.940
and it doesn't seem to be
as flexible as people want.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.090
We can't do rollback.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.410
There's,
just compared to most other major

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.300
operating systems package format,
it's pretty weak.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:05.900
Yeah.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.970
But some guidelines,
and they don't have to be like, you know,

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.240
formal anything,
but because I know sometimes getting

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.000
software developers to realize
you do need to talk to IT people,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.300
yes, it's scary,
and we're not always nice.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.840
Do you have any company in mind, perhaps?

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.300
Adobe.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:23.620
Adobe.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.460
Over the years, Adobe,
there's been quite a few.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.590
I don't want to Adobe necessarily
name anyone Adobe,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.380
but, you know.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.640
Thank you, Mr.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.040
Nealon.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.790
There you go.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.120
All right.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.540
Yes.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.640
Neil Clennon, University of Michigan.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.780
My question is about performing major
upgrades to the OS on the servers.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.170
In the past,
the recommendation we've been

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:53.420
given from Apple is to do
clean installs and then import,

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.600
and the problem in the past has
been with getting passwords over.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.930
I attended one of the sessions
where there was some talk

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.180
about how to do that now,
where there are ways to get the password.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.840
There's been some talk
about how to do that.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.690
So, I'm wondering if the suggestion
from Apple is tending more towards

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.910
doing upgrades or migrations
or things that are moving away

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.380
from the clean install option.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.750
I was also at a lab at one
point where I was told,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.520
well,
there's a service you want to implement,

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:30.040
and maybe you're going to want
to wait until version 10.6 is out

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.120
because it's changing everything.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.640
And once again,
I was hearing it's going to

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.400
be a major pain in the butt
to migrate all of that over,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.200
and there's not necessarily going
to be a tool to make that work well.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.870
So, I'm wondering which way
Apple is headed on that.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.290
So, let's qualify your question before
I turn it over to these guys.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.940
When we talk about a migration,
we know the user data is either

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.320
stored on a RAID or someplace else.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.320
It's very likely not
stored on the same drive.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.800
In some cases, maybe.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.120
Yes.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.860
Not the same drive as the OS, right?

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.620
The server OS.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:14.730
So, what is absolutely critical on
that server OS that you need?

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.130
It's the LDAP database,
the KDC user principles

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.560
and service principles,
and the password server database, right?

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.590
Right, and data.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.700
What data?

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.940
Data that the users create?

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.360
Yes.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.650
That shouldn't be on that same drive.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.630
Right?

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.330
Xserves come with three drives.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.400
Oh, oh, I see what you're saying.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:36.940
You know what I mean?

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.640
Yeah.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.250
Right?

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:46.660
So what else is critical if you're
migrating from box A to box B?

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.350
What else is there?

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.900
Justin?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.480
- Basically the data you can't
easily restore or reinstall.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.150
You have to have backups of that.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.930
- So configuration
files for your services?

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.920
- Sure.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.250
- What other databases
are critically important?

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.210
What if you use mail?

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.980
- Wikis and the Wikis.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.460
- Wikis, okay.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.980
So now that we've qualified that, then...

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.210
Okay, so I don't have an
answer to the question.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:21.280
I have an approach to where you would
get to the answer to the question.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:27.990
When you're managing client machines,
AFP548.com came up with a great

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.040
methodology called Instant DMG,
and the idea being that you

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.180
modularize what you're building.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.820
You start with Apple's install disks,
and then you layer packages on

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.140
top of that to get to your final
result for your client machines.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:47.750
You can use other tools to get
to the same thing on OS X client.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.710
I use a combination of tools,
which include RadMine, sorry to say.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.440
But basically,
I've modularized things so I can

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.000
take a base OS and then I can
layer my stuff on top of it,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.900
and now I have a machine that
behaves the way I want to do it.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.510
If you're managing a large
number of OS X servers,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.560
I think you need to be
thinking that same direction.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:15.490
How can I document, encapsulate,

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:22.400
The bits that make this configuration
different from what Apple has dumped on

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.300
the disk when I run the install disks,
and that doesn't just

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.520
help you from a migration.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.590
That helps you from a disaster recovery.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.390
It helps you with replication.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.070
It helps you with load balancing,
any of those sort of things,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.470
bringing up a new remote site.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.550
I'm not saying it's an easy answer,
but if we're talking best practices,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.670
that's really where you need
to be going so that you are

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.970
keeping separate the data,
the OS,

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:55.500
and then your configuration changes
that make the server useful to you.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.170
And then, you know,
the easy thing is to not pay

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:02.020
attention to any of that and
just do an upgrade install and

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.800
hope like heck that that works.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.700
But obviously that's not the
recommended approach from Apple and

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.570
that's never the way I've done
it because for whatever reason,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.230
I think we all find
that when we do a clean,

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.620
fresh install,
stuff that was broke before just

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.060
suddenly starts working again.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.330
And that's because there's
configuration changes that

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.300
were made during the time that,
you know,

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.610
during the time that the server was
alive that maybe you forgot about or

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.160
didn't know about that are suboptimal.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.480
And you don't really want to bring
those over to the new server.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.780
A lot of times Apple has
done some tuning.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.780
They've done some tuning that requires,
you know, different base settings.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.000
So from -- So just one thing along
before we get too far off track.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.170
My kind of approach is that if
you've got a server and you can't

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.160
-- you're backing it up because
everyone backs up their servers.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.670
And if you can't get from your backups
to your services being up and running,

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.980
why are you backing up?

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.160
And so the same approach really
holds true for going from

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.880
one OS version to another.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.760
You should be able to get from, you know,
your LDAP backups.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.300
To an LDAP server running.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.580
From your KDC backups to a KDC running.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:14.000
Those three components, VOS10 server,
password server KDC, and LDAP,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.820
you need to be able to get from your
backups to those services up and running.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.760
And it's the same approach holds true
for a new version or the same version.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.610
Well, now in the past,
the ability to bring the passwords over

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:31.140
with the entire description that was
given in the documentation about how

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.740
to bring you over to the next server,
it says passwords aren't coming with it.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.520
And that's where my initial downfall was.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.660
Yeah, I mean,
the documentation leads you to do

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.890
a DS export and then a DS import,
which -- correct,

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.180
doesn't -- doesn't get the passwords.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.240
We had an article on the site a
while back about how to hand take

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.740
the password server database out of
10.3 box and move it over to 10.4.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.880
So there is methodology for doing that.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.840
But I agree, it's not as simple and
as easy as it should be.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.950
And it's certainly not
currently available in the GUI,

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.170
which is what leads you to
do that upgrade in place,

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.720
at which point you get
everything still in there.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.780
Yeah, the upgrade in place had gone wrong
from 10.3 to 10.4 for us when it turned

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.440
out it doesn't work from one set of
disks but does work from the other set.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440
You may be familiar with that problem.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440
Yeah, I remember that.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.440
Yeah.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.110
Okay, thank you.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.070
So that being said,
you've got the tools from the command

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.000
line to dump your password server
database and bring it back in.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.690
So yeah, the archive function,
the log is very, very verbose in telling

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.170
you exactly what that is.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.230
And actually,
there was another article where

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:39.220
you just added to it where you,
that was up talking about

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.000
stopping the mail database,
stopping the SQL server,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
sort of adding that information as well.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.380
So I don't think it's unreasonable
to ask for Apple for a server

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.390
migration assistant that would
help you move that data over rather

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.990
than all of these techniques that,
you know,

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:59.000
us grizzled systems administrators
have had to discover for ourselves.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.630
You know, whether that be an actual
nice GUI tool or just a very

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.960
well-documented set of procedures
you can do from the command line.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.600
I personally don't care either way,
but it would be nice for Apple to

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.990
document that and explain that to people.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.000
So would it be -- I agree.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.650
So would it be fair then to say that
the recommendation from Apple at this

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.530
point is to do the clean install but that
there are more tools that have already

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.740
been provided and perhaps more on the
way to make sure that all of the data,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.700
including passwords and everything,
come over cleanly?

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.660
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:35.890
And that's why I'm such a
stickler about the word data,

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.700
because we need to segment it out, right?

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.550
The configuration files for the services,
the databases that we need,

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.490
including LDAP, KDC, Password Server,
MySQL, Mail Store Database,

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.690
things like that.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.120
If we can segment that out,
that's doing what Greg said,

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.680
that documentation process.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.150
Wait a minute,
I tweaked this one launch the item,

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:58.690
right?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.230
Because I didn't want something
else to run on demand or I wanted

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.700
it to wait more than 300 seconds.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.690
So documenting all those little
tiny bits that you've changed

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:09.700
is going to make that my goal.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.860
I mean, I think that's the key
to the integration,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.700
just it goes so much easier.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.690
Thank you.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.700
Thank you.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.530
Justin?

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.100
Go ahead.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.400
Actually,
I think David might have been before me.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.700
We're going to let Dave stay
in for a little bit.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.320
Oh, OK.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.480
Sorry.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.600
Fair choice, I guess.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.790
I want to go back to package
management very quickly.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.890
We've been using Radmine,
and we're very happy that we've

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.980
been there for many years.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.090
So I know that it's been
bashed on a couple of times,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.820
but I don't think that's really fair.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:33.800
Not to pick on Greg.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.650
Greg and I are friends.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.310
But I understand the pains
of using Radmine is that it's

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.920
got a large learning curve,
but it's very powerful because of system

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.370
rollbacks and things such as that.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.130
Now, it's not always easy to do a
system rollback with Radmine,

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.570
but most of the time,
it's very good at doing that.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.680
The power there is amazing.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.250
OK.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.380
We've actually been thinking
about possibly moving to

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.610
other third-party products.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.460
But every time we start
thinking about that,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.720
I personally think that that is such
a low-level system operation that it

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.180
really needs to come from Apple and have
a more refined package management system.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.230
I mean,
Apple knows all of the ancillary files

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.920
that it's going to take us longer
and poking at our SEs and going to

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.200
WWDC and get secret answers that we
then post to the web of how it's solved.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.130
And I'm not saying system
rollbacks are easy,

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.130
but the best person or people
to do that would be Apple.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.080
They make the OS.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.370
So I'm frustrated that-- yes,
I know PKG has been out

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.340
there for a long time.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.860
Iceberg is out there for making packages,
package installers.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.440
If anybody knows about MSIs,
I admit I know very little about them,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.490
but I talk to my Windows guys
because I have to eat lunch

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.940
with them occasionally.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.490
But they talk about MSIs,
and the power of MSIs on

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.560
Windows is very extensible.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:43.910
Self-repair.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.720
I mean,
there's a lot of functionality there.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.160
Now, Microsoft has had a lead
and a head start on this.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.240
I understand that.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.880
But I think it's now time for Apple to
finally get serious about package

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.500
management for system administration.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:04.000
So before the Apple people come in,
I guess I was feeling really

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.090
pessimistic about packages until 10.5,
and if you actually poke around

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.860
in the internals for 10.5,
you can see I know nothing about

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.220
what Apple's plans are with packages,
but things are changing.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.670
We have a database now,
there are tools that let you

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.340
track what files have been
installed by what package,

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.380
you can search.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:27.260
There seems to be groundwork being put
in that looks like it's making it better.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.500
And I think all we can do is keep
applying pressure as to what we want.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.500
Now on to the sales guys.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.780
So what I don't understand,
and I think this is where I'd say

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.870
you'd fail in the first place,
is why did that package

00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:44.180
get out if it doesn't work?

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.180
Could be a package from Apple.

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.180
I understand that.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:54.200
So you blindly download and install
every single update that comes out.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:36:55.800
[Transcript missing]

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.500
Okay?

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.500
Yeah, that's one application.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.780
And that's specifically, that's fine.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.890
That's entirely scripted.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:20.780
So, specifically with hardware,
but if all you care about is hardware,

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.290
your problem is much,
much less than what it started off being.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.390
We've got Joel Sputter.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.460
Understand,
but if all you have left is hardware,

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.710
your problem is much,
much less than what it was before.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.540
Joel, package management is a lot more
than just what you're talking about.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.460
I mean, if you look at the
whole RPM under Red Hat,

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.740
which, by the way, RPM is under the Mac.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.570
Let's separate out two things here.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.430
Let's separate out the server side,
where package management and what

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.640
you're talking about is very,
very significant.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.790
No, I'm talking about for clients.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.230
How often are you updating
packages on the client?

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:52.840
Daily.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.460
Daily.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.780
Why are you updating things daily?

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.250
Because Red Hat comes
out with a shitload,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.600
pardon me, a boatload of updates.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.260
It's Friday.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.910
Hey, you were right the first time.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.850
The naughty mic.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.570
No one go to the naughty mic.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.300
Apple comes out with a patch, you know,
a lot.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.730
- The small percentage of your boxes,
that's the cost of doing business,

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:20.680
those vulnerabilities.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.140
It's gotta be patched.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.540
- Yeah, there's security and defense
that gets before that.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.440
- Over here?

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.890
So an SLA is nice for keeping your job.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:34.860
That's great.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.420
Okay?

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.040
I mean,
it really is a great thing for that.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:41.340
But in a former job,
I was in the position of supporting

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.070
scientists with a lot of,
you know, each biologist has his own

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.480
application that hooks up to his
own half-million-dollar machine.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.080
You know, it's great to be testing.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.320
Like I said,
it's not the panacea for everything.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.580
But if you don't even have that,
how many people in here have an SLA?

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.910
So we've got two-thirds of
the room that doesn't have it.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.660
How many people are using
it in the right way?

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.260
How many people have turned
that SLA into a testing matrix?

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:19.300
There you go.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.200
I know, Mark,
do you want to speak to that real quick?

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.920
30 seconds.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.000
30 seconds.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.370
Only 30 seconds?

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.880
Well, I mean,
I agree the SLA is good to keep a job,

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.720
but we're arguing we need better
package management on Macs.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.730
Well, actually,
I'd like to touch on both those animals,

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.120
if I could, real quick.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.690
We actually do use the testing matrix,
and we actually incorporate it as

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.000
part of our internal SQA process.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.840
I mean, again,
Genentech is kind of bizarre in this way.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.610
We actually have an internal
software quality assurance group,

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.520
and they test the stuff that goes
out into the general enterprise

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.880
before it actually gets out there.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:08.040
And they come back with an SQA report
that shows where things worked,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.850
where it did not.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.410
And we basically have to sign off on
it before we flip the switch on it,

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:18.170
before it gets unleashed,
so that pretty much everybody

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:19.680
is on the same page.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:25.090
It also gives us an insight as to what
sort of things may potentially crop

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.880
up as it travels through its path.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:32.150
We do also run the SLAs,
and the SLAs are incorporated

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.560
with our service desk,
so that pretty much

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.640
everyone along the way,
when a new application,

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.390
something that someone wants to install,
gets brought in,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.100
we have some insight as to
whether this thing is going

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.320
to work out of the box or not.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.310
We've also worked very hard on
trying to get the users to...

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.320
Only put on stuff once
we've been able to vet it.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:01.040
Now, does that stop the CS3
people from out there?

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.900
No, and actually CS3, for example,
is one of our banes of existence.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.210
But a lot of that is kind of how it's
done from Adobe in the first place.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:15.250
It's very,
very hard to manage application because,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.220
for whatever reason,
they decided they want to just

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.470
kind of do things on their own.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.460
Fair enough.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.340
All right.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.900
So-- And I'll back off the mic.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.640
Yeah, Chris,
we have some people up over there.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.250
Dave?

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.280
This almost ties into package management.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:37.440
One of the banes of my existence
in using OS X servers facing the

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.740
internet is that Apple seems totally
unable to grasp the concept that open

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:48.870
source software is updated more often
than every major release of OS X.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.530
and David So you end up with half
of your application or half of

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.730
your binaries being built under
user/local and then Apple comes

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:04.620
out with an update and you're like,
"Oh my god,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.150
Clam AV just made it up to within
two revs of what's current.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:12.250
Do I need to go back and test this?"
My own environment I end up just

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.470
building the open source software,
packaging it and basically doing all the

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.250
work that Apple should be doing for me.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.880
But I'm curious how other
environments are handling this.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.700
So the work that Apple is doing for
you is why it's two revs behind?

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.000
Then Apple needs to learn to work faster.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.900
Give me one engineer and two
interns and I'll keep it up to date.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.900
But you as the admin have the ability
and you understand both sides.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.590
If you wanted somebody
to QA and all that,

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.310
you'd pay a lot more
and you'd get Solaris.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.620
Or Red Hat or Debian.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:44.980
Sure.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.520
Or freaking Fedora for free.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.360
Get done in that.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.740
So there is definitely a
trade-off between that.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:53.800
Okay.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.600
Go ahead.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.270
I'd like to make one little
quick comment on that.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.050
I'm actually a free BSD administrator
as well as other things,

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:06.400
and I work with various packages that
are based on other open source packages.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.950
And I have to say almost every
environment that I've seen where

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.900
there's a third-party application
that's built on top of open source,

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.500
there's always delay.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.550
So with -- I administer
Sophos PeerMessage,

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:21.600
which is a mail-filtering,
spam-filtering environment.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:28.640
And there are always behind on what
releases of free BSDs that they support,

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.880
et cetera.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.400
So I've run into that problem a lot
with other applications as well.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.990
So I do wish that Apple was able to
come up with a way to incorporate

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.490
some of those changes quicker.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.740
But I also acknowledge that, yeah,
there's delay because of the

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:44.290
vetting that you're doing.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.280
Okay.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.700
Alfred.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.310
Yeah,
I was just interested in knowing how

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.500
you document your configurations.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:56.150
And you use like Word, Pages, a Wiki,
what?

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.260
Mine's a little more primitive,
so maybe we should start with mine

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.260
and then I'm sure his will be puppet.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:09.430
That's the beauty of a modular
methodology like DMG or

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:14.100
like using RadMind is the
configurations are self-documenting,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.540
meaning they're encapsulated in
a package or they're encapsulated

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.210
in a RadMind load set.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.110
And so you don't have to write
something down somewhere to go,

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.600
oh yeah,
to make sure that the user can't do this,

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.920
go in and edit this file and then
make sure you save it and then

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.090
make sure you set the mode to 755.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.390
You don't have to do any of that stuff.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.650
You just apply the package or
you just apply the transcript.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:45.600
And if you're familiar with RadMind,
you basically get an audit trail

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.910
of what's on each machine because
each machine has a command

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.160
file which tells me which.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.440
Packages it gets.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.580
And other package management
systems do something similar.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.930
So you don't have to spend
a lot of time documenting.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.840
You make your change,
you capture it as a package and then

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.320
you just use that package going forward.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.290
Do you use the same for
server configurations like

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:08.300
IP addresses and everything?

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.580
I don't, but I would think that would
be the right way to do it if

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.550
you were managing it correctly,
which I'm not.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.280
Right.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.500
I mean,
even Apple has a very simple server

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.220
worksheet that you can print out,
you know, and you fill out.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.520
All the information just
to get people started on

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.390
documenting that sort of thing.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.970
So for us,
this is one of the reasons I actually

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:32.100
really love Puppet so much because it's
a really simple declarative syntax.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.790
And what you're doing is
you're describing the state

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.360
you want the machine to be in.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.090
So you're saying, you know,
I want this kind of resource

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:40.570
to have these attributes.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.530
And so it's pretty much self-documenting.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.660
Like,
we're still kind of working out the best

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:51.080
way to document which image revisions
at which times had these packages,

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.200
whether they're delivered by Puppet,
whether they're delivered some other way.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:59.300
But honestly, I don't think the way you
document matters anywhere near as

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.880
much as getting something down.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.920
And making,
lowering the barrier to keeping

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.900
documentation up to date.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.600
There's something I seem to keep
running into in jobs over and over

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:11.980
again that it's all well and good
to come up with a really robust

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.780
framework for creating documentation.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:18.700
But if you can't quickly and easily
update it when you find a mistake,

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.040
it may as well not have it at all.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.820
Because within a year or two,
it'll be so far removed from reality

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.310
that you may as well not read it.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.650
So, yeah, I think it's a really
good way to do that.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.660
Can I add something to that right here?

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.990
I've noticed with our deployment that
if the process doesn't document it,

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:34.650
then it doesn't get done.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.650
And that's why, you know,
what Greg was saying about RadMine.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.660
So when we make overloads,
we try and -- when we create them,

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.400
we try and make sure that there's
nothing in there that's going to throw

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.970
us off when we look at it in six months.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.680
Real quick, on documentation,
I've learned over the years

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.570
there's kind of two levels.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.160
There's the long-term
status documentation.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.780
One of the reasons I've become
such a cheerleader for Nagios

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:04.250
over the years is because I can
look at every switch router,

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.890
everything above the
clients on my network,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.740
and I can tell you firmware revisions,
all of it banged that fast.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.340
Completely blew away a Cisco guy
when we were doing upgrades at

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:18.020
Kansas City Life because we were
the only site he'd seen in two years

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.130
that could show him our revs without
him running their little bizarro,

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.460
you know, snarf the network tools.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.750
The other one that I found
even more important is that

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.380
the aha moment documentation.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.920
You know, you've been beating
your head on something,

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.640
you finally get it done and in
the midst of running around it,

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.550
you know,
or pushing it out to a dozen machines,

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:40.020
a hundred machines, a thousand machines,
you want to document it but you're

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.440
busy and anything that's more,
that takes more time than about 15

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.060
to 20 seconds to get it up there.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.760
You're going to forget to do it.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.310
And so in my case,
I've become a complete and

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.220
utter Wiki fanboy on Leopard.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.660
It's one of the reasons I jumped on
Leopard so quick and I put up with having

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.480
to manually restore the Wiki pages a lot,
getting it stable and all that.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.520
But that Wiki having, you know,
just that URL right there

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.950
in my toolbar going,
oh,

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:10.040
did something to click and it doesn't,
it's ugly sometimes, it's not formatted,

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.220
sometimes it's barely English,
but it's there.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.560
00:19:00:00 - 00:19:11:00 Unknown I can
just go back later and make it pretty if

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.300
I have to add in screenshots or whatever.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.530
But having something like that
where all you have to do is open a

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.250
link in a browser and you can brain
dump into it real quick has saved

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.220
my bacon over the years so many
times setting up stuff like that.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.880
At worst,
a pad and a piece of paper is better

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.350
than some complicated process.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.290
00:19:11:00 - 00:19:29:00
Unknown I agree.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:38.580
So we actually have Google has a really
strong culture of peer code review

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.680
and which is one of the big things
Mondrian does that Guido talked about.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.860
So with our puppet configs,
00:19:29:00 - 00:19:35:00 Unknown we're

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.940
actually having to justify why we're
making a change to our peers who have

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.460
to approve it before we check it in.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.700
And I think this is one of the
big things that sysadmins can

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.260
learn from software developers
that peer review and code view,

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.500
however you're creating your packages,
however you're doing your configuration,

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:06.290
if you can somehow get that out to your
peers to review before it gets committed,

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.580
that's just a much better process.

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.560
And Greg had some interest.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.880
00:19:35:00 - 00:19:45:00 Unknown Yeah.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:14.630
So Nigel's got a great environment
where he's got a bunch of people.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:14.640
It's a big deal.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.890
It's a big environment.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:19.260
So he's got a bunch of colleagues
that can help him do peer review.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.470
I'm sure there are a lot of people here
that don't have a lot of colleagues that

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:25.870
work on the same stuff that they do,
so they don't have those peers.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.280
That's actually my situation.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.970
There's really no nobody else
doing Mac engineering in my group,

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.860
so it's hard to to get that review.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.980
But I have a solution,
and that's I post stuff

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.080
up on the Internet.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.710
You know,
I've got to put it on a blog or put

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.500
it in the Mac enterprise mailing list.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:48.160
And I let my virtual colleagues around
the world comment peer review my work.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.140
And that's actually one of my
justifications for for publishing

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:56.120
stuff that I do at Disney out
on the Internet is is that

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:59.840
that way I can get peer review
from from other administrators.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.610
So that's that's an option
that's available to everyone.

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:07.160
If you don't have local peers,
use the peers out on the great cloud.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.610
00:19:45:00 - 00:20:00:00 Unknown

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.650
And I will say we know that there are a
plethora of third-party tools that will

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.900
help us with that package management.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.370
And I just saw one the other day,
a web interface that ties in,

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:26.750
does policy management, package healing,
really, really nice, nice tool.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.760
So, in the back.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.560
What tool?

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:31.230
What tool?

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:35.400
Well, who said it over here?

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:36.030
Casper?

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.250
Casper.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:43.100
There's now a little add-on to it.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:44.040
Yeah.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.910
I was shown it.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:46.890
Is it called Wendy?

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:51.290
Is that the self-service one?

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:56.400
No, the developer showed it
to me earlier this week.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.690
I think it'll probably be
up on Casper's website.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.500
I'll tell you after.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.060
I don't want to throw it out
because I think they're going to

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.260
make an announcement about the
software if they haven't already,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.460
but I don't want to jump in.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.580
Is he in the room?

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:14.500
He's not here?

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.500
Oh, he left yesterday.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.500
Oh, he left yesterday?

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.500
Okay.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.500
In the back.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:23.220
One of the challenges that we're going
to be seeing probably before the end

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.450
of the year is going to be that we're
going to be mandated to be doing full

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.920
disk encryption on our Mac laptops.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.920
So -- Why would you applaud that?

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.920
Yeah.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.990
I mean,
I can understand that you have to do it,

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:37.990
but why would you be excited about it?

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:41.460
Because of one word, "vile fault."

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.040
Still,
encryption is like a necessary evil.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.640
It's not something you're excited about.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:50.390
The main reason that I'm,
the big thing that I'm taking a

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:53.630
look at is it's going to knock
my existing imaging methodologies

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.060
kind of into a cock-tap because
it's going to be an instance where

00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.600
in order to re-image you will have
to spend eight hours unencrypting,

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.910
re-image, and then spend another, well,
you can hand it back to

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.690
the user at that point,
but still,

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:09.860
you've pretty much taken their laptop
away for re-imaging for a full day.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.450
So, I'm wondering what methodology... So,
why do you have to decrypt?

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.670
Like, are you not,
you're not running backup clients on the,

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.550
backup software on the clients?

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:23.000
Well, I am for the most part, but... So,
their data's somewhere else?

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.330
Sometimes I don't necessarily,
my laptops aren't necessarily

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.000
always backed up in a timely manner.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.170
So, that kind of seems,
so we're kind of facing the same problem,

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.900
and I think a lot of people who
are thinking about full disk

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.030
encryption have the same issues,
and I think really it just

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:40.560
sort of exposes... Yeah.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.200
...other areas that we have,
other weaknesses we have

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.470
in our methodologies,
and really you should be able

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.100
to just get to the point where
I need to re-image this machine,

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:49.470
I wipe it, I re-image it.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.680
Right,
and that's where I'd like to get to.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:56.720
Tempo has a nice Windows option for
that with their live backup product,

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.370
which they're going to be
bringing for Mac this year,

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.190
but right now it's not
going to be a full,

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:06.430
you know, basically bare metal install.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.700
On live backup on Windows,
basically you can just wipe.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:40.460
And, you know, put it back... Yeah.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.550
...and put them on there,
or they've used some of these

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:45.200
self-servicing portals from the
various client management vendors.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.850
And that way,
the only piece that you care

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:48.280
about is their specific data.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.130
Now, if they're running as a non-admin,
it's pretty much entirely

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:52.530
within their own home folder.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.480
So, now we have a much,
much smaller subset of that 160 gig drive

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.820
that you have to back up and care about.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.500
So, that's where something I know,
a couple people here, I think,

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.110
playing around with CrashPlan,
which is also a nice little backup

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:05.620
agent that runs through there.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.280
They got a shout-out
over there somewhere.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.280
The ATempo stuff is interesting.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.240
We've had a few people... ...people that
do this with portable home directories.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.380
Who's using portable home directories
for this kind of functionality.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.130
All right?

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:17.250
And for the most part...

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:23.240
So that concept of just using that
portable home directory functionality,

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.630
which is already in there to sync back,
who's playing around with

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.510
Time Machine to do this?

00:54:28.600 --> 00:57:06.800
[Transcript missing]

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.130
Yeah, it's a tiny, it's an agent.

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.500
There's an agent, so it doesn't,
and Casper's free?

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.220
No, no, no.

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.260
ARD's not free.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.970
No, ARD is a couple thousand dollars,
and, you know, that's it.

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.480
System Profiler, SSH,
and Shell Scripts are free.

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.140
Yeah, I know,
I don't want to roll my own.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.370
Will, as well.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.610
So you don't want to roll your own,
you don't want to pay,

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:30.500
and you want one that works really good.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.300
Very good, all right.

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:33.750
Good luck with that.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.710
Let us all know when you find it.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.700
He did say it works at Los Alamos, so.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.220
That's right,
this is your money we're spending.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.100
It's not like Google's money.

00:57:45.100 --> 00:59:16.100
[Transcript missing]

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:19.320
And that's the problem
where that gets into,

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.140
is that if you do do a peer
review between different people

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:26.800
or different organizations,
that what you're reviewing is IP.

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.960
In theory, I mean, that's your business.

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.790
Nigel, how do you run your data centers?

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.430
And if you did know,
you wouldn't tell me.

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:36.960
Maybe.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.650
But to a point, like,
if I'm having issues with AD,

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:42.930
I know there's a bunch of other
people with the same things.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:46.160
It's hard to find different companies
that have that kind of relationship.

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.230
We do, a few of the Fortune 1000
that I work with have kind of

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.850
developed their own networks,
typically with other customers

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:57.020
or other companies that aren't
in their same business area.

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.520
Yeah, just to kind of make it an
easier networking for us here.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.650
That's why you can get a random
handle on a number of different

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:09.040
websites and start going into those
forums and kind of start doing some

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.560
of that there where nobody really
knows where people are coming from.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.960
And a little more neutral ground.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.220
This has been brought up before,
but I don't think that it's exceptionally

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.340
feasible to be able to do in kind
of an organized manner for Mac OS X.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.440
Real quick, yeah, come on up on that.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.120
Go ahead.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.460
Yeah, we do do peer review.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.640
We belong to an organization called
Advertising IT Group in Minneapolis.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.940
And all of the CTOs or system admins
get together once every three months.

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.580
We talk about how we do stuff.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.240
And if I have some solution
that helps other people,

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.880
I fully disclose it.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.640
All right.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.760
So it exists and face-to-face,
but it's local.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.940
I think Apple can help in some ways.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.860
WWDC is a great place.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.260
I see nothing about birds of a feather.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.010
It all happens at Dave's, you know,
buying each other a beer.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:59.260
So I, and we didn't even end up
talking about technology.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:00:59.500
But that's it.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.110
That's another point.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.170
So I think that, yes, Apple can help.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.150
I'm happy to give you a forum
on the site if you want to get

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:09.090
a little meet a friend section.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:09.640
Right.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.900
I think that would be
a great place to go.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.300
I hope I don't.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.600
Actually, I need friends with benefits.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.140
That's a different site.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.720
Look out.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.300
That's a different forum.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:26.450
And I'll second that for the other major
big conference that happens in January,

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.260
right?

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.680
Macworld.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.040
I can do that.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.250
So, yeah.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:35.100
On the advertising front,
just because I work in advertising,

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.560
if you're an indie,
the 4As has an IT committee

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.000
that does that kind of stuff.

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:43.760
So get on that and talk to people.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.330
If you're not an indie,
you're part of a major network.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.590
Major network partners,
if you're in Publicis

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:51.170
or Omnicom or whoever,
you're different companies,

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.980
but you're owned by the same entity.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.020
So that's a really excellent
venue for peer review as well.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:56.860
Okay, good.

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:57.680
Thanks.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.380
Up here.

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:01.810
Richard Glitzer, University of Utah.

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:06.820
I had a question on your feedback on
if Apple should provide Delta software

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.600
updates for new hardware.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.240
Do you think that's something
Apple could provide?

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.270
Do you think it's unreasonable?

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:15.510
And how do you guys handle it now?

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.060
This is why we built Insta DMG,
so that you could do

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.370
that kind of on your own.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.440
And I'm not speaking with my Apple hat.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.800
I don't disagree that that's
something that's necessary.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.220
But do remember, I don't make the stuff.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.440
So while I'm the only Apple badge
person sitting in a chair up here,

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.860
I have a lot of the same pain
and feelings that you do about

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.160
these things that need to be done.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.300
So I'm not arguing that
package management and things

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.630
like that aren't important.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:42.450
What I am saying, though,
is that we are working in the

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:45.800
community on tools to help do that,
to make things simpler.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.360
And while it'd be great if
Apple creates de-installers,

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.550
kind of the Deltas between
the different updates,

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:56.360
these aren't necessarily
exceptionally hard concepts.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.550
And since a lot of your
environments are very,

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:02.240
very custom, and the OS,
while it's a big piece,

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.760
is not the entire piece.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.170
Things like Final Cut,
if you're in a video

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:07.880
production environment.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.010
Things like CS3 and stuff like that.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.660
I add a lot of complexity to it,
where you need a process

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.010
and a methodology that
looks at the whole piece,

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:18.300
and not just at the piece that
came from an individual vendor.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.240
One thing that would really, really,
really help,

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:26.040
and it wouldn't involve uninstallers,
Delta releases, or anything else,

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:33.020
is when, say, 10.5.3 came out, within,
say, a couple of weeks, maybe a month,

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:39.180
reference disk images so that
you could download a disk image

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.530
with the absolute most current
version of the OS as far as 10.5.3,

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:43.620
10.5.1.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.930
Any hardware that came out after that,
fine,

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:48.120
you've got to deal with that separately.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.740
But when, you know, you've got to,
you can't download Mac OS X 10.5.3.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.130
You have to download some
earlier version of 10.5 if you

01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:00.730
want to get the disk image,
or you've got to try to, you know,

01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:04.110
hopefully figure out, you know,
read the tea leaves and the chicken

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:08.550
livers when a disk with 10.5.3 or
whatever the most current version

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:12.100
is is going to show up in a retail
store or get one from your rep.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.200
You know, Apple regularly releasing,
you know, it's IT, we'll pay.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.400
We got money.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:17.880
Okay.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.400
You know, that we can.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.150
So what would that get you?

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:20.680
So.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.140
That would mean that every machine,
unlike, like, right now,

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.600
we don't do net boot or net install
on that because which image goes

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.700
to which version of which MacBook?

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.160
Which image goes to which
version of which MacBook Pro?

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.480
Oh, we just have some brand new Mac Pros.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.640
Oh, we can't use the images.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.100
So you're not actually
building images then?

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.550
It's not worth the time.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.820
Well, that's your first problem.

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:44.440
No, I've, it's actually less time to
just hope that whatever.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:44.730
How many machines do you have?

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.860
What do we got, like, two, three hundred?

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.780
I really think you're looking at how
to build images incorrectly then.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.960
I just don't feel like
dealing with the hassle.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.480
I'm sorry.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.890
Because I can get that
from other vendors.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.940
I can get reference OS images,
reference OS downloads

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:08.080
from other vendors.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.060
I can hit Microsoft's TechNet site,
and within about 60 minutes...

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:17.130
I'm still confused as to,
so if we gave you a 10.5.2 image,

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:18.570
what would you do with that?

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:22.270
Then I could make that the new master
image for every piece of hardware we

01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:23.980
bought up to the point of that release.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.540
Well, why not just take the installed
DVD that came with your latest hardware?

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.600
Which piece of hardware?

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.760
Which piece of hardware is senior
enough that I can use it for every

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.450
other piece of hardware I have?

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.840
So, it's pretty rare.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.290
Like, the end of 10.4 was kind of a
special case because of delayed

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:41.920
models and the whole forking.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.840
But I find it's pretty
rare for the latest,

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.060
newest hardware installer to
produce an image that doesn't

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:51.280
run on your earlier hardware.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.900
In a couple cases, that has been true.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.510
No, you don't install from it,
but that's what you use to create your

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:59.430
image using Insta DMG or whatever.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:04.030
But it only has to fail once or twice
before you develop a very deep-seated

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.020
inherent lack of trust in that idea.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.320
And it's failed on me
enough that I don't,

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.820
you know, it's going to take a while for
me to believe it'll work again.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.200
So we have about ten minutes left.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.040
We're going to open it
up for questions now.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.200
In the back, go ahead.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.200
Jeremy Reichman from RIT.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.200
We've seen a tremendous amount of
growth of Mac OS X on our campus.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.670
And I spend a lot of my time
dealing with the licensing

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:33.200
issues surrounding the platform.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.200
And I liked when we were
doing a show of hands earlier.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.160
And I was wondering if we'd get a
show of hands of people who were

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:42.450
satisfied with Apple's volume licensing
and maintenance arrangements versus

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:44.180
what they get from other vendors.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.200
All right.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.200
People that are satisfied.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.200
So do you mean just OS X on its own?

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.200
Just OS X on its own.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.200
Okay.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.200
People satisfied with that?

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:53.200
Okay.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:53.760
Down.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.990
People dissatisfied with it?

01:06:56.490 --> 01:07:00.480
What about people dissatisfied with
the combination of OS X and iLife on

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.500
new machines and iLife maintenance?

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:08.900
Yeah, I mean, really,
per-seat licensing is a big issue for us.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:09.240
Right.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.800
And accommodating growth over time,
because we're at the point where

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.260
we're going to have to pre-buy
so much in advance to accommodate

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.600
the growth that we're seeing,
because we can't get the same

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:21.140
per-unit pricing over time.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.790
I think there's a problem in quite
a few environments where iLife is so

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:30.720
core to how Apple markets the platform,
and yet very few businesses find that

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.970
they can produce a decent business
case to buy iLife for all their Macs.

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:36.960
In the Richard.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.460
Hang on, just a minute.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.480
I had a comment on this.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:39.820
Oh, yeah.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:40.400
Oh, go ahead.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:40.810
Go ahead.

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:41.760
Bill, it's your name to mention.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.230
We ran into an issue with downgrade
rights that Apple would not let

01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:47.210
us buy Leopard and install Tiger.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.420
And that was a big deal,
and they wanted to know how

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.800
many seats that it affects.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.930
And we had our account,
but we'd like to know if

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:54.400
anyone else has that issue.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.640
Anybody?

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:55.760
Yeah?

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.720
I think you have some shared pain.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.130
Yeah.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.590
Okay, I have a question relating a little
bit to the discussion we were

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:08.660
talking before with Time Machine.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:13.600
So ZFS is coming out in 10.6.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.670
This is actually, I guess,
kind of a feature request,

01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:20.310
but it would be really cool to
see some of the stuff that's put

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:24.810
into Time Machine apply to ZFS,
and particularly cool if

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:29.520
that was combined with more
robust server features.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.520
And I know that...
What are you asking for?

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.520
What is in Time Machine that
isn't in ZFS?

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.520
Nothing.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.580
That's my point.

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.520
My point is that ZFS and Time Machine,
in my mind,

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.120
seem to fit together pretty well,
and it would be nice if... I mean,

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:50.020
I'm hoping that that will
work together pretty well,

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.520
especially on the server side.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.520
But ZFS won't be on the client.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.520
Okay.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.490
Yeah.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.790
ZFS isn't on the client.

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:01.760
I had heard otherwise, but-- Well,
it's not in there easily.

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.820
It's in there now.

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.180
It's in there now.

01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:06.170
The DVD we got has ZFS.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.700
We're all under the same NDA, aren't we?

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.610
It's not booting.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.900
Well, if you're on a client machine,
and that's all you have.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.600
Yeah,
you need to boot for it to be practical.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.790
I don't think they've
said anything about that.

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:23.740
Okay.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:28.460
There's the only server bit, though.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:37.290
In any case,
my real interest is actually, I mean,

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:43.030
Time Machine offers a lot
of possibilities if it was

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:44.560
done well for the server.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.580
So, I mean, right now you can use
Time Machine to backup the server OS,

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.860
but that's not really that useful.

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:55.920
Time Machine and snapshotting is
not an effective server backup tool.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.440
No, I understand that.

01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:58.250
I understand that.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.980
But it would be nice if you could
apply the Time Machine effects to,

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:08.080
say, home directories so that a user can
actually benefit from the Time Machine.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:08.570
Well, you can.

01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:09.900
You can have a network
Time Machine volume.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.140
Yeah, but it doesn't work very well.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.080
That's a different question.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:14.810
I have it at home.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:18.170
Well, my point is it would be nice if it
does work well and if it's actually

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:22.160
designed a little bit better instead of
generating hundreds of little DMG files.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:25.030
Well, it's always going to be
a DMG on the network.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:26.580
All right.

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.060
Well, I guess I'm asking for
it to be a network.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.180
And that's actually a good thing
because that way you have it.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:35.090
Thank you.

01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:41.560
I did not take the mic from you.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.090
Sounds like what you would really
want is the time machine UI on

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.440
top of ZFS snapshotting stuff.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.820
And that's a good thing to
ask Apple for in the future.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.180
And that may be the direction
they're thinking in the future.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.820
If you think that's going
to ship in Snow Leopard,

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.460
I think you're smoking crack.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.860
I didn't say it would.

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.890
I was asking.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.280
and David It's also a
third-party opportunity.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.180
I mean, putting a GUI on top of a ZFS is

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.640
Yeah, you want to speak on the mic there?

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.460
As long as he doesn't
steal it from me again.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:20.740
Putting a GUI on top of ZFS is
probably not that hard of a thing.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.630
I mean, Zpool and all the rest are
pretty simple commands.

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:27.640
Sure, but, I mean,
Apple's selling a nice polished product

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.540
for end users with Time Machine.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.520
ZFS is not a polished
product for end users.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.460
I understood that.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.520
I understand that.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:38.140
But what I'm saying is people are going
to want that feature in IT departments

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.100
because they have it at home.

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:39.380
Sure.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:42.220
And be nice to Tony.

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.680
I mean,
I'm not disagreeing with you here,

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.950
but the crux of your problem is that
if Time Machine doesn't work for you,

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:51.020
Time Machine should be fixed.

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:54.360
It's not replacing Time Machine with
ZFS or something else like that,

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.070
but the Time Machine mechanism
and those things in there need to

01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:58.760
work solidly and reliably for you.

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.140
Yeah,
that's essentially what I'm getting at.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.300
It seems to me that
ZFS would be all right.

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.540
Don't cloud the water with ZFS.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.040
All right.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.160
Mark, real quick.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.650
Especially since there's
mic theft going on now.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.800
Um,

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.850
On software update,
there's a bit of a behavior issue going

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:21.100
on with software update right now.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.340
One of the things that we thought
was going to happen with Leopard was

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:28.090
that when you get a software update,
say in Tiger Server,

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:33.020
it automatically pushes the previous
update out of the way and deactivates

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.660
it and puts it to the side.

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.050
That's great unless you
don't want that to happen.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.300
Say you haven't finished your
SQL cycle on QuickTime 7.5,

01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:45.140
but now 7.5 is suddenly
up on software update.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:46.580
This is very personal.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.480
This is quite personal.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.950
I know that there were
some discussions on that.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.280
We have two minutes left.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.170
I'll try and keep it short
and basically in the next rev,

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:04.400
be really nice if the software update
would be able to just hold it until

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.340
you as administrator send it back.

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:09.060
I don't disagree with that.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.610
Definitely, that's feedback that needs to
make it into those sessions

01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.900
and those things like that.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:17.400
I do take issue with people that
really try to do a lot more with the

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.140
software update server than is ever
really rational to be done with it.

01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:23.500
This is just getting a release though,
Joel.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.180
I just want to gate the release.

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.490
I don't want to stop it.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:28.800
I just want to hold it.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.670
It surprises me how many people are using
the software update server for all of

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:35.620
their software updates to their users.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.140
If it comes down from Apple, yes.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.550
Being that this is a whole technology,
you still have to find a solution for

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.440
all of your other third party technology.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.290
Yeah, I got that kind of covered.

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:47.800
Either through Landline
or through Casper.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.600
So why aren't you running the
Apple updates through Casper as well?

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.040
No,
because the previous person who talked

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.070
about imaging and how they use disks
and FireWire drives or whatever,

01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:00.780
I mean, we have a base image.

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:03.890
It's 10.5.1 and then software update
gets it to me in about 12 minutes

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:06.300
to 10.5.3 or 10.5.2 or whatever.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320
Sure.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.820
So that's -- I don't worry about images.

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.420
I just have a base image and then
I have software update do all my

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.390
work for me and it works great.

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:15.400
Sure.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.780
But how do you do the
third party updates?

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800
Casper.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.440
So why don't you do the OS with Casper?

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.420
Because you -- Trust.

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:28.390
You trust the software update server
more than Casper that you paid for?

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:34.290
No, Casper -- I may be wrong here,
but I believe to do a software

01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:38.500
update of the OS itself in Casper,
you need to net boot to do it.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.730
I don't think you can do it.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.320
For me, also,
it comes down to the software.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:40.740
I don't know if you can
do it with the software.

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:41.970
I don't know if you can
do it with the software.

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:42.980
For me, also,
it comes down to the fact that

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.950
when users run software update,
they get a UI, they get feedback,

01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:48.560
they get this is being downloaded,
you need to log out now,

01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:50.030
you need to restart.

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:51.040
Yep.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.190
I would really love it and have
been hassling Apple about this

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:56.320
for ages if we could trigger the
same user experience with software

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.980
update from the command line.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:58.980
Yep.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.980
So we could go download and install.

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.460
All right.

01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:04.710
With that, we do have to, time is up.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.190
Oh, Schoun, I had one last, one quickie.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.480
This is in regards to
people asking about what,

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.580
how can you manage to make
sure you have an OS release,

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.260
that one that will work going backwards?

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:19.230
What we found over the years at
Genentech in our imaging process,

01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:22.740
best rule of thumb is go to
the top of the line hardware.

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.620
Basically, if you, for example,
if you image for

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:29.300
PowerBooks or for MacBooks,
you do your imaging on the latest,

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.240
hottest, sexiest MacBook Pro.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:31.640
Yep.

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:34.000
If you're doing desktops,
you do the Mac Pro.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.440
Basically, MacBook Pro, Mac Pro,
and actually, in most cases,

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.200
if you do a MacBook 17,
you cover everything.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.040
Yep, and it means your imaging guy
doesn't resent doing imaging because

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.400
he gets all the sexy hardware.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.140
All right.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:45.720
Yeah, that's true.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.080
Thank you very much.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.760
Hope you had a great WWDC.
