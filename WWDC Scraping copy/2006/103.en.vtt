WEBVTT

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.820
Welcome to session 103,
User Interface Design.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.560
We've got a bit of an echo in the room,
so I hope they correct

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.440
that in a few minutes.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.360
My name is John Geleynse.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.030
I manage the
Software Technology Evangelism

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.700
team at Apple,
but I'm also continuing in my role

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.780
as User Experience Evangelist.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.690
And we've got a lot of
stuff to cover today.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.060
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.210
And I would like to begin by
just sort of setting the stage

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.100
for why this session matters.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.490
Why does it matter to create
software that looks great,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.870
that operates efficiently,
and just delivers a really

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.530
great user experience?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.760
One of the things is it generates
higher user productivity,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.220
right?

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.180
Well, everybody likes to be
productive with software.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.880
So if your software is well-designed,
your customers are

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.880
going to be productive.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.320
And as such,
they're going to be satisfied, right?

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.440
Increased customer satisfaction,
great apps.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.360
We all have great apps that we use,
that we love.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.990
They're well-designed apps, typically.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700
There's greater perceived value,
all things being equal,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.740
the app that looks better, certainly,
and operates more efficiently,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.400
and has a better user experience is going
to be perceived to be the better product.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.560
Lower cost of customer support.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.850
Think about the cost of customer
support in your organization.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.830
The industry rates, you know,
average is about $45 to $75,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.090
depending on the company
that's providing the support,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170
per minute of customer service.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.370
And so you think about the
cost of goods of your box,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.590
and then the amount of profit
that you make on every piece,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.510
on every version that you sell,
and you figure out the cost

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.800
of customer service and the
amount of calls you're getting,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.690
and you can easily correlate the
relationship between how much support

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.740
you're providing to your customer base,
you know, versus the profitability that

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.770
you've got in your product.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.870
And so if a product is well-designed,
you're going to have

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.860
less customer service,
less customer support.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.900
Faster and simpler implementation.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.010
Sometimes creating a
really great product,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.350
a well-designed product,
takes less effort.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.850
once it's designed and
you're implementing it.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
Competitive advantage, of course,
as I said before, all things being equal,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.770
same feature set on two applications,
the one that's got a better

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.610
design is going to be the
winner in that competition.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.960
Brand loyalty.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.930
Customers stick with companies
that create great products.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.230
And so we all know great products.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.480
I think of software from
some of the Panic guys,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.840
Panic Software,
they create some great products.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410
Net News Wires are another great product.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.010
Some of these small companies
have done a great job with the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.710
user experience of their products.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.500
And the net result is they've
got customers who are ready to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.200
buy the next thing they produce.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.340
And so brand loyalty is really critical.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.060
And I know most of you are
programmers and engineers,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.990
and so maybe profitability or brand
loyalty is not something you think about,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.620
but it really does matter to the
company that you're working for.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.890
Simpler manuals and online help.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.580
Of course,
it's easier to document something

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.660
that's straightforward and easy to use,
right?

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.520
Now, today in this session, you know,
that's pretty much the boring part,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.120
the startup piece.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.410
Today in this session,
what I would like to do is

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.440
something very different from
what I've done in past years.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.080
I've been up here about six years,
I think, presenting here at WWC.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.440
And in the past,
I've kind of gone through a process

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.760
of explaining our interface guidelines
and talking about different examples.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.570
Today,
I'm going to redesign an app here on

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.600
stage in front of you and just sort of
weave the principles into that process.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:48.000
[Transcript missing]

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.220
All right, well, the experience,
sort of where I get this information from

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.800
and the experience that I bring to this
session comes from having worked with

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.880
close to 900 developers or 900 products
over the last seven years at Apple.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.570
I came to Apple in 1999,
began in this role at that time,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.780
and since then have averaged about
two or three interface audit meetings

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.610
or interface review meetings,
user interface review meetings,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.190
per week on average,
except when WWC kicks in and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.700
we have to prepare for that,
you know, starting in March.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.520
But on average, I'm doing about 120,
150 of these design reviews

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.900
and redesigns a year,
and so we're coming up on about 900,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.100
not including all of the
HI Lab reviews that we've done

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.620
at WWC over the past years,
and so there's a lot of experience

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.100
that I've gained over the years,
and I'd like to share

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.680
that experience with you.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.700
Now, interesting thing is that
despite all of the effort,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.250
despite all of the talks
that I've given at WWC and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.540
elsewhere at other conferences,
and despite, you know,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.380
multiple revisions of the design,
I've been able to get a lot of

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.380
feedback from a lot of people.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:05:05.690
I've been able to get a lot of
feedback from a lot of people.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.520
I try and I try.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.140
And we're making great progress.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.640
And I'll show you some great
progress that has been made

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.100
at the end of the session.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.730
But I want to start off by sort
of giving you the state of the

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.000
union of software on the platform.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.010
This is a shipping app today.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.900
And I don't know if you can pick
it out from the back of the room,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.780
but hopefully you can.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.070
This is a shipping app today.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.330
And the problem with it is,
if any of you here have been

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.650
on Mac OS early versions
of the system software,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.840
system 7, system 8,
we've got an app here running on 10

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.860
that's completely faked the scroll bars
and all the controls and all the buttons.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.360
It looks exactly like
a system 7 application.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.970
So that's not acceptable.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.340
Here we've got an application.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.340
It's a chatting tool.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.600
It's shipping today.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.720
Again,
the point here is not to drive people

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.880
into the ground and roast them,
but this is a little bit of fun.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.640
I mean, we appreciate the
products on the platform,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.230
but there is some need
for some good design here.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.420
So here's a chatting application.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.540
The issue here is just
some really garish colors.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.900
Some of the layout could be optimized.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.730
We've got giant controls,
huge double-sized pop-up menus,

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.200
if not triple-sized.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.940
Red text, which is a real red flag.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.620
Lots of problems.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.640
Here's an application.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.120
A bazillion buttons in the toolbar.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.320
I have no idea what to click.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.190
Where do I start?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.680
Which one's important?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.320
Which one relates to the task
that I want to accomplish?

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.330
Not to mention the fact that the rest of
the UI is completely custom and probably

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.400
looks exactly the same on Windows.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.600
Not a great experience.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.420
Here's a really cool app, actually,
which we're thrilled to

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.840
have on the platform.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.360
But it's just lacking, you know,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:18.400
[Transcript missing]

00:07:18.500 --> 00:09:22.800
[Transcript missing]

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:28.800
If I could go to the D machine.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:28.940
Yeah, all right.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.340
And just let's have a little
bit of fun here for a second.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.110
I want to zoom in and just show
you a couple more disasters that,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.840
you know.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.040
Okay, these are great error messages
that are just useless.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.680
There's not enough room on the disk FW8
gigabyte hard drive to copy Mac OS X.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.120
An additional seven bazillion, you know,
terabytes are needed.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.820
Okay, here's another great dialogue.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.720
Do I give a damn?

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.160
Attempting to give a damn.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.520
Okay, check this out.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.000
OK, it's attempting to give a damn.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.110
Unable to give a damn, it should stop me.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.560
So great error message.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.380
All right, let's see.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.180
OK, here, this one.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:07.800
This one's great.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.540
How about this for an error message?

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.200
The updater reported that it is not
the memory the diff was created.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.700
Go figure.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.590
Here's another one.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.670
I love this stuff.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.520
OK, here's a great one from Windows.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.420
Some random data is needed to generate
a cryptographic identity for you.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.210
Please bang on the
keyboard like a monkey.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.300
All right.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.100
I love this one.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.270
Here's a sad device.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.420
Your software is trying to be emotional.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.060
Unable to open a stream
to the sad device.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.000
Okay, and here's one from Vista.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.500
Trying to install Vista on my,
on one of the,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.640
I guess a MacBook or something.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.240
It says, you know,
I guess I don't have what I need,

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.730
but it's just a real,
it's real hard to read this

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.440
dialog box or this error alert.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.800
I haven't got any more.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.550
This one's great.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.470
So I've got to select an adapter here,
and then the error message

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.350
I get at the bottom is,
"wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.960
wubba," and it just keeps going.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.950
Okay, back to my slides, please.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.660
All right, so clearly there's some
design sense lacking.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.300
So what can we do about this?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.240
And that's what this
session is all about.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.800
Well, there's a design process that you
need to follow to end up with a

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.060
really great result on the end.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.920
And to explain that process,
I'd like to give you a demo of

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.480
the product that we're going
to redesign this morning.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.300
So think of this as kind of
like extreme software makeover,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.740
and this is our contestant.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.260
So if we could go back
to my laptop again,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.100
demo machine.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:43.580
All right,
and a colleague of mine who professes

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.860
to just totally not care about interface
design has written this application.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.660
And so when I found out about it,
I thought, you know what,

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.100
this is a great app to demo
in my session and redesign.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.450
So, okay,
so let me zoom in a little bit just so

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.690
you can see a little bit what's going on.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.350
So this tool is,
it's an application that allows

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.900
you just to basically open a file
and look at every byte in the

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.540
file and examine it and look for,
you know, patterns and what have you,

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.440
and analyze the data
because maybe you care,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:11.820
okay?

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.610
So it doesn't matter whether you
think it's a great application

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.970
or a useful application,
that's not the point.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.340
The point is that this is a real app that
we're going to redesign in this session,

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.540
and it does enough for us
to get the point across.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.740
So the app, basically,
I've opened the source for apple.com.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.420
I saved it as an HTML file, text file.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.520
And so here I can just, you know,
I can click on the

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.680
different bytes in the file,
and you see I've got an

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.280
ASCII display on the left here.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.240
Actually, I've got a real cool tool that
lets me highlight what I'm doing.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.700
Isn't that cool?

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.150
That's OmniDazzle.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.790
You guys have done a great
job with that little tool.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.740
Here's a hex display,
so I can look at the hex value

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.560
of a given byte over here.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.860
It's just interesting.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.750
And, you know, in fact,
if you want to hack a game and

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.290
figure out where the high score is
and then just change the high score,

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.470
this is the tool to do that.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.350
Now, I'm not saying you should do that,
but that's the kind of

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.480
thing you'd use this for.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.330
Or you might say, oh, you know what,
I've got a right.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.370
It's an RSS, you know, thing,
and I need to find out where in

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:07.040
this HTML page the RSS feed URL is
located because the page changes,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.630
but I'm looking for a
particular set of bytes.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.890
And anyway,
so you can scroll through the file,

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.780
and you can look at the different
byte values and et cetera.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.060
Okay.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.800
Now, say you wanted to make a change.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.040
You could switch to modifiable,
and now I can go in and say I want

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.770
to modify the ASCII or the hex.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.220
If I change the hex,
I can click on a particular item,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.850
and I can change it to, say, a 45,
and then I have to hit the apply button.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.400
But, of course,
it doesn't map to the return.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.330
It's a return key, which is bad.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.940
So I can hit to the
apply button like that.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.220
I can change another value.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.550
Let's change it to 45 again.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.490
And, of course, it changes it over here,
and it does highlight it in red to

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.900
show me that things are changed.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.260
Okay.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.860
And anyway,
that's kind of the basics there.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.000
I can do something else.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.030
I can flip the bottom of the screen open,
and I can create a note.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.200
I can say, okay, let's see.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.740
Right here is something about expires.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.140
I don't know.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.950
Say this is meaningful.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.280
Okay.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.390
So I'm going to make a note
about this thing expires,

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.250
and I say expires location.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.740
And then I can do some wabba, wabba,
wabba.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.620
And so I've created a note.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.100
Of course, you'd type something useful.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.220
But in this case,
it's kind of a cool feature.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.340
You can kind of go through the file,
and at different byte locations,

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.920
you can tag the byte
location with a note,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.500
and notes and their commentary
are stored in a separate file

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.840
associated with this one.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.380
So you're not actually changing
this file with those notes.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.920
So that's kind of cool.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.220
I can scroll, you know,
elsewhere so that my selection goes away,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.320
and I can hit a button,
just scroll to selection,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.890
and so now it brings the selection,
you know, where the cursor was.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.160
It brings it back into display.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.500
Not bad.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.210
I can toggle a side drawer,
and this drawer comes out,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.870
and there's a whole bunch of stuff in it.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:46.820
And the stuff in it at the top is sort
of I can look at a given selected byte,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.460
and I can see its byte value,
its unsigned value,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.600
little Indian version of a word.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.540
I can look at the long equivalent of
that byte as well as a string of hex

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.090
bytes starting at that point and ASCII,
et cetera.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.300
Okay, so you get the point, right?

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.490
It's basically just a file
sniffing type of application.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.690
And I think that was
all I wanted to demo,

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.310
so let's go back to slides.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.300
It's enough for now, anyway.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:13.750
OK.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.550
So the problem with that app is-- I mean,
I pointed out a couple

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.980
of things verbally,
but I hope you paid attention and noticed

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.090
the fact that there were small buttons,
big buttons, square buttons,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.680
round buttons.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.400
There was different sizes of text,
different font faces being used.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.900
And just the general layout kind of
looked like the shotgun had been loaded,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.210
and the stuff was shot onto the screen.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.630
So to redesign something like
that-- and all of you have,

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.320
I'm sure, some part of your application
that needs some love.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.880
And to redesign those
parts of your application,

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.420
you've got to begin with
user-centric design.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.000
In fact, the whole process,
the whole redesign process,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.640
or writing a product from scratch,
has got to be done with the user in mind.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.810
So we'll get to the specific
redesign in a minute,

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.940
but I want to begin by sort of
saying that in order for you to have

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.680
user-centric design or user focus,
you've got to first

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.240
understand who your users are.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.910
You've got to know what their problem is,
which in turn is your

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.820
opportunity with your software,
of course, right?

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.640
You've got to know what's required
for them to get the task done.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.400
In other words, do you really understand
who your users are?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.020
As time goes by,
more and more people have computers.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.700
Computers become more and
more part of our society.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.460
And what was true 10 years ago about
computer users is no longer true today.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.660
We've got a whole new generation
that's text messaging,

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.700
that's doing a thousand things at
once with all their little devices.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.920
They're not tolerant.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.350
They want instant response.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.840
They want this stuff to work fast.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.320
And many of them are less sophisticated
than computer users were 10 years ago.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.710
So you can't assume that, you know,
the world is the same

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.780
as it was previously.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.730
And so you really need to
understand your user as you design

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.550
a product and design it for them.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.640
Secondly, of course,
in the redesign or in

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.020
a design from scratch,
you need to understand

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.980
what your solution is.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.940
What are you trying to
build in the first place?

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.180
A cartoon I shared last year,
and several times,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.660
I love this cartoon I saw one time,
is a bunch of programmer

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.250
guys sitting at machines,
and the boss is going out the door,

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.120
and he goes, hey, I'm going upstairs to
find out what they want.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.850
You guys start getting coding, right?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.200
You start coding.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.840
And so many of the companies that
I've met with over the years,

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.870
that's almost what's going on.

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.090
Everybody starts writing stuff.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.820
Writing a list manager,
and writing this and that,

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.940
and no one really is quite
sure what they're building,

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.340
ultimately.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.760
Everybody's talking about
how they'll figure it out,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.820
but there's too much work going on in
terms of the engineering and building of

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.440
the product before it's even designed.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.640
And so you need to define your solution.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.080
Decide what it is you're going after,
what users are you aiming for,

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.940
and what are their capabilities.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.620
And then, as you go through the process
of defining your solution,

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.790
it's important to stay
conceptually broad initially.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.920
Come up with a general mission
statement for the product.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.010
I call it a product definition statement.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.740
The definition statement,
I'll give you an example in a minute,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.660
is what's going to summarize the
intended purpose of your application.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.110
It's going to guide everything you do,
and you should use it as kind of a

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.840
filter for every new feature that someone
brings to the design meeting that they're

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.150
suggesting you add to the application.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.000
You stick it through
this mission statement,

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.730
and if it falls through, great.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.460
But if it bounces off for some reason,
and you'll see why in a few minutes,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:25.460
you need to reconsider either
re-architecting the statement,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.000
or ditching the feature
that's being asked.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.400
So a lot of times when I talk about this,
or as people go through this exercise

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.150
and try to define the solution,
they think of their product,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.870
the end product,
in terms of the features it is,

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.610
and the things that users can do with it.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:55.440
And so you end up with a list like this.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.440
Now, it might be nicely formatted,
but you end up with these huge lists,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.440
long lists of what the app can do.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.440
What are its features?

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.440
Well,
for the app that I just demoed here,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.440
these are the features, some of them,
anyway.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.840
It can open a file.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.440
It can show contents byte by byte.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.340
It can add, edit, or delete formatters,
which I'll explain later.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.420
You can define ranges of bytes.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.890
You can go to a note location.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.480
You can revert to the original.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.640
You can commit changes.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.880
You can display byte
as an unsigned integer,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.950
a string of text,
or a string of hex in little

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.270
Indian or big Indian formats,
et cetera.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.910
You get the point.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.810
All of your apps,
the apps that you're working on,

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.110
have lists and lists and lists
of features that users can,

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.720
you know, things that people can
do with the application.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.160
And as you take those features
and boil them to specific steps,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.790
the lists get even longer, of course.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.080
You know, click here, do this.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.230
All of those are actions.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.130
But those don't define the product.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.650
And you can't build a product
using that list as your filter for

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.470
what gets in and what gets out,
because it's just a list,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.290
and there's no priorities assigned to it.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.430
So what you need to do is come
up with a product definition

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.840
statement based upon this,
sort of, but that refines this,

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.540
and that gets to the
point very succinctly.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.280
So in our case here,
the app that I demoed that

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.400
we're going to recreate,
rebuild this morning,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.780
it's a file snooping and editing
tool for highly technical users.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:05.320
So in one sentence,
I've defined my audience,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.130
highly technical users,
which is going to impact

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.010
things like the terminology,
some of the gestures,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.940
and the UI that I design.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.400
It's also a file snooping
and editing tool.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.600
It's not a file synchronization tool.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.840
It's not a file, you know, whatever tool.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.110
I mean, it's just these things.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.790
All it does is it opens, reads files,
and it lets me edit the bytes,

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.190
the individual bytes of them.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.800
So this, as you can see,
this very succinct statement

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.840
is a great starting point
for your entire design team,

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.100
because everybody should have this
in their mind front and foremost as

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.620
they figure out what features they're
going to put in the application,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.450
and as they think about what, you know,
as they design the application,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.640
they run it against this.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.060
Okay, now, you've figured out your users,
you know the solution you're going for,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.300
you've come up with a product
definition statement or a mission,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.820
you know,
mission statement for the product

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.570
that the whole team has bought into,
but how do you get

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.900
from there to a design?

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.420
Well, you get from there to a design
by beginning with something

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.000
called a mental model,
which is sort of the user's perception,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.230
you know, of the product.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.560
Actually, I jumped ahead of myself.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.640
Mental model is not the way the
application is perceived and designed

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.100
from the programmer's perspective.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.780
Of all the meetings-- I mean,
pretty much every meeting I have

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.600
gone to over the last seven years,
it's been clear that most product

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.750
teams are developing software with
their view of the world in mind.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.360
And so you get programmer
terminology showing up in the UI.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.300
You get the sort of
programmer class model,

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.840
the hierarchy of objects in your
Objective-C or your C++ code.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.880
All of that is kind of being presented.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.730
It's drawn out, and it's somehow finding
its way into the UI.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.600
So things are structured in
the UI according to how you've

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.400
architected the product.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.060
And that's not the right
way to go about it.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.350
The problem with that is that
it puts the burden of learning

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.680
your application on the user.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.100
Might be a great app,
might be great performance,

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.180
very performance tuned,
and it might be very responsive.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.320
But the problem is users are
going to come to that app,

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.080
and they're not going to know what to do.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.640
They might figure it out,
but ultimately they're trying

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.900
to kind of wrap their mind
around what this app does,

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.290
because it's your view of the world in
terms of how you designed the product

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.520
from an architectural point of view.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.320
What I mean by mental model is that
it's the way the application is

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.500
perceived from the user's perspective.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.140
That's user-centric design.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.590
And you've got to constantly kind of
take yourself out of your design mode,

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.510
your programmer mode,
and look at the application

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.940
from the user's point of view.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.190
And that's why it's important to
understand who your users are.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.760
Well, how do you determine
the user's mental model?

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.260
Well, this is a great exercise,
and this is fundamental

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.160
to this session today.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.660
It's fundamental to this process.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.240
You have to first go through an exercise,
and it could be a cross-functional

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.930
exercise with your help writers,
documentation people who understand

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.630
the app from that perspective,
with your engineering team,

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.380
key people in the engineering team,
of course,

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.830
who understand what the application
is going to be able to do and what

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.280
the technical constraints are.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.210
It could be comprised of some product
marketing people who are going to have

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.740
to pitch this to the customer base.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.330
They probably know some of
the audience you're going

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.080
for better than maybe you do.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.430
You've got product managers
who understand some of the

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.160
constraints that are going to go on.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.170
There are all kinds of cross-functional
skills within your organization that

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.140
are going to be part of this process,
or that are going to be part of this

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.710
product development that you need to
bring into this initial design meeting

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.100
to come up with the user mental model.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.040
And the mental model
exercise is basically,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.500
OK, take that cross-functional team.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.360
And work through a brainstorming day.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.180
Begin the day with brainstorming.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.210
OK, guys, what are the objects and object
hierarchies and object relationships

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.960
inside of the application that we're
going to build or that we're redesigning?

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.490
And you list them on the board,
on a whiteboard.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.790
And you just whip them out.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.540
Whoever says whatever,
you just write it down.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.620
Don't worry about prioritizing.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.000
Don't worry about cleaning up the list,
whatever.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.480
You just get those objects out there.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.840
Then you come up with another list,
concepts.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.250
What are the concepts the
user's thinking about as they're

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.800
going to use our application?

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.340
Then you list them.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.180
Then you list tasks and workflow.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.170
Tasks and workflow are synonymous,
basically.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.460
But you could build two different lists,
because sometimes the people you're

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.530
working with in the room are going to use
different terminology in their own mind.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.560
So they're going to throw things up.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.500
And eventually,
you can consolidate the lists.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.780
And you want to list roles.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.920
I was recently with a developer.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.590
They were doing sort
of a pre-press thing.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.420
And anyway, the application-- I don't
want to be specific.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.030
So the application we were
redesigning in this meeting was it

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.310
required different types of users.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.140
There was kind of the midnight
type that was using this tool.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.770
There was the day shift that was
paid a lot more money to use the

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.360
tool to design certain things.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.900
And then the midnight shift would
use the designs that were created

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.580
during the day to generate output.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.320
And clearly, there were some roles.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.860
And the roles had access
privileges associated with them.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.930
And there were parts of the workflow that
would be shut off to different roles.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.180
And so it was important
for us to list the roles,

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.140
because that impacted the
ultimate design of the product.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.790
Once you've got these lists in place,
then you go.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.980
You take a coffee break,
or you take a lunch break,

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.940
you come back as a team.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.060
You go, OK, let's prioritize these lists.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.610
What are the key objects?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.900
What are the key tasks?

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.330
What are the key workflows?

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.020
Who are the key roles
users of the product?

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.320
And you prioritize the process.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.240
This is critical because once
you've got these lists in place,

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.130
and you've scratched off the things
that you all agree don't make sense.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.430
You know, that's not an object.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.000
That's the wrong term.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.630
It's this object.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.690
And once you've kind of
finalized those lists,

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.640
then you're going to use that as the
basis for everything you do from then on.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.520
And we're going to illustrate
this in the session this morning.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.020
It's going to affect the presentation
of information on screen.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.390
It's going to affect the interaction
model of the application,

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.060
how you use it and what it does.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.720
It's going to affect the structure
and organization of Windows,

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.240
the organization of your menus,
the hierarchy of your menus.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.590
It's going to affect terminology,
of course, because you understand

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.460
who your users are.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.920
And in our case, it's a snooping editing
tool for technical users.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.580
So we can use words like
data and default and stuff,

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.560
because we assume the
users understand that.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.850
And it's going to affect
even the toolbar contents and

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.880
labeling that you put up there.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.660
Mental model affects everything you do.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.010
And you'll see that this morning.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.550
We're going to get into the redesign now,
and I want just to put something

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.060
into your minds for a minute
as we begin this process.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.100
As you start,
now you've done the mental model,

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.580
you've prioritized the whole thing,
now you get into the step where, OK,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.310
guys, as a cross-functional team,
you kind of kick around some ideas.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.420
Well, how would we represent
this stuff on screen?

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.330
It's important to keep thinking
about what is important now.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.940
You're going to talk about different
steps of the process of your application,

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.970
what the user does at one point,
what do you do at the next point.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.440
And at each point,
you keep saying to yourselves,

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.320
what is important now?

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.510
Because if it's important right now,
it needs to be right there on the

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.260
screen for the user to access.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:57.900
But if something is not-- if a
particular feature or something

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.780
that your app does is not important
now at that particular point,

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.070
then perhaps it's sort of secondary.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.100
It's a nice to have.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.860
If they clicked here,
that would be really great.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.040
It would augment what they're
doing in our application.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.960
But it's not to die for.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.860
It's not critical at that point.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.160
Well, if it's secondary like that,
then it could potentially go in a drawer.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.200
It could go into a lightweight
panel that's floating on screen.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.390
Or even if it's not even secondary,
it could go elsewhere,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.380
like just in the menu bar.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.920
And you'll see what's going on.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.400
OK, so let's start with a really,
really simple example.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.970
Say you were designing a calculator.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:28:12.300
[Transcript missing]

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.560
Let's look at iTunes.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.420
If you think about the
mental model for iTunes,

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.460
and you come up with a mental model,
you have to go through this object

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.560
concept brainstorming process.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.120
So if we define the objects for iTunes,
if you were creating a playback software,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.390
an audio playback,
whatever you call iTunes, music software,

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.130
what are the objects and concept
the user is thinking about?

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.380
Well, they're thinking about songs,
collections, or albums maybe.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.260
They're thinking about
devices potentially,

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.740
an iPod, some MP3 player.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.540
What are the concepts?

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.540
Rip, mix, burn, playback, searching,
organizing, right?

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.300
Those are concepts.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.850
They're not specific tasks.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.160
They might be,
but just in terms of this stage

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.990
of the design of this process,
let's just keep it very vague.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:01.190
Or not very vague,
but let's not be too specific.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.510
Well, we've got the list.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.100
Now let's prioritize them.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.120
What are the most important
objects from the user's point

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.600
of view for music management,
music software like iTunes?

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.630
Well, I would propose that it's
songs and collections,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.220
songs and albums.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.480
And from a conceptual point of view,
the key concepts that the user has come

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.540
to the application with is playback,
search, and organize.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.000
Well, how does this now impact-- once
you've gone through this exercise--

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:33.610
how does this impact the presentation
of the design of the interface?

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.160
Well, first of all,
songs are one of the key

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.500
objects for the user.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.120
And so they dominate the interface.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.580
In fact, they are the number one thing
the user expects to see when

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.100
they launch the application.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.900
And so they dominate the
interface for iTunes.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:51.790
Collections, albums,
which is really-- those objects correlate

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.040
directly to a concept which is organized.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.680
I take my songs and I pull them in.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.720
So that's a big part of
the interface as well.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.510
It's resizable.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.180
It's on the left.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.100
It's very present and accessible.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.140
Playback.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.160
Playback is key.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.200
It's a key concept.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.420
It's right there in the top left corner.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.800
The human eye reads from
top left to bottom right.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.270
So your top left corner of your
screen is like the top real

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.700
estate for your application.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.420
That's where you want to put
the things you want users to do

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.490
right away or see right away.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.900
And so playback belongs there.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.260
Secondly, status.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.580
I didn't have it on my previous list,
but status, communicating status to the

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.900
user is really important.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.440
And so status belongs in the UI.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:37.300
It's at the top of the iTunes window,
not so much because it's primary,

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.870
but because iTunes has another feature,
which is you can shrink it to

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.960
the little playback window,
right, the small little thing

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.940
that's floating on screen.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.660
You don't need to see the full UI.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:49.850
And it really is valuable for that
status message to not be jumping

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.160
around and for UI to change positions.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.680
It's much more valuable for users,
and from a good design point of view,

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.060
that these things stay
anchored where they are.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.960
And so the rest of the
window kind of changes,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.570
but these two items stay there.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.500
And then search is a powerful
concept that users have in mind.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.360
And so that's up there in the toolbar.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.100
It's front and center, so to speak.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.640
And it's readily present.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.780
And then, of course,
there's lots of other

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.910
stuff that iTunes does.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.230
But it's down on the bottom.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.200
It's miscellaneous.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.320
It's secondary or tertiary functionality.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.940
It's there.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.350
It's in the main window,
because there was a design philosophy

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.150
to make this a single window app.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.770
But it's very much at the bottom.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.700
It's just, you know what?

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.370
If you need it,
you can go get it kind of thing.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.080
So you can see how the mental model,
the list that you've built,

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.570
the list that you've built,
that you've decided on as

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.090
a cross-functional team,
directly impact the presentation

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.320
and layout of the interface that
you ultimately come up with.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.350
OK,
so what about our makeover contestant?

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.980
Well, this is the screen I showed you
earlier when I was on my demo machine.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.940
And if we look at the concepts
and objects for this product,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.100
I'm just going to-- I did
the brainstorming by myself.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.240
So the objects are files, bytes,
and notes.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.040
Concepts are NDNS,
display formats like Hex and ASCII,

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.360
patterns, formatters,
which I didn't demonstrate,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.880
but I'll talk to you about shortly.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.000
And then some of the tasks are not
specific actions the user can do,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.660
but they're sort of the general
features of the application.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.420
Viewing file contents in ASCII, Hex,
or other formats,

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.320
editing file contents byte by byte,
revealing byte patterns, et cetera.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.140
So that's the app I showed you.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.660
And so if I prioritize this list,
I'm going to come up-- I propose that

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.280
bytes are number one in terms of objects.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.280
If I'm doing a file
editing snooping tool,

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.400
it's all about the bytes in the file.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.880
It's the data of the file.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.440
The concepts that are important
are the display format.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.540
How do I show those bytes to the user?

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.330
And then patterns.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:42.880
Patterns turn out to be really cool.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.430
And then some of the tasks
are to view the file contents

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.000
in the different formats and
reveal the byte value patterns.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.290
OK, so we've got this list.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.780
It's prioritized.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.600
Now let's look at the current app,
the shipping version,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.280
and see how they're currently
presented in the screen.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.940
So we've got the big block of ASCII data.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.500
That's fine.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.480
That matches.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.840
We've got the big block of Hex data.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.780
That's fine.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.160
But we've got patterns in the drawer,
which is interesting,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.100
because-- and you'll see
later how this kind of works,

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.020
but trust me, patterns are key.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.460
And then we've got sort of
in the middle of the window,

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.280
down underneath the Hex view,
we've got these two radio

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.550
buttons that switch you between
read-only or modifiable mode.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.480
And I demoed that earlier.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.950
You could switch to the modifiable,
and now suddenly you can edit the file.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:34:59.400
[Transcript missing]

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.300
I've got the bytes, ASCII data.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.720
I've got hex data.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.260
And I've got my patterns
right in the main screen.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.370
And up in the toolbar,
I'm going to put two buttons

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.390
that allow me to hide the hex
view and hide the pattern view.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.210
And so the result would be that the
patterns would disappear and the hex

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.880
view would grow and that kind of thing,
like this.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.440
So I can switch different views.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.440
You're always going to have
ASCII data in this application.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.180
OK, let's look at formatters.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.680
And in order to understand formatters,
they offer great functionality.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.680
I'd like to do a quick
demo of formatters.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.960
Okay, so what formatters do, let you do,
is you,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.560
let me just zoom out just slightly here.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.560
I can click this awful tab
thing at the bottom here,

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.650
and I can create a new formatter,
and actually I need

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.660
to go to their window,
open the formatter window,

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.250
and now I can create a
formatter and call it,

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.100
you know, foobar,
and then over here I have to,

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.850
for that formatter,
basically a formatter is

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.730
like a record definition.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.550
I can say, you know, long,
and then I can specify that it's,

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.040
you know, look at this horrible UI.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.470
It's four bytes, it's unsigned, yes,
I can specify, you know, a string here,

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.790
I gotta click the plus sign,
notice the plus sign characters

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.000
and stuff are totally,
total hacks.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:37:00.800
[Transcript missing]

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.790
So how does that impact the design?

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.300
Well, the top of the screen,
which was proposed a few minutes ago,

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.580
I'm going to propose that formatters
belong on the main screen,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.240
and that essentially we have
something like Network Crafts,

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.660
where we've got a pop-up menu
that lets you create them,

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.120
edit them, delete them-- sorry,
create them and edit them.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.700
And then you would
just-- you'd name them,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.910
and you'd choose them from that pop-up.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.380
And as soon as you change it,
you'd change the view

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:25.900
of the data down below.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.330
And it turns out that in
the drawer of the app,

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:42.800
[Transcript missing]

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.400
Tertiary objects in the app are notes.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:46.600
Well, how do notes work?

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.100
Well,
they're currently in the main window,

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:48.350
right?

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.930
They don't belong there because
they're really not used that often.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.390
So remember this at the
bottom of the window?

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.620
I think it could go in a drawer.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.170
So let's take it out of the main window.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.180
Let's put it in a drawer.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.060
Let's clean it up, make it look nice.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.900
Let's take a 3M Notes approach
where they're colored.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.520
So let's give it a yellow background,
the right font, the whole thing.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.160
And notice that I've got some
additional capabilities in there,

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.130
where when I select a note,
I see the commentary for the note,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.740
and then inside the main screen,
I've got these yellow dots for behind

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.280
the byte where the note is associated.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.660
Currently, the app doesn't really give
you that kind of feedback.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.040
And if it does, it's some ugly,
ugly color.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.690
So here are the dots,
and they spread across

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:29.370
the different views.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.810
And again, patterns are just another
way of looking at the data.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.360
So let's look at the toolbar.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.800
What's going on in the toolbar?

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.940
Well, sorry.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.420
I've got the lock icon.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.400
I've got the hide pattern, hide hex,
which we talked about a few minutes ago.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.440
I've got a few other things,
edit formatters and add note.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.140
But do you remember this thing,
the read only modifiable?

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.770
So we put that into the lock icon.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.410
So we've got a little lock
unlock so that it turns it from

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.300
read only or modifiable mode.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.020
We've got the notes.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.330
And so when I turn on-- sorry.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.840
When I unlock the
application or the file,

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.980
and now it's modifiable,
I've now put edit fields behind

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.770
some of the value fields down below.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:17.590
So there's some change in the UI that
occurs when you unlock the window.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.620
We talked about these before.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.300
These expose useful shortcuts.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.010
Just edit formatters, add note.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.580
You know, some of these things are
going to be off in a drawer.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.780
They might be in the
pop-up menu down below.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.700
Putting things up in the
toolbar that just expose useful

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.030
functionality in your app is OK,
but it's important to not go too far

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.150
with that and populate your toolbar
with just so much stuff that users

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.580
don't even know where to begin.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.980
You really only want to
use it for key things.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.620
And then, of course, hide notes,
which when you click these,

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.170
all of them would change their labels
appropriately to say hide show,

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.220
that kind of thing.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.770
OK.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.880
But we put notes in the drawer.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.960
It turns out that we can
get rid of the drawer,

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.900
because notes are pretty interesting.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.830
When you defined a note and assigned
it with a particular byte position,

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.940
you can use the notes list
to navigate your file.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.500
So that's interesting.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.720
So I'm going to change the plan.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.600
And again,
going back to the user mental model,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.930
how this thing works,
as your cross-functional team

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:21.120
would talk about these things,
you'd say, oh, wait a second.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.370
You can use notes for this.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.530
And you guys are going to talk
about the features of your

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.280
app and how people use them,
because you understand your user base.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.250
And so that's going to
directly impact the design.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.120
So we're going through an iteration here.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.640
We're changing the design as we go.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.040
I'm going to propose that notes
actually come out of the drawer.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.880
They could go back into the main window.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.660
But let's put them down at
the bottom in a tab view,

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.320
because a tab view allows combination
of features into one space.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.540
And it lets us get rid of
the drawer thing on the side.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.540
And it simplifies our toolbar slightly,
too, because we get rid of an icon.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.660
So that was the Notes tab a
few minutes just prior to that.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:54.780
This is the Formatter tab.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.550
Again, same structure as we had before,
but it's now just living in a

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:58.710
tab at the bottom of the window.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.200
So we've consolidated
everything into the main window,

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.180
and it's pretty slick.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.140
We've gotten rid of the
clutter of a drawer.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.480
It really isn't necessary,
and we're moving forward.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:12.070
But wait, are tabs really needed?

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.650
I see a lot of developers,
I talk to lots of companies,

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.130
and there's a tendency
to kind of just go,

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.210
yeah, let's stick it in a tab.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.280
You know, it combines stuff,
and it's all down the bottom.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.280
You know that argument I just
made a few minutes ago.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.040
Sometimes it works.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.920
But again, are they really needed here?

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:29.800
I don't think so.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.920
I think we can grow this window
just a bit and put these two

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.300
things side by side at the bottom.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:41.860
So we can have our default formatter
on the left and the notes on the right.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:46.050
And it provides a simpler interaction,
because features are available

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:50.420
simultaneously and with a whole lot
less clicking around of the mouse.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.330
See, previously,
if I wanted to go to notes and

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:54.640
I was looking at the screen
and I had the formatter tab,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.140
I'd have to click the Notes tab,
then click a note to

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.520
navigate with a note,
right?

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.000
If I wanted to go to formatters
and it was the reverse,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.730
I'd have to click around.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.670
So there's extra clicks required,
and that's all about interaction design.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.860
Try to come up with a design
that requires the least amount

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.660
of interaction from the user
to get something accomplished.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.540
So let's combine this stuff together
at the bottom without a tab.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.940
We've changed the layout slightly.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.500
We've got more of a vertical
layout around the formatter stuff.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.460
And it looks good.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.580
Now, how did we get this great look?

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.140
Well,
there's some basic Aqua layout and design

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.080
guidelines I'd like to share with you.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.460
First of all, avoid using solid black.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:35.480
Use 75% black if you have to
draw a black line somewhere.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.570
I would advocate that you don't
need to draw a black line anywhere.

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:45.930
In some cases when you need to do that,
avoid using solid black.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:50.300
Our design, the look and feel for
Aqua is all about more muted,

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.070
more grays, and a softer presentation.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.380
Avoid random alignment
of interface elements.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.240
If you go back to the app
that I demoed earlier,

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.820
there's just this disaster
going on at the bottom of

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.440
the screen with big buttons,
little buttons, square ones.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.320
They're not positioned.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.560
They're not aligned.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.860
There's different fonts going on.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.020
It just looks like a mess.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:09.980
Group-related items.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.760
So the screen previously--
and we'll come back to it--

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.340
notes are nicely on the bottom.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.700
Formatters are nicely on the bottom.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.740
The displays,
the viewing of data on the top.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.020
Use white space effectively.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.860
You don't have to put group
boxes around everything.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.400
You can actually just separate
items with enough white space-- and

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.840
I'll show you a couple examples--
to get the effect that you need.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:29.790
And you don't need a line.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.760
You don't need a group box.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.420
You can achieve the end
result that you want.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.360
Reduce clutter.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.480
Get rid of duplication and redundancy.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.630
One of the things that I see pretty
much in every app I look at is

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:43.170
there's some dialog box or some
window or some element of the app

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:47.190
where you see a whole bunch of labels,
and the same word is repeated over

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.370
and over and over and over again.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.390
It's like, okay,
if you see a word repeated

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.090
over and over in labels or in
different elements of the UI,

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.810
start to think about,
that should be a red flag, which is,

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.070
why are we repeating
this term all the time?

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.160
It's taking up real estate.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.140
We could just use that as a title,
you know, a group box title, perhaps,

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.600
or some sort of a parent label,
and then group stuff underneath it,

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:10.230
you know, with the same term.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.100
Eliminate extraneous content.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.340
So just, again, what's important now?

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.700
Only put the stuff in the UI that's
important at a particular--

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.940
at each point of the workflow.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:23.180
And ensure close proximity of
controls to the data they affect.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.670
By that,
I mean-- a great example of that is,

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.460
you know,
the plus/minus buttons at the bottom

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.580
of lists that you're starting to
see in iTunes and other places.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.860
That's a great-- it really works,
because you just glance at that,

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.670
and you realize those controls are
kind of bumped up against that list.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.400
They probably affect the list.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:43.400
And yet, time and again, I review apps,
and I see, you know,

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.810
I'll notice buttons that are way over on
the other side of a dialog box or inside

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.240
of the main window that affect something
way over on this side of the window.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.040
And, you know, as much as you can,
try to put stuff close together

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.120
that affects each other.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.400
Use standard interface
elements correctly.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.210
Again,
avoid mixing control sizes like we saw

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.660
in the sample app that we reviewed.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.670
Avoid mixing text sizes.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.370
If you're going to go with
standard size controls,

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:09.520
go with standard size controls
and standard font face,

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.510
lucid or grand,
across your whole interface.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.440
Use user-centric terminology.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.760
Again, this comes back to mental model,
right?

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:22.260
What is the user's term for this object?

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.600
How would the user express
what they're doing right now?

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:28.130
And build that into the
terminology that you use.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.410
Avoid programmer terms,
unless you've got a real technical

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.680
audience and they're programmers,
in which case that's the right

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:35.460
term to use for that audience.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.480
Begin checkbox, radio button,
and push button labels with verbs.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.340
Capitalize the first word
of labels or strings.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.340
Use colons and labels preceding controls.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.710
Avoid mixing text sizes.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.940
Again, that same one.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:50.170
So let's look at these
in practical examples.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.990
And let's take the design that we made,
and let me show you how we applied

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.650
those guidelines to the design we made.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:58.830
First of all, on the bottom, what was it?

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:03.060
The left corner of the screen
of the window we designed,

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.890
we had the formatter pane at the end.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.620
And here we've got is
everything is nicely centered,

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.020
center equalized.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.580
You know, the edges of the controls,
the farthest right, the farthest left,

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.900
the farthest top, farthest bottom,
is inside of a box.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.560
And that whole box is
centered within that area.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:47:05.800
[Transcript missing]

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.400
And this is center equalized.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.100
Seems easy enough, right?

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.330
Interesting here.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.600
No.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.720
While this is mathematically
correct in terms of the bounding

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:21.160
box being centered in the window,
center equalize really

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.230
means visual balance.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.670
And so if we drop the box down again,

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.620
You'll see that visual balance does
not mean centering the box either.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.380
It's all about visual balance.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.820
Actually,
if you pay attention for a minute,

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.590
look closely to the sort of weight
of the-- imagine there's a scale.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.300
And on the left side or
right side of the line,

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.360
you've got so many
characters on the one side,

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.010
and you've got so many
characters on the other side.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:47.560
But you know what?

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.620
Checkbox controls are
way a little bit more,

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.620
and so they kind of tip
the balance this way.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.480
And so this is why you need a visual
designer involved in interface design,

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.840
because there are people who
are sensitive to this stuff,

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.240
like me, who can pick it out in the dark.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.110
We can just go, ah!

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.020
And anybody who's been in a
meeting with me knows that

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.400
as soon as you start talking,
I'm like, hey, what about that?

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:06.600
Hey, what about that?

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:07.940
But this is a great example of it.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:08.780
It's center equalized.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.690
So if you did the first version where you
just put it in the box and centered it,

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:12.450
you'd be good.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.700
I'd give you good marks.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:17.180
But to get it right,
it's about balancing things

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.990
across the center line.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.240
All right.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.050
Another thing I talked about
is right aligning labels.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.840
I still see this getting-- you know,
people are getting this wrong.

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.710
You-- where you've got a whole
bunch of things vertically stacked,

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:37.100
whether it's in a main window or a dialog
or any sort of interface container,

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.780
you want to make sure that
what is labeled has got colons

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.190
on it and it's right aligned.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.760
Everything that's stacked
is right along the colons.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.580
And then their associated elements
and controls are left aligned.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.340
OK?

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.920
It looks great.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.490
If it's done well, it looks great.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.320
It's very clean.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.810
In fact,
I just read a study-- just going back to

00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:00.450
the previous slide-- I just read a study
on the web where some interface designer,

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:04.840
scientist guys, walking around lab coats,
very expensive labs, did some kind of a

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.480
test where it was like,
OK, are right aligned controls easier for

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.680
users to discover what's going on?

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.740
And it turns out that it takes your
mind about-- it's five times as

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.280
fast to associate a label with a
control when it's right aligned than

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.900
when it's left aligned or aligned.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.860
or aligned otherwise.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.430
So it's interesting
what we've done in Aqua.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:27.360
Left-aligned dependents.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:28.780
Here's a different
dialogue from another app.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.560
But here's a case where you've got
a dependent-- the size edit field,

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:35.960
particular number of
pixels or what have you,

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.540
is really a dependent of
the radio button above it.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:46.340
And you can see how I've left-aligned the
text of the S for size with the edge of

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.560
the text for the radio button above it,
its parent radio button.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.360
Just little tips.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:52.460
Goes a long way.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:53.880
Space items and groups adequately.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.370
I was talking about using white space.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.930
So here we've got between
each of the individual items

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.600
in the bottom of our display,
we've got kind of this section for bytes,

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.010
section for word values,
and longs and strings.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:08.880
And each of those sections is
separated by the same amount of space.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:12.600
And there's no-- I don't
need any gray lines.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.710
I don't need group boxes.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.710
Your eye just kind of
separates out things,

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.280
and it sees the groupings.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.980
And it's a much cleaner design.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.880
And then that group, that space there,
is really from the bottom of the

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:27.750
pop-up menu to the top of the
characters in the edit field,

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.290
not the edit field itself.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.680
Again,
something I see over and over and over,

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.910
a lot of this is just, I guess,
people coming over from Windows,

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.330
bringing apps to the platform,
and we love that they're doing that,

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:43.860
but it is a standard on Macintosh
that the action buttons are

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.010
in the lower right corner,
and the most action item,

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.240
the OK button is in the
rightmost side of those two.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.960
Begin checkbox and
radio labels with verbs.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.900
If you scan the human eye,
you will scan UI constantly.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.560
Users are always doing that.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:01.960
That's the way your mind works.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:07.020
And if you can begin checkboxes and
radio buttons with verbs or action words,

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:11.060
you will quickly be able to go down
this list and just go selected,

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.210
reposition, remember, copied, you know.

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:14.980
You don't even have to
read the whole label.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.600
You could just go, ch-ch-ch-ch.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.030
And you've seen it before,
and so then your mind fills

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.280
in the missing blanks.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:52:42.800
[Transcript missing]

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:48.860
We've got the top left corner,
you've got the application menu.

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:51.960
So about is there, and preferences,
great.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.540
The right keyboard shortcut, perfect.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.310
Everything else is great.

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.780
So that menu is good to go.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:00.180
The next menu down just
below that is the File menu.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.600
New, open, recent, close, apply, yeah,
yeah.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.200
It's pretty good.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.500
On a first pass, I would say yes,
it maps great.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.930
These are all commands that
associate with the file,

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.980
and the file is a key
object in the application.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.380
Next menu, above that one in the
center of the screen,

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.020
is the Edit menu.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.520
And we've got standard edit commands,
undo, redo, copy, text bigger, smaller,

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:20.920
sure.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.190
It's good enough for now.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:28.300
Let's jump to the, I think,
the one below it, the Find,

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.480
which is associated with
the Tools menu at the top.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.090
This is probably the menu that
would need the most work in

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:37.740
a redesign meeting with me,
because it doesn't map to the

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.380
mental model we've talked about.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:41.080
In fact, the menu bar should change.

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:43.020
Tools should go away completely.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.030
There probably should
just be a Notes menu,

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:49.090
and then perhaps a Formatters menu,
and then perhaps another menu for maybe

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.260
one of the other objects that we would
talk about and come to agreement on.

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.480
And you really want to just have menus
for those objects that have commands

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.280
associated with them specifically.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.180
So Notes absolutely have commands.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.360
There are Notes management commands.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.190
Formatters have-- there's
stuff related to formatting,

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:05.710
you can see,
but all of this stuff is jammed

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.820
together in this one menu that
the developer just sort of said,

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.370
ah, whatever, just call it Tools.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.100
Right?

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:14.110
And I don't know how many Tools menus
I see in applications that I review,

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.060
but there are lots.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:18.460
And I bet you've got one in your app,
or at least some of you.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.920
So that one needs some work.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:23.260
But the last one, specific to Notes,
actually it's great.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:23.660
It's good.

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.080
It's all about new Notes, go to Notes,
open Notes, manage Notes, et cetera.

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.190
Now I might work on
some of the terminology,

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.700
because just like radio buttons
and check boxes need to begin

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.260
with action items and verbs,
so do menu items.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.950
So that you can just go to a menu,
choose an item,

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:41.440
and just understand that it says, like,
open, save, print, you know, format,

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:42.260
whatever.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:46.680
And so action items at the beginning
of text menu items is great.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:51.160
So tool menu would have to be redesigned.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.730
You're beautiful.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.640
All right, I want to honor some products
on the platform that have done

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.850
a great job in this regard.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.640
And these are beautiful apps.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.150
And so clearly, you know,
when we started,

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:09.380
it was obvious that there's
certainly lots of design sense

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.580
lacking in the community,
right?

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.630
There's still lots of people
creating a pretty useful software

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:17.380
from a functional point of view,
but from an interaction

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.150
usability point of view,
it still needs a lot of work.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.130
But there are lots of developers
also who are doing great work,

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.460
and this is to honor them.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:28.680
So the first is Delicious Library,
the guys at Delicious Monster have

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.730
done a phenomenal job.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.600
These guys have won an
Apple Design Award in the past,

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:32.500
if not a couple.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.370
And this app does a great job at just
sort of representing the user mental

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:40.860
model and communicating very visually
in an elegant and delightful way what's

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.560
going on and what data it's representing.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.130
And from left to right,
interestingly enough,

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:55.040
it goes from general information
that you would click on,

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:57.560
you know, like I want movies or books,
over to the right.

00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:57.560
From left to right,
you're going general to specific.

00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.150
So as you make a general
selection on the left,

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:01.200
then you go to something
more specific in the middle,

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.910
then you go to something very
specific about that selection.

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:07.020
And so that's a great model,
from left to right, general to specific.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.530
Here's another one, Fuzz Measure Pro.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.680
It's a product that does,
it's for acousticians.

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:18.730
It's for acousticians to
determine the sort of the

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:23.750
acoustic configuration of a room,
a home theater perhaps.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.900
You put a microphone in
the center of the room,

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.620
it generates a sound tone,
and then it tells you exactly what

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.870
you need to do to your speaker
arrangement or furniture arrangement,

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:35.320
and it looks at the flow of the audio
response and all this sort of stuff.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:37.800
And anyway,
it's just a real simple to use,

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.910
highly complex,
very very cool application, well,

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.760
well designed.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.100
Photo Magico by Boinks.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:48.560
The guys at Boinks have done a phenomenal
job at creating an app that just,

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.780
in a moment,
you can just put together these

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:54.100
really cool visual effects for
photos and put together some

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:55.830
really compelling slideshows.

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:59.190
Great, great,
where they have customized controls,

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.480
which I don't generally encourage,
but they've done it

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.900
because they needed to,
and they've done it in a really,

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.470
really elegant way for rotations
and for zooming and stuff.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:31.430
Great product.

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:36.130
This is iBank, great banking software.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:39.120
It is everything that banking
software should be on Mac OS X.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.000
It's a great, simple, clean,
well-designed Aqua app,

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:46.660
and it pretty much does everything that
you would need for personal banking.

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.480
Looks great.

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:51.000
The Body Journal, phenomenal product.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.190
It looks gorgeous.

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:55.390
This is a standard, this is just a
straightforward Mac OS X app,

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:57.900
but for the audience
that they are going for,

00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.490
which is people with medical
needs who need to track,

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:03.690
you know, blood sugar levels, and,
you know, heart monitors,

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:07.360
and all the stuff that you need to track
when you've got medical conditions,

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:10.500
this app lets you keep track of
all of the data for your situation,

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.180
for anybody in your family,
for that matter.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.450
Doctor visits,
everything is combined here,

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.630
and because you probably wouldn't
be in this app on a daily basis,

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:21.880
they've sort of upped the ante in
terms of the visual presentation.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.030
They've made it gorgeous to look at.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.480
The entire app looks like this,
and then where there's actual data entry,

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.250
you've got standard Mac OS X controls,
but this is a really,

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:33.090
really gorgeous app,
and it's completely appropriate

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.880
for the audience they're going for.

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.760
NetNewsWire.

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:41.020
This guy, not a lot of sex appeal in
terms of the look of this app,

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.750
but this is probably one
of the best RSS readers,

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:45.220
in my opinion, on the platform.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.520
And I say that from a
usability point of view.

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:49.940
This app does exactly
what you want it to do,

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:51.300
when you want it to do it.

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:55.470
And these guys have spent all their
time making this thing do just the

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:57.480
right thing at the right moment.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.080
It anticipates what you want to do.

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.440
From a usability point of view,
these guys have done a great job.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.060
It's a great, clean look and feel.

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.060
It does exactly what it's supposed to do.

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.010
Guys at Panic-- and again,
these folks did not pay me to do this.

00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.000
This is totally my top
10 list or top 12 list.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:19.340
Folks at Panic with Transmit,
great FTP product.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.450
It does exactly that.

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:25.550
It just does FTP, and it does it really,
really well with a really clean UI.

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:30.230
iSale, folks at Equinix,
great application for doing eBay,

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:33.440
for designing eBay auctions
and getting them up there.

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:37.650
Just a much more pleasing approach
to the process than it would be if

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:42.280
you were just using the standard web,
more bland web interface.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.880
And then on to jobs,
something written by a student.

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:50.140
Just the cleanest, simplest time tracking
tool you have ever seen,

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:53.720
with a really great startup mechanism
for just pointing users to what to

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:58.910
start at first in a non-modal way.

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:03.140
It's at the point where the app
certainly needs a couple more features.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.450
But from a student point of view--
and I'm not telegraphing ADA winners.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.380
By the way,
Apple Design Award winners here.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.580
I'm just talking about usability.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:11.520
But this is a great app.

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:14.330
This person has done a great
job keeping the UI very simple,

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.910
very focused, very clean.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.630
Sandbox.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.080
Great.

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:25.140
It's kind of like an iWeb
type of web authoring tool,

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.440
but it goes beyond the
capabilities of iWeb to deliver

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.840
a really powerful functionality.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:36.280
And the interface is just clean,
straightforward, no extra crud on the UI.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.260
Very, very well designed app.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.780
Yojimbo from the guys at Bare Bones.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.250
Really, really great.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.620
I am totally impressed with the layout,
the visual appeal of this app,

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.960
the coloring.

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.440
It is as clean and simple and
straightforward as you could want for an

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.600
application that does this type of thing.

01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:01.120
And applause to all of these folks.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.620
So again, that's kind of my top 12
interface choice list.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.510
We have covered the process of
redesigning an application today

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.520
by looking at an existing app.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.590
And we've kind of gone through
the mental model process.

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:14.540
But we have only touched
the tip of the iceberg.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.440
This process is a long process.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.720
I'm not talking about years,
but it's certainly more than 75 minutes.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.820
And we've only touched part of it.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:25.060
But if there's nothing
else that you remember,

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:28.070
remember some of the things we talked
about in terms of mental model.

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:32.460
If you would like someone to go through
this process with you during this week,

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:36.220
the HI Lab is just behind me here,
right in the same room at the back

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.580
of the Graphics and Media Lab in
the ADC Compatibility Lab.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.220
Feel free to stop by and sign up on
the sheet for a time slot this week.

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.100
We'll give you a one hour consultation.

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.140
It's not going to be
with me most of the time,

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.120
because I have other
responsibilities at the show.

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:50.880
But you can certainly
get on a waiting list,

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.780
and I will follow up with you
after the show with your company.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.180
I can come visit you and do this
kind of presentation in front

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.400
of all of your organization.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.740
But the folks at the HI Lab are the
actual interface designers at Apple who

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.920
created the look and feel of Mac OS X,
the Aqua interface.

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:08.270
They're not from our apps division,
they are from the OS division.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.430
So they are kind of guys that you
can talk to and not worry about

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:14.660
sharing industry secrets with.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:17.420
And if you're concerned about that,
then work with me, because that's my job,

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.940
is to work with third party developers.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.650
But please, work with those folks.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.320
They're going to do a great job and
help you kind of navigate this process.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.560
Apple Design Awards tonight.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.810
A plug for this is a personal
invitation to attend the Design Awards.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.230
It's a great ceremony.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.480
We're going to have a lot of fun.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.510
And we are basically going to applaud
and award excellence in software design.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.180
And I look forward to
seeing you there tonight,

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.800
and Presidio.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.120
Here's my contact information,
Gellenze@apple.com.

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:46.180
That's G-E-L-E-Y-N-S-E at apple.com.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.420
Find me at the show.

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.140
Once I'm done today in
the Apple Design Awards,

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.480
I'll be much more relaxed.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.530
I'll be available just to sit down
with you in the hallways if I'm free.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:55.600
Come by the HI Lab,
and then check out the

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:58.090
interface guidelines,
which have won awards numerous

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:01.460
years in a row for great quality.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.990
So thank you for attending the event.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.260
Hope this was valuable.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.860
Remember, mental model is critical.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:09.160
Get that right and everything
else will fall in place.
