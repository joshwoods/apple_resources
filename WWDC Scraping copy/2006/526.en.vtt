WEBVTT

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.140
We're just going to go with this
simple action just like this.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.170
And I'm going to choose
Show this action when run.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.180
And in Automator, that will pop up,
that little piece of the UI,

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.480
when this thing runs.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.360
Let's save this.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.500
But not in the usual way.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500
We're going to say save this as a plugin.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.920
And we want to save
it as a folder action.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:13.200
[Transcript missing]

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:23.490
With this folder action attached to it,
and I can quit Automator right now.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.390
Uh-oh.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.560
That never happened, did it?

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.440
We'll quit Automator right
now and we'll find a file,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.800
we'll drop it in there.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.800
Somewhere I've got something
interesting on here.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.800
How about...bear with me for a moment.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.800
I had a movie I was looking for.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.790
Put the slides back up for a moment.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.970
Thank you.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.360
All right, hang on.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.920
We'll be right with you.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.300
Tony, tell them a joke.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.320
Oh, my.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.120
I'm the straight man, Steve.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.010
I know no jokes.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.840
There's this really cool movie at
the beginning of the presentation.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.800
I can switch to that if you want.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.800
Yeah, go to that one.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.640
Everybody wants to see that one again,
don't they?

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.040
So how about that party last night?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.500
Wait, no, I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready, I'm ready.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.230
Okay, here we go.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.640
Okay, now can we have this machine again?

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.660
I found my movie.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.240
I'm going to drag this file and I'm
going to drop it in that folder,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.670
and that should trigger an
Automator workflow that pops

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.680
up this little piece of the UI,
which is optional, and I'll say copy this

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.630
to all the computers,
and it should copy that

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.700
QuickTime movie over to all the
machines and launch it and play it.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.980
So you've now got a nice little way
that you can distribute something

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.520
easily to all the computers in your lab.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.870
You've got a little
folder in your desktop,

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.090
drag and drop stuff in there, poof.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.080
It appears in the lab.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.320
I noticed something interesting.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.660
Picture you're a teacher
with a room full of students,

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.090
and you're looking at
some interesting web page.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.000
Here's your Toronto Argonauts finest team
in the Canadian Football League website.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.070
All right, all right.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.380
You can drag a URL out of here
and drop it in that folder,

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.360
and it will copy some kind
of a web location folder

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.420
over to the other machines.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.490
And they should all then go--

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.330
This workflow will wake up and copy
that URL to all the remote machines,

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.080
and they should all open this page.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.090
That's going to be...

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.570
So for me,
I had that one set up to pop up

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.940
that little piece of the UI where
I could pick all the machines.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.930
But you might like to set it so
it just automatically dumps things

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.070
to all the remote computers.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.850
I got one more slightly elaborate
workflow that we showed yesterday

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.630
I want to give you a brief
peek at here involving some

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.130
custom actions that I wrote.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.670
I've got a workflow here
called Classroom Quiz.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.460
It's my other teacher's scenario.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.170
How many of us are frustrated teachers?

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.200
How many of us are
teachers' college dropouts,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.800
by the way?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.960
I'm proud to be a dropout of
Teachers College at York University.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.380
Thank you very much.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.260
Here's a workflow that's going to,
we did this one yesterday,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.110
but I'm going to talk a
little bit about it today,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.740
that starts out by making
a new keynote presentation.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.720
And then we're going to
take a computer list,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.250
find a bunch of computers,
and we're going to run

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.160
this custom action,
which is a little

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.640
AppleScript Studio-based action
here called Ask a Question.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.560
This action is going to pop up a
little dialogue on the nine computers,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.370
and my lovely helpers over here
are going to vote on the answers.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.220
They've got 10 seconds to pick
a choice off of this list.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.130
And then the results come back in here
and are passed to a standard Keynote

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.280
action that adds a chart to a slide,
in this case a 3D pie chart.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.110
So I'll set this one to
Show Action When Run,

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.010
and we'll run this here.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.940
So it's making a new keynote
presentation in the background.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.700
I get to fill in my question.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.860
Who's your favorite CFL team?

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.880
The Argos, Hamilton, Montreal?

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.180
Okay, guys, go vote.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.600
So they all get a little pop-up...

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.920
Little pop-up like that on
each of these computers.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.960
They're all voting,
picking one of the buttons.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.970
The answers are coming back
after a 10-second timeout.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.140
The data is passed to Keynote.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.500
Keynote makes a pie
chart with the answers.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.190
Isn't that neat?

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:03.310
There were a few too many votes
for the Montreal Alouettes.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.580
I think we're going to
have to do this one again.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.000
Get back up here and
vote for the right team.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Holy smokes.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.120
Stop.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.170
Even when you rig the election,
apparently your team loses.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.220
Ah ha ha ha ha.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.520
Jeepers creepers.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.150
All right, Tony, do some slides.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:22.980
That's how you feel.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.930
Sorry, that was my one joke.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.960
All right, so that was Automator.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.800
We'll loop back through and
show you some of the things

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.080
you can do with AppleScript.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.370
And for those of you new to AppleScript,
you want to find applications

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.210
that have dictionaries.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And the dictionaries will
tell you the kinds of things,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:45.410
the objects that you can interact with
in those applications with AppleScript.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.020
This is the dictionary
for Remote Desktop.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.730
And in it,
you see things like common tasks

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.760
that you might want to run.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.680
Here's a list of the task
objects included with ARD.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.240
And we can do things
like send Unix commands.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.010
We can restart the machines.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.680
We can lock their screens.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.460
We can install packages.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.470
Let's take a look at a very
simple example of a task,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.180
the upgrade clients task.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.210
So you set up a bunch of
machines out of the box.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.940
They have the ARD 2.2
client installed on them.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.330
You've got
Apple Remote Desktop version 3.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.160
You want to upgrade all
of those clients to 3.0.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.890
We've got an Apple script.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.540
The very first line here is going to
create a variable called the clients.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.970
And in this variable,
we're going to stuff a list of all

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.230
the computers that you have selected,
that you just selected

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.040
in Apple Remote Desktop.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.790
And that'll remember those,
and then we'll create the task

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.850
as a new upgrade client task.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.870
And finally...

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.540
will execute that task on those clients.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.460
And because we're telling
Apple Remote Desktop to do something,

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.780
we'll actually see those things
happen in the application as if

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:58.350
we'd done those individual tasks
with our mouse and keyboard.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.860
A more involved example is
the send Unix task example.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.860
And in this case,
we want to run the Unix command uptime.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.310
We want to see how long these
computers have been running.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.630
Still very simple,
but we create a variable

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.900
called myserverlist.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.180
And notice in this one,
instead of picking the machines that

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.340
are selected in Apple Remote Desktop,
I've predefined an ARD list called

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.000
servers to run this task on.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.340
And I created a new task.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.240
I called it anewtask.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.930
It's a sendunix command task,
but notice we have a lot of

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.080
properties we can set for this task.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.930
These are options that you would
be clicking in the application if

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.340
you were running them manually.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.500
Things like setting the name of the task.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.300
ARD will remember and show you the
currently running task or previous tasks.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.680
This one will be named
showComputerUptime.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.390
We can also decide when we
run this remote Unix task

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.470
which user it will run as.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.540
And if you want to run a task that
requires administrative privileges,

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.010
you want to choose the root user.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.020
The root user does not need to be
enabled on those remote systems.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.600
ARD will run your script
as root regardless.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.170
Finally,
there's ordinarily a checkbox in ARD to

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.190
show the output of your Unix command.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.900
In this case,
this is something we want to see.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.290
And when this executes,
ARD will perform this task and

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.810
show you the output within ARD.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.710
And finally,
the specific command that we're

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.850
going to execute is uptime.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.580
It could be as involved
or as simple as you like.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.090
We're going to execute the
task that I defined on the

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.760
machines in that computer list.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.470
But in addition to doing that,
we're going to create a

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.060
variable called the result,
so that we can get those values back and

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.630
maybe do something interesting with them.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.500
And this is what those results
look like in this case.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.880
A number of machines will
respond with their unique ID,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.250
their IP address,
and the results of that command.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.980
If you enter that script
within Script Editor,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.790
which is in--it's included with Mac OS X,
you can save that as an application.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.030
And it resides in your finder.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.750
Double-click on it.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.580
You can also trigger it as a
result of things like mail rules.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.900
So let's say your boss sends
you an email message that says,

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.140
I'd like to know what
the server uptime is.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.040
Your script can fire, get the uptime,
potentially mail it back to him,

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.970
and he doesn't even need
to know you're not at work.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.470
And then we've also got iCalc capability.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.690
So if you want to schedule scripts
without using something like Cron--

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.850
Just put them in your calendar,
set an alarm, and have that alarm

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.410
trigger an AppleScript.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.140
And now for some more AppleScript demo,
here's Steve Hayman.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:22:54.500
[Transcript missing]

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.290
Now, I want to just, before I proceed,
I want to show one little Unix

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.720
command that I wrote here that I'm
going to be making some use of here.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.180
We were at Macworld.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.880
Nader and I were at Macworld back in,
when is Macworld?

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.040
It's in January or something.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.940
It's not here either, is it?

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:08.600
Is it here?

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.210
It is here.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:09.620
It is here.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.590
And there was some big,
humongous lab of iMacs

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:17.080
spread all over the place,
and something was wrong with host 47,

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.020
and nobody was really sure
which machine was host 47.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.710
There were 50 computers out here.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.810
Which one is host 47?

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.440
I thought, well,
there's got to be a way to

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.030
identify that from across the room.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.150
So this terminal window here
is running on my laptop.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.030
I wrote a little tool
called Big Honking Text.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.410
that just displays
text in big letters on,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.310
sorry, on the wrong computer,
big honking text.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.040
This displays text on this
computer here like this.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.780
And if I could send a command like
that to a whole bunch of computers,

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.640
then I could display large text
on a whole bunch of computers.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.080
People say, "Steve,
why didn't you use Growl?" Well,

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.130
Growl is great,
but I think Growl requires

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.260
you to be logged in.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.450
This particular tool can display
text on top of the login window,

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.000
which is kind of nice if you have
a bunch of logged out machines.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.390
So I got a tool like that.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.760
That just makes me
want to write a script,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.540
you know?

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.170
So we're going to bring
up Script Editor here.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.360
We're going to try to
create a new script,

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.780
typing it from scratch without using
any of those wussy type-it-for-me

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:21.460
tools that some of the other
presenters have been using this week.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.050
and I are going to tell
Remote Desktop to do something.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.070
First thing I want to do,
I want to create a computer list.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.100
This list happens to be called
WWDC over in Remote Desktop.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.100
You can see I've got a list called
WWDC with these nine machines on it.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:39.100
Set WWDC to Computer List WDC.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.800
And if I could just run that,
you can see that we've retrieved

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.100
some goofy kind of Apple script
reference or something to a list

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.570
of computers inside of ARD itself.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.590
Now I want to create a
Send Unix command task.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.800
If you look over in the dictionary,

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.650
You'll see that there's this class
called "Send Unix Command" - "Send

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.720
Unix Command Task" - and you give it a
script and you give it whether you want

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.890
output shown in Remote Desktop or not,
and you give it the name of a user

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.380
you'd like to run the command as.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.750
Perhaps the console user,
but perhaps root if no one's logged in

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.550
or if you want to remove all the files.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.410
So let's make a new task here.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:23.700
Set my task to make new send Unix
command task with properties.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.670
Is this the most verbose
programming language in the world?

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.700
Name.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.880
I'm just going to run the Unix
command hostname as a simple example.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.910
Hostname.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.190
So this is going to be
the name of my task.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.400
The script it's going to run is I'm
going to run the Unix command hostname.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.340
Okay, that's just a command
that returns the hostname.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.150
We'll say showing output true.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.920
That means I want Remote Desktop to
display all these results.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.640
And user root.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.000
Don't really need root for this.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.540
So that's actually
created a task object now.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.920
I've got a task object.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.430
I've got a computer list.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.310
I'm all set.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.410
Execute my task on WWDC.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.130
Running this will execute,
will create a new Send Unix Command task

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.980
and run it on all those remote computers.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.760
And this isn't going to display
anything on the screen yet.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.460
This is just going to
return results to me here.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.200
So if I run this, we'll see that ARD has
actually run it over here.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:11.940
It's shown the results.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.440
And back here,
I get this complicated record with the

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.180
line of output that came back from each
machine and their IP address and so on.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.780
If I want to, in Apple Script,
I can walk my way through this and start

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.280
picking out results and analyzing them.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.920
And doing more things
to certain machines.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:31.180
However, given that I have a program
called Big Honking Text,

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.950
Let's change the script so that
it pipes the output of hostname

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.770
into the big honking text program
on each of the remote computers.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.500
and I hope you can see it over
here in this window over here.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.580
We run that now.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.990
Each of the machines is going to
display their host name in big letters.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:53.710
This starts to get pretty handy, I think,
if you're trying to diagnose things

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.730
on a large lab full of machines.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.300
So one approach that you could take
is you could write a whole lot of

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.990
these little system administrator-y
kind of scripts that ran Unix

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.360
commands on remote machines and
displayed them in big letters.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.830
And then you could walk back to
your computer every time and launch

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.670
the script or run the Automator
workflow or run the Cocoa application

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.020
that you built with all this.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.300
I'm lazy.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.700
I want to run it near
where my computers are.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.300
There's this great tool
called Soling Clicker.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.430
Those of you with Bluetooth phones,
you should get Soling Clicker or one

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.250
of some other similar applications
that allow you to associate

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.490
Apple scripts with events on your phone.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.810
Soling Clicker runs as a
preference pane like this.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.380
and the idea is that you
can set up your phone,

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.780
a link between your phone and
Sol and Clicker on this computer

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.960
to execute an Apple script.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.090
And why not have that Apple script
execute a command that tells

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.400
Remote Desktop to go and do something?

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.670
Now we're talking.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.000
So if we dig around in here,
I have set up on this system

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.980
a bunch of ARD scripts.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.280
Here's one that shows the host name.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.250
In fact,
if we looked at it in Script Editor,

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.540
this is just a simple script,
just like what we saw.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.770
It's displaying the host
name on the remote computer.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.480
But Sol and Clicker is associating
that script with an entry in my phone.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.830
I think I can show that to you here.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.420
If I hold my phone up
to my iSight camera.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:12.900
One second.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:15.450
Oh, I have a message.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:15.900
Oh, great.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.340
No.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:18.460
One moment, please.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.290
Steve, you were supposed to turn your
phone off before the presentation.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.750
If this demo didn't work,
it's because they told

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.680
me to turn my phone off.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:29.190
So I have a bunch of menu items on
my phone like this that correspond

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.300
to those various scripts that
I've loaded in to Sol and Clicker.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.120
Oh, Sal's taking a picture.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.450
Hi, Sal.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.610
You get that?

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.340
Does one of those scripts say, "Hi,
Mom"? I got to go.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.420
I got to plane at 3:00.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.030
Got to go.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.180
Let's take a picture.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.870
So...

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.030
I have a bunch of different scripts on
here where I can do things like click a

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.090
button on my phone that will cause all
the machines to display their IP address,

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.440
for instance.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.760
Or, actually,
let me put up the big window so those

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.250
of you in the back who don't really
believe that anything's happening

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:00.160
here can see what's happening.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.000
Here's the nine computers.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.340
Show me uptime.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.040
That's a Unix command.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.410
Uptime.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.760
Show me the uptime of
all these computers.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.460
I'm running a Unix command
and displaying the result.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.480
Let's see.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.470
How much disk space is available?

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.790
If you run the DF command and, you know,
grep for this and awk for that

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.170
and pick out the second line,
you can get something like this.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.580
Oh,
they've all got 56 or 57 gigabytes free.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.200
If you get really fancy here, let me see.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.400
Somebody asked me for what
launch D items are running.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.970
So you can tell which things
are running what services.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.940
Oh, there's all the launch
D items on all the computers.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.210
I don't think I'm going to use that one.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.470
But I like this one here.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.270
It turns out there is a particular
Apple support web page that

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.380
you can go to and type in the
serial number of your computer.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.190
Maybe you've seen this.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.360
It's apple.com slash support.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.920
And in there you can type the serial
number of your computer and it

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.920
will come back with some warranty
information about your computer.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.780
Well, how about I have all those nine
computers go to that page and type in

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.360
the serial number and get the result?

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.630
Let's see what happens.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.610
This one takes a moment because
each of them is now doing a separate

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.680
fetch to this support site at Apple.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.160
And they're going to come back, I hope,
and tell me the warranty status

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.540
on all these different machines.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.900
That was fun writing that one.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.600
Boy, picking cookies apart and
scraping the output of the script.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.600
So I think as a management tool,
this is actually not a bad idea.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600
You've got a large lab.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.510
You want to walk around and make
the machines do something by

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.900
clicking the actual buttons in here.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.900
I think you might actually
find that quite entertaining.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:27.800
I find it quite entertaining.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.500
Let's have all the machines
say their host name.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.290
Let's see.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.090
We're doing audio on the iMacs right now.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.700
Here comes some audio on the iMacs.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.710
Everybody say your host name.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:49.000
[Transcript missing]

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.240
So you can do,
I'm taking a big chance here,

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.650
but you can do other
stuff on here as well.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.270
I've got some other scripts
that do things like put

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.000
all the machines to sleep.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.150
Oh, it's asking for confirmation.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.210
Put them all to sleep.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.390
Please.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.480
And wake them back up.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.570
Now, another thing you can do,
I'm not going to show it here,

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.340
another thing you can do with
Sol and Clicker and these other

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.490
Bluetooth attachment things is have a
script executed when this thing loses

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.960
contact with my laptop over here.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.780
Like if I walk out of the room
with my phone in my pocket,

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.040
I can have all the screens lock.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.320
Wouldn't that be cool?

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.010
Now you've got a little talisman
device that locks the entire lab

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.710
every time you go to the bathroom.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.690
All right, maybe not.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:31.830
Might not be the best.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.980
So I would encourage people to
have fun with these scripts here.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.500
There really are a lot of neat
things you can do by tying all

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.320
these different ideas together.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.390
And I think for a lot of us,
once you get one script working,

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.920
the rest of them fall
out pretty naturally.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.040
Okay, I want--boy, Tony,
we're actually going to have time for

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.790
Q&A because this is going so swimmingly.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.100
I haven't had to reboot anything yet.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.190
I had some good patter ready for
if I had to reboot a computer,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.910
but look how well everything's working.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.200
I want to try one more thing here.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.440
Like many of you,
like many of you I'm sure,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.430
hands up if you run a marching
band in your spare time.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.400
All right,
all you people listening to the

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.230
stream on the QuickTime stream,
I wish you could see all the

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.930
hands that were going up.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.300
It's phenomenal.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.030
Half the crowd here are
apparently marching band leaders.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.860
I'm a marching band leader.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:20.720
I run the band for the Toronto Argonauts,
and we're working on a song.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.090
We're working on a little
GarageBand song here.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.700
GarageBand, scriptable.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.420
Oh, boy.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.300
I got GarageBand.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.640
I got Remote Desktop.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.290
What can I do?

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.340
And I've got a Cocoa application.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.940
This is an
Apple Script Studio application

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.980
that's going to execute various
workflows and shell scripts and

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.020
Apple scripts in response to
clicking on these various buttons.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.890
Well, first thing I'd like to do is
I would like to launch GarageBand

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:48.370
on all nine of these computers.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.270
Here it goes.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.360
Clicking a button,
GarageBand starting up here.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.550
I would like to run a script that
copies the current GarageBand song from

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.570
this computer to all nine computers.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:02.540
There it is.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.640
It's now copying a GarageBand
song to all nine computers.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.240
Now they've all got a copy of
the Liberty Bell March here.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.200
But what I really want,
this is the future of music education,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.040
I want each of these nine
machines to play a different part.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.460
will run that script here.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.950
And each of them is
deleting all but one part.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.340
In fact, if you were to look at this one,

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.270
All it's got left is the trombone part.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.720
Here's the trombone
sheet music down here.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.330
If I were to look at this one over here,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.140
Piccolo, this one's got the
Piccolo music going by.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.400
In fact, maybe I'd like to use a big
honking text just to remind

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.180
me of who's playing what part.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.470
This is the point at which you would
have-- This is the point at which-- wait,

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.600
wait, wait.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.580
There's one more button
I know you want me to click.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.220
This is the point where in my dreams,
in my dreams of this session,

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.650
I had nine musicians were going
to come out and stand here,

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.570
each one of them in front of a different
machine and play what they saw.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:04.570
But in lieu of that,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.360
Let's just see what happens if
we send an Apple script to tell

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.660
all the machines to rewind to the
beginning of the song and play.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.590
One of these machines is only
displaying the bell part.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.160
Which one is that?

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.600
Oh, that was a bad idea.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.640
This one, display box.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.040
Which one of you guys is the bells?

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:27.900
There's the bells right there.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.860
I'm going to keep an eye on the bells.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.610
Oh, nothing happening in the bells part.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:37.100
Somewhere later, I think there's a bell.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.500
Or is it much later in the song?

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.490
Oh, here comes the bells.

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:40.740
We'll wait about a minute here.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:46.040
Perhaps I won't let this
play all the way through.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:47.800
Oh, okay.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.380
Oh, you want to hear the bell
part when it comes in?

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:49.720
All right.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.500
Thank you.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.500
Oh, don't worry, there's a repeat.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.500
There's a repeat.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.500
The bells are coming.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.400
I think we're ahead of schedule here.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.250
Maybe we should look
at the trombone part,

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.000
that might be more interesting.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.680
It's got, oh, there it is.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.880
There it is, marching along here.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.120
Coming up to a bell, get ready.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:43.760
Get your bells up.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.720
You all brought a cowbell, right?

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.760
You all got the note, right?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.150
Here it comes, get ready.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.490
I would like to thank the sound guys from
the crew for being patient with me and my

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:37.300
ridiculous demand that we have audio from
nine iMacs for a remote desktop session.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.050
Okay, back to you, Tony.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.160
Let's play a different song at the end,
maybe.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.160
So a quick summary.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.150
Apple Remote Desktop's a powerful
system administration tool,

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.160
but you can set it up to be used by
folks who are not system administrators.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.160
You can integrate it with Apple Script or
Automator to expand on its feature sets,

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.150
do things that it's not
able to do out of the box.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.160
And you can set it up so that folks
who are not system administrators,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.050
maybe teachers, maybe even students,
can take advantage of its features.
