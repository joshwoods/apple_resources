WEBVTT

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.340
Good morning.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.500
My name is John Rosascco.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.080
I'm a member of the
Apple OpenGL engineering team,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.490
and I'm here to talk to you this morning
about the state of OpenGL on OS X.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.440
In this session,
if you'll indulge me for a minute,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.240
I'm going to cover what
OpenGL is in a slide or two.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.960
And I know that's a little elementary
for most of the crowd here,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.030
but I think it helps to kind of
ground us in a minute before we go

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.990
into the rest of the presentation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.880
I'll also talk about
OpenGL's role on OS X.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.580
We'll go through some of the new
features and things that have

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.180
happened in the specification
and in Apple's implementation of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.280
the specification since WWDC '05.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.250
We'll talk about what's
new in OpenGL for Leopard.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.140
We'll go through some
architecture slides,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.400
some of which,
if you've attended previous WWDCs,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.550
you may have seen before,
but we'll have some new stuff

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.510
in there for you as well.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.410
We'll go through some of the new
extension examples and we'll kind of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.780
roll that together with best practices
and basically how to make the best out

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.480
of modern OpenGL specification and the
features that have been enabled in OS X.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.420
So what is OpenGL?

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.710
Fundamentally, it's a specification.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.390
And that specification describes a
software interface to graphics hardware.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.240
The OpenGL specification,
currently version 2.0,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.560
has been developed by the
OpenGL Architecture Review Board,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.140
otherwise known as the ARB.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:03:54.600
[Transcript missing]

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.140
So what does OpenGL do?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.360
Fundamentally, it takes a few inputs.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.920
It applies,
and those inputs are pixels and vertices.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.910
Then some visual operation
is applied to that data,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.280
and it produces pixels or fragments out.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.820
And really, if you take a look at it,
back at Apple,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.090
we have the OpenGL machine printed
out on the wall by our group,

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.720
and it's about five feet
wide and four feet high.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.900
This thing has, you know,
it's basically describing

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.080
a state machine,
which is kind of feathered in here,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.290
that has an innumerable number of states,
it seems like, at times.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.360
But it's often good to
just reflect back and say,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.260
what is it that this thing is doing,
and where are we in those three states?

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.500
Are we here at the input stage,
where we're modifying this data?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.960
Are we in a kind of transformation stage,
or are we in the output stage, you know,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.160
kind of the rasterization
end of the pipeline?

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.970
So OpenGL's role on OS X,
I think it's pretty fair to say,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.760
is very unique industry-wide.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.560
And its uniqueness is really rooted
in the fact that there are application

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.870
dependencies and API and framework
dependencies because the Mac OS X user

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.240
experience is so intimately tied
with this kind of visual experience,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.700
all the way back to the genie effects you
see when you close windows and all the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.140
compositing and transparency that's been,
you know,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.520
now most folks are familiar with
as far as OS X is concerned.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.470
You know,
the heart of all that is OpenGL's

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.370
processing that visual information.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.220
So, as far as OpenGL being
Grand Central Station,

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.460
I alluded to some application
dependencies earlier.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.370
You know, one of the most fundamental
application dependencies is the

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.810
Quartz Windows Server itself and all
the windowing operations that are

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.320
basically controlling the desktop
and the OS X user experience.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.530
The other application dependencies,
like iLife and iWork,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.220
represent a very broad base of Apple's,
you know,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.280
basically their customer or their
clientele that are using the platform.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.320
So, obviously,
iLife and iWork is a big part

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.340
of the OS X user experience.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.960
There's also the professional
applications like

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.600
Final Cut Pro and Logic and Shake,
you know,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.940
for music and digital compositing.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.040
And video editing.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.720
Those all also depend
fundamentally on OpenGL as well.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.550
And there are also the API dependencies,
some of them of which you may

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.270
have seen in this session,
such as Core Image or Core Video and

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.860
the new Core Animation.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.620
These all depend on OpenGL as
well as Quartz Composer.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:09:28.500
[Transcript missing]

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.880
So, new things since WWDC '05.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.160
We've been very busy.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.160
And one of the biggest
new things is OpenGL 2.0,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.300
and I'll talk a little
bit more about that later.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.900
GLSL.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.890
As of the last WWDC '05,
we did have GLSL support,

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.960
but it was only in software.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.150
Since that time,
we have given GLSL full hardware support.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.470
The introduction of framebuffer
objects at that time in the

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.000
Mac OS X OpenGL implementation of OpenGL.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.920
Also, pixel buffer objects.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.290
For the first time,
stereo and window on the platform.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.440
And processing,
we've added a feature for processing

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.300
unit determination based on the
enabled state for your application.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.700
We also added an extension for our Vertex
and Fragment program that allows batching

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.430
of program parameters and a lot more
efficient kind of uses of the API so that

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.730
you're not just hammering on the API to
send these parameters into your shaders.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.260
We've added an extension called
Apple Flush Buffer Range for

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.680
partial flushing of VBOs and
more efficient use of the bus.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.730
We've added Intel GPU support,
so that's kind of a big departure,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.970
or not big departure, but a big addition,
because adding a driver is kind

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.540
of a big deal on the platform.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.310
Obviously,
not only is the GPU support there,

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:06.310
but the OpenGL implementation has
had to do a lot for CPU support

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.120
for the Intel platform as well.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.950
There's a lot of optimized paths,
and when it comes to OpenGL development,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.920
there's no room for messing around
or dropping megabytes per second on

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.170
the floor when you're trying to move
two or three gigabytes a second.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.950
So obviously,
we've got to make the most advantage of

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.720
the CPU that we have at our disposal.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.210
So for Leopard, what do we have new?

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.600
OpenGL 2.1 will be available in Leopard.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.780
And GLSL version 1.20
of the language spec,

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:49.960
that GLSL 1.20 is available in the
developer seed that you've gotten,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.360
or the Leopard preview DVD that
you've gotten here at the conference.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.350
So that's ready to go.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.820
You can find out a lot
more about the GLSL,

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:06.100
modern GLSL usage and examples
by attending Nick Burns' session,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.250
number 216.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:15.200
We'll also add support for
OpenGL ES 2.0 in Leopard timeframe.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.380
64-bit support, a big one to make your
application 64-bit ready.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:26.240
We have multi-threaded our GL engine
and our command stream for processing.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.620
The pervasiveness of multi-core
systems was just too tempting

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.000
not to make that change,
that transition.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.640
We'll have a new major version rev of
OpenGL Profiler available in Leopard.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:48.620
And we're going to have some
to-be-announced shader tools.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.070
So this is probably one of my
favorite things that's happened

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.600
since the last WWDC '05,
which is that our group has done

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.760
a lot of work on updating the
documentation so that you can get the

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.260
most out of your application on OS X.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.700
This documentation is really superb.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.710
They had a lot of engineering
support working with technical

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.470
publications on this.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.700
Very well illustrated, great examples,
really great coverage and

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.580
continuity across the platform.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.100
So I really encourage you
to take a look at this.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.590
It was updated recently, June 28th.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.600
So I hope you find it as interesting
and kind of compelling as I did

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.910
when I first took a look at it.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.060
So, on to architecture.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.640
As far as the architecture on OS X,
I alluded to some of the diagrams

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.110
you may have seen in previous years.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:48.910
OS X has some really unique
challenges when it comes to

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.160
architecting an OpenGL implementation.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.280
If you consider that you have a
system that is capable of driving

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.720
multiple displays using multiple
heterogeneous devices from various

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.770
different graphics vendors,
that means that this one device may

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.720
be driven by logic that was written
in part by Apple and part by NVIDIA.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:17.640
This display over here is driven, again,
in part by Apple, but by ATI or Intel.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.990
Then you take your application.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.360
You have an extended desktop
across those two devices.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.700
You move it from a GPU that
has capabilities of,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:33.510
say, the ATI X1900 over to something
with the capabilities of one

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.710
of the older NVIDIA parts,
for instance.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.770
You lose a tremendous amount
of functionality as far

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.880
as the GPU is concerned.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.450
If there's a bunch of state
that's not supported in hardware,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.800
obviously the implementation has to do
something smart with all that state.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.860
It has to move it across.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.360
Basically, seamlessly.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.220
Make your application do what we call a
renderer switch when you move it across.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:03.910
For these reasons,
it's kind of why the OS X combination

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.430
of OpenGL is quite unique.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.970
We'll describe the framework
interface and the driver model.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.600
So on the top of this diagram,
you see your application.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.310
And on the left side,
you'll see the windowing

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.180
interfaces to OpenGL.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.780
There are three of
those available on OS X.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.950
One is Glut.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.790
And you can see kind of the
dependency chain for Glut.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.680
Glut depends on NSOpenGL view.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.740
So essentially,
Glut is a kind of Cocoa-based,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.380
results in having sort of
a Cocoa-based application.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.510
Over to the right of that, you see AGL.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.200
And AGL is for carbon-based
GL applications on OS X.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.590
Underneath Glut is
NSOpenGL app kit slash Cocoa,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.640
if you want to put
another slash on there.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:05.060
And always remembering that, you know,
the app kit code and functionality

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:09.650
is not interchangeable with AGL.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.510
So those are two paradigms you never mix.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.300
And similarly,
because Glut is derived from NSOpenGL,

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.600
you do not mix that with AGL as well.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.480
So underneath that, of course,
is driving through the state to

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.960
the OpenGL engine and drivers that
ultimately control the hardware.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.180
So as far as the driver model,
we talked about the application

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.400
and the framework interface.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:39.400
You may have heard in some of the
State of the Union sessions some of

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.900
the work about the OpenGL engine,
and this is effectively

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.460
another logical module.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:53.040
One of the kind of configure application,
it's a modular implementation,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.730
so you're really just trying to
wire together these different

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.400
elements in a manner that
makes the most sense logically.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.900
Some of this wiring happens kind
of beneath the covers for you,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:09.410
but ultimately you control this
by choosing pixel formats and some

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.800
of the state that you've set up
in your application and so forth.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.880
So you have the GL engine
kind of command stream,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.890
which then drives the commands
into the driver layer beneath it,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.880
and we have our new Intel.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.930
So you have the driver plug-in
there in blue on the right,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.390
the previous three were at the last WWDC.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.070
And ultimately,
once the driver state has been set,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.690
that drives the commands
through to the hardware.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.760
So that's it for architecture.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.810
And after a little water,
we'll go into features.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.100
So, new features for OpenGL and Mac OS X.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.330
OpenGL 2.0.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.170
Now...

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.500
If you consider,
most of you are probably quite aware

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.990
that when OpenGL makes a revision,
a minor revision number is

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.550
usually pretty significant.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.760
In OpenGL's case,
a major revision number, therefore,

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.180
is even that much more so.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:24.680
What makes OpenGL 2.0 much more
significant than the 1.x series is the

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.390
introduction of the GL shading language.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:37.510
That, of course, is the descendant of the
arb-vertex-in-fragment program method.
