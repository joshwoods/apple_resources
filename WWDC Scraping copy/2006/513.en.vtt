WEBVTT

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.130
Hi.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.560
Excited to be here today to
talk to you about iTunes U.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.150
This is a new service from Apple that we
just began making available this summer.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.960
So I've divided this
session into three parts.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.610
First, I'm going to talk about
an overview of iTunes U,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.510
give you a sense of what it is,
what it can do,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.120
and how and why you might want to use it.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.840
And then we'll move on and talk about
integrating your authentication,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.490
authorization, and your online learning
environment into iTunes U,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.200
what steps are required on
your part as an institution.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.500
And then last, we'll talk about content.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.500
So just curious,
how many people here are already

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.410
a part of iTunes U and are
working on their implementation?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.740
Great.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.040
That's great.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.790
Thanks.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.270
So let's get into talking about
exactly what is iTunes U for those of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.250
you who are here to learn about it.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.810
iTunes U really got its start
from the iTunes Music Store.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.130
This graphic I put up here
is just to display the fact

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.250
that the iTunes Music Store,
iPod, and iTunes were really designed

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.370
to work together as a unit.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.760
One without the other doesn't make
the entire system as complete.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400
The iPod, a great device for portability.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.240
The iTunes, the great desktop software.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.890
And the iTunes Music Store is the
place to get content was the goal.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.080
And as we started hearing back
from the education community

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.620
about what was needed,
we realized we needed a way

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.720
to get content into iPod and
iTunes in higher education.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.860
So we created iTunes U.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.340
Now iTunes U, as I said,
we just made available this summer.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.980
has been in development
for a little over a year,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.290
and we've been piloting this
with some institutions that had a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.290
great interest in iPod and iTunes.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.510
So we feel today what we have to offer
is the best way to distribute content

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.320
for iPod and iTunes in Higher Education.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.290
I mentioned this is a
service that we're hosting.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.990
We're making it available to
Higher Education institutions in the U.S.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:17.990
and Canada, not for profit at this time.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.420
It provides a really simple and
powerful way to manage content and it's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.200
not just simply about distribution,
it does a lot of collaboration as well.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.920
So if you're thinking about podcasts
and already doing podcasting,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.990
you can use iTunes U not only to
distribute content but allow your

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:37.990
students and instructors to collaborate,
to share the content

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:37.990
that they're authoring.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.570
We'll talk about how to control
access to iTunes U because iTunes U is

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.070
also about allowing you to control
who's authorized to use different

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.310
sections of your site and really be
able to put very fine-grained or broad

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.310
control on what type of content you
want it to deliver to your audience.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.510
I mentioned it's a service.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.390
We're making this a service right now.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.510
We feel comfortable in doing this
because we really want to be able to

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.270
deliver features to you quickly and
turn those around and give you new

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.740
features as fast as we can deliver them.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.970
We have over 2.9 million songs
in the iTunes Music Store.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.240
We're delivering a million videos
per week and 3 million songs per day.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.600
And we have the infrastructure to
do this and we feel very confident

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.080
in delivering that to you.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.400
This is an example of an iTunes U site.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.580
We'll get into a demo shortly.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.980
I just want to show
you a few screenshots.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.060
Duke University was one of
the first to use iTunes U.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.980
I'm showing this page to also show
you that you can protect access

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.010
to content or make content public.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.220
Duke University has chosen to
make some of the content they're

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.300
distributing open for free access.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.600
So the content on this site and
all the sites within iTunes U,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.190
there's no DRM on it.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.940
Anybody can access and
download these files,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.300
and they play back on an iPod and iTunes.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.910
They also play back on other players.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.290
So with this site,
Duke University has chosen to put up

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.560
content that they feel is not just
accessible to their students and faculty,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.370
but to the entire community and is
important for them to be able to access.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.820
So you can get to this site
through their web browser.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.300
UC Berkeley is doing the same thing.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.910
This is their welcome page and
they have content up here in

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.910
several different categories.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.680
They have computer science content,
biological sciences, engineering.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.610
As you click on individual
icons on this page,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.920
you drill down into other levels
where you'll see course pages.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.880
Here's Stanford's welcome page.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.880
They're also distributing content.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.710
To the public,
all three of these cases are.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.730
And as we get down onto
an individual page,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.420
you see this is what
we call a course page,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.000
which should look familiar if
you've used the iTunes Music Store.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.940
This is very similar to an album
page within the Music Store.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.300
And we took a few other concepts
from the Music Store that I want

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.300
to point out to make what we call
a course page within iTunes U.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.760
We've taken tabs,
which are an element that iTunes

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.450
Music Store uses for essentials to
organize content into different areas.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.150
So you don't leave the page,
but organize content

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.760
into different sections.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.200
So they have this faculty lectures
section that's been broken down

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.390
into several different categories.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.740
Audio, best of philosophy talk,
and titled opinions, video,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.780
micro documentaries,
and travel and study.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.650
They have a links box that
they control the content of.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.490
They can link to other content that's
related to this audio/video material

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.440
that's on their website or on other
websites that they want to point you to.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.600
And then there's a way to download
all the tracks in each tab or

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.060
subscribe to the content in this
tab as a podcast so that you can be,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.110
as a user, updated with all the latest
content when they choose to add

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.500
content to these categories,
these tabs.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.600
So those are a few areas
I want to point out.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.510
We're going to do a demo,
and I'm going to ask Jason Ediger,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.820
who's the product manager for iTunes U,
to come up here and help me with that.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:30.800
And we'll take you through more of
a real example that we've created

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.800
called the Apple Digital Campus.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.800
Great.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.800
Thank you, Eric.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.170
So Eric showed you some of the
screenshots of some of the iTunes

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.390
U sites that are out there,
primarily some public sites.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.400
And what I want to do is kind
of show you the infrastructure,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.750
how they built out those sites,
and how they were able to

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.640
manage some of the courses.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.040
So we're going to log in
from a web-based environment.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.760
And I'm going to log in actually as a
person with two different credentials,

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.520
one for a site administrator,
as well as somebody who has course

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.660
management roles or an instructor role.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.260
So when we go in and
we're on the front page,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.060
you'll notice that this front page
looks different than UC Berkeley.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.130
It looks different than Stanford.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.840
This front page is yours
that you can customize.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.790
You'll notice that you have edit page,
edit appearance tools here

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.020
on the right-hand side.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.910
You can put your top-level graphic,
your messaging, your background colors,

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.690
your links.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.120
So that way you can match the
look and feel of your university.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.440
So as you pass a user into iTunes U,
it very much feels as if you're providing

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.600
a service that's part of your university.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.820
You can link out to things
outside of iTunes U.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.330
So if you want to link back
to your web-based services,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.700
online resources,
course management systems,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.000
you can link back to the
web using link boxes.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.680
In this case, our service.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.500
So if you want to link back
to your school calendar,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.600
it's the Apple Store schedule
at the Palo Alto store.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.650
And you're able to link over into the
music store if you wanted to do that,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.530
or anywhere else that is URL addressable.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.930
Jumping down into a course,
this is set up as English 350.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.500
Going down inside of that,
you're seeing that we're able to

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.000
divide a course into sections.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.390
This is love and despair and poetry.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.200
So there's love, there's despair.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.810
If you heard my joke,
there's more despair than love.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.570
And so you're able to go in and
actually manage this content.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.000
You're able to get individual songs.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.100
You're able to get tracks.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100
And one of the nice things
that we've been able to do is,

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.500
be able to do collaboration.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.900
And so you notice there's a
Dropbox tab in here as well.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.990
So I, as a course manager,
have an edit tool up

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.400
here to edit the page.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.000
And you'll notice that the
UI changes just very slightly.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.870
So when I click edit page,
I get these editing tools

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.400
in line inside of the page.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.800
So for Dropbox,
I'm able to go in and say that the

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.380
student access for this tab is a Dropbox.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.300
As students create audio and
video content for this course,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.300
they can drop it back into that tab
and hand it back to a professor.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.900
You can also set it for
it to be a shared tab.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.100
It can be a no access tab or a way
of just having straight download.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.080
So I, as a course manager,
might have a no access tab so

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.740
I can build out content inside
of the environment before I make

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.090
it available to the students.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.490
I can also manage content to
upload it into this environment.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.810
So if I click on upload files,
I'll get a tabbed environment inside

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.570
of a web browser that allows me
to go to the tab that I'm going to

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.300
associate content with and then add
the track in line and then I'll upload

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.300
it and refresh it inside of iTunes.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.540
Thank you.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.290
I can also edit the links box.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.620
Hang on,
it would help if I saved my changes.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.220
Let's edit the page again.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.410
I can add a links box up here.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.420
So if I wanted to add a link or a URL,
again,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.760
out to those other web-based resources,
you can do that.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.820
It's also important to note
that everything inside of

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.220
iTunes U has its own unique URL.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.300
So if I wanted students to
come and grab the Raven,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.450
I can grab that URL,
paste it inside of my

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.740
course management system,
and then a student can click on it,

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.460
link into iTunes,
and with a single click,

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.820
sync it to their iPod so
they can listen to it.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.080
It's important to note that iTunes
U is not a course management system.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.070
This is a content distribution system.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.340
We look at it being a complementary
service to a service like Blackboard

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.380
or WebCT or Sakai or Moodle,
where this course management or

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.880
the learning management system
provides the context for the

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.640
content or where the communication
and the collaboration would occur.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.710
But when you want to give students
access to audio and video content,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.360
it's one click away inside of a browser.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.590
And then they can easily
sync it to their iPods.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.760
Inside of these as well,
you're able to go in,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.080
and as Eric pointed out,
you can add subscribe buttons,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.360
standard RSS 2 feeds coming out
of the iTunes U environment.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.760
We support everything that the
iTunes Music Store itself supports.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.820
You'll notice here that we have video
icons next to these assets here,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.780
so these are MPEG-4 or H.264 videos.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.560
When a course instructor adds new
content to this particular tab,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.670
it'll automatically be podcast to
whoever has hit the subscribe button.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.180
And again, each one of these elements up
here is URL addressable as well,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.720
So if you want to drive somebody to
an individual tab versus an asset,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.230
you can do that.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.020
And then I think the other asset
type that we have in here is a PDF.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.460
So again, you can distribute audio,
enhance AAC, MP3, enhance audio, video,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.290
and PDF, anything that the music
store can distribute.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:53.320
The way that we build out the front
page is if we go to edit page and

00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:00.400
we wanted to add more courses,
you'll be able to see that we have the

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.400
tools for being able to add new sections.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.400
So if I wanted to add new
sections called Heard on Campus,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.400
I can do that.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.400
Heard on Campus.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.510
"I could add a new section and then
I could go and add a new course

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.080
to that and then build that out."

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.750
Okay,
so that's kind of the quick top overview

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.430
of how you're going to build out a page.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:20.260
These are the tools that enable you
to build out an environment like

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.490
what you saw with the screenshots.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:23.490
And with that,
we'll turn it back over to Eric so

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:23.490
he can talk through how you can
authenticate into the environment

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:23.490
and tie it into your infrastructure.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.740
Okay, thanks Jason.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.500
Okay, so you have a sense now
for what iTunes U can do.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.490
What do you have to do as an institution?

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.700
So now I'm going to switch gears and
we're going to talk about what it takes

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.490
to integrate your institution's online
identity management into iTunes U.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.830
I'll talk a little bit
about the design approach,

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.860
why we've chosen to design it this way,
and then we'll get into

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.470
The actual steps of authorization
and passing information to iTunes U,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.260
talk about the structure,
how you build that out,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.980
and then tie access
controls to that structure.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.580
So one of the things that we did with
this design was to make sure that

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.310
you as an institution would be able
to control everything you need to

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.610
control about access to these courses.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.090
Students and faculty and other members of
your community have an online identity,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.950
hopefully with the
institution that you're with,

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.680
and that should be the way
that they enter our system.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.050
We also realized we wouldn't
be able to have complete access

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.190
to all the data we need to.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:35.440
So we need a way for some server on
your site to authorize users to the

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.200
content that is residing within iTunes U.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:47.750
So all the decisions about access control
should be made by business logic that

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.750
you encode or write code to produce.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.960
So one of the philosophies we took
away from that was early on working

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.290
with some of the universities we
were working with that a lot of

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.060
people were interested in SHIBLA,
Federated Identity Management,

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.730
and allowing for the sharing of resources
across institutions and things like this.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.560
This is similar to what
we have done in Spirit.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.640
We're a content provider,
a service provider in this case,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.790
and your institution is
an identity provider,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.480
and we want to make sure that we
allow you to secure the content.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:23.960
So let's get into what gets passed
from your institution into iTunes U.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.000
You have a message here that
we've crafted an example

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.630
of that sends an identity,
a time stamp, and a set of credentials.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.140
And we'll talk about how the
credentials are used in a moment.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.490
Identity, I want to point out,
is an optional piece of information

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.300
you can send to iTunes U.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.070
We realize that there are
privacy concerns and you may not

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.810
need to identify users by name.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.300
What does this get you in iTunes U?

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.070
If you want to identify users and
put in things such as a full name

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.760
or email address or username,
this allows you to track the user

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.050
information more closely in reports.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.560
It allows you to identify in the Dropbox
and shared tabs who uploaded the content.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.610
If you want to use opaque identifiers
in order to obscure this and

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.790
meet your own privacy policies,
then you may want to do that.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.350
Keep in mind that it does preclude
some of those features from being

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.920
as user-friendly in terms of being
able to display who did something.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.680
The time stamp guarantees that our
servers are on the same wavelength,

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.060
that the message is coming at the
time that we expect it to come.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.390
And then the credentials are really,
we have two here, two different student

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.670
credentials as an example.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.050
What defines the user's
access within the system?

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.970
In this case,
the example is somebody transferring in

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.840
as a student enrolled in two courses.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.400
You add the shared secret that we gave
you when you created your iTunes U site,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.940
and you produce a
signature of that message,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.950
and then you post all that
data over secure HTTP to Apple.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.860
And that's how you transfer
information to us about what type

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.600
of a user is entering the system.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.590
So let's take that through step by step.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.560
One of the first things you need
to do is figure out where the user

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.170
is going to enter iTunes U from.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.380
Probably a web page.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.350
Probably should be a web page.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.160
That's what we've worked with in
all the cases we've done so far.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.180
So I've got the Safari icon up here just
to indicate we start off in a web page.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.130
And it could be, as Jason said,
a course management system,

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.340
learning management system.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.510
Could be some other
gateway that you create.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.120
There's a request to access
a resource within iTunes U.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.570
That resource needs to go
to your campus web auth.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.220
You need to make an authentication
and then an authorization decision.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.580
What is this user authorized to see?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.100
Where can I go and get information
about what affiliation?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.760
So this is a way to get information
about what affiliation this user has

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.240
with things that are stored in iTunes U.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.750
So course enrollment data or other
group-based information that you have.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.130
Then you construct that
message we just saw,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.520
and you send that server
to server to iTunes U.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.240
iTunes U validates that,
and if it validates,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.090
it sends back a URL that will contain
a session ID that will establish

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.320
a new session for this user within
iTunes U with those credentials.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.760
So that gets forwarded
on back to the browser.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.100
The browser launches iTunes.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.300
There it goes.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.320
iTunes, and iTunes accesses iTunes U.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.590
So that's how you get
a user into iTunes U.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.620
Jason mentioned bookmarkability,
having the URLs to individual

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.630
assets within iTunes U.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.070
In order to make that work,
you also need to consider that

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.140
your web auth server is going to
need to understand a destination

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.620
parameter that we expect.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.180
So it's a form value that if you
want to make bookmarkable URLs work,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.150
needs to get passed through your campus
web auth onto iTunes U so that we can

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.300
generate a URL that's going to take the
user to that specific track or asset.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.700
OK, so I'm going to go through an example
of building out a course structure.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.680
And this is the structure I want to have.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.560
And we'll talk about courses.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.710
I have a Courses section.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.580
I have an Events section.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.080
And I have a Campus Community section.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.180
So my Courses section,
I've created three courses just

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.340
to go through as an example.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.940
You could create many more.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.080
And my Events and
Campus Community section,

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.650
I have a few sections of
content that I've organized

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.440
into different course pages.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.330
With this,
I want to create unique identifiers

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.120
and establish credentials for each of
those three courses and think about the

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.540
different roles I want to give to those.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.620
I want to have a student role,
and I want to have an

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.340
instructor role for each course.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.310
Now for Events and Campus Community,
I want to have a credential that

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.780
allows anyone I choose-- in this case,
I'm going to choose

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.500
students as a large group,
any student enrolled in my

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.460
institution-- to have access
to content within that site.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.140
And we're going to block everybody else.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.470
There's going to be no
public access to this site.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.520
So underneath,
we have this type of a structure.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:02.480
We have the welcome page, three sections,
and course pages underneath.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.060
Now let's consider the roles.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.150
When you got your welcome
email for iTunes U,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.180
you were given site
administrator credentials.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.320
So that was the first one that you
had that allowed you to go in and do

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.120
the things that Jason was showing to
create courses and sections and such.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.900
The two other rules to think
about in this case are instructor

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:22.900
and student that I mentioned.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.350
Further, when you get further
with your implementation,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.460
you want to consider two more roles.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.980
Authorized member,
which I'll use in my example here,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.810
which is somebody who, as I said,
is a large group of people,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.350
anybody who's a student in this case.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.580
Or it could be anybody
who you just authenticate.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.650
If they're a part of your community,
you're going to allow them to

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.940
see the content within your site.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:48.990
And then a visitor role is the public,
anybody who comes to your

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:48.990
site unauthenticated.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.650
So we have four levels of access.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.440
Blocking access altogether.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.990
Enabling download access,
which enables podcast access at the same

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.820
time if you've turned that feature on.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.100
Upload access to be able to put content
back into a specific page or tab.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.860
And then edit access,
which allows you to either edit the

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.500
entire site or just the section that
you've been given edit access to.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.250
So let's combine these with the roles
that I have and define what the rules

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.320
are and policies are for my example.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.210
Site administrator is going to have
edit access to the entire site.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:27.200
We're going to have instructors
edit access at a course page level.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.890
We're going to give students download
access at a course page level.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.340
We want to give the authorized
member role download to those

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.670
other sections that I showed you.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.700
And we're going to block
visitor access by not-- visitor

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.170
access is blocked by default.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.250
So we're not even going
to do anything with that.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.250
iTunes U won't let anybody
in unless you specifically

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.250
create a credential for that.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.180
So back to my structure,
I want to protect these three

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.660
courses with unique credentials.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.980
And I want to protect this
section with unique credentials.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.580
So I would do something
like this as an example.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.780
You would create a student credential
that has a unique identifier that

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.080
identifies that course and section.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.590
If you have multiple sections,
you can choose to create new

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.920
course pages for each section.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.700
Or you could create a credential that
will work for all sections of that course

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.190
to have access to the same course page.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.940
And then we have an
instructor credential here.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.170
So we would do this for
each of these three courses.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.650
And then we would create this
type of credential for the

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.940
events and campus community page.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.010
So as an example,
here's somebody who logs in

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.220
with two instructor credentials.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.180
They're going to only see those
sections they have access to.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.320
So the events in
Campus Community would disappear.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.270
They wouldn't have access to those
and only the two course sections that,

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.350
two course pages that they
have access to would appear.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.610
As another example, you have a student.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.420
The student comes in,
you pass two credentials.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:05.820
One, the authorized member credential
that gives them access to the entire

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.400
events in Campus Community site,
part of the site, and then the one course

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.400
that they're enrolled in.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.370
Notice that this
hierarchy is pretty flat.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.630
You could have hundreds of courses,
and we would recommend still keeping them

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.090
all in that same section called Courses,
because many of your users are not

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.840
going to have access to all of them.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:29.100
They're going to have access
only to a few of them,

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.130
and it keeps the page nice and tight,
small, easy to find things.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.170
So, a couple of additional topics
about getting this working

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.080
with your iTunes U site.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.020
You get all this set up.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.940
We have some sample
code that's on our site,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.900
which I'll point you
to a little bit later.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.580
But you get all this set up and
you're passing credentials to

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.660
iTunes U and things aren't working,
what do you do?

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.560
We just recently added some additional
debugging information to a page.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.540
What you do is you take the suffix
that we gave you when you signed up,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.920
you add that suffix onto the
URL that you post credentials to,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.650
and you get a page like this.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.560
This tells,
instead of jumping into iTunes,

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.400
the browser's going to display
what iTunes you received.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.430
It's going to tell you exactly,
we received these

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.800
credentials in this format.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.980
They either match or they don't
match anything that you've

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.220
put into the system already.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.350
And if they don't match,
that's a pretty easy clue that

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.490
we have a formatting error
between the two credentials.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:26.340
So use that to help you figure out
what is iTunes U think I'm sending

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.400
and determine that you have the
right structure and the transfer

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.220
of those authorization tokens.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.250
A couple of other topics,
people ask about what to do at

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.440
the end of the semester or quarter
with the transition of courses.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.770
What are we going to do at that point?

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.010
Well, because the authorization
logic is in your hands,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.400
you have a lot of power to make
some of those decisions yourself,

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.420
and you saw that you
have templates to create.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.030
So you have a couple of choices.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.450
You could create a new course page
for each course every semester,

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.360
or you could reuse those.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.560
Reusing those would be taking
out the old credentials,

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.650
updating them with the current ones that
your business logic is going to pick up

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.450
when they look for the affiliation of
a user within your student information

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:16.130
data or other information systems,
and passing that on and changing

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.580
that so that they have access to the,
everyone in the new section or

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.940
the new course for that semester
has access to that same course.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.120
So you can reuse courses if you want,
or you can provision new ones.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:40.710
So let's just recap this section of how
to integrate iTunes U with your site.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.540
First, determine the entry point.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.120
How are users going to
gain access to iTunes U,

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.380
and where do you want them
to do that on your website?

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.880
And how are you going to
do the authorization logic?

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.890
That's step one.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.000
Second is to implement some
of the transfer logic and

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.370
test these credentials.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.770
I mentioned the sample code.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.240
Use that.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.100
We have some sample code
today in Java and Perl,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.340
and we hope to be adding
to that in the future.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.380
Implement handling of destination
parameter and test bookmarks.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.460
I mentioned this earlier.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.280
If you want bookmarks to work,
please make sure that your gateway to

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.340
iTunes U supports that and test that.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.670
And then fourth,
the shared secret is really

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.420
the only thing that keeps this
information trusted between your

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.870
authorization server and iTunes U.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.790
So secure that.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.520
Put that on a server and make sure
it's logically and physically secure.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.400
And then last,
go through the exercise we just

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.360
did and figure out how you want
to create a structure and build

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.650
out with the iTunes U admin tools
and assign credentials to those.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.410
Okay, so with that we've covered
the integration steps for

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.900
authentication and authorization,
and now I want to talk about content.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.200
Without content,
we don't have much to talk about.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.720
It's all about distributing content.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.160
So we're going to talk about
file formats that work with

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.660
iTunes U and iTunes and the iPod,
and talk about the importance of

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:07.660
metadata and uploading content.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:15.460
So we highly recommend MP3 or AAC because
of the compression and size of the

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.780
files that it produces and the metadata.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.710
And we'll go into metadata in a moment.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:27.680
For video, if you want this video to
work at all with the iPod,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.980
there are some pretty particular
formats you have to use.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:29.980
MPEG-4 with H.264 compression.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:40.440
All of Apple's tools now of iLife06 and
QuickTime now support export to iPod,

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:46.190
which takes the guesswork out of,
"Is this going to work when I get

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.190
the content into iTunes U and
have others download it and play

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.190
it back on iTunes and iPod?"

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:51.160
Another format is enhanced podcasting,
which in the last year has gained a

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.100
lot of popularity due to podcasting.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.620
This is an audio track with images.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.410
And if you're considering
doing any kind of capture of

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.440
lectures or just presentations
that other people are doing,

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.720
like this one,
this is a great way to just

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.160
have an audio track with images
instead of full motion video,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.880
which saves a lot of space.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.800
And it's still a very rich experience
for your users on an iPod or an iTunes.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.540
Jason also mentioned we support PDF.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.260
And if you want more details about this,
we have a document I'll point you to at

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.050
the end of the session about creating
content for iPod and iTunes and all

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.900
of the things you should think about.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.270
So, I mentioned enhanced audio.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.200
If you think about these different
file sizes for 60 minutes of content.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.740
If you're going to distribute 60
minutes of content compressed at

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.080
128 kilobits per second audio,
you'll probably end up with a

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.030
file roughly around 56 megabytes.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.130
You add 30 images to that.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.740
I have 30 or 40 images
in this presentation.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.300
You size those for the iPod
screen and you've got a file

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.080
that's about 58 megabytes.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.490
It's a lot smaller than if
you do 60 minutes of 15 frames

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.240
per second video for the iPod.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.190
That's going to come out
to be about 280 megabytes.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.730
And you have to think about what
you want to recommend to your

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.160
users as they're both uploading and
downloading this content potentially.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.940
And there's time associated
with that and bandwidth.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.240
So metadata.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.600
This is a important subject
for iTunes U and iTunes and

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.740
iPod is as all systems rely on,
metadata to a great extent.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.500
So iTunes currently displays name, album,
artist, and genre in many places.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.270
In columns, in the info panel,
these same labels are used on

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.820
the iPod as you navigate the
content that's stored on the iPod.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.470
And these are the common uses of
these fields that we found in the

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.260
work we've done so far in iTunes U.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:52.370
Take the name of the track,
and that translates pretty straight.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.000
But use the album as the course name.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.010
Use the artist as the
instructor or student,

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.330
whoever really is the
author of the track.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.860
And replace the genre
with the institution name.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.770
Now explain.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.980
This works well when you've
got content on iPod and people

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.900
are looking for that content.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.620
If it's mixed in with other genres,
you may find that it makes it hard for

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.840
them to find all the content related to
Stanford or Berkeley or Duke or whatever.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:25.130
If they have all the
content tagged familiarly,

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.130
they'll be able to find
it easily on the iPod.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.490
So one of the site administrative
features that we created

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.360
was a track preferences.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:38.140
In track preferences,
this gives you as a site administrator

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:45.460
the power to control and make sure that
your users have consistent metadata.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.860
So let's take a look at one example.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.080
On that page, you have the ability
to manage album artist,

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.080
genre, artwork.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.710
This is an example of album.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.700
So if you want to make sure that
your users are always getting

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.450
consistent album metadata,
you have a couple of options.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:01.420
Because a lot of people forget to
put in metadata for these tracks.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.080
We give you a couple of options here.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.250
If it's empty-- I think that's
going to be a real common case

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.110
for most people-- if it's empty,
you want to make sure that it

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.600
gets filled in with something.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.970
So we have an option of
Page Name and Tab Name or Page Name.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.450
And we offer these because the page
name is taken from the course name.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.520
When you've provisioned a course,
the course is going

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.040
to get that page name.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.390
Your instructors may put other
information into the tab about what

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.280
type of content is stored in that tab.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.980
Take those two,
combine them into a string,

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.580
and that will become the
album metadata for that track.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.360
And all tracks downloaded from your site.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.320
That makes it easy to find later.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.930
You can override that.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.530
You can select Override,
and that will make sure that

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.280
the content always uses that.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:49.100
But if your users are providing
metadata in the album-- metadata,

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.060
then it's going to get
overridden by that.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.140
And of course, if you want to turn
all these controls off,

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.440
select Use Original.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:04.200

File Formats.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:10.850
Looks like I'm missing a
slide here on upload options.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.980
So you saw the upload options for a file
at a time for an instructor and student.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.010
Jason showed you how it transitions
from iTunes into a browser.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:24.940
You have the interface with the tabs.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.170
This makes it very easy for a user
to upload a few tracks at a time.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.000
We've had a lot of people
ask for another way to upload

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.180
content in an automated fashion.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.520
So we've been working on that.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.100
And we have a web service which
allows you to upload many tracks

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.550
using any HTTP-based file upload
code that you have laying around.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.280
Or you could use a utility like
Curl in Unix to upload a file.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.330
And this allows you to
upload several files,

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.550
write a script.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.580
It allows for a lot of flexibility.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.450
Some situations this is useful is if
you're trying to automate the workflow

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.240
of getting content into iTunes U.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.920
If you have a lecture capture system
that's recording audio or video,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.720
you can let that do its work.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.780
Compress the file down to the
format you want to distribute.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.360
And then send that file to iTunes U.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:25.300
[Transcript missing]

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.490
transfer logic.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.040
You can find those at this URL.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.250
We also have documentation
posted there which I mentioned

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.390
about creating content for iPod.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.180
In iTunes,
we have documentation on the whole

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.610
process that I just described.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:42.820
If you haven't,
if now you're interested in

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.730
iTunes U and you want to apply,
you can go to itunesu.com.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.190
That's the URL that's
easiest to remember.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:53.090
That'll take you to our site and
give you information about what it

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.140
takes to become an iTunes U site.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:00.350
If you're a developer interested
in working with us in some way that

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:05.420
would allow your product or service to
automatically get content into iTunes U,

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.810
for example,
or other possibilities and you

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.170
need a developer contact in
Worldwide Developer Relations,

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.300
your contact is Michael McMillian.
