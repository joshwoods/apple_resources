WEBVTT

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.500
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.400
My name is JD Mankovsky,
and I manage Apple's

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.250
Enterprise Professional Services team
for the U.S., and we actually

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.080
do quite a bit of large enterprise
deployments around server storage,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320
email, backup, XAN deployments.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.880
And today I'm here to talk about
enterprise messaging solutions.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.590
And for those of you who might
have been to WWDC before,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.450
we've done this for the past few years.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.530
So I'm here to give you another
update as to where we are compared

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.770
to probably about 12 months ago.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.590
So here's our website as well if you
want more information on what we do,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.870
apple.com slash services.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.330
So we're going to first give you
an update on the client side.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.280
And talk about some
updates from Microsoft,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.380
IBM, Novell.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.500
And then we'll talk about
some OS X server solutions.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.140
So for those of you who are interested
in deploying both collaboration

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.990
solutions on our platform,
both on the server and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.760
on the client side,
we'll talk about those.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.840
Mixed in some success
stories with those solutions.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.930
And then we'll just finish up the
session and open it up for Q&A.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.930
There'll be Q&A with myself,
and then there's some people from

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.500
the Microsoft team who are available.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.450
available that you can
talk to after the session.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.150
So first let me give you a
quick update on Groupware

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.470
Enterprise client solutions for the Mac.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.350
And obviously,
how many people in the room here

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.740
use Microsoft Entourage or Exchange?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.450
Yeah, quite a bit of you.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.190
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.520
How many people here use IBM Lotus Notes?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.360
Okay.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.870
And Novell?

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.460
Okay, that makes a lot of sense.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.970
So, um, well...

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.590
It makes a lot of sense.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.390
I mean, it's kind of what we see
on the services side.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.050
There's definitely a lot of people
that use Exchange out there.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.550
So what I'd like to do is kind
of focus on kind of some of the,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.030
an update from Microsoft,
and first talk about the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.710
Mac OS X client for the Mac,
which is mainly Entourage 2004.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.250
That's what the majority of the
clients use nowadays on the Mac,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.950
and Microsoft has done some pretty
significant improvements to Entourage

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.910
over the past few revisions,
and we'll talk about that.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.990
For those of you who really want
the full Outlook experience,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.840
and who feel like Entourage is not
sufficient for your requirements,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.570
well, obviously the Microsoft team
would love to hear,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.880
you know, what other features do
you need on the Mac.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.080
But if you're... If you
do want the full Outlook,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.920
you can use RDC, which is the Microsoft,
you know, remote desktop client.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.260
Outlook Web Access,
so they obviously have Web Access.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.000
And then, obviously,
some of you might be running Parallel

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.340
already on your new MacBooks or
MacBook Pros or Mac Pro machines.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.970
But Parallel is a great,
great solution to run any

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.550
Windows application on the Mac.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.970
And then, obviously,
some of you might have seen

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.450
the announcement from VMware,
which they are also porting over.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.440
So, you could potentially run that
through a VMware container.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.230
Obviously,
Outlook Web Access is important,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.100
especially when a lot of us travel and
need to quickly connect and check email.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.200
You can go to a cyber cafe or wherever
and just get to your email very quickly.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.370
And the Microsoft team has been pretty
hard at work to make sure that they

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.200
have very nice support for Safari.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.070
And with the next version
of Exchange Server,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.200
version 2007,
they have significantly improved

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.370
the richness of the content being
displayed through the Safari web

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.110
browser using Outlook Web Access.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.560
Here's a screenshot of
what RDC would look like.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.340
And I'm sure a lot of you use RDC.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.850
Even a lot of Mac IT people who
want to administrate Windows 2000,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.240
Windows 2003 servers.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.990
And Microsoft actually announced
today that they're in the process of,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.000
they will be releasing in the
future a universal binary version

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.020
of the RDC client on our platform.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.200
this year.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.890
Entourage 2004.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.260
So when we talked about
Entourage last year,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.200
this is kind of where we were, right?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.650
There was synchronization of emails,
there was, you know,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.780
scheduling available,
there's global address list directory,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.610
form-based authentication support,
delegate support, which was, you know,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.660
not quite what we wanted.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.950
And then, obviously, you know,
it's a Mac,

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.430
it's the native Mac OS X product.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.670
And here's a, you know,
a nice screenshot of what, you know,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.280
Entourage 2004 looks like.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.700
I'm sure a lot of you are
familiar with that UI,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.370
but, you know, in this case,
you can see you've got free busy,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.800
you can invite quite a
few people to a meeting,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.130
and it does what it needs to do, right?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.130
To go to a Senate meeting to a
bunch of people at the same time.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.130
Last year when we talked,
the Service Pack 2 release was not

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.200
available at last developer conference.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.680
And Microsoft said,
this is what we're working on.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.980
And the good news is they released
Service Pack 2 in early 2006.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.420
And from what we heard,
it significantly helped the

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.790
integration of the Mac platform
within an exchange environment.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.940
And so the Mac BU has been really hard
at work to make sure that the needs

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.440
of the Mac client integrating with an
exchange environment are well served.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.020
And they did a pretty good job
with this Service Pack 2 release.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.340
And we'll go into some of the key
details behind SP2 in just a second.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.780
So obviously, you know,
global address lists,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.950
you go to look up addresses
are very important.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.500
That was significantly improved.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.430
The fact that you can tie in
multiple calendars and look up

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.500
multiple users' calendars and address
book views within the product,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.840
that was a pretty big significant
request from the users.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.340
Obviously, delegation was big.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.810
Full support for delegation was crucial.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.840
Obviously, you know,
when you have an admin and she

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.690
needs to update your calendar,
those are all, you know,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.020
really key features.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.550
Sharing was greatly improved
and then public support,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.220
you know, there was some feedback
that the public folders,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.080
some were showing up, some were not.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.060
It was kind of slow.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.680
Things got a lot, you know,
significantly better in the SP2 release.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.760
Obviously, client-server synchronization
was something else.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.520
As the mailboxes were
getting significantly big,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.260
there was also some slowdowns there.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.800
They did a really good job on that side.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.580
And sync services as well.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.920
So being able to integrate with iSync and
syncing your address book and your iCal

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.260
with Entourage are pretty neat features,
especially when you need to then sync

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.190
with a PDA or a Trio or something.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.680
It makes it pretty easy.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.370
Pretty neat.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.820
On the server side,
things are pretty straightforward.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.870
I mean, what do you need to support
entourage on the Mac?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:00.720
Well, pretty much Exchange 2000, 2003,
with Service Pack 2 or later.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.400
If you want to take advantage
of some of the newer features,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.840
the new OWA features, we encourage,
or Microsoft encourages you as well,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.920
to test the 2007 server, Beta 2,
which is available.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.920
And then obviously,
Outlook Web Access needs to be enabled,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.100
which is pretty straightforward.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.880
WebDAV and LDAP need to be turned
on as well on the server side.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:31.100
So that's kind of a quick
update on the entourage side.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.420
As far as some of the collaboration
tools that are out there,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.800
how many people here
use Microsoft Messenger?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:10:28.400
[Transcript missing]

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:36.340
Server-side requirements for Messenger,
again, the live communication server,

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:42.180
Service Pack 1,
or the Microsoft Office communication

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.740
server,
which is in beta.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.360
That's the next version, version 2007,
as well as support for the live

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.870
communication server 2005 for
the public IMing connectivity.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.360
So if you want to be able to
do IMs across the Internet to

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.620
other types of chat services.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.290
Let me quickly talk about SharePoint.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:14.020
So how many people here use or have
SharePoint deployed within their company?

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.190
Okay, so quite a few of you.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.670
So the good news is Microsoft has
also been working pretty

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.780
hard to support Safari.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.170
And in the SharePoint version 3,
they're definitely adding

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.860
some significant support.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:36.620
Microsoft is now using
the ASP.NET version 2,

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.640
which has the Safari and
Firefox support in there.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.500
And in this case,
we're showing their project

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.620
document management screenshot here.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.150
And pretty much, you know,
everything you can do on the PC side,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:57.700
you'll be able to do on the Mac through
the Safari browser in terms of,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.730
you know,
document and project management here.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.630
So that's really exciting.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:10.710
Here's a view of the project task
view in SharePoint version 3.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.710
Now obviously they're
also going to support,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.360
you know, Wiki and Blog.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.550
That's part of the SharePoint product,
their collaboration product,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.370
and that's also supported
through the Safari browser.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.890
Here's another screenshot of the
SharePoint version 3 running in Safari.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.050
You can see that the rendering, I mean,
everything looks pretty

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.060
nice within Safari,
which is really good news

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.930
for the enterprise world.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.810
This is something that's
important to mention.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.890
How many people here are Mac IT people?

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.520
Wow.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.590
Yeah.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.040
Okay.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.800
So, I don't know if-- how many of you
have seen this document or have

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.100
downloaded this document before?

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.080
Okay, a few of you.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.840
So,
this is-- this is a significant document.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.840
The BU team has spent a lot
of time putting it together,

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.560
and it's something that you
should-- you should all download,

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.890
which really clearly explains
how to integrate Macs,

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.760
you know,
and-- and our servers and-- and Apple--

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.280
how to use Apple Remote Desktop,
how to use, uh, PackageMaker,

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.210
how to use a lot of the
Apple tools within your Microsoft,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.300
you know, your Mac,
Microsoft IT environment,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.300
and integrate it well within
your overall enterprise,

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.300
um, you know, deployment.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.200
And when you're looking for ammunition
as to why do you need an XServe,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.300
for example, for the-- the Mac people,
um, when you have, you know,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.270
a large group of Mac users doing
publishing work or working on a lot of,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.730
you know, office documents,
and your-- your CIO is asking you, "Well,

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.560
why can't we run this off a, you know,
Windows server?" Um,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.210
there's some really good
information in there that explains,

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.110
well, you know, if you deploy an XServe
and you deploy AFP,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.220
Microsoft actually supports
launching documents over

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.300
the network using an XServe.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.070
So that-- all-- all that information
is contained in the document,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.300
so I-- I strongly recommend
that you look at it,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.770
'cause it has a lot of
really good info as far as,

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.930
you know, deploying-- uh,
deploying Office and integ--

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.660
integrating the-- the-- the Macs,
you know, the-- the-- the Macs

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.300
into this enterprise,
you know, Microsoft environment.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.690
That a lot of us run into when
we deal with large enterprises.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.840
So check it out.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.160
It has a lot of good content in it.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:43.570
Obviously, you hear that at Macworld when
ROS comes on stage last January and

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.870
their commitment to shipping a
universal binary version of Office.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.100
The good news is now the entire
code has been ported over to Xcode.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.290
So this is huge.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.310
The team is really hard
at work at getting Office,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:04.590
the next version of Office out,
and running it on Intel natively.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.700
And obviously, Microsoft, again,
is very committed to

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.710
the Macintosh platform,
and they publicly indicated that with

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.630
a five-year commitment to develop
Office on both PowerPC and Intel.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.130
So again, and we probably have eight
Microsoft people in the room

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.300
today that are available,
again, to answer your questions

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.880
after the session.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.300
So there's a lot of Microsoft developers
at this conference this week,

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.960
so we're very excited.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.230
And then obviously in terms of resources,
I just wanted to highlight those again.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.420
There's a lot of resources available from
Microsoft to support the Mac community.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.520
And if you go to
Microsoft.com/exchange or /mac,

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.350
you'll get to all those other resources
that are up there on the slide right now.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.220
So that's the Microsoft update.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:06.160
And what I wanted to do now
is quickly talk about IBM.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.980
And obviously,
there was a few people in the

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.510
room who use IBM solutions.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.460
And the first one I wanted to highlight
is IBM WebSphere Portal version 6.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.700
And that product was made
available on July 26.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.370
And that actually has full
support for the Safari,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.620
for Safari 2.0 and above
for the Safari browser.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.110
So that's really good news.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:34.570
As far as, you know,
workplace solutions from IBM, obviously,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.660
IBM Workplace Content Management,
version 6, supports Sapphire 2.0.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:48.100
On the collaboration products,
the IBM team is hard at work to

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.720
release the next version of their
collaboration product suite,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.710
which will be, you know,
the workplace team collaboration,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.380
the documents, the workplace documents,
as well as the collaborative

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.270
learning suite,
which will be fully supported on the

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:09.320
Mac and on Intel in the near future.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.930
Lotus Notes and Domino.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.840
So right now,
the version that's currently

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.580
available is version 6.5.5,
and that obviously runs natively

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.710
on PowerPC and runs under
Rosetta on the Intel Macs,

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.540
and that is fully
qualified under Rosetta,

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.460
so there's no issues there.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.060
The next version of Notes Domino,
which is 7.0.2,

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:42.240
which will be the first universal
binary release on the IBM side.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.150
And that also has some
nice same-time messaging.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.140
How many people here use same-time?

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.050
Okay, so that's significant.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.940
So integration of same-time
messaging within the next release,

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.950
the 7.0.2 product.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.800
And then obviously the Web Access 7.0.2,
support using Firefox on Mac.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.330
Mac OS X.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.460
Here's a screenshot of the
Lotus SameTime 7.5 product,

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.470
which is coming soon.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.700
And that not only has chat,
but also has voice over IP built in.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.400
It has embedded screenshots.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.320
You can do that.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.660
That is supported within a chat,
as well as history.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.930
You go to save all your chats.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.900
Creating some custom plug-ins using
the Eclipse development suite.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.570
And we actually have, I believe tomorrow,
we have a session around

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.940
Eclipse on the Mac platform.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.820
So it's something that
you might want to go to.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:44.770
As well as dynamic allocation
awareness built into the 7.5 product.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.590
So now let's talk about,
quickly about Novell.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:58.670
And Novell, group-wise,
is their collaboration server solution.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.700
And they released version 7 in
the June timeframe this year.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:09.210
And they have Mac Intel,
so they have a native Mac Intel client,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.860
which was released in June.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.180
They have iCal support.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.270
And for those of you who went to the
calendaring session this morning,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.920
Novell actually does already
support the CalDAV standard,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.340
which is what Apple is adopting on the
client side and on the server side.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.280
So they have CalDAV support
within group-wise 7.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.940
As well as support for our IPv6,
shared contacts with Outlook Connector.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.560
So they have an Outlook Connector
shipping within group-wise,

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.710
as well as many bug fixes.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.100
They also announced their
GroupWise Mobile Server.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.560
Obviously, a lot of us carry Trios,
clear BlackBerry, you know,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.440
carry Symbian OS-based phones.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:00.220
And so they actually have a pretty
interesting product there in terms of,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.850
you know,
wirelessly syncing all your data

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:09.560
via pretty much any carrier,
or even using, you know, 802.11,

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.030
you know, Wi-Fi type devices.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.580
Here's an example of the list of
products they actually support within

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.270
the GroupWise Mobility product.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:26.200
You can see it's a pretty large
gamut of support in terms of mobile

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.940
devices within the Novell product.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.810
For any additional information on Novell,
please go to novell.com/groupwise

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:46.470
or gwmac.com is another really great
website to get more information on that.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.200
So that's kind of a quick
update on the top three,

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.900
I would say,
collaboration client solutions that

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:03.180
a lot of education and enterprise
companies run on the Mac platform.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.480
What I wanted to do now is
talk about server solutions.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.830
And obviously today,
our goal is to talk about

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.350
third-party solutions.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.140
There's a lot of sessions around
Apple's Mail Server and Leopard

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.160
Server and our new iCal server.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.630
And we're not going to spend any
time in this session about this.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.060
There's three or four
sessions at WWDC around that.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.830
But what I want to do is spend some
time on some of the third-party

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.460
products that we've seen have
been adopted by the Macintosh

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:39.140
community and have been deployed
on XServes and on Mac OS X Server.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.920
And the two products that we've seen
have been deployed greatly are Cario.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.290
How many people here
use Cario in the room?

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.260
Okay.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.290
And then Zimbra.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.300
How many people here use
Zimbra or have tested Zimbra?

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.920
Yep.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.360
So we're going to talk about Cario first.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:23:14.500
[Transcript missing]

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.280
So it's a real complete
collaboration service solution.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.920
It's a mail server,
it's a calendar server,

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:25.030
it has a lot of really cool features,
tasks, notes, folders,

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.530
public folders are all in there.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.240
Obviously,
it fully supports POP and IMAP,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.360
which is pretty much standard
for any mail server out there.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.410
It has also full anti-spam,
virus checking is all built in.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.120
It has some really nice web mail support.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.490
It's multi-platform, obviously,
and they have some really nice

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:51.780
connectivity for the Entourage client
and the Outlook client on the PC side.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.400
So Entourage support
is pretty much native,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.220
so if your users use
Entourage on the Mac side,

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.380
they can just keep using that
and you can pretty much migrate

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:07.470
the server back in from an
Exchange server over to Cario server.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.400
They have a really nice
tool that allows you to.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:15.960
migrate that, but not touch any of the
clients' PCs or Macs.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.830
Just have them keep running
Outlook on the PC and keep

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.280
using Entourage on the Mac.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.420
They have backup tools,
which are built in, which is very neat,

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.420
so you don't have to deploy any
third party backup for this.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:34.820
And they've had some really
good awards in the past 12

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.170
months from different magazines.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.300
What I also like about Cario is
they fully integrate within our

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.700
open directory and active directory.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.610
So again, if you've already
deployed active directory,

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.000
you don't have to worry about anything.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.400
You just tie Cario right in.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.210
They have a bunch of attributes.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.480
You have to extend the schema.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.400
They have all that
available on their website.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.630
It's pretty much double
click and install.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.590
And same thing on the
open directory side.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.190
The Admin Console is something
you can run on Mac OS X,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.200
on Linux, or on Windows.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.200
It's pretty straightforward.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.200
Here's a screenshot of
their administration tools.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:21.350
Again, I think they're very
easy to use and manage,

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:27.200
which makes your life as an
IT mail administrator a lot easier.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.450
And again, something you can run remotely
from pretty much anywhere

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.190
on pretty much any platform.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:26:26.700
[Transcript missing]

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.500
They just released version 6.2,
which is a universal binary release,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.180
so we're really happy about that.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.190
This is actually perfect
timing with our new server.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.780
And they've added a couple
things in terms of their web UI,

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.330
especially when you have a
lot of users hitting Cario.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:54.090
They added AJAX support,
so the UI is a lot faster.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.430
They have SpamAssassin, McAfee,
also engines.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.330
They have ClamAV if you want
to do for email scanning.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.110
You can do ClamAV if you want,
which is open source and free,

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.590
as well as sticky note support.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.100
Quickly, I wanted to talk about one of
the success stories they've had.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:18.920
This is a hosting company
called Socketworks,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.190
and they're based in Sun Valley, Idaho.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.960
And they do web, email, database design,
hosting, and they're running Cario.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.580
They've got about 800 email
users running on Cario,

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:35.360
and previously that
company was using 4D mail.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.950
And some of the top features that
they really liked about Cario,

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.680
which I think is important,
is the web mail mini support.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.250
If you don't know what that is,
obviously I'm sure none of you

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.360
here are running OS 9 anymore.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.920
But if you are,
you can actually get to your email.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.840
But any other mobile device,
which as you know,

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.120
mobile devices have kind of
lightweight web browsers.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.280
Those allow you to connect and
to get to your email through

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.880
the web interface using their

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.860
using their kind of
light version of this.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.200
Obviously, they have web-based domain
administration built in,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.260
and again,
it's a very cost-effective product.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.480
If you go to their website
for about 20 users,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:32.620
you're talking about $700 for
the software for about 20 users,

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.300
so it's pretty

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.140
For more information,
you can contact Cario.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.770
Just go to info@cario.com
or go to www.cario.com.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.220
and I think there is someone from Cario.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.790
Yep, John.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.210
Yep, so John is here from Cario as
well if you want to talk to

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.130
him later after the session.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.640
Another product that I'm very
excited to talk about is Zimbra.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.820
So this is a company that we've been
working with on the professional services

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.000
side for probably about 18 months.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.000
So it was a hush-hush company.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.880
They were showing us the product.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.180
We were very excited.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:24.900
And then obviously last March, I believe,
they released their first

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:24.900
Mac OS X Server product.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.560
They have kind of two
versions of their product.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.020
They have an open source version,
which you can download.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.010
You can download the Zimbra
Collaboration Suite Server on Mac OS X.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:35.760
It's free.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.680
And then if you want, obviously,
support and clustering and a bunch

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:46.050
of other sync services support,
then you have to basically pay something

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.340
of the order of $28 per user per year.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.580
But they have an open source version,
which is great because

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.680
you can download it,
test it, and see if it works.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.130
And if you want kind of
the advanced features,

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.570
you can buy the product.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.620
It's a very innovative solution.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.940
It's a very scalable mail solution.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.860
The team, the Zimbra team,
comes from backgrounds like phone.com,

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.350
and a lot of people come from Sun.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.440
So they're familiar with
building very large,

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.150
scalable enterprise mail solutions.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.530
And they're... They have support like,
you know, obviously, XServe support,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.760
XSAN support for distributed mail and,
you know, large-scale mail deployments,

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.890
which we'll talk about in just a bit.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.330
They've also, obviously,
we gave them a lot of

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.520
feedback in terms of,
you know, sync services support.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.110
They obviously support mail,
but they also sync with iCal

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.970
and AddressBook as well.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.180
Some customers they have right now,
again, it's a new product.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.200
Like I said, they just released the
OS X version a few months ago.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.960
But HNR... HNR Block is a
company that has deployed Zimbra.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:31:02.160
TBW Chai Day also is currently testing
the Zimbra suite on our platform,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.130
on the Mac OS X server platform,
and looking at deploying that, you know,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.170
company-wide.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.390
and Dave uses that internally as well.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.200
And what's really interesting,
they gave me that info yesterday,

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.200
is they're seeing over a
thousand downloads of the

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.470
Mac OS X Server product per month,
which is right behind

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:27.700
their VMware container,
which runs on pretty much any other

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.200
platform that VMware might support.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.650
So they're very excited about the
support and the feedback they're

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.520
getting from the Apple community.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:40.200
And we're beating, you know,
Linux and some of the other

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.200
versions they might have up there.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.200
We're the number two download
per month on their platform.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.500
As far as a quick product
overview on the Zimbra side,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.090
now again,
when I was talking to Andy at Zimbra,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.980
they gave me like 20
bullets to talk about.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.500
And obviously,
20 bullets don't fit in a single slide.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.510
So I had to kind of trim it down
and go to like the top five or

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.120
six features built into Zimbra.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.760
But I strongly recommend you
just go to their website.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.390
They have a beautiful kind of flash demo.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.610
You can even download a demo
account and test it and kind

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:17.980
of check out their interface.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.750
Slides are great, but checking out the
demo is well worth it.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.910
They've got a very rich AJAX client.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:31.390
It's probably the first
AJAX mail solution that I saw,

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:37.320
which is truly amazing in terms of
the richness of what it can offer.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.040
Almost as good as a native
client mail solution.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.810
They've got calendaring built in.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.410
They've got free busy built in.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.980
They've got mobile.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.140
So they support
Blackberry through Notify.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.800
And then they have
smartphone support built in.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.010
So you don't have to buy any
additional package that's

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.850
just built into the product.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.580
They have Zimlets.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.830
So here's a great example of that.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.850
So they've got integration
within Salesforce and Oracle.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.260
So let's say you have an email
that has like a PO number.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.700
You can generate a Zimlet.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.440
And as people click in the email,
and the PO, it literally can launch,

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.620
and bring up the PO.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.780
So they've got some pretty neat
integration within Salesforce and

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.660
Oracle and pretty much anything else.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.520
They can customize that to tie into
SAP or any other backend system.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.460
They also have a new document editor,
which is built in.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:44.410
So think of it as, again,
kind of a blog document type system built

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.100
into the-- it's called Zimbra Documents.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.660
And I believe that's in beta right now,
right?

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.530
And that'll be shipping
in the next few weeks.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:58.610
And again, it's like a wiki blog type
thing built into the product.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.500
and, you know,
allows you to embed images, spreadsheets,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:07.040
do a whole bunch of really fun stuff,
thanks to the richness of Ajax.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.690
On the admin side, again,
there was like 20 features

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.470
I had to go through,
so I trimmed that down to about five.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.470
But there's a lot of really
cool things on the admin side.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.500
They have online backup.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.590
They've got single mailbox restores,
obviously.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.610
They've got HSM support,
which is pretty neat.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:33.470
Obviously, if you're an enterprise,
probably you'll run your tier

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.140
one email on some potential
pretty expensive storage.

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:43.960
And then as those emails get older,
you want to move them to XServe raids,

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.570
for example.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.810
And so the product has that built in.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:54.440
And obviously, anti-spam, anti-virus,
as well as the admin runs on a Mac Mini,

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.010
for example.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.230
So what a perfect use for that.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.330
Here's one of their case
studies on the education side.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.400
So Eastern Illinois University has
deployed Zimbra.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.480
And this is going to
support about 30,000 users.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:17.440
So we can see the
scalability of the product.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.990
Again, we'll show a good
diagram in just a minute,

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.800
but it's all running on XSERVs,
as well as the back end is

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.180
using our XAN shared storage.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.150
And here's a diagram
of what it looks like,

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:38.770
where you have the MTA servers,
you've got your directory

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.700
or LDAP servers,
and then you have, using IP failover,

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.030
you've got a set of
pairs of mailbox servers,

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.420
and all that is,
all those servers are tied in over

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.800
a fiber channel to the XAN back end.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.390
So obviously your mail storage is
on a central shared storage system,

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:02.580
which is using XAN,
and then all the mail servers,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.410
as you need more mailbox servers,
you can just add them up,

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.840
and all those mail
servers talk to the XAN.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.540
And each server has its
own IP failover set up.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.260
So pretty straightforward,
pretty much how you would deploy kind of

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.660
an enterprise class mail server solution.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:28.190
And again,
that's something that my team does.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.020
So if you have any questions,
let us know.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.690
Pricing and Information.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.830
So again, the subscription is,
like I said, about $28 per year per user.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.740
Obviously,
they have significant discounts

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.760
for governmenteducation.org,
you know, organization.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.190
So, you know, just let them know,
give them a call.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.700
Sales or email sales at Zimbra.com.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.150
And Andy is from Zimbra.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.700
He's actually here.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.300
He's got his nice black Zimbra
and red Zimbra shirts if you

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.390
want to talk to him afterwards.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.870
You can come up.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.080
Thank you.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:08.500
So there's a lot of things
we haven't talked about.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.770
I just wanted to make sure that
we focused on a couple of really

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.060
key solutions here on the client
side and on the server side.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:18.460
But obviously,
people might use Communigate.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.640
That's also available.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.270
I think Communigate runs on
probably 40 different platforms.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.790
So we don't want to-- Mac OS X is
one of the platforms they support.

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:32.590
Cario, Novell, some of you might be
running Evolution as well,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:37.450
which Novell has an Evolution client
available for the Mac.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.850
And that's available as well.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.610
Some people might be using Snurdware to
integrate with their exchange back end.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.920
That's also a great solution
available on the Mac platform.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.340
So I just wanted to make sure that
we talked about these people and

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:55.720
made you aware that some of those
solutions are available on our platform.
