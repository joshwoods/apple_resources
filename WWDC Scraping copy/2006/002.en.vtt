WEBVTT

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.900
My name is Ron Okamoto,
and I'm really happy to welcome you to

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.950
this year's State of the Union for the
games industry and the games market,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.890
Mac games market.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.940
It's going to be really
interesting today.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.180
What we're going to do is we're going
to talk a little bit about Mac games,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.150
what's been happening on the platform,
and we're also going to get into some

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.880
things about some trends that we see,
two things that we think

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.280
will be important for you.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.130
And we'll also be talking about
some ways to get your games done.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.620
And when we're all, you know,
done with looking at them,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.100
figuring out what's
going on with the market,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.300
we'll then tell you maybe
even how to get published.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.700
So that's the ground that we
want to cover this afternoon.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.390
So let me start off by something
that I think all of you

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.010
guys are very well aware of,
which is the Mac market

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770
itself is booming right now.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110
You can take a look at
the revenue trends there.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.830
It's been really strong for us.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.250
But what I think is important
for all of us here is,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.220
if you stand back and think about it,
a lot of people have been saying, well,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.760
gee, that's a lot of iPod revenue,
that's a lot of iTunes revenue.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.540
You know, what's happening with the Mac?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.580
What's happening with the things
that's running your games?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.870
Well, if we take a look at that,
let's look at volume.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.670
So here you have 2003, 4,
and 5 showing the steady growth

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.220
that we had in Mac volume.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.590
But look what happens when
I lay 2006 on top of it.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.420
You can see it's been really strong.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.070
And Steve mentioned to you the strong
sales and the strong unit growth

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.000
that we've had in our Intel-based
portables over the last year as well.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.620
So what's great for you guys is
that we think there's a fantastic

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.440
opportunity now for the Mac and gaming
because the volumes were up and we

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.080
know that people want to play games.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.520
But the other thing that they do is
they also want native applications.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.110
They want platform experiences and
things that really take advantage

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.280
of what makes a Mac app a Mac app.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.180
And, you know, that's really what this
whole week's dedicated to.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.050
And we're going to get
really deep into that.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.680
But we want to just let you know,
you know,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.180
there's some developers out there who
have been doing really great jobs.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.040
I mean, there's a lot of you
guys doing a great job.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.550
But two that come to mind.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.370
One, for example, is Microsoft.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.240
When Microsoft introduced their
most current version of Office,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.980
they used a lot of really cool things.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.110
Like transparency, Aqua, OpenGL,
and some stuff to make

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.360
their app look great.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.980
And they have been having
fantastic business on it.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.110
In fact, within Microsoft,
they're considered one of the stars

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.220
of business performance for last year.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.920
Another great developer is
Delicious Monster and their

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.480
Delicious Library product.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.080
You know, Will Shipley has integrated
EyeSight camera functionality

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.570
into his application,
really taking advantage of

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.160
some of the things that we
provide with the baseline Mac.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.630
And we think that's another
opportunity for you because,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.010
for example,
if you take a look at what we're doing

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.740
with all of our applications in general,
all third parties in general,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.240
it's been really strong.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.300
A half billion dollars
sold only in our channel,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.640
only in our retail channel
over the last year.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.740
So that's a lot of products moving.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.510
And if we click down underneath that,
you can see that games is the number one

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.340
volume category in our retail stores.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.350
Now, this is just our stores.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.600
That's not everybody else
out there that's distributing

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.820
and selling Mac products.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.520
So again,
one thing I really want to make clear is,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.140
the games and Mac go
together extremely well,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.160
and it's extremely strong.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.710
And in fact,
sales are up 10% by revenue this year.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.040
So again, these are pointing to a really,
really strong trend toward

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.540
what's happening with us today,
games on the Mac.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.180
Now, another thing,
another way of measuring that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.440
interest is taking a look at how
are people looking for these.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.680
So for example,
if you look at our Apple store,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.520
we search for everything, right?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.980
People are looking for iPod accessories,
they're looking for, you know,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.620
bags for their new MacBook,
and things like that.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.380
Oh, I went a little too fast there.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.380
Sorry, guys.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.820
Anyway, it is within the top five of all
the searches that are going on.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.160
And these are millions of
searches that are happening today.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.720
So one thing I want to make clear
for everybody is that what's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.980
happening here is that we've noticed,
and we know, that our Mac customers are

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.560
rewarding developers for a
great platform experience.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.510
And what applies to Office and
Delicious Monster applies

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.570
to games as well.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.040
So Mac customers want native games.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.630
And right now, today,
we have some efforts going on there.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.240
So for example, Universal Binaries,
a really big thing that

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.080
we introduced last year.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.420
And we have to tell you,
the games community was one of the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.320
fastest to jump on top of that.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.460
So here we are today,
a little over a year

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.390
since we announced it,
212 days since we shipped

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.600
our first machine.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.260
And take a look at some of the
great titles that are out there now.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.990
Shipping Universal today, Aspire,
Blizzard, a lot of our great partners

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.900
have been doing a good job on
moving to Universal Binaries.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.200
And we want to thank you for that.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.390
But it's not just what's happening
with these kind of titles as well.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.270
There's international involvement now.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.470
There are some really interesting
things going on overseas.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.020
And I want to show you one here
that we're particularly fond of.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.360
And maybe you'll see why.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.560
This game came from a
Chinese student developer.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.220
This gentleman, his name is Ben,
I believe.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.560
He is in Tangji University in Shanghai,
China.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.640
And if you take a look
at what's going on here,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.020
he's making some really
interesting things happen here.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.820
I love this part, because you're going to
see a bunny eat a bull.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.000
Look at that.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.180
That's one mean bunny.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.650
Anyway, you see this bunny eat this bowl,
but this is done by a student

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.400
developer using the Mac platform.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.840
This is only on the Mac.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.520
And these guys have a great
student effort going on there,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.770
and I think it's just one of
many going around the world.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.550
And I'll tell you,
the coolest experience I had was about

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.820
now about two and a half years ago.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.640
I was at this university.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.780
And these guys have these
great labs out there.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.010
You know, they have a Mac lab,
they have a Windows lab,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.320
and they have a Unix lab.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.040
And when I went to visit them, they said,
"Man, the Mac lab is the most popular

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.730
on campus." Now for background,
there's not a lot of

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.860
Macs in China right now.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.520
We're still growing that market,
but our penetration isn't nearly

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.200
what it is for Linux and Windows.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.210
And so when I asked the guy, I said,
"Well, that's interesting.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.040
How come this guy,
this student looks at me

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.390
like I'm crazy and says,
'Well, because it's cooler.'" And so,

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.270
you know,
if you have that kind of resonance

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.360
going on worldwide right now,
again,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.820
we think not only are we doing great
things with our major developers,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.790
but there's a seed here.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.800
There's inspiration going on
for student developers as well.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.520
And of course, there you go,
Animal Kingdom by Ben.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.140
And of course, we got AAA titles,
things like Worlds of Warcraft,

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.340
which has been fantastic.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.580
I mean, these guys were one of the
first to come out on universals,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.580
and they've been having huge success.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.340
Look at that, they got six and a half
million users today.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.260
And a good, you know, not a good portion,
but there's a strong number

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.580
in there that's Mac users.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.900
In fact, I dare say, you know,
some of you out in the audience could

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.940
probably count yourself in that group.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.800
So again, there's an example of what's
happening with Mac development today,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.720
we got the universal binaries,
we have student developers,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.730
we have AAA titles,
all happening right now.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.040
So that's what's going on right now.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.540
But we also wanna look
a little bit forward.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.700
So, there's two things we'd
like to highlight today.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.550
Two things.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.750
The first is online gaming.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.740
How many of you guys here in this room
have actually played an online game?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.550
Okay, the data's good.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.810
Yeah, myself as well.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.930
Let's take a look at this.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.760
First of all,
PC remains the favorite gaming device,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.610
primarily because of online games.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.970
You know,
it's really what's been holding the

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.720
PC market together for the gaming
industry is the online phenomenon.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.190
Take a look at this.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.720
You know, Red Herring, the famous,
you know,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.550
prognosticators of telling people where
the world's going technology-wise,

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.490
finance-wise, and otherwise,
they cite that online gaming

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.100
is one of the major trends.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.550
And, you know, again,
just looking at you guys saying how many

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.490
of you guys have played online games,
we get it.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.660
The second thing is, take a look at here,
you know,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.950
of the Mac and PC online gaming,
46% of the users are

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.420
playing online games.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.320
That's huge.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.600
That's almost one out of every two.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.010
Another thing is,
take a look at the growth of the

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.030
projected revenue in this segment.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.360
You know, today, it's $1.1 billion.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.860
By 2009, $3.5 billion.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.980
This is a projection, but guys,
there's a lot of zeros in there,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.280
so this is significant.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.960
The last thing, and the thing that we
think is really great,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.930
is if you take a look at
your typical Mac user,

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.140
and you take a look at
your typical Windows user,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.800
that Mac user is broadband,
they're connected, and they're online.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.820
They are a perfect
audience for online games.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.190
And because of this,
what I want to do is introduce

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.770
you guys to Mark Lenstner.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.120
Now Mark is with Linden Labs,
and these guys are doing some super

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.570
interesting things with online,
and games, but as well as a concept.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.830
And I want him to go ahead and show you
guys all the cool stuff they're doing.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.380
So Mark, thank you.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.420
So I'm Mark Lenstner.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.100
I'm a studio director at Linden Lab,
which means I run one of the engineering

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.820
studios or groups in Linden Lab.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.480
By the way,
for those of you that missed it,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.400
that's not a mock-up.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.680
That is a Real Business Week cover.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.780
The avatar on the cover there is
one of our most famous residents.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.060
She's Anqi Cheng.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.300
She's a virtual real estate developer.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.720
And the real Anqi Cheng,
the person behind the avatar,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.040
actually makes a six-figure real-life
income from her work in Second Life.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.450
So you might want to listen up.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.370
All right,
let me tell you a little bit about Linden

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.570
Lab before I delve into Second Life.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.750
We're a really

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:52.900
[Transcript missing]

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.770
Now, Second Life is a virtual world,
or a metaverse, in which we simulate land

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.330
and physics and objects,
and we have a scripting

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.120
system and an economy.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.600
And it's really big.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.190
I mean, really big.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.640
There are a lot of numbers
up there that are fun.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.600
It's not just bigger than Boston,
it's three times bigger than Boston,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.120
or twice as big as San Francisco.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:22.540
Second Life is a whole ecosystem of
people and social groups working to do

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:30.480
everything from fun to serious business,
making use of our existing economy.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.470
There's a whole in-world economy
that actually supports real payments.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.450
And this creates, well,
let's go ahead and see it.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.400
Let's go get the demo and see
what's going on in Second Life.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.780
This is live,
we're running off the internet here live.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:05.350
Now our heritage is certainly games,
but it's... Great,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.350
someone's already talking to me in world.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.670
Our heritage is certainly games,
but we've evolved into

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.900
something much bigger.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.420
So for example,
we're starting here at Riverwalk.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.680
Riverwalk is an in-world
cafe and art gallery,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.360
outdoor art gallery with some,
let's say the Swan Boats from

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.560
Boston for you to be able to ride.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.220
But something you can also do at
Riverwalk is you can play games.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.400
So here is actually a chess
set that someone's built.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.720
And over here is some
kind of interesting,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.120
some kind of hex grid-based land game.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.560
And you can see Mahjong off on the side.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.080
Now everything in Second Life,
if I haven't mentioned it,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.380
is built by the residents.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.160
We don't build this.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.830
It's all built by the
people in Second Life.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.840
And people build a lot, a lot of games.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.910
So there's all these kinds of games.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.620
But there's a big variety of other kinds
of games that we're going to go see.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.560
So for example,
let's see why I start going there.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.310
There are board games and sports games.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.010
There's golf.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.620
There's yacht racing, which is really,
really cool.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:05.120
There's giant 11-meter-tall
snail racing every Saturday.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.700
It's really great, worth going to go see.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.550
People build word games.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.930
People build all sorts of games.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.900
And hopefully,
I've got a bunch of friends here who

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.900
were going to be playing war games.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.400
Let's see if they're actually there.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.320
I think they're over in the other spot.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.900
Let's go see them.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.700
Ah, yes, there

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.960
Yeah, so you can fly over.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.640
Let's see, this is,
this game is actually,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.550
we have a games contest in Second Life.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.400
Every year we get people
to build in games,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.400
and this is one of this year's winners.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.870
And they are building, this is great,
this is kind of like a

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.400
robot war style thing.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.830
All these things are
objects they've built,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.160
they're all scripted,
they're all having a

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.830
big fallout battle here,
which is really a lot of fun.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:49.830
And we'll say something, thanks.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:59.080
and David So I like this example
because this is kind of a new kind of

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.560
game that people have built in here.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.500
All sorts of crazy stuff.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.480
Now when it comes to games,
we have to talk about not

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.460
only just existing games,
but also a new trend of serious games.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.260
Serious games are simulations and
games and training exercises designed

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.820
for research or for training purposes.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.580
A good example is there's an emergency
response training program with a

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.660
complete simulated UC Davis campus
where people can set the hospital on

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.980
fire and all the fire trucks come out.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.240
It's pretty wild.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.020
There's also, someone did,
there's I think 13 courses,

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.110
university courses taught
in World this year,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.550
and someone did a whole physics
optics lab where you can do

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.800
optics experiments in World.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.200
So games can have a lot of other meaning.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.430
This is an interesting place.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.840
This is the
International Space Flight Museum built

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.980
in World with I think a building of
every rocket ever shot into outer space.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.580
Complete models with note
cards and information about

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.000
all the things that are there.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.490
But of course, you know,
we can have a little fun with it.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.180
We can actually,
actually ride one of the rockets.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.360
Here, I think we can go to the
Gemini rocket and ride it.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.900
Alright,
there we are on the Gemini rocket,

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.780
and it's asking us to say
"blast off" when we're ready.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.460
So, there we go.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.450
So we're blasting off.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.390
And I'll show the, we'll zoom out here.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.900
As soon as we get, there we go.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.080
So you can see the rocket
flying up into the space here.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.240
There it is, flying out.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.800
So the
International Space Flight Museum is

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.000
kind of a whole museum and simulation
of some of the facts where you can

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.800
do an interesting amount of learning.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.790
We're now in orbit around the Earth,
and soon we'll actually go

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.230
up and see the museum there.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.540
Interesting about entertainment is that
there's a wide variety of games and

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.290
entertainment in Second Life because
we have a wide variety of population.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.730
There we go.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.300
We have 43% female users.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.130
Our age demographics exactly
match that of the United States,

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.080
and we have 25% international users.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.640
So there's a wide variety
of things going out there.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.990
It's one of the great things
you do when you do stuff online,

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.920
is that you get great,
diverse user bases.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.320
Here's the International Space Station.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.410
Endeavor loaded there,
and there's a bunch of stuff.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.160
Actually, this whole simulation
allows you to fly to,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.750
I think,
every planet in the solar system,

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.240
which is a tremendous amount of fun.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.980
We're going to do a two-second see
if this is going to work today.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.700
Yes!

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.740
We made it to Mars.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.660
There we go.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.900
There's actually the lander and stuff.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.780
So there's a whole variety of things.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:41.230
By the way, this is... All right.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.710
Now, while there's this stuff
happening up here in space,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.260
there's some more
real-life stuff going on,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.940
which is, I think, getting interesting.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.540
We're beginning to see a
connection between real life

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.910
and virtual online life.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.700
So, we've recently had book readings
and signings by Cory Doctorow,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.580
Professor Lawrence Lessig,
and Kurt Vonnegut.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.690
There were,
the BBC held a simultaneous concert

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.810
in Scotland and in Second Life.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.290
Susan Vega recently gave
an in-world concert.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.060
And these kind of connections
between real life and Second Life,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.930
or between things online
and things in the real life,

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.980
are beginning to expand
and do just great things.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.420
Here's a commercial opportunity.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.040
This is American Apparel,
an actual manufacturer of clothing,

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.060
that opened a virtual store.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.810
So, many people say, "Well,
why have an online virtual 3D store

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.840
when you can actually just go to a
website?" And that's because shopping is,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.570
well, a social experience, right?

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.300
So, here you can actually go into
a store and buy something.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.300
So, you can actually go into
a store and buy stuff.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.300
Oh, my God, there's Amy Webber.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.290
I'll talk about her in just a second.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.380
So, you can see a whole bunch of
people in this store hanging out.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.530
We can actually look at the goods.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.160
I like this great, here's a, yes,
the real world, the real world shirt,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.010
the virtual shirt.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.640
I can actually go buy stuff,
so I'm going to actually

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.280
buy this jacket right here.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:58.990
They're all talking.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.700
So I've actually bought-- so
that's actually using the virtual

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.500
and world currency to buy things.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.480
Let's see, here's the jacket.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.420
It's just dumped.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.490
Actually, I get-- it's great.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.500
I get one of every single color.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:14.900
I'm going to go off and wear the red one.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.020
So here's an interesting thing.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.200
So we've got virtual versions
of real-life clothing.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.720
There it is on me.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.440
But there actually is a
connection back out again.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.730
So this actually is-- you click there,
and it takes you to their website,

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.920
where you can actually buy the real-life
version of the virtual clothing that

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.600
you just bought that was a mimic of
a real-life-- my head's spinning.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.400
Actually, what it's really great is
that if you buy it virtually,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.520
you get 15% off.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.490
You get a coupon.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.360
You get a virtual coupon
that works in real life.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.600
How cool is that?

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.390
Another aspect that's interesting
for developers and development here

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.080
is this store is a professional
development done by a professional

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.500
company that does virtual
development for real-life customers.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.660
In this case, actually,
Amy Webber right there

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.160
is the lead developer,
I believe.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.270
And actually,
I think she just mentioned Sarah.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.330
Sarah Linden there actually
works in our office,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.550
and she almost always wears
in virtual life what she is

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.920
actually wearing in real life.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.460
People do the craziest things.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.110
There are 20 companies now,
at last count, that I recently spoke to,

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.190
doing actual development in Second Life.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.870
They're doing real things for the BBC.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.270
They're doing things for companies
for several universities,

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.700
and here in the case of American Apparel,
building things.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.660
And development in Second Life is a real,
well, there's a real business there.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.650
We mentioned the economy.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.150
There was a stat there
you might have seen,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.040
$10 million U.S.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.120
equivalent trading hands
every month in Second Life.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.680
$1.4 million actually goes into
Second Life from customers' hands

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.050
and back out again into the market.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:45.290
And that's just growing.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.870
That's just a great thing.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.470
Now,
last thing I want to point out is that,

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:51.270
how does all this happen?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.310
All of this building
happens in Second Life.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.400
So, building is an important thing.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.630
I'm falling down on the ground.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.630
I've gone to a sandbox,
which is a public area for building,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.230
and so I have to apologize.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.650
I have no idea what's going
to be in here when I get here.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.010
We'll see all sorts of crazy stuff.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.360
But I want to show you how
this all really happens.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.290
This isn't magic.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.700
It all starts... Whoops.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.970
That's not what I wanted to build.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:20.970
It all starts...

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:28.070
With a plywood cube.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.070
There's a plywood cube.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.070
We can make it bigger.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.620
And so, notice that all building
happens in world,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.320
creative,
that any resident can do these things.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.270
I'm going to go off and
twist this a little bit.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.230
You have the ability to pull in textures.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.690
You can take any textures you want.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
and apply them.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.450
So actually there's a nice
multidisciplinary work in

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.250
building in Second Life for
which the Mac is just perfectly,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.340
perfectly suited.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.110
You have to do texturing and scripting.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.900
There's a nice sphere.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.570
Do you like the sound of creation?

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.120
It's one of the best things we've got.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.810
So I'm going to go off
and build a little wither.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.120
There's a little brass sphere.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:13.060
Let's go off and make it some shiny,
because everything's

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.060
better when it's shiny,
and show you that it's physical.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.680
Let's see, I think I can push it off.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.380
Come on.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.680
There it goes.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:23.680
Oh.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:38.300
[Transcript missing]

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.690
Well, where is it?

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:48.880
Well,
I just made it fly all over the place.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.700
Yeah, well, you know,
the best laid demos.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:49.700
Here, let's go off and make
the big pedestal bounce,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:49.700
too.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.400
Oh, I didn't make it physical.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.960
Here, we'll make it physical.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.770
Now, the great thing about--
How did that happen?

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.630
I don't know.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.490
The great thing about Second Life is
that building happens in a social space.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.920
All these green dots up here are people.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.160
This is happening-- I'm going to
zoom out and get a little sense

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.840
of what's going on in this place.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.620
This is a sandbox where people are
building the craziest of things.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.620
And we've got some big
tree house going on there.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.430
We've got some other pods and houses.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.510
And one of the things
I wanted to show you is,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.900
you can see over here,
here's a group of people Well, let's see.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.690
Oddly enough, two of them are dancing.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.670
But these people are building.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.980
And building becomes a social
experience in Second Life,

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.500
which means they're
all helping each other,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.240
and they're helping learn.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.160
And it helps make the whole experience,
by being an online social experience,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.020
just so much, so much,
so much more better.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.020
OK, we're going to leave
Second Life now for the moment.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.720
And I'll go back to my last little bit.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.970
So we can get back to the slides.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.160
So now just a few geeky details
about how we build this thing.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.800
The client for Second Life is built
from a single source for both Mac,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.500
Linux, and Windows.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.850
Runs on all three.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.500
It's universal binary.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.460
We were universal binary within just a
few weeks of the shipping MacBook Pros.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.190
We really love supporting
the Mac program.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.120
And I was mentioning
in the other session,

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.950
our users are surprisingly-- they were
telling us they had MacBook Pros and

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.740
we were waiting for it faster
than we could get it out the door.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.170
They loved it.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.960
Mac users are loyal
users and early adopters.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.220
It's all open GL for the rendering.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.260
So that makes it easy.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.380
Helps our cross platform.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.660
And of course, the debugging tools in the
Mac are just great for it.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.230
We compile with Xcode on the Mac.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.740
And we make just extensive
use of all the Xcode features,

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.050
like distributed building and
zero link and all the abilities

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.820
to make building really,
really fast, which otherwise would

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.880
be really problematic.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.330
Lastly, some other geeky things.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.310
The actual back end simulation is
running in a huge rack of machines in

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.230
a building a couple blocks from here.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.740
There's one process in
CPU for every 16 acres.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.470
So if you do the math right now,
we're about 3,100 CPUs all running in

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.380
a giant grid computation simulation,
simulating all that land

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.100
and physics and stuff.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.000
Lastly, just a note that the Mac fans,
Mac users,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.480
are always just-- they're so loyal.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.090
It's great.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.940
So this is at the Space Flight Museum.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.760
I was taking the screenshots for
stuff and planning things out.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.790
And this is one of the creators.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.960
And he walks up and starts talking to me.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.960
And when he talks,
a PowerBook appears in front of him

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.010
that he's typing on every time he talks.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.860
Just made it because he liked it.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.310
Anyway, that's Second Life,
a great online game,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.710
a great platform that integrates
and was built with Mac.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.980
Thanks.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.360
Let's see.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.040
So that's one, online gaming.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.970
I have it on good authority
that is the real Mark Lettseer,

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.560
not the Avatar,
just in case you were wondering.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:43.980
Okay.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.740
So, second trend,
casual games and casual gaming.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.300
Again, this is another one.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.240
So we talked about, first of all,
about online gaming.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.380
Now let's talk about casual games.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.490
Like a lot of things going
on in gaming right now,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.040
casual games are big.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.380
So let me just ask a question.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.180
How many of you guys got
a game on your phone?

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.990
How many people got a game on the phone?

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.340
Okay.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.030
A lot of people.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.800
Not most.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.660
Anyway, that's a lot of casual gaming.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.960
But in addition to that,
there's a lot of casual gaming

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.670
going on on computers as well.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.220
In fact,
it's the most popular segment title

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.850
that we sell in our retail stores.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.110
So, first of all, audience, look at that.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.780
You know,
we have over 100 million PC users

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.590
who say they're casual gamers.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.010
Casual gaming is a business.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:24.740
It's a quarter of a billion dollars.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.600
So from that aspect, it's very large.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.150
And consoles are now starting
to get on the bandwagon.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.670
So originally, you know,
we always think of consoles

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.180
as being driving games,
first-person shooters,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:34.260
and all that kind of stuff.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.420
But more and more, with the trend of,
you know, the casual and the family

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.740
game becoming more prevalent,
we're seeing the consoles jump on board.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.460
There were four conferences
this year just on casual games.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.490
And, you know, some, you know,
it's interesting when you consider

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.840
what's been happening with some of the
first-person shooter kind of AAA stuff,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.120
the emphasis now that's
moving in that direction.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.190
And as a further proof point,
EA's Pogo site has, you know,

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.670
a million subscribers right now.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.540
And so we think casual games
and online gaming are two trends

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:03.540
that are going to be very,
very different.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:10.050
And so we think casual games
and online gaming are two trends

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.150
that are going to be very,
very different.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.140
So Freeverse is involved in the
Mac gaming market on all sorts of levels,

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.500
and I want to go the wrong direction.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.610
And I want to touch on four of them:
casual games,

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.340
original Mac game development,
which we're very excited about, PC ports,

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.140
and distribution.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.940
And let's begin.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.320
First, a casual game in today's market
has a very specific definition.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.400
A casual game is a small game,
like 20 megabytes or less, downloadable.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.400
A casual game has almost
no learning curve.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.600
You can pick it up, put it down.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.880
It's got a very small time commitment.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.160
And all these things come together,
and I'm sure you've played them.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:06.430
You've played Zuma or Snood or Bejeweled,
any number of these games, I'm sure.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.590
Raise your hand if you've
played any of these games.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.590
Everyone.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.590
Yeah.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.620
And casual gamers are
pretty much everyone.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.700
Everyone who owns a Mac is
a potential casual gamer.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:23.170
And the casual game market skews a little
older and skews a little more female.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.050
And that's a good thing.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:29.130
And Freeverse has been in the
casual game market for a while,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.700
and we're seeing just great results.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.440
Casual gaming on the Mac has never
been stronger than it is this year,

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.880
and Apple deserves a
lot of credit for that.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.000
We're also big, big boosters of original
Mac game development.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:50.100
Last year, we co-sponsored the original
Mac games programming contest,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:56.860
which we'll be doing again this year,
with a great resource, idevgames.com.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.060
So if you haven't been there,
you should check that out if you're

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.060
interested in doing Mac game development.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.640
We think a Mac,
original Mac game made on the Mac and

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.610
made specifically for the Mac will
always be a better user experience

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:14.220
and will always be a better game than
a PC port or a game that's designed

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.240
without the Mac specifically in mind.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:23.490
And the Mac has some great technologies
that you can plug into and it has

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.070
a design sense that just makes the
whole gaming experience much better.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:30.040
And I'm going to talk about four casual
games that Freeverse is doing this year.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.460
Wingnuts 2,
which you may have seen already,

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.880
came out two months ago.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:38.680
And the other one I want to talk
about is a new suite of casual games

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:44.180
called the Big Bang Brain Games,
and specifically Big Bang Reaction.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.170
So I guess let's talk about them.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:48.170
Let me dive in.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.300
First is Big Bang Reaction.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.500
And this is, at its heart,
it's a simple puzzle game.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.010
But, as I hope you'll see,
there's nothing simple about

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:08.300
the technologies we bring to it,
and the level of quality.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.580
This is using all the same stuff you'd
see if you're trying to make a AAA title.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:18.770
Open GL, beautiful sounds, scores,
and just...

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.920
Sounds not quite high enough to hear him.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:30.290
But all of this quality,
all of this production value is brought

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.190
for what is basically a puzzle game,
and that's something I think

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.400
Freeverse has always tried to do.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.340
Regardless of the scale of the game,
we've tried to make it as

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.050
high quality as possible.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:46.590
And I think users really appreciate that,
especially Mac users.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.560
They know what's happening.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.720
So in this game, you're adding

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.760
You're adding balls,
and when you get to a certain level,

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.320
it explodes and can
cause a train reaction.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.730
So let me just quickly
show you another level.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.740
Let's see.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:10.700
And so I guess the story behind this
game is that as if you caught Bertrand's

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:15.990
State of the Mac OS speech yesterday,
he was talking about the cinematic

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:19.750
experience they bring to the OS,
the wow factor.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.360
And that's the language of games.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.860
And it's being done with the technology
that's been developed for games.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.970
And having the wow
factor is very important.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:30.970
And also--

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:34.670
Easy to do on the Mac,
especially with the new

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.580
technologies they talked about
with core animation and stuff.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:43.980
Those are all great things
for increasing the level of

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:43.980
quality in the finished product.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.960
So as you can see,
if you know where to go,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.620
this is a pretty big chain reaction.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.580
And we're using a golf
metaphor for this game.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.230
So if you look at the top,
this is a par-5 board.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.250
And I'm two shots into it,
so I'm doing OK.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.210
And that's Big Bang Reaction,
which is almost in beta and

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:01.970
will be out in the fall.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:12.480
And the other game I wanted to show,
sorry about that, is Wingnuts 2,

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.780
which you may have seen already.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.240
Again,
it's got very high production values,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.990
soundtracks, it's an original Mac game.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.680
You can only play this on the Mac.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.590
And it takes a little while to load
because it's over 800 megabytes.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.180
It's 30 levels.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:34.170
Each level is hand-built with dozens of,
not that long on the machines

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.900
they give us a demo on.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:44.220
But there's 30 different boss monsters,
and I'll just try and quickly show you.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.500
Hopefully you can see that
it's a thing of beauty.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.440
And this game also demonstrates,
in addition to the beautiful particle

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:59.320
effects and the use of OpenGL,
this also is a good example of

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.040
how we integrate Mac technology.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.200
Because it's a Mac app, it runs windowed,
it runs full screen.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.350
We use the iSight camera if it's
available for generating victory

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.770
pictures for your top score list.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.200
We use core image effects.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.200
And here's a mecha mode power-up,
which I'm going to get.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.010
And notice that I just
turned into... Yeah,

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.200
I'm a badass right now.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.180
And notice how I come apart.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.210
I turn to individual rectangles
and they all spin off.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.540
Anyway, that's the very first few
seconds of level one of Wingnuts.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.740
And I will get out of that.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:46.030
Now going back to this.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.000
We also chose this year
to do some PC ports,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.720
which is a first.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.040
We've done some publishing of
other people's PC ports before,

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.260
but Freeverse thought what with
all the new technologies coming

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.040
on and the Intel transition,
now is really the perfect time to

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.020
get into the PC porting market.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.140
And we chose two very specific titles.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.440
And I'd like to reveal a
little bit about our thinking,

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:11.260
just so you can get a sense of how
we're evaluating the Mac game market.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.440
First is Legion Arena.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:19.000
Legion Arena is hitting an underserved
part of the Mac gaming market,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.720
we feel.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.640
It's a historical war game,
and it's a beautiful game.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.850
It's fully 3D.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.210
It's in the genre of Rome Total War.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.120
And there isn't much
like that for the Mac.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.760
And so we thought that would
be a good one to bring over.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.420
And that one shipped last month,
I'm happy to report.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.320
It also has,
because it's a historical war game,

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.080
and that has its own sort of
sub-segment of the market,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.660
it will continue to sell, we think,
for a while.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.590
And that's very important
from a business side,

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.660
because of the nature of the PC port,
you're probably going to

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.870
miss the first few months,
and probably a lot of the

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.680
advertising buzz around the
launch of the game initially.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.850
And so if a game is going to
spike and then go away in a year,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.310
you've missed a lot of
your window of opportunity.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.970
So Legion Arena will have longevity,
and we expect it to sell in retail

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.160
and from our store for a long time.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.320
The other game I'm very
happy to talk about,

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.080
is Heroes 5 of Might and
Magic by Ubisoft.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.110
This is a AAA title,
and it's a title that has

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.500
a long history on the Mac.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.040
All previous four versions
made it over to the Mac,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.530
and if you've been using the
Mac for more than a few years,

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.890
I'm sure you're familiar
with the franchise.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.390
It's a great game also.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.360
Again, we wanted to play it.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.770
Both Legion and Heroes have
no console version.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:32.050
And in terms of maximizing
it as a business venture,

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.740
we thought that was important.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.270
If you want to play
either of these games,

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.280
and people do want to play them,
you have to have a console version.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:37.280
And if you want to play
either of these games,

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.990
you have to do it on your
desktop or your laptop.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.900
And again,
like in Age of Empires or a Civilization,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.450
we think Heroes 5 is
the sort of game which,

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.650
once we do a kick-ass
Mac version and get it out there,

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.780
it'll sell for hopefully years.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.990
And so just wanted to let you
know a little bit about why we

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.470
chose these specific titles.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:00.430
And then there's the final part
of the points I want to speak to,

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.960
which is marketing and distribution,
I mean.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.240
And how do we get these games out?

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.510
Thank you.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.360
The retail side is interesting.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.600
We have a European and Asian partners
to help us get into those markets.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.140
In North America, the Apple stores,
I guess, and internationally now,

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.760
the Apple stores are a great resource.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.680
I think there's almost 160 stores,
and that's essential for getting

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.520
your games in front of people who
aren't necessarily Mac game players,

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.440
even though they're Mac users.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.910
But they're potential customers,
so we have to beat them.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.820
And of course,
we maintain a great online store and

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.480
try to keep our face in the press.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.160
But casual games present
a special problem for us.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.700
Casual games,
because they're potential customers,

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.040
are everyone with a MacBook and
everyone with an iMac,

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.820
or whatever Mac they have,
they're not necessarily

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.400
self-identified as gamers.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.580
A lot of them won't even say,
are you a computer game player?

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.430
And they'll say no.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.860
And then you ask them if they play Zuma,
and they say every day.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.950
And because of that,
they're also not geeky.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.840
So they won't go to a version tracker.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.690
They don't even know
version tracker exists.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.020
They might not read Macworld,
and they don't consider

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.000
themselves Mac addicts.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.210
And so how do we reach these people?

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.360
And so we think we have a solution.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.700
And I'm proud to announce this
week we launched MacFun.com,

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.900
which is the premier
Mac casual gaming portal.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.780
We've been talking to and
partnering with some of the

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.610
larger casual game developers,
PopCap and GameHouse, et cetera,

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.750
as well as Mac-specific developers
like Brian Greenstone of Pangea.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.330
And so what we hope to do is we hope to
create a place where all this original

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.390
Mac development and the more general
casual game market can come together,

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.740
and you can get the best Mac experience.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.730
It'll look great in Safari.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:55.760
All the games will be pre-vetted to
make sure that they run great on OS X.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.030
And it's launching this week,
so you can go check it out.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.870
And if any of you are interested
in developing casual games or

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:06.400
talking about larger projects,
we want to talk to you.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.190
So come up to me after the session,
or just drop me an email.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.130
It's ian at freeverse.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.110
It's very easy to find.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.030
And now I'd like to introduce Ron Travis.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.180
Oh, sorry.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.480
Travis Brown of Apple,
who will talk a little bit about

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.530
putting this OS X technology to work.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.440
Thank you.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.240
Thank you, Ian.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.470
Great games require great technology,
and Mac OS X is filled with

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.580
an array of great technologies
that you have the ability to

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.160
take advantage of in your game.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.090
So what I want to do in this section is
actually take a look at the technologies

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.670
that are relevant for games and sort of,
you know,

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:50.180
put the context around them so you
understand how our technology portfolio

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.500
can be used in your game efforts.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:58.180
So there are several key technologies,
areas that most games almost always have.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.780
They have almost always graphics.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.470
They have strong audio experiences.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.050
They, in many cases,
have to exceed the input of a

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.140
keyboard and mouse and use joysticks,
game pads, and other forms of input.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.820
And also, games require certain degrees
of optimization that aren't

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.240
necessarily typical in your
common application software.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.220
So we'll speak to a tool story as well.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.600
So what we're going to do is take
each one of these categories and

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.780
sort of drive down into it and talk
about the technologies in Mac OS X,

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.560
and what they're important
for you to know about.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.680
I'll also talk about trends
and certain technologies,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.060
particularly in the graphic area,
that I think you need to be aware about.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.040
Then also, I will talk about new Leopard
developments where appropriate.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.260
So let's talk about graphics.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.510
Games are synonymous with graphics.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.520
I mean, you're trying to create
an immersive experience,

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.850
and therefore,
every pixel on the display counts

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:46.160
in terms of that experience.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:51.280
And what almost all games use
on the platform is OpenGL.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.980
And for those who aren't
aware of what OpenGL is,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.970
OpenGL is an industry
standard graphics API.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.360
It came out of sort of science and CAD.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.020
It was originally used
principally for 3D,

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.680
but more and more we're seeing
it used pervasively throughout

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.080
all categories of applications.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.230
But since it has such
a strong 3D heritage,

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.980
it's a sort of a foundational
technology for games.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.050
And I'll talk about
that in the next slide.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.550
You have also OpenGL is what
we use in the platform of

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.980
distraction for graphics hardware.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.350
Because we're going to ship ATI, NVIDIA,
and Intel GPUs in our systems,

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.500
and you want an API that's going
to abstract you from some of the

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.460
complexity or specifics of the
underlying graphics processor.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.270
We also are increasingly
moving OpenGL as a fundamental

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.230
component of Mac OS X graphics,
all Mac OS X graphics.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:40.900
Many of you have seen some
dazzling demos so far at WWDC,

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.560
and almost all those dazzling
demos are powered by OpenGL.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.700
So let's really talk
about games and OpenGL.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.590
I'm going to bring up sort of a,
you know, go in the time machine,

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:54.620
go back, and take a look at a sort of a,
you know, a seminal game in, you know,

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.810
3D graphics and hardware
acceleration in particular.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.320
And that's going to be Quake 3 Arena.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.220
It looks a little bit dated,
but it's going to,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.660
it's an interesting point
because it points to a trend.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.840
You know, Quake 3 Arena in its day was
absolutely cutting edge in

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.810
terms of what it was doing.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.430
It was very fluid, real-time,
hardware accelerated

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.640
graphics using OpenGL.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.520
It also used some pretty cutting
edge techniques for its day.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.940
So if we actually take a look at that
and look at the sort of complexity

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.360
that was involved in the scene,
we have around 10,000 polygons.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.870
We also have a technique
called multi-texturing.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.460
And for those of you who aren't really
familiar with textures and polygons,

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.290
obviously the wireframe
represents the vertex data or the

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:37.100
polygon data that's being drawn,
at least submitted to the graphics card.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.180
And the textures are the images that are
laid on top of it to create the scene.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:46.980
And so Quake is using these techniques to
create a reasonably immersive experience.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.580
Now, the reason I have this slide is
because this is where a lot of

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.410
games and entertainment software
today still sort of gravitate to,

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:57.640
these techniques, a lot of texturing and
a lot of vertex data.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.270
And at least, you know,
basic vertex data submitted in ways

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:05.380
that go back a long way with OpenGL.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.060
Now, I don't know if many of you
saw the -- Peter Graffagnino's

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.880
Graphics and Media State of the
Union yesterday where we showed an

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:16.540
interesting application from ATI,
which is something called Toy Shop.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.100
And the reason why we're showing this at,
you know,

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.650
both here and in the Graphics and
Media State of the Union and later

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.860
in OpenGL sessions is because this
is representative of people using

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:31.230
the modern capabilities of GPUs as
exposed through modern OpenGL or

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.240
the latest OpenGL techniques.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.960
And you can see there is a quantum
leap in visual capabilities where

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.260
I have a scene that has not only
a lot more geometry information,

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.360
but you can see on the water
ripple effect on all the windows.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:47.900
You can see puddles effects
on the road surface.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.770
You can even see rain falling.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.880
And this is an interesting
technology demo.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.790
And you'll have an opportunity to see
it again in the OpenGL optimization

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:59.830
session or at least see a video of
it in the OpenGL optimization session

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.470
because it is representative of,
like, the absolute cutting edge

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.950
techniques that you're able to do.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.660
Many of these things, details,
are actual physical simulations

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.100
executed on the GPU.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.260
So if we actually sort of take
a look at the complexity here,

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.510
we see that there's a tremendous
increase in the amount of

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.400
information you can throw at a GPU,
okay?

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.670
And the GPUs in our system at
the high end are capable of

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.720
really moving a lot of geometry.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.970
And there's also new techniques
they're going to talk about in a bit

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.600
to submit this much geometry to get
in the scene and get it rendered.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.510
In addition,
we have something called programs, okay?

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.600
Now, modern GPUs are programmable.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.220
You're no longer limited to the
sort of fixed function that was

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.000
available initially in OpenGL.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.180
You can actually change the way
vertices and/or polygon data or,

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.070
you know,
pixel rasterization happens or fragment

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.410
rasterization programmatically to
meet the needs of your application.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.560
And that is really, really powerful,
and that's how, you know,

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.500
how Toy Shop is getting that
quantum leap in capability,

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.300
and you can do it too
in your applications.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.990
So obviously the key to sort
of unlocking that is going to

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.340
be the OpenGL shading language.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.100
Now, we've had the OpenGL shading
language on Mac OS X since Tiger.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.500
We've improved it
incrementally along the way.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.680
But this is going to be
a high-level language.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.750
It's going to enable you to use a
C-like language to get access to the

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.360
programmable features of the latest GPUs.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.720
The interesting thing is, you know,
Peter Graffagnino brought up in

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:24.380
his slides yesterday that GPUs,
programmable GPUs, you know,

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.810
basically started happening around 2003,
and you actually program them through

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:33.060
some low-level exposure extensions to
OpenGL called ArbVertex and ArbFragment,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.680
which are very much like assembly
language and very difficult to program.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.420
You know, GLSL sort of makes it
significantly more accessible

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.180
because it is a C-like language.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.130
It compiles and has a lot of
language features that you're used

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:45.460
to in a higher-level language.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.400
So you're really going to want to
check out the using the OpenGL shading

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.240
language session because not only
are we going to actually show you,

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.940
uh, details about OpenGL and its usage,
we're also going to have, uh,

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.540
Rob from ATI, uh,
who worked on the Toy Shop demo,

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:03.020
come give you, uh, some, uh,
information on some of the

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.660
programs and shaders that they
used to create that awesome demo.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:44:45.300
[Transcript missing]

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.540
So let's talk about
multi-threaded OpenGL.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.290
So what we've done for Leopard
is an exciting new feature,

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.680
where we've realized that a
lot of applications themselves

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.170
tend to be single-threaded,
particularly games.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:03.820
And games also tend to run open
at a sort of open-loop frame rate.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.660
They're driving as hard as they can
to get as many frames as they can.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.280
So what this means is games are
pushing hard against the OpenGL stack.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.800
And the OpenGL stack has to do a little
bit of work to actually get commands

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.760
ready to go up to the GPU so the
graphics card can actually draw them.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.220
So in Leopard,
you're going to be able to take and

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.860
tell the OpenGL stack that it needs to
farm out some of that task of preparing

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.860
the list of things to do for the
GPU and move that onto a second thread.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.680
So in a multi-core or a
multi-processor machine,

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.140
you're going to get a net benefit.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:40.980
Because let's say, for example,
in this somewhat contrived example-- it's

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.990
a little more complicated than this--
if I have an application that's spending

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:49.180
60% of its time in my game logic,
it's spending 30% of its time

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:50.980
pushing up against OpenGL,
waiting for the

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.380
OpenGL framework to do things,
and you have another remaining 10%

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.260
of time spent doing other stuff.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.960
If you turn on multi-threaded OpenGL,
we're able to take maybe 20% to 25%

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.180
of the work spent in the OpenGL stack
and farm that on the second thread,

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.550
which suddenly makes your main
thread have about 20% to 25% more

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:11.820
cycles available for it to push
harder and generate more frame rate.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.490
Now,
this is an opt-in option for developers,

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.520
because not all OpenGL applications
are suitable to have this enabled,

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.680
because the way they use OpenGL may
induce synchronization points,

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.400
where we actually have to either check
with the OpenGL framework or possibly

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.140
even through the driver to the card
to determine some current state.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.180
So things like glget will create
these synchronization points,

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.230
which means that we cannot get
the parallelism we need with

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.320
a multi-threaded OpenGL stack.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.820
So you want to really watch
your state management.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.140
And to help you do that,
the OpenGL and Mac OS X section is

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.240
going to talk about conceptually
the multi-threaded GL stack.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.980
And also,
it'll be touched a little bit in

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.000
the optimization sessions as well.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.050
So let's look at where this
gets us in terms of performance.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:01.480
We've taken Doom 3 and World of
Warcraft and done before and afters.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.120
So you look at, in the case of Doom 3,
when it's off,

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.150
we're getting about 109 frames
per second on a Mac Pro.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.560
When we turn it on,
we hit 160 frames per second.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.970
And again,
this is just throwing a switch.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:20.280
On World of Warcraft, Ironforge,
which is a very crowd-intensive

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.280
benchmark-type scene,
we're getting 48 frames

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.190
per second with it off.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.430
We flip it on, and we're getting around
90 frames per second.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.050
With World of Warcraft in a large
outdoor scene on a mountaintop spinning

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.930
around where you see the mountain
ranges and you see all the trees and

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:40.300
it's pretty geometrically complicated,
you go from 68 to 132 frames per second.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.250
So this is the type of performance you
can get with our new multi-threaded

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:46.890
OpenGL stack in Mac OS X Leopard.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:50.680
Now, obviously if you're here, you know,
you're not getting this information

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:51.840
in the core animation session.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.680
So I wanted to take a little
bit of time to cover some of

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:57.740
it because core animation,
although we've shown it in

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.180
the use of application UI,
for example, in Time Machine,

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.350
which makes use of core animation,
we also, I want to make it clear that

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.750
it's very appropriate potentially
for casual games as a 2,

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:13.540
2.5D sort of a sprite engine that's built
in and ready to go in Mac OS X Leopard.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.940
And it's got a couple of interesting
details you want to check out.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.340
One is this concept of
automatic or implicit animation,

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:21.770
where all my application,
my game would need to do is

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.840
put graphic elements on layers,
tell core animation where the layers are,

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.530
and then tell core animation what
needs to happen with the layers,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.050
like the layer needs to go
across the screen and fade out.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.070
And core animation takes it from there.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.220
It basically, you know,
on its own rendering thread,

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.480
its own rendering engine,
takes it and animates that scene.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.800
You're out of the business of
driving each frame of the animation.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.960
And this enables us to
do all sorts of stuff.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.040
With making it a really efficient
system where we're able to ensure,

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.140
you know, do our best to optimally draw
the scene and ensure that

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.710
we get maximal frame rate.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.230
And also in simple scenes,
we don't draw too fast and end

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.820
up trying to draw 3,000 frames
per second on a trivial scene,

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.640
even when the user's
only going to see 60.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.950
So I really think this should
be interesting for you guys

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.450
to check out for casual games.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.490
Let's talk a little about audio.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.340
Our solution for audio
for games in particular,

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.540
because they need very
environmental sound,

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.530
very sort of detailed, rich sound,
much like they need with graphics,

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.040
we use OpenAL.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.670
And that's a 3D positional audio stack.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:28.140
And it works pretty simply.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:31.480
You have a listener,
and you have audio emitters

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.740
around in a three-space scene.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.790
On the basis of that layout
and where things are moving,

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.120
an audio equivalent will be rendered.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.200
And you can use that to represent that
and sent through two or more channels.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.480
And the actual API is
modeled after OpenGL.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.600
And so it's really conceptually
easy for developers to pick up

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.400
if they're familiar with OpenGL.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.890
It's also multi-platform.

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:54.420
So if you want to take
your title across platform,

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.020
the OpenAL implementation is
available on several other platforms.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.260
And then a key note is we added
this because of popular request.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.020
A lot of game developers
looked at Core Audio and said,

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.170
hey, this is great.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:06.070
It's powerful.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:09.280
But we want something a little
more tuned to our needs.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.040
And so we actually found
this in open source,

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.640
brought it into Mac OS X,
did an optimal implementation,

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.600
and put it in Mac OS X Tiger.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.390
So what we're doing, well,
here's a quick example of some

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:22.630
AAA titles that are shipping with OpenAL.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.180
Things like Doom 3,
the Mac version's sound is

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.900
implemented on top of OpenAL,
Unreal Tournament, Harry Potter.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.900
And there are about 25 other titles,
a lot of casual games

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.610
that are using OpenAL.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:36.780
and David Levin.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.770
So what are we doing
with OpenAL and Leopard?

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.920
Well, like OpenGL,
OpenAL is continuing to be moved forward

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.560
by its standards body and its community.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.170
So there's a new version
called OpenAL 1.1,

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.140
and that's being included in Leopard.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.890
And it has a couple of new features, one,
the ability to capture sound.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.390
It also has distance models,
so you can better replicate

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.030
fall-off of sound as things,
you know, go into,

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.930
as sounds go into the distance.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.920
It also has reverb,
occlusion and obstructions that

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.550
are going to be very useful when
you're trying to recreate the sound

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:09.480
environment based on maybe what
you're rendering with graphics.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.060
So if, like, for example,
you have a first-person shooter

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.660
and someone ducks in a door
or goes around the corner,

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.720
you're going to be better able to create
the equivalent audio representation

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.800
that matches your visual representation.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.760
It also has static buffers,
which are sort of like I talked

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.100
about with buffer objects in OpenGL,
a data flow optimization.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.710
In this case,
this enables your application to hold

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.490
onto the sound data versus having to
have copies in the OpenAL framework.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.760
So it's a very, very good way to do
performance optimization.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.920
So let's talk briefly about input.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.140
Now, input is interesting,
because this is actually

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.790
surprisingly complicated.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.170
You think graphics and
sound are complicated,

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.800
but input is really, really complicated.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.500
So how we sort of try to
simplify it is by USB HID,

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.160
or the Human Interface
Device Specification.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.310
We've actually taken our I/O, you know,
I/O Kit framework,

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.350
which is a device driver
model in Mac OS X.

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:59.200
We have a set of classes that deal with,
you know, input devices, HID devices.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.080
Last year,
we asked for feedback in this area,

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.730
and we got a lot of feedback.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.330
We got a lot of feedback from the users,
and we got a lot of

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:01.740
feedback from the users.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.170
And we got a lot of
feedback from the users.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:02.740
And we got a lot of
feedback from the users.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.540
And we got a lot of
feedback from the users.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:09.160
And we got some great feedback at WWC,
and, you know, we've taken it to heart,

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.990
we've listened,
and we've actually made some

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.120
changes to USB HID and Leopard.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:16.880
And what we've done is to create a group
of higher-level APIs that enable you to

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.290
have easier -- make it easier for the,
you know, discover and access

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.810
and parse HID devices,
because part of the trick is a

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.580
gamepad can have n number of buttons.

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.140
You know, a joystick can have a throttle,
a top hat.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.840
It can even have foot pedals, rudder,
you know, they're used for rudders

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.960
or area -- you know,
used for rudders.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.920
And making sense of those
is pretty complicated.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.160
So we used to do this with HID utilities,
which is some sample code,

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.280
and we're actually sort of
superseding that with the new HID,

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.120
you know,
new HID APIs and I/O Kit in Leopard.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.950
Now, we still have a little bit of areas
that we want more information on.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.260
One is the issue of UI.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.380
Do you want in-game UI for configuration?

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:01.380
Do you want us to provide sort
of raw API for configuration?

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:01.880
And you'll take care
of the game experience.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:07.200
And then, you know,
do you want us to create a -- you know,

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.380
create Aqua sort of
UI and componentry for it?

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.400
We're also interested in getting
feedback on how you want to

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.550
handle out-of-spec devices,
because there's a fair

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:18.080
number of devices out there,
like mice that report they have

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.030
255 buttons and stuff like that,
which can create issues when you're

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:23.020
trying to configure your game.

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:27.180
If you want to give us some feedback,
why don't you send it to Craig Keithley,

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.940
our I/O technology evangelist.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.220
His e-mail is up there.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:34.240
And he's the one sort of
championing this issue at Apple.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.510
So, quick note about tools.

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:38.380
Obviously, tools is all about Xcode.

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.590
If you're developing on Mac OS X from C,
C++, Objective C, you're going to want to

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.500
be doing it with Xcode.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.840
But I wanted to make a specific
call out to some tools,

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.850
some performance tools that are
key to unlocking the performance

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:51.360
of your entertainment title.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.400
And that's going to
be -- I went too fast.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:55.400
Oop.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.140
So that's going to be,
it's going to be Shark,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.430
it's going to be OpenGL Profiler,
and it's going to be Driver Monitor.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.130
And you can learn more about
these tools and the OpenGL,

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.990
optimizing OpenGL applications,
we're going to take OpenGL Profiler,

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.300
and we'll also take Driver Monitor and
Shark together and teach you

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.460
how to optimize your graphics.

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.900
And then also,
you'll learn more about Shark and sort

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:21.270
of algorithmic level debugging and using
performance analysis and debugging tools.

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:25.190
Now there's some other interesting
tools that are out there that don't

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.400
require C or C++ level of development.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.820
And that's going to
be higher-level tools,

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:32.640
and these are game
development environments.

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.520
And one great example is one
done by a company called Unity.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.630
Now, instead of actually coding
a game from scratch,

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:43.230
you're going to be able to use a tool
like Unity to focus at the gameplay

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:48.490
and the sort of art level and,
you know, geometry level,

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.620
and build your game at this high level,
and then have the

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.990
Unity game system really,
you know, enable that game to be

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:58.550
developed without you having
to think about physics engines,

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:01.500
graphics engines,
all the sort of details you might

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.840
if you were starting at a low level.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.320
So it's a great high-level tool.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:05.840
It's fantastic.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:10.210
It's fantastic for game development,
and I want to invite David Helgason

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:12.090
to stage to show it to you.

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.500
Thanks, Travis.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.940
So it's been a great session.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.480
We've learned a lot about
the opportunities for games,

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.520
Mac games, ways to publish them.

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.760
But this is the Worldwide
Developer Conference,

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.090
so a lot of you are
probably asking yourselves,

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.710
how do we actually tap into
this and create the games?

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:36.490
And one great answer is Unity.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:40.200
So let's just look at that.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.000
Unity is a simple but powerful
game development environment.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.600
It's one application only.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.410
So you just sit down with that,
and you create your

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.640
entire game inside it.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.990
It enables you to create stunning
3D games in an amazingly short time.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.410
and it's fully featured,
meaning we just hand-picked all the

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:00.540
most powerful game technologies,
put them together,

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.100
and at your disposal in the menus and
in a very nicely laid out application.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:10.100
So this includes the most incredibly
beautiful OpenGL graphics,

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:14.200
Unity ships with dozens of shaders
and 12 full-screen image effects,

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:17.100
which can make your
game look really great.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:20.780
Another nice thing,
cool thing about games is

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.100
immersive environments.

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:27.100
And the easiest and most powerful
way to create those is using physics.

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:30.100
So Unity includes a full version
of the Geophysics engine,

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:34.010
which is probably the most scalable
and powerful physics engine out there.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.430
And we made it really easy to use,
so you define how your

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:40.440
objects should behave,
material properties,

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.950
and you set it to work.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:47.100
Of course, Unity has character animation,
so you can import your animation.

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:51.500
I've got animations from Maya from
pretty much every 3D program,

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.230
and just set it to play.

00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:57.180
Now Unity is an application,
it's not an API.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:02.180
So instead of mucking around with tens
of thousands of lines of C++ code,

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.290
you get a flexible scripting environment.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:09.890
It supports JavaScript, C#,
and a dialect of Python.

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:14.440
And it's super-powered,
it's JIT-compiled, so the JavaScript,

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:16.800
for instance, is 20 times faster than
your normal JavaScript.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:19.160
And that's just really nice to use.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:22.600
The last thing that is at
the core of Unity is the

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.620
no-hassle art asset workflow.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.340
And I'm going to show it to you,
because it's kind of hard to explain,

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.540
but it just makes it very,
very easy and efficient

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:32.170
to get all the art,
whether it's textures, audio,

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.740
or 3D models, into Unity.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.650
So, I think we'll... Oh yeah,
before we actually put

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:40.520
out Unity as a product,
we ate our own dog food

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.530
and created the Goo Ball,
which you may have heard about.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.460
It was published by Ambrosia
one and a half years ago,

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.640
and it's just still a gorgeous game.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.230
You can find it on the net.

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:56.960
So, let's just look at Unity and
see how easy it is to use.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:05.890
So you see up there, Unity,
gorgeous Cocoa application,

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.710
totally lickable.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.580
And up there, you have,
we've actually preloaded it with an

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:16.100
early version of Tiki Magic Mini Golf,
which is in production by Freeverse.

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.260
So up there,
you have your normal 3D view,

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.700
kind of like, you know,
in any 3D application,

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:24.150
you can pan around your level,
select objects, move them into place,

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:25.760
build levels from there.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.870
To the right,
you have an overview of your objects,

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.510
your files, very nice to kind of,
everything is drag and drop.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.410
And down here, you have a game view,
where anytime you want,

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:40.430
you just press the play button,
and play the game as it is right now.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.490
So this is a mini golf game,
so you get to drive this

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.550
ball around those fanciful,
tricky levels.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.160
Let's just bounce it around for a second.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.710
Whoa.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.120
So Unity has a million features to
make your game look really gorgeous.

00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:02.000
One category of those
is full-screen effects.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:05.190
So one of my favorites
is the glow effect.

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:12.200
So let's go and pick the camera and
add a glow effect to the whole game.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.120
Image effects,
you see the 12 image effects we ship,

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:15.120
we're going to pick glow.

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:19.260
So it pops up here, and you see there's
several properties to it.

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:21.830
Let's just play the game
and see how it looks.

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:28.340
And if we turn it off and on again,
we're going to see how nice

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.280
it makes the game look.

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:34.600
And kind of tune the properties,
it's all drag and drop.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.600
Oh, that's a bit much.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.980
Cool.

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:38.980
Perfect.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:45.170
It looks great.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:46.230
Maybe the color, color picker,
everything is very, always, 10.

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.230
Yeah.

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.250
Another thing which is
important when you're making

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:52.160
games is getting all the art,
all the textures and 3D models

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:53.740
to look great in context.

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:57.500
And I think the ground there
looks a bit washed out.

00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.780
So let's pick the ground texture.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:04.270
Here we just pause the
game while changing it.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:05.220
There's the ground texture.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:08.220
It's just a Photoshop file
with layers and whatnot.

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:12.330
But we're going to open it in preview,
because it's faster.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:16.180
So I'm going to just-- let's
just up the contrast a bit so

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.980
it doesn't look so washed out.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.160
Cool?

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.210
Looks great.

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:23.170
So save the file.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.440
Switch back to Unity,
and this is the no-hassle

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.580
art asset workflow.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.160
However you change your files,
they just get imported

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.420
into Unity right away.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.570
This is cool for textures,
but it also works for 3D models.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.670
So put in your Maya binary files,
your Cinema 4D files,

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.380
your Cheetah 3D files,
your Blender files.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.960
You change them,
it updates in Unity across all

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.680
your levels at the same time.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.180
That just blows your mind.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:53.510
And it's really nice when you
have to change and modify the game

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:55.660
to make it look and feel right.

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:58.550
To have this tight loop of tuning.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.520
So now we've worked on
the look of the game,

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.560
so let's go and add some interactivity.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:10.100
I made a fan for this,
which will work as an obstacle.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:12.980
It's made in Maya,
so we'll just drag it in.

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.080
Move it into place.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:16.800
This is a fan.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.360
In front of it, it has this trigger
area marked with blue,

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.120
and everything that's going to
enter the trigger area is going

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.730
to be affected by the trigger.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.680
So we can just rotate it so it's
kind of in front of the bridge.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.230
That's an obstacle.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:33.740
Now, we need a trigger effect,
so we wrote a trigger script.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.400
And that's just a few lines
of JavaScript in this case.

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:41.710
What it does is it takes the object
that gets in front of it and pushes it.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.720
That's going to be the fan effect.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.850
So if we switch back to Unity,
we just drag the fan effect onto the fan.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.920
Cool.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.280
Yeah, and try to play it.

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:03.200
It's rotating, it's animated in Maya.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.200
Of course.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.200
And the bulb gets pushed over.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.200
So we've got an obstacle.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.420
It's probably a bit hard,
but switching back to the fan script...

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.630
We see there is a force
variable at the top,

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:22.470
set to two initially,
and if we look it back into Unity,

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:25.000
We're going to see that
the force variable,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.120
like all member variables,
show up in the inspector,

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:30.230
so we can just tune it in there
without having to change the code.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.290
It's really cool if you have graphic
artists tuning the game for you.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.200
So let's set it to
something more reasonable,

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.130
and play the game again.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.300
This is still a mini-golf game.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:50.300
Yep, and now it's actually possible
to complete this level.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.350
Now this way,
this game is kind of half-made,

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:55.300
it probably needs two,
three more months to finish.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.300
But once you're finished with it,
you want to be able to deploy it.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.390
And then you just go to the file.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:06.870
Build, and you get to choose between:
build for the web,

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.860
build as a dashboard widget,
OS X universal binary,

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.700
a couple of other non-universal binaries,
and then Windows.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:19.330
I think we're just going
to go with the web,

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:19.330
build and run, give it a name.

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:26.900
Now what Unity does is takes
all the assets together,

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:31.200
all the scripts, compiles it,
optimizes it, and puts it into one file

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.400
which can be put on the web.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.400
And that's exactly what we get here.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.880
And the same game inside Safari.

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:46.430
I think we already made
it as a dashboard widget,

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.750
so if we bring up the dashboard.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.400
Same game, just play it.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.390
Same game, play it.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.120
All from the same source.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:01.150
So now it's ready to be published,
so I guess we'll take it to ION.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.150
That's pretty much it.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:06.320
Let me see.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.680
Last slide.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.600
Slide, please.

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:15.450
So I'm David Helgason.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.940
Go to our website, download the demo.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:20.400
It's a one-month free demo.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.990
It includes a lot of different tutorials
on how to make different types of games.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.270
And just to give you an overview,
Codemasters is doing a game with this.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.800
Freeverse is doing two.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.590
We've got a small game startup with seven
people doing an immersive third-person

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.430
game set in Jerusalem with hundreds of
characters and cars at the same time.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.450
So it's really scalable.

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:44.280
And yeah,
after the session I'll be around,

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.590
so come talk to me.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:56.400
Thank you, David.

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:59.650
Okay, so we've been able to take a
look at a lot of stuff today.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:03.680
So, three great developers doing some
interesting things on the platform.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.120
And before we go,
what we wanted to do is kind of

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.420
give you a little bit of a look at
still what's ahead for the week,

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.050
because Travis told you
a little bit about stuff.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:13.780
And so, let's take a look at it.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.080
So, first of all,
if you're tired and all this

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:19.100
makes you want to go play a game,
go down to the first floor

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.410
and go have yourself a blast.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.560
Second thing is, there's some lunch talks
that are coming on.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.550
There's Marketing Your Games and
Garage Games.

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:28.780
They'll be talking about their
tools and engine as well.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.490
That's coming up later on in the week.

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.240
We have more sessions,
and these sessions will really

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.410
give you a little bit more insight
to some of the technologies that

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:38.140
Travis has outlined for you.

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:41.890
Core Audio, Go-To-Market again, OpenGL,
Optimizing OpenGL,

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:44.540
and Performance Analysis and Debugging.

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.770
Take a look at those sessions,
because they'll really help you out.

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:52.740
Another very interesting thing, again,
you know, it's not just about doing it.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.180
We think we'll take the opportunity
of having you guys here to come out

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.720
and actually meet the publishers.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.170
So, you can see here,
tomorrow night at 6.30,

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.390
we'll have an event where
you actually have a chance

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.940
to meet the game publishers.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.860
Come talk to these guys,
and if you guys have been

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:06.950
working on anything and you
want to get it out there,

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.980
here's your chance to
meet them and hook up.

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:12.420
Now, before we're done done,
I want you guys to meet Andy.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.630
Andy, stand up.

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:14.950
Now, I'll tell you why.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.140
Wait.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.730
Andy is our
Developer Relations Games Partnership

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.580
Manager.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.880
He's a really important guy.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.160
He's your number one contact for things
that are going on inside of Apple.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.850
So, if you have any questions
or anything else like that,

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.700
come see Andy.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.860
And with that, what I want to do is
thank you for attending.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.920
And our presenters today,
with the exception of Travis,

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.800
had to go to the OpenGL session.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.640
They agreed to stick around afterwards.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.800
So, if you guys want to
come up and talk to him,

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.690
go right ahead.

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:44.720
But anyway, thank you for coming to
the State of the Union.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.430
Have a great day.

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.040
conference.
