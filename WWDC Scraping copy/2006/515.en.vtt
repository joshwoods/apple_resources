WEBVTT

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.000
Good morning.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.680
I cannot tell you how
excited I am to be here,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.380
giving you guys some information
and some demos about Teams.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.350
Teams is something brand new for Apple,
and it's going to be an

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.710
amazing presentation.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.360
For those of you who were at the server
overview where we first introduced Teams,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.200
you're going to hear a little bit more of
the information that I already gave you,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.890
but we're going to spend
a lot of time on the demo,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.960
so you can really see all
the functionality that we've

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.190
built into this product.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.850
Like I said, Teams is something new,
so I want to give you a little bit of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.200
context about the problem that we're
trying to solve with this product.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.200
The context comes from asking a question.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.200
The question is,
how are you guys working?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
You get into work, it's Monday,
you're having your coffee,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.900
you sit down at your computer,
and you've got all these dizzying

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.200
array of applications that are
begging for your attention.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
You need these applications
to get your job done,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
and you're creating information
with all of these applications.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.850
You've got Spotlight,
where you're finding stuff on

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.030
your hard drive all the time,
easily.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.200
You've got iCal,
which is suddenly much more interesting,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.190
now that we have iCal Server.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.000
iCal, obviously, is your meetings,
your day,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.200
the people that you interact with.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.200
You've got Mail, which, like Steve said,
is your day.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.190
Like Steve said in the keynote,
he lives in it, and I live in Mail.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.180
There's a huge amount of organizational
information inside of Mail,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.200
and people use it in a
lot of different ways.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.360
I was working with my kids' school on
this huge network infrastructure to get

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.200
homework from school to home and back.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.880
I'm like, "Why don't they just mail it
to each other?" They're like,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.960
"Oh, yeah,
I guess we don't need those servers

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.230
and all those things." Anyway,
the point is that Mail is being

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.200
used for a lot of different things.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
There's a huge amount
of information in there.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.190
You search Mail all the time.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.770
You're like,
"Didn't I have a conversation

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.200
with Bob about this and da-da-da?"
You're using Mail a lot for that.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.810
You've got Safari, which is your means of
gathering information,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.030
surfing the web.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.250
Then you've got iChat,
which is your means of talking with

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.190
all these people that you work with,
making decisions.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.200
My phone doesn't ring at Apple anymore
because I have Mail and I have iChat,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.200
and that's really how we work,
is a lot of those applications.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.200
Teams isn't replacing any of these.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.000
The question is, well, the game is,
at business at least,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.070
isn't actually how you work.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.060
It's how all of you work.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.200
It's great that you've got this great
set of applications available to you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.350
that are easy to use and all this stuff,
but the fact of the matter is

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.450
somebody else in your group,
in your work group,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.090
in your business has information,
wants some information

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.200
that's on your computer,
and they can't get to it

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.200
because it's your computer.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.390
So what Teams is,
what we're trying to do here is create a

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.200
space to share all the information that
you want for the rest of the company.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.200
We want to make it really,
really easy to use.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200
So that's Teams.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.660
So let's talk a little bit about the
functionality and then let's just

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.920
get to the demo because that's really
what is compelling about this Teams.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.850
Teams is an application
in a set of services.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.500
The application is a Cocoa application
called Teams Directory.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.800
It has two roles and
it serves two people.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.970
The first role is a directory viewer.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.000
You've got information
sitting inside your directory.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.200
You want to go find that person,
that group, that map, whatever.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.960
And then it's also a
means of generating teams,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.260
groups of people,
as well as the services behind it.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.800
Again,
I said there was two different people

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.300
that Teams Directory is serving.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.960
There's a person who
just wants to get in,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.700
get out, find a piece of information.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.000
And then there's a person who's actually
managing organizational infrastructure.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.800
And this came out of our
design around iCal Server.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.900
This is the person who
needs to create maps.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.300
This is the person who
needs to create a projector.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.300
And we're not going to inflict
Workgroup Manager on them,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.600
right?

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.500
They need something a
little bit easier to use.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.330
It's a great tool, Workgroup Manager,
but it's obviously a power user tool,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.000
right?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.330
So like I said,
it also allows you to create

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.920
these groups and services.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.690
The services are all web-based.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.890
It's going to be the best
Wiki that you've ever seen.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.500
It's Weblog,
which is very similar to a Wiki,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.000
and we'll talk about that
in a little bit more.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.880
It's web-based calendaring,
which you're asking about

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.380
in the feedback session,
and shared contacts.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.290
So like I said,
it's much more interesting to see a demo,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.700
so I'd like to bring John Anderson up.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.970
works at a company called Bazookle

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:09.100
[Transcript missing]

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.290
Okay, so John, can you tell us a little
bit about what Bazooka does?

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.460
Yeah, actually.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.700
So at Bazooka we facilitate
collaboration through

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.210
peer-to-peer AJAX social networks.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.900
[Transcript missing]

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.300
So, can you maybe tell us a little
bit about how Bazooka was working

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.190
before you started using Teams?

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.190
Sure.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.640
So, I mean, as you know, as a dot-com,
we're going through

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.200
employees quite a bit,
a lot of turnaround.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.920
And what we were doing before was
we were making Word docs and we

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.300
were passing them around via email,
renaming them to try and get

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.200
some semblance of versioning.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.690
So every time somebody
made a spelling change,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.700
they were emailing out a new version of
the document to everybody in the company.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.610
And so, as you can imagine,
we had this proliferation of all

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.100
these different Word files and
Excel files and stuff like that

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.360
that are all over the place.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.860
No organization whatsoever.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.290
Right.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.100
So, maybe we can go ahead and bring
up the homepage and you give us,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.010
this is the Teams homepage,
give us a little bit of, you know,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.200
It's very white.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.200
Okay.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.630
So you can see our Teams.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.640
Go ahead.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.240
You can see our Teams home page here.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.790
And you can see actually some of
the ways in which we've organized

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.760
things now that we have Teams.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.320
And basically what's happening here
is instead of having these Word files

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.590
being distributed around the company,
everything's coming in via Wiki and

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.360
everything's in one place and you
have versioning for everything.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.320
So wait a minute.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.720
I guess you are doing a lot of hiring
because I just saw that the live --

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.160
the About Us page just updated there.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.120
So maybe we can go look at that and
actually see what happened there.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.740
All right.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.430
So I'm going to click
on About Us over here.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.250
And you can see some of the people
that are founders in this company.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.660
And I'm kind of curious,
somebody marked it as hot,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.980
and I'm curious what other
kind of changes they've made.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.280
And so what I'm going to do over
here is look at the page history.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.980
So if I click on history,
then I can see basically

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.640
all the comments,
all of the essence of what's been

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.470
changed in all these different versions.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:37.330
But I can also click on any of these and
see the old version as it existed before.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.180
I'm going to go back out of history.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.540
And now what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to edit the page.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.200
It turns out we actually recently
discovered that Bob Stevenson is

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.100
actually Nathan Hanner's evil twin.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.090
So we've eliminated him.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.040
And so I'm going to edit this page.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.100
And this is really cool.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.090
So I'm looking at the page now.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.800
If I want to edit it,
all I have to do is click

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.090
on this pencil icon.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.800
And you can see the page
is now in edit mode.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.590
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.160
Do that again.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.380
I want to see that again.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.910
That's totally cool.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.350
All right.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.390
I'll click Done.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.960
I'm out of edit mode.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.570
And now I'm in edit mode.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:24.400
So all I have to do here is
just get rid of Bob Stevenson.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.590
And get rid of his picture as well.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.560
So at this point he's gone.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.900
Now of course,
since we're missing a founder now,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.170
I've been retroactively
promoted to become a founder.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.130
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to insert my picture and I'm going

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.580
to insert my name in the list here.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.190
And you can see how easy it is.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.500
Now if anybody's used
Wikipedia or MediaWiki,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.530
UseMod, anything like that,
you know that inserting an image or

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.900
attaching something to a page is a pain.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.020
I mean, it's something where you have to
upload something to an FTP server,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.920
perhaps, or an AFP server,
and know somehow what the URL of it is,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.630
and then use some sort of a weird UseMod
mockup to put that URL in the page.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.860
And in this case, it's a lot simpler.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.720
So all I have to do is
click on the Image button,

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.590
and then I pick a file
on my local machine.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.100
So in this case,
I'll pick the picture of me.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.970
I hit Insert.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.740
And the picture is
right there on the page.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.680
So piece of cake.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.930
The other thing I'm going
to do here is add my name.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.900
I'll make that bold,
do some formatting here.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.900
Okay,
so that's actually going and existing

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.900
and editing an existing page,
but let's obviously want

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.900
to create content as well.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.900
So let's go in and maybe explore
some of the content creation tools,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.900
additional ones.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.900
Okay, so the thing I actually want to
do here is create some new content

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.260
with a bio from myself in here,
which surprisingly enough

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.900
I don't have in the system yet.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.800
So all I have to do is
click on the link button.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.660
And you notice my name's
already highlighted,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.170
so I'll just hit link.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.420
Now it's going to do a search to see if
there's any pages that match that string.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.320
It's also looking to see if there's
any pages that are related to this one,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.720
ones with the same tags.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.250
And it gives me a list of all the
pages I've looked at recently.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.840
The idea being that if I'm
going to link to something,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.050
I've probably seen it in the last, say,
10 or 20 pages.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.060
In this case,
we're actually linking to a new page,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.400
so I'm just going to click on New Page.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.300
And my highlighted text
shows up automatically,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.370
so I just hit Create.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.900
And you'll notice up here
it says Page Created,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.030
so it's made a page for me in the system.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.990
And I'm still in edit mode,
so I can keep adding more links,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.600
adding more text, whatever I want to do.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.380
In this case, I'm done.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.800
So I'll just say, comment here,
promoting myself.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.090
Removing evil twin.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.580
So I'm done with this page.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.350
And one thing I'll get into as an
aside is I've never left this page.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.140
So as you're going through a
wiki page or editing things,

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.530
you're usually doing previews,
and all of a sudden your

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.360
browser history is meaningless.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.720
And in this case,
I've stayed on this page the whole time,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.460
which is really nice.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.270
So I'll just click on my name here.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.740
And you can see that there's a new
page created with my name on it.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.230
So I'm just going to edit this.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:37.180
I have some text already in here,
I think.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:47.480
I can highlight this text and copy it
and paste it into the WYSIWYG field here.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:18.100
[Transcript missing]

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.200
So, I'm going to go to my
file and hit attach.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.300
And there's my attachment.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.200
When we save,
that turns into a link to my vCard file.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.500
So it's right in line
with the rest of the text.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.500
So let's show them a little bit
more of the cutting and pasting,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.940
because I think it's really one
of the powerful features of Teams.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.720
So you can cut and
paste from any web page,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.290
right?

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:46.800
Yes.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:47.220
Yeah.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.770
So let's go ahead and try another page
with maybe some richer content on there.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.390
OK.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.360
So I have here a Wikipedia page.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.700
About sheep.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.700
Bob Zuggal.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.700
Got it.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.360
And it's important here
because our company motto is,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.600
you know, some people are sharks,
some people are sheep.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.220
We want to be sheep.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.530
What I'm going to do here is
create a new entry called Sheep,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.500
a new page called Sheep.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.850
And so I can just take a bunch
of text out of this page.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:34.000
And I'll just copy that.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.170
And then select all this
text and just paste in

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.430
The Wikipedia entry.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.900
And it's possible Safari just froze.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.820
Uh-oh.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:54.100
[Transcript missing]

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.660
So perhaps we'll skip
that part of the demo.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.270
I think we'll skip that part.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.580
The idea is that all of the
information that you posted in

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.950
from Wikipedia would actually be
showing in there as well and look,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.160
really have all,
retain a lot of the rich text,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.280
as well as the image as well.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.670
So let's move on from that snafu
and go talk a little bit about tags.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.740
I see you guys are using tags in there.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.130
Can you maybe give us a little
ideas about how you're using tags

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.240
with the content inside of Bazooka?

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.240
Sure.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.520
Now the great thing about tags
is that in a lot of CMS systems

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.960
or a lot of other systems,
you're dealing with a folder structure.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.420
And that's a hierarchy that's defined
by some surly IT person somewhere

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.740
or maybe one of the founders.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.640
And so, you know, they decide what the
structure of your content is.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.640
And the kind of sucky thing about
folders is that you can only

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.740
put something in one folder.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.310
Whereas, you know,
when you're dealing with tags,

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.550
you can put things in as many buckets as
you want and anybody can tag stuff and

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.960
rearrange it and put in different things.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.010
And so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to go ahead

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.360
and click on my new bio entry.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.080
bio entry.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.760
And since this is a bio,
I know that there's already a bios tag.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.910
You probably want to log in.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.310
There you go.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.960
And since this is a bio,
I know that there's already a bios tag.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.120
You probably want to log in.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.520
There you go.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.090
So that will add me to the hot
list on the group home page.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.420
And so to get into a little
bit about how this works then,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.310
if I actually click
on this BIOS tag here,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.050
this will do a search and show me
everything that's in the system

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.200
that has that BIOS tag on it.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.480
And you can see all the tags
appear here on the right hand side.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.060
And I can actually click more
tags to narrow down my search.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.900
So I can look for just hot BIOS,
which is basically just me and about us.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.840
And for example,
I could look for spicy BIOS.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.280
Apparently Amanda's kind of spicy.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.640
Maybe a little curious
as to what else is spicy.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.780
Apparently there's a food
and spicy combination here.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.370
And so I want to check this out,
review of Casa Sanchez.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.200
That's a big burger.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.400
So this is actually a blog entry.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.720
And the question that
sometimes gets asked is why

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.760
do we have a blog and a Wiki?

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760
Because they operate in
a pretty specific way.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.620
They're both WYSIWYG.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.670
They both have these sort of
entities that you can edit in

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.510
real time and stuff like that.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.520
So what's the difference?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.290
Well, the difference is that a blog
is better suited to content

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.200
that grows stale over time.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.030
So when you're talking about
settings or when you're talking

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.550
about status or meeting notes,
news items,

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:46.800
things like that that matter less
after a week or two has gone by.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.990
And so that's kind of the
purpose and that's what we

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.620
use blog for is food reviews,
news items, stuff like that.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.600
And what I'm going to do here,
just because it looks cool and

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.930
it's really WYSI is I'm going to
remove the spicy tag from this.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.180
From this page,
so all I have to do is take this

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.990
and just drag it off the tag bar.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.990
It's gone.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.640
Tagging and untagging
stuff is incredibly easy.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.800
That encourages people
to tag more content.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.600
When they do that,
it's easier to find stuff.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.300
Let's go back to search and show
them how we're integrating our

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.900
tagging and text searching with RSS.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.640
It's a great way to get to the
information from outside of teams.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.940
As you know,
there's RSS support now in Leopard.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.600
There's more RSS support.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.640
There's support in Safari,
but there's also support in Mail.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.040
It allows you to have a way to
get notified when something gets

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.280
tagged or anything like that.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.150
Basically,
the way that this works is that

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.000
anything that is -- I don't
know what's going on here.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:06.480
Anything that's taggable is an RSS feed.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.510
This isn't good.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.080
So I'll go ahead and just keep
talking to this and hopefully

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.620
it'll show up at some point.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.590
Anything that you can tag,
anything that you can bring

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.850
up in the search results,
any combination of tags you

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.060
can bring up is an RSS feed.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.550
And that's actually available in apps
like Safari and mail and stuff like that.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:40.220
So I can see if anything
gets tagged as a bio,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:40.220
if anything gets tagged in that manner.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.930
So, one thing is, you know,
I already have this subscribed in mail.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.800
Now, of course,
the downside to this is that

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.770
the server doesn't seem running.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.200
It went to sleep.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:02.280
That's what you get for putting a
server on a PowerBook or a MacBook.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.460
At least it's not my problem.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.100
Oh, there we go.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.700
Excellent.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:16.190
So we can see here, if I update this,

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.560
Hmm, okay, that's not really working.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.990
Blame the Mail App team.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.620
The theory being that if you
add the bio tag to something

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.970
new or you create something new,
you can actually see it in

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.230
Mail.App or in any other RSS client.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.360
Hmm, okay, that's not really working.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.800
Blame the Mail App team.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.420
The theory being that if you
add the bio tag to something

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.770
new or you create something new,
you can actually see it in

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.960
Mail.App or in any other RSS client.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.820
So we'll go ahead and click on calendar.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.650
Of course I have to-- that's not good.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.800
You try and do something
that makes me log in here.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.890
I think you need to log in again.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.990
I think I'll restart Safari.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Good idea.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.130
This is why we aren't shipping yet.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.640
OK.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.970
And a login.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.590
There we go.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.390
Okay, one second.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.390
Michael,
can you talk about Calendar a little bit?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.560
Michael Hanna: Yeah,
so the difference here is, remember,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.400
this is a group calendar, right?

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.400
When it's working.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.790
This isn't the individual calendar,
this is the calendar that you're

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.400
actually sharing with the entire team.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:58.270
So you'll see the events when they
hopefully show up here in a second.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.700
You'll see that it has a lot
of the same functionality

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.820
that you expect out of iCal.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.510
The ability to create events,
the ability to invite folks,

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.700
and the ability to also just see things
as they're happening in real time,

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.700
if we can actually get it going there.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.370
Which we're going to try right now.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.200
And we're not going to,
maybe we'll skip the calendar piece.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.420
Is the server still asleep over there?

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.580
Did you restart the calendar server?

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.950
So while we're getting
the calendar together,

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:35.100
why don't we, so we talked a little bit
about Teams Directory as well.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.060
So one of the other things,
the applications that we're

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.570
shipping along with this,
which I was hoping

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.580
will be working better,
is Teams Directory.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.520
This is a Cocoa application.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.450
And John,
if you could actually go ahead and

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.750
fire up Teams Directory and show
how we actually start creating

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.960
new groups inside of a Zoogle.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.120
John Anderson: Okay.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.180
So I actually want to create a new group.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:59.080
As the new founder, I feel like we need a
viral marketing group.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.610
And so I'm going to go ahead
and set one of those up.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.240
And so you'd think it
would be fairly difficult,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.210
even through work with group manager,
as great of an app as it is,

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.600
this is something that we
can hand off to anybody.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.520
And oh, we've already got one.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:23.080
So I'll just create a new
bazoogle viral marketing.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.520
So I can just search for
some people and drag them in.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.460
I'll add myself, of course.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.780
And Michael, a few other people.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.280
Bertrand.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.030
And if I go into settings here,
there's this simple checkbox,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.340
enable teams for this group.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.220
So I can turn that on, hit save.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:50.170
I'll try that again here.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.510
So I'll turn on Teams for this group.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:07.820
So now I can see the home page
just by clicking on the link here.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.320
So there's our new home page.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:09.820
Excellent.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.290
Very simple.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.490
So do we want to try calendaring
one more time or are we done?

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.440
Let's try it again.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.610
Let's try it one more time.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.170
OK, so back into calendaring.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.740
It's really important to show this
because obviously we've built it

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.650
on top of iCal Server and we want
it to have a web-based front end.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.500
So we'll go ahead and log in here.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:51.300
[Transcript missing]

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.260
So you can see here,
this is our calendar for the week.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:58.310
And I'm going to talk a little bit into
what constitutes a Teams calendar versus,

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.210
say, a personal calendar.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.920
And this is stuff that pertains
to the team as a whole.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.370
You can think of this as something
that anybody in the team can edit it,

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.400
and anybody in the team can look at it.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.670
And you'll see here it
updates in real time.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.380
So you see some meetings move
as other people on the team are

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.260
actually moving the event around.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.160
And so that's all Ajax enabled.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.840
And there you can see
the GM move back a day.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.900
of course.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.400
And so this is kind of like a combination
almost of a calendar and a wiki.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.110
It's something that
anybody can go in and edit,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.640
and they can add these events,
and anybody can take them out.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.510
And as long as you have
access to the group,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.940
you can do that sort of thing.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.080
You're a GM party.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.670
The GM is moving back day for day here.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.020
So as long as we're slipping,
as long as our schedule is slipping,

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.700
I'm actually going to make a longer
World of Warcraft tournament.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.600
I think an hour is a little bit short.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.510
And so I'm going to make it cut into
my work day of another hour or so here.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.700
And lengthen it by an hour.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.990
So I've just changed that on the server.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.180
Very, very simple.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.540
No page refreshes, no settings,
anything like that.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.040
I can just take those
items and move them around.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.290
And for example,
if I mouse over any of these things,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:14.040
I can see these tool tips
with information on the event,

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.880
where it is.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.830
In this case, the GM party,
it doesn't have a location.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.690
So you can see some of
those things going on.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.230
And so the one thing I'm going to
do here is I'm actually going to--

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.220
I guess I'll move that another day.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:35.200
So I guess, fine,
as long as the GM is slipping,

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.880
I probably should just get
rid of this tournament.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.760
And so I showed-- just because
this is very demo-y and showy,

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.060
I'll go ahead and delete an event.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.200
I'll just hit the Delete key here.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:53.700
[Transcript missing]

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:06.500
[Transcript missing]

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:07.800
You pushed it too far.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.800
That would be why.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800
Okay.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.800
Well, we'll skip that part.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.230
You will be able to delete
events in the final product,

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.800
though.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.800
Excellent.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.550
So if we can go back to slides,
thank you very much, John, for the demo.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.480
So John actually doesn't
work for Bazookal,

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.400
he works for me.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.380
And he's one of our chief
engineers on the team site.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.860
We kind of want to make
a little fun of Web 2.0.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.500
But really the interesting thing
about this is we're actually

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.660
borrowing what I consider to be one
of the biggest memes out of Web 2.0,

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.090
which is that dynamic
interaction inside of web pages.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.660
People are starting to expect
a little bit more of elegant

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.390
interaction in web pages,
and that's what we're

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.090
building into Teams.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.290
So a little bit of the
ideas behind the product,

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.900
a little bit more of
what we're doing here.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:01.140
Obviously it's the Wiki.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.350
The first class citizen is the
Wiki that organizes everything.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.380
Next to that is the web blog.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.460
And then we've got the calendar.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.350
And underneath it is a whole set of
services that work with everything.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.820
So you've got tags, you've got RSS,
you've got search,

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.730
and then you've got the directory,
which is obviously open directory to give

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.720
you secure access to users and groups.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.940
As I go and talk a little bit
more about these features,

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.800
as opposed to how I pitched
this earlier this week,

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.950
I want to talk a little bit about
why we built these features.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.980
Because the reason we
built these is we see,

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.000
the reason we built Teams is we saw
a lot of how Apple was developing

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.210
software and how we were communicating.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:50.360
We saw problems there and Teams really
came as a direct response to that.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.150
Opportunities, not problems.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.610
So, let's talk about a couple
of the key features.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.860
Directory.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.560
You saw Teams directory,
it's a Cocoa application.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.030
What I've found in the server land,
when people have directories,

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.760
is they usually have homegrown
their own version of it.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.480
They usually have a web-based
version or they've done their own.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.030
And as we started to develop
iCal Server and Teams,

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.480
we realized we needed to have an
application which served a purpose of

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.110
serving that user I was talking about,
that admin user who was sitting there

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.950
and managing the infrastructure.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.220
And also we wanted it to be just
an elegant application because

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.770
you're going to be in here and
you use this application a lot

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.010
because you're dealing with people.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.190
So, that's what we did with,
that's what we did with Teams directory.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.280
Just some screenshots here.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.080
Obviously, it gives you access to the
people in your organization.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.880
And I think this is the primary
use case for Teams Directory,

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.360
is going in and finding someone.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.810
But it's not just the information,
it's also where they are.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.850
We made it really easy to attach
maps to this app inside of here,

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.320
so you can go and find that
person as well as where they sit.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.480
In addition to people,
we also are searching groups, teams.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.890
We're also searching locations,
we're also searching resources as well.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.820
And it's spunky, it's really fast.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.750
You go in there, you're in, you're out,
because we know that's

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.960
the primary use case.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.430
As you saw, also, it's a means for
creating different teams,

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.660
team sites.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.900
It's group management.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.470
The nice thing about this,
the thing I think is really important,

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:24.120
is that you don't need an
admin to create all this stuff.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.650
This is the -- we're empowering
the individual user to actually

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.960
go and create these groups.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.120
And the website, the team site,
is actually provisioned on the fly.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.240
There's no one changing
permissions anywhere.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.920
It's all done behind the scenes.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.970
And obviously,
you can also add other people into it,

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.180
as John was demonstrating.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.050
And again, and this is kind of funny,
this is where we actually

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.420
started with Teams Directory,
is we have these other resources

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.220
that we need to deal with,
projectors.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.950
You want to invite a
projector to a meeting.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.580
You need that for a calendar server.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.560
So this is actually
where we started with it.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.300
So other resources are in here,
whether it's a projector or a room.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.680
And like I said,
you can also easily add a

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.710
easily add maps to it as well.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.260
So that was Teams directory.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.970
Here's the big one, Wiki.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.870
So why did we decide to build this Wiki?

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:19.430
And the thing was, was at Apple,
Wikis were just appearing everywhere.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.050
There was no corporate mandate
to actually start using Wikis.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.550
They were just kept on showing up.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.450
So why is that?

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.580
You can say maybe it's engineers
wanting to be efficient,

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.240
but I would argue that it's people
just wanting to be able to collaborate.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.260
They want to be able to
share their information.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.140
So we saw that as,
we saw Wiki as sort of the organizing

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.600
principle around a lot of Teams,
the technology there.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.580
Wikis are accessible.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.920
They are via the browser,
and everyone's got a browser.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.800
Maybe you're looking at one right now.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.920
We want to encourage
people to collaborate.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.100
And the reason we made it WYSIWYG is
we want to make the bar extremely

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.450
low for actually adding new content.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.620
We want everybody to contribute,
because we know that the more

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.020
people that contribute to content,
the more valuable it becomes.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:11.610
So we want everyone in there adding
their own opinion and editing stuff.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:13.800
Really the goal is to create
a whole which is greater

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.040
than the sum of the parts.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.510
And again, WYSIWYG really gets us that.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.600
We love Wikipedia.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.450
Wikipedia is great.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.600
I use it 10 times a day and I'm
always finding out information.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.700
I'm shocked how much time people
are spending of their own time to

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.580
maintain this and make it look great.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.020
There's a problem with Wikipedia though.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:32:42.800
[Transcript missing]

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.140
This is my favorite feature about wikis.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.000
And I'm an engineer, so I'm a nerd.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.600
So it's really that wikis
are under version control.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.440
Standard feature in all wikis,
they never forget anything

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.590
that you actually submit.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.280
Every single change is there.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.450
Who did it because they logged in,
what they did, when they did it,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.880
and really the most
important thing in my mind,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.490
and this is sort of a
change for a lot of people,

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.270
is why they did it.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.500
You saw as John was adding content,
he was dutifully putting in comments.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.300
Those comments are kind
of an afterthought,

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.910
but when you're in an
organization with a lot of people,

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.190
those comments are the
context for the change.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.450
In Wikipedia,
I always go and read when there's news

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.290
pages that are updating with a hot story,
I go look at the changes because

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.990
that's really interesting too.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.470
So that's why we like the context,
and that's why we really

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.500
feature that comment.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.280
Right up there when you
click on the done button,

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.990
we want you to put a comment in
there so you can share what you

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.590
changed with the people that you're
sharing your information with.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:46.780
So weblog, weblog's technically not that
different under the hood to us.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.330
When you think about the difference
between a weblog page and a wiki

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.200
page really isn't that interesting.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.200
What's different is the social
conventions around weblogs.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.200
Weblogs are obviously organized by
time with the most recent post on top.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.100
They tend to be shorter
entries or sometimes not.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.200
They tend to be information that you
push and forget and it gets stale.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.200
That's okay.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.000
And there's a lot of,
at Apple there's a lot of people

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.200
who use it for status reports.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.370
I want to go there,
I want to look at what's

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.200
going on most recently,
right?

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.020
So that's why we have weblog as
a first class citizen inside of

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.170
Teams is we think people are going
to use it in different ways than

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.870
they're going to use the wiki pages.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.800
My other favorite feature.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.340
Tags.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:36.290
There's not really a good-- really this
came out of looking at a lot of the

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.300
web applications out there that a lot
of engineers and everybody are using,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:45.110
like Delicious, like Flickr,
and realizing that it's a great way

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.580
for people to organize information.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.510
We made tags, as you saw in the demo,
a first class citizen.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.130
It's one of these things again
about pushing the responsibility

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.940
for the content back to the people
that are putting it in there.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.690
We want the people who own the content
to be tagging their information,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.530
to be figuring out different
ways to slice and dice it,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.800
and we don't know what
you're going to do with this,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.540
but we're dying to see what happens.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.420
For us, some of the ideas we think
about are like Primal Workflow.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.190
You see the to review tag up there?

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.780
That's my tag that I use on content
that I want to look at later,

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.180
right?

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.990
So you can start to see that you start
to put interactions associated with tags.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:29.930
Remember also that wikis are flat.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.040
There's no file hierarchy in wikis.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.000
It's a completely flat name space.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.340
The other thing that wikis do,
I mean tags do,

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:41.000
is allow you to kind of give a hierarchy
to it and also organize organically

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.800
the structure of your content.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.000
And then, as you saw,
we also have the hot tag.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.100
The hot tag, which was inside,
I think we did in the demo, it actually,

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.070
what it does is it actually pushes
the information up to the front page.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.560
So that's kind of a magic tag.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.590
And my guess is, as we go out,
as you guys start to use it,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.230
as we continue to develop it,
there's going to be other magic

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:09.370
tags that we're going to do to give
you more flexibility within Teams.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:15.650
Calendar, again as I mentioned,
it's a group calendar, right?

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.080
This is where you put the milestones.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.900
This is where you put all
the other information about,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.900
you want to share with the group.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.450
Obviously,
we're just getting started with this,

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:31.500
but we really want this to be a
world-class web-based calendaring client.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.230
And then we have RSS.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:42.540
You can't have a Web 2.0
application without RSS,

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.380
obviously.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.120
What it allows us to do,
as you saw in the demo,

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.110
was allow you to share this
information that you have in

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.350
Teams that's constantly building up,
and you've got all this

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:58.610
different stuff in there,
and share it with other applications,

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:05.600
whether it's Mail, whether it's Safari,
Newswire, whatever.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:05.600
But what it allows you to
do is make your RSS reader.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.370
Because you're not sitting
in Teams all the time,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.680
surfing it and seeing what's changed.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.640
What you're doing is you're going
and you're defining a search,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.220
or any type of search,
to kind of map the stuff

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.370
out that you really,
really care about.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.040
So we think that any sort of news reader,
but also Mail RSS is a great

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.450
place to actually go and do that.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.880
Any search that you can
build inside of Teams,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.650
you can export as RSS.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:36.090
Also, obviously, with web logs,
you can do RSS RSS as well.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.700
Search, I really hope you got tons
of information eventually.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.640
There's a huge amount of
content inside of Teams.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.950
Like I said, we want everyone to
be able to contribute.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:51.090
So search is really
designed to be simple,

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.000
so that people can go and slice
and dice it in different ways.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.090
Obviously with tags,
you can mix and match tags

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.250
to get an information.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.260
You can filter.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:01.580
You can sort and do everything
that you need to do there.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.380
And text-based searching
is exactly what you expect.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.930
It searches all the text
in Teams and gives you the

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.360
results that you saw a demo.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:15.480
So I'm going to finish
up with where I started.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.840
The question was, how do you work?

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.180
And again, as I said at the beginning,
Teams is something brand new.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.040
I think of Teams as a set of tools.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.900
We're not trying to tell
you how to do your work.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.480
What we want to do is give
you tools to build cool stuff,

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.470
to build things that you can
use inside the organization.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.800
What we're interested in this seed
is to get a lot of feedback from you,

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.160
because what we want to know is how
are you going to work with this?

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.260
What else do you need?
