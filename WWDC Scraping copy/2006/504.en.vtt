WEBVTT

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.800
So we're here to talk about some new
technologies in Leopard Server and

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.190
Leopard Client related to calendaring.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.410
And I want to first talk a
little bit about what we've

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.830
done with Mac OS X in the past.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.870
Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server related to
collaboration technologies in the past.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.430
So, we've got a great mail client.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.320
We have a great mail server
with CyberSciMap and PostFix.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.040
We've always had the Finder,
which was able to support numerous

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.690
file services such as AFP,
SMB, and WebDAV.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.200
With instant messaging, we support AIM.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
Last year with Tiger,
we added Jabber support to

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.680
both the client and the server.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.600
We've got Safari,
which is a great web browser.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840
Apache for serving up the web content.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.690
And starting with Leopard,
we now have Teams,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.700
which serves up a bunch
of interesting content.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
But we've always had this hole
in the space of calendaring.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.590
We had a great client,
but it didn't really

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.330
have a server to talk to,
and it didn't really have the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.700
collaborative features built into it.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.940
And Leopard is changing that.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.010
We're adding iCal Server.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350
So I've been introduced to
you about four times now,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
but I'm introducing it one more time.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.160
So I want to talk about
four major things.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.540
I want to talk a little
bit about the features.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.980
I want to talk about the
standards it's based on.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.350
And talk a little bit about the
integration with Mac OS X Server,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.720
and then talk about how
we can scale the server.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.300
So starting off with features,
most of you, I'm sure,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.700
use calendar servers of some sort,
whether it's Exchange or Meeting Maker or

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.770
any of the other servers out there.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.160
iCal Server and iCal support all of the
features you would expect us to support.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.070
So we support multiple calendars,
which allows you to organize your

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.060
calendars into different categories.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.500
Of course, you can invite people.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.400
It would be uninteresting
if you couldn't.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.050
You can browse free/busy,
find out when people are busy so

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.160
you can find the proper time for
scheduling a meeting or an event.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.320
And of course,
you can invite rooms and resources.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.080
So if you can't invite a room,
it can be very difficult,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.400
especially in Seattle,
where it rains a lot.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.640
Resources allow you to do things
like invite projectors to a room.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.560
If you've got a projector that
moves around from room to room.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.400
And we have full open
directory integration,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.180
which means that all of the users
that are in your directory system

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.220
already will just automatically
work with the new iCal Server.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:04:29.100
[Transcript missing]

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.920
Excellent, excellent.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.800
Well, first I'd like to thank
you all for coming.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.560
I'm Mike Hay.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.360
This is Scott Adler.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.080
We'd like to show you some of the
new things we've been doing in iCal.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.070
Before we show you the new stuff,
let me just run through iCal for those

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.060
of you who might not have seen it before
or may not be comfortable with it.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.300
iCal is Apple's calendar app,
ships on every Mac, ships with the OS,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.460
best known for its bright colors
and its multiple calendars.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.400
As you can see over here on the left,
we have multiple calendars.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.720
We actually have groups of calendars.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.760
We'll get back to that in a second.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.010
You can see how all the different
events show up in different views.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.620
That's not a very interesting week.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.720
Got different days.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.380
Let me go back to this month
because that's what you care about.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.030
There we go.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.720
So we can do banners.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.320
We can do all the stuff
you'd probably expect.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.480
If I drill down to any given day,
you get a nice concise view of the day.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.000
If I drill down to, let's say, any event,
we actually allow a lot of information

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.530
to be placed on the events.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.330
So we can have a title, a location,
as abstract as you want that to be,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.320
date and time, obviously,
which calendar it's in,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.430
and driving directions,
which I pasted in from an email.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.590
So we can have a title, a location,

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.090
Let me go back to the
month view for a second.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.410
So iCal is very easy to use
and it's had a lot of success.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.980
You can very easily change your calendar.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.660
If I decide, for instance,
I want to do these

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.000
chores a week in advance,
I just drag and drop,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.500
and the event moves,
and the time changes.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.310
It's very easy.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.860
I can also show different calendars.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.140
I can kind of wean down to just
one calendar view or the other.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.840
The interesting thing,
and you might have asked yourself before,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.940
why does Apple put "I"
in front of everything?

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.500
Well, in our case,
we can actually tell you.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.400
We are the Internet Calendar app.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.850
So you can actually publish your
calendars to the Internet or

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.100
subscribe to other person's calendars.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.670
Let me go to Safari for a moment
and show you how that works.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.340
So if you have a calendar that you'd
like to share with other people,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.950
you can very simply
put it up on a website,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.680
just have a link that
other people can click on.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.620
And when they click that,
it will launch that URL straight

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.070
into iCal and you can very
easily subscribe to it.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.620
I get a chance to rename it
if I'd like to rename it.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.850
I can strip out things that
I might not want in my calendar,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.800
say "OK," and then it shows up over
here in the calendar list with the rest.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.380
I can go through.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.080
And I can change the color if I want.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.310
I'm picky, so I always do that.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:16.890
I can get rid of these other calendars,
so you can see just this calendar,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.890
and this shows us the moon phases,
which is kind of an interesting thing.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.680
So, more interesting to this
crowd is obviously CalDAV.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.280
We've built the CalDAV support
right into iCal.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.770
So, CalDAV looks just like
everything else in iCal,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.850
works just like everything else in iCal.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.240
Calendars from the same account
are grouped together so that

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.980
you can organize them better,
but otherwise the appearance and

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.850
the behavior is pretty much the
same as everything else in iCal.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.440
So, now that you're a little
bit more familiar with iCal,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.840
let's take a closer look at the iCal
features that have to do with CalDAV.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.860
Scott?

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.860
Okay.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.860
So, let's go to my account here,
and I'll go to my work account.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.010
So, you saw Mike's account have all
the CalDAV information in it,

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.920
so, and you might have seen some of
this in Red's demo yesterday if

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.090
you were at the server overview,
but we've added this accounts pane

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.860
because you could have multiple
CalDAV accounts on different servers,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.860
and I'm going to use
my Apple account here.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.860
And what we're going to do right now
is to use the open directory server.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.860
So, all I need to do is add my
username and my password.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.860
And I'm going to use
my Apple account here.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:16.860
And what we're going to do right now
is to use the open directory server.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.960
And once I hit tab,
it's going to go out to open directory,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.950
get my full server user address,
and then in the background it's

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.860
going to start loading everything
and pulling down all my calendars.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.860
So, what it's actually done right now,
this account didn't know anything about,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.840
this machine didn't know
anything about the CalDAV server,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.860
it just had the open directory
server in my open directory list.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.360
So, it now went,
detected all my calendars,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.050
and you can see I have a
whole bunch of calendars here

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.690
that I have up on the server,
and I've already have events in

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.860
them because I've been using this.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.860
This is my work account.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.860
So, I have my, and I have all these
different things grouped.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.300
So, one of the things that we can
do here is that I can create

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.860
new calendars on the server.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.860
So, we've modified this so it knows the
difference between local and accounts.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.860
So, I'm going to say I want to make
a new calendar up on the server.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.850
And I can create a new calendar and
I can call this WAC demo calendar.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.860
And I can create another
one and I can call this.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.850
Meetings with developers.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.850
And I can add things to them.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.860
So, if I'm going to make a meeting here,
I could just create something.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.160
I'm going to have a meeting with
some developer who is not going to,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.860
who's going to still be here on Friday,
let's say.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.860
So, I can make a new meeting here.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.910
And I can also just,
if I don't like these,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.850
I can just delete these calendars.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.860
And it's all just going up on the server.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.860
And that's what you'd expect.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.720
That's the thing about CalDev
is everything in here is

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.850
exactly what you'd expect.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.750
It's just stored off on the server.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.860
So, the big thing about this
is it's all running on DAV.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.850
And since iCal already had
some DAV support in it,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.850
we just built on top of that.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.630
And it's all using HTTP.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.860
You might have heard
something about that earlier.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.840
So, it's very well understood protocols.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.860
So, that's really cool.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.860
And I have this on my work machine.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.860
But let's say I go home.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.250
If I go to my home machine,
the important thing here is that

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.860
I just can do the same account setup.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.840
At home, let's say this is Apple work.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.450
And...

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.730
here, and then just my password,
and does the exact same thing, goes out,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.540
detects my calendars,
sees the new ones I created,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.960
including the WWC demo.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.590
It knows the colors that
I've set on the calendars,

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.590
all the changes.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.540
So it's really important that you get
the exact same data in both places

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.450
and you don't need to use sync.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.510
You just, it's,
the truth is up on the server.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.850
So that's the big thing with
CalDev is that you have one

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.450
place for all of your data.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.820
You could also get to this
from other clients too,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.260
but we're showing how this works in iCal.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.680
So that's great,
and you might be wondering why did

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.350
it take two of us to demo CalDev.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.010
Well,
that's because one of the great features

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.920
of CalDev is the scheduling spec.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.680
So there's a draft spec for
scheduling support in CalDev,

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.710
and we've implemented that spec.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.820
So I can make a, let's say I want to do a
lunch meeting with somebody,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.990
I don't know who,
so let's go to this and let's

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.080
say I'm going to do lunch here,
and I'm going

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.230
Lunch, and we'll go to my favorite place,
the Zuni Cafe.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.420
Don't all go there
because I like it so much.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.560
Oops.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.240
Yeah, that's fine.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.040
So I'm going to go to lunch,
and let's see who I'm going to invite.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.980
And I'll invite Mike.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.500
That's great.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.040
And it'll go off to the server,
and it'll ask for a free busy report.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.460
And if you see here, I can zoom in on it,
there's a little slash

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.080
next to Mike's name,
which means he's not available.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.070
So that's kind of a bummer,
but I really want to

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.000
go to lunch with Mike.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.620
So I'll just move this to tomorrow,
and I'll see that he's available.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.620
And then all I have to do
is send the invitation,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.420
and the server takes care of the rest.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.060
Great.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.570
So let's take a look at the
invitation that you receive when

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.180
somebody invites you to a meeting.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.220
Go back to my machine.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.920
And--

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.420
What we'll notice if we show the
doc is that iCal has this little

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.080
notification that tells me there's
something that needs my attention.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.450
There's also a little indication over
here and little indication over here that

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.360
shows me that there's something there.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.750
Let me take a look at
those notifications.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.140
Now I see that there's a
lunch invitation from Scott,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.150
and things are a little busy,
so let me turn off a couple of

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.410
these calendars so I can see a
little bit better what's going on.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.600
Luckily, lunch does not conflict with
my drinks with the iCal team.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:45.370
Let me go back here, click on that.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.340
Let's look at that in the week view.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.840
So you can see in the invitation
in the inspector over here,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.620
I can choose to accept
the meeting or refuse.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.320
I'll accept.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.870
I can choose which calendar
I'd like this to go into.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.640
I'm actually going to put
this into the iCal calendar.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.090
You'll also notice that the
event blocks out space in my

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.500
calendar so I can tell where or
when this event would take place.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:14.500
So I'll just go ahead and accept this.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.260
And you see it's added to my calendar,
the notification goes away,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.000
works pretty smoothly.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.390
Okay,
so if we go to back to my account here.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.110
and you'll see I also get a
notification that Mike's replied.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.030
I can click on this event
and it brings it up in the

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.400
inspector and it says that yes,
Mike has replied and all I have to do

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.890
is just say okay and it gets rid of
the notification and there we go we

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.470
just have to meet tomorrow for lunch.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.530
There's a couple more subtle
clues that you can use.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.770
If you want to stay in one view or
another you can see there's a little

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.680
check mark next to the person there
that shows that all the attendees

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.600
have replied and you can see there are
different icons depending on the status

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.540
that show up over here in the inspector.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.440
Let's go to a more real world example.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.290
I'm sure many of you in a work
environment will actually not

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.170
just invite one person to lunch,
you'll actually create a meeting

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.480
with a lot of different people.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.280
So let's turn a couple of these
back on so I know what I'm

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:17.320
doing and let me schedule a
dinner with the whole iCal team.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.630
Since we're all up in the city
this will be kind of novel.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:21.630
So we'll go in and

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.650
Make a dinner event.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.380
I'm not really sure
where we're going to eat,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.820
so I'll leave that blank for now.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.540
And since there are many
people I want to invite,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.900
let me just show you our people picker.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:38.560
As Scott mentioned earlier,
we're integrated with Open Directory,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.450
so I can just go here,
and I get a list of everybody

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.550
who's on our Open Directory server.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.260
And then in iCal,
I can simply go through and

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:48.260
drag people into the meeting.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.900
and they'll get added one by one.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.800
And you'll notice as Mike's adding them,
they've got a little

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.680
spinning cursor next to them,
which is them checking the free/busy,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.680
and then it'll go away if they're
available or if they weren't available.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:22.100
[Transcript missing]

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.200
I'll get an invitation and I can see all
the people on the team who are invited.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.760
I can see Mike organized it
and I'll just move it into,

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.250
I'll say I'll accept this and I'll put
it into my meals calendar and reply.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.570
So following on the theme of this
is a more real world example,

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.150
in the time that it took Scott to reply,
I've actually called the restaurant,

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.270
figured out where we're going to go.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.910
Go back to my machine, just for kicks.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:57.010
Called the restaurant,
figured out where we're going to go.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:57.010
We're going to go to Buca di Beppo.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.770
And we've got a reservation and they
told me on the phone that they won't

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.960
actually seat us until everyone's there.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.570
So let me just add a note here.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:19.090
Maybe we need a spell
checker in the notes field.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.590
And I'll send that out.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.800
And now everyone who I've invited,
as you notice here,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.490
the icons have all changed.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.740
Let me zoom in a little bit.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.910
To show that I've sent an update.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.920
So everyone now has an update
waiting for them to tell them that

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.080
the meeting has changed slightly.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.440
So if you go back to my home calendar,
you'll see I get an

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.980
update to the meeting,
and also over here in yellow,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.940
all the things that have been
updated are highlighted for me.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.860
So I can see if there
are new attendees added,

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.070
we'll get that.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:18:39.300
[Transcript missing]

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.700
So what I wanted to show you,
just in closing here,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.300
was I can even subscribe to my
calendar from my Tiger machine.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:52.290
So over here,
I happen to have the URLs to the server.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.210
And I can just go in with
the existing version of iCal.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.340
and just like the other
calendar that I subscribe to,

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:09.700
I can rename it if I like,
I can strip things out if I wanted to.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.340
But as you see,
I can access these calendars that are

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.600
up on the CalDAV Server even from older
clients or from other clients that

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.890
simply support publication and subscribe.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.850
So we think this is going
to be a really big deal.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.500
There's one more thing
we wanted to mention,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.820
which is in Steve's
talk yesterday morning,

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.770
he mentioned that
there's a to-do service.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.820
There's also a full event service that
goes along with that to-do service.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:40.600
If we go back to my home calendar here,
one of the things that we have is

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.860
that this entire API that lets you
get to all of our calendar data,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.010
so the calendar store framework,
lets you get to all the data that

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.660
people currently have on their machines,
and also it'll let you get to all the

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.530
CalDev data that people are downloading
when they connect to their server.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.190
That data will be available just
like everything else on your system,

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.520
and there's great APIs for you guys
to build applications for with these.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.720
We use it internally.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.490
We use it for mail, you saw,
with all the to-do features,

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.260
and also the new calendar widget.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:14.050
If I bring up this,
it has another pane here that shows

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.120
all of my upcoming events here.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.970
So this is...

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.380
and if you notice these events are
things that are up on the CalDAV server.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.730
Some of them might be local too,
but it's just the way the calendar

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.310
widget shows it shows everything for me.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:39.980
So there's a session on this
today at 3:30 in the Presidio,

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.190
so please come to that session
and thank you very much.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.190
Back to you Chris.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.190
Thanks Chris.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.390
Great demo.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.900
Do you guys actually have two
machines that work when you're... or

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.090
do you guys have to work like that?

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.800
So I want to talk about
standards a little bit.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.000
One of the things we try to be very,
very careful about with

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.340
Mac OS X Server is that we don't
use proprietary technologies.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.580
We like to use open standards.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.440
And if you look at some of
the services in 10 Server,

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.160
it's very clear that we've been
doing a very good job of that.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.400
So of course,
we adopted a standard for calendaring.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.120
There have been attempts to
create standards in the past.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.320
Probably the most famous one
is Calendar Access Protocol.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.540
And it's sort of the older,
ill-behaved brother of CalDAV, I guess.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.030
It just never really grew up.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.180
Didn't really get along
well with other people.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.120
Just kind of stunted.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.350
Problem with it is that it tried
to do everything from scratch.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.750
It created this very,
very complex protocol.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.280
Maybe one or two people adopted it.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.860
I'm not sure if anybody ever adopted it.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.280
And this lasted for
like six or seven years.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.560
So it was not good.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.810
So we looked at that and decided that
really wasn't where we wanted to go.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.060
CalDAV, on the other hand,
is built on top of a bunch of

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.750
protocols that already exist.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.200
And that's a good thing.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.540
So here are some of the
protocols it's built on top of.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.500
You'll notice that all of these
things have RFCs attached to them.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.220
iCalendar, that's the file format
that describes events.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.120
iTip is an extension to iCalendar
that adds the ability to do

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.540
things like invite people,
just to the data format.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.020
HTTP, probably the most popular
protocol in the world right now.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:26.200
WebDAV, which was designed for allowing
collaborative document editing in HTTP,

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:32.730
has also been used for other things,
such as file servers, like at .mac.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.520
And what it basically does is it
adds kind of a data model to WebDAV.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.230
It adds collections,
which are the equivalent of

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.840
directories in a file system.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.220
Gives you a couple of new methods.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.180
You can copy files between directories,
move files between directories.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.420
And really importantly,
it adds metadata to those files.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.120
So you can attach metadata,
which is actually really important when

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.480
it comes to trying to do calendaring.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.900
And a couple of other lesser
known standards are the

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.600
WebDAV access control protocol.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.210
So that's what we use for
providing access controls on all

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.920
of the events in the calendar.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:08.500
And there's another WebDAV standard
called Delta V which is

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.680
their version control.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.940
We just stole one of their methods,
which didn't steal.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.760
CalDAV takes one of their methods,
which is a report method for allowing

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.140
you to do queries against calendar.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.400
So anyway,
we took all of these standards,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.640
which are all very solid standards,
well tested, well used,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.560
put them all together,
added a little bit more to them,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.110
and came up with CalDAV.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.030
CalDAV adds just really
a little bit more.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.590
It adds make calendar method.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:37.900
So that's a method that tells the server,
please create me a calendar collection.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.000
Adds a schedule method,
which is just a method that says,

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.540
I'd like to create a meeting
and send it off to people.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.480
And with the addition of this and
then some semantics for where these

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.240
things go and how they get passed
around inside the WebDAV repository,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.180
you end up with CalDAV,
which is built on top of a very,

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.890
very solid foundation
of existing standards.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.620
Here's a protocol stack.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.990
So HTTP at the bottom.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.780
Then you've got webDAV on top of that.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.080
iCal under the file
format that we're using.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.200
iTip provides a little bit of
the scheduling sauce we need.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.270
And then CalDAV on top of that.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:19.700
And then off to the side is
LDAP because iCal Server is completely

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:19.700
integrated with Open Directory or LDAP.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.020
So how does it work?

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.240
It's not that complicated.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.520
It's maybe a little more
complicated than five bullets.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.360
But basically,
when a user wants to invite

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.280
somebody to a meeting,
they have an inbox and an outbox.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.560
And these are basically
just directories in WebDAV.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.480
So if I want to invite
somebody to a meeting,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.050
my client will drop a
request into my outbox.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.260
The server will pull
that out of the outbox,

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:50.560
look through the list of attendees,
and then make a copy of that event,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.460
and fan it out to each of
the attendees' inboxes.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.540
At that point,
the client on the attendees

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.480
machine notices there's
something new in their inbox.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.000
They pick it up,
show the event to the end user.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.740
The end user says, yes, I'll attend.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.600
No, I don't want to attend.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.280
I'll decide later.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.860
And when they're done with that,
their client puts that

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.660
event into their outbox.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.960
Server notices something
new in that outbox,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.020
picks it up,
sees that it's a reply to the originator,

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.960
puts a copy of that event into
the inbox of the originator.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:30.120
The originator's client sees that,
picks it up, updates the original event

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.590
with the attendees' status.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.160
It's all very simple, isn't it?

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.520
And then additionally,
users can be set up to auto-reply.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.260
So some people like to have
their calendars auto-reply if

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.720
they've got time available.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.680
Rooms and resources have
to be done this way.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.510
So basically, a room will always reply
yes if it's available,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.480
if it's not being
managed by somebody else.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.080
Somebody else?

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:59.780
I want to show you a little bit about,
or a little bit of the file layout.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:25:59.780
So,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.720
Like I said, this is all web-dev based,
so these really are just file

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.320
directories and files on the file system.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.070
So, with iCal Server we start off
with a calendar collection that

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.340
contains three collections.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.400
One that contains users calendars,
one that contains group calendars,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.440
and one that contains resources.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.150
So,
kind of diving into the user calendar,

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.030
you'll see three users here: Cyrus,
Chris, and Wilfredo.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.440
And in my calendar collection,
I have two calendars.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.480
I've got a work calendar
and a home calendar.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.140
Now those calendars are
actually just another directory.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.850
There's nothing really
that special about them.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.580
But inside of them are
very special things,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.500
and those are the events.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.680
And I've got two events in my calendar.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.370
And these events are just
iCalendar files or ICS files,

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.400
the same files that iCal's
been using since the beginning.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.250
And kind of a key point to all of this
is you notice an HTTP URL at the top,

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.540
right above event number one.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.340
Because we're using web dev,
which is based on HTTP,

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.370
every single event is
addressable by a URL.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.160
So even if you're not building
a full calendar client,

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.370
you can still do some pretty interesting
things just knowing that you can

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.120
get to anything with a unique URL.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.400
Groups are the same structure.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.000
A group will have a calendar.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.400
Groups also have members.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.710
So in this case,
the software group calendar

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.360
is accessible by me and Cyrus.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.290
We can both read and write that calendar.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.060
This is useful for when
you're dealing with projects.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:28.330
And resources,
this is where we put the calendars for

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:36.310
things like rooms and projectors and
other things that don't talk in meetings.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.900
So why did we choose Kite CalDAV?

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.160
There are a few reasons.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.750
We actually started looking at
building a calendar server a little

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.620
while back and put a bunch of
effort into designing a calendaring

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.720
protocol that we wanted to be open.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.010
We were going to, as Apple,
try to create a protocol and push

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.960
it out to the world as a standard.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.030
It actually got fairly
far along with that,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.940
and very strange, it was based on WebDAV,
included inboxes and outboxes,

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.460
used the iCalendar format,
and then we were probably about a

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.700
third of the way through this thing,
and then this thing CalDAV popped up.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.440
It looked just like
what we were working on,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.140
so the timing was absolutely perfect.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.310
We decided rather than go it alone,
we would jump on board with

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.340
people designing CalDAV.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.330
Second thing is, as I mentioned,
we like to keep things as

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.480
standard in Mac OS X server.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.480
CalDAV's totally open.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.120
It's run being run through
the IETF as an open source.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.780
Open standard.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.950
Third thing is that it's being adopted.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.870
The worst thing to do is to create a new
standard and nobody comes to the party.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.300
Not something we wanted to have happen.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:57.860
We don't want our product to work just
iCal server and iCal working together.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.500
We want our product to be able to work
with all the different clients out there,

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:05.710
numerous servers out there,
so it's important that

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.310
it's being adopted.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:13.140
We also noticed it was being adopted.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.800
There are people already adopting this.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.040
So Oracle's announced that
they're adopting CalDAV.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.310
Novell with their Hula project
has announced that they're

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.890
going to be adopting CalDAV.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.930
So it seemed like everybody
who would in their right mind

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.240
adopt an open standard did,
so we decided that would

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.330
be a good thing to do.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.900
Then also the future is being
designed into this protocol.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.160
This is not a protocol that's
like very tightly coupled.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.040
It's actually very loosely coupled,
and you can see that based

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.400
upon all of the different
protocols that are involved.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:54.050
One example of this is a group of
the people involved in CalDAV a month

00:29:54.050 --> 00:30:00.240
or two ago did an experiment where
they allowed free busy information

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.400
to be seen between different
servers from different companies.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.230
And so what this allows
in this experiment is for

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:11.400
somebody from Microsoft,
for example, to invite me to a meeting,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.400
and while they're inviting me,
see my free busy.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.760
That's a pretty important thing,
especially in the university world

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.290
where you guys are definitely
a lot more open about letting

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.400
people see free busy information.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.400
And the experiment went well.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400
It wasn't all that difficult
to get the thing working,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.200
and there's actually a technical
committee who's working on completing

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.400
this and making it part of the standard.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.180
And the last thing is that CalDAV is
being designed by some people

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.400
who are extremely well organized.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.400
A lot of standards are
kind of grassroots.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.400
Efforts by people who are
trying to go through the IETF.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.390
They're not very organized.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.380
They get disorganized.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.390
Things fall apart.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400
One guy becomes a bad guy.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.340
The good guys all quit.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.400
And that sort of thing.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.400
CalDAV doesn't really have that problem.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.750
It's being designed primarily by a
group of people who are members of

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.400
an organization called CalConnect.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.350
And CalConnect is doing a great job
of getting the standard defined and

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.400
then pushing it over to the IETF.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400
So they're fast tracking that way.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.400
And they avoid a lot of the
problems you have with IETF.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.590
And to speak about CalConnect,
I'd like to invite Dave Thewlis,

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.400
who is the executive
director of CalConnect.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:32.490
Thank you.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.260
Yesterday I couldn't
figure out how to use this,

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:39.010
so I was technology
challenged from the start.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.910
As Chris said,
I'm the Executive Director of CalConnect,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:43.910
which is the calendaring
and scheduling consortium.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.620
And I'll talk just a little bit about
what it is and what we're about,

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.460
and then I'm going to go into a
little bit more detail about the

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.740
things that we're actually doing.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.820
CalConnect is an information
technology consortium.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.730
It is actually a 501c3 nonprofit.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.180
We tend to think of it,
or I tend to think of it,

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.220
as a partnership between
developers and customers.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.570
We have a variety of
different types of members,

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.490
as you'll see,
but it's a very collegial organization.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.900
And people who are actually developers
from vendors or other organizations that

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.630
are developing calendar applications,
and people from customers and users

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.870
that are actually users of these things,
are working together to help evolve

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.980
the specifications and help do
interoperability testing and such things.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.150
Our mission, although it has a lot
of fancy words in it,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.300
boils down to the fact that
we are dedicated to driving

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.720
interoperability between different
calendaring and scheduling systems.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.760
To that end, we develop requirements.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.180
We develop requirements and
use cases for standards.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.180
We help to evolve changes to
standards to support calendaring.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.580
We also provide a place where work
on the specifications can happen

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.330
between individuals and organizations,
and then the specification can

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.270
be furthered into the IETF or
conceivably another standards body,

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.060
if that's the appropriate
thing to do with it.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:04.420
We definitely conduct interoperability
testing either between existing

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.670
systems or interoperability testing
against the RFCs to ensure that

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.170
the specifications are done correctly.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.180
And that the specifications
are properly implemented.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.700
And in a sense,
what we're trying to do is to push

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.020
the industry towards interoperability.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.150
Calendaring up to now,
especially in organizations,

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.180
has largely been a case
of individual islands.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.180
Some proprietary server and the
clients associated with that.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.320
So you can do calendaring
within your organization,

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.180
but you can't do it between
your organization and another.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.140
Frequently, even if it's the same system,
and very definitely if

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.180
it's different ones.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:41.180
And our goal is to make sure that,
calendaring systems can interoperate

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:46.090
and that calendaring for
individual people can interoperate.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.150
As far as who's involved in CalConnect,
calendaring vendors such as,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.520
Chris mentioned Oracle and Novell,
both of whom are members.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.800
Academia,
many major universities that are

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.420
heavily involved in calendaring are
now members of the organization.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.130
Commercial companies,
we're starting to get membership

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.690
from organizations such as Boeing.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:11.310
Open source developers,
governmental entities, NGOs, individuals.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:16.310
This is an incomplete slide,
but it does show many of the members

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:20.160
and as was announced yesterday,
and I was here to welcome

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.420
Apple to CalConnect.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.820
Now the reality is that Apple has been
a member of CalConnect since January,

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:30.600
has been heavily involved in work on
the CalDAO standard and other evolving

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.870
work that's going on within CalConnect.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:37:16.100
[Transcript missing]

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.570
Chris alluded to the Free/Busy
proof of concept demo.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.160
This was conducted by CalConnect.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.770
And it was actually
about three weeks ago.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.600
What we demonstrated was collection
of Free/Busy data from seven

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.470
different calendaring systems,
which included, as it happened,

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:39.430
Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Notes,
and several CalConnect-- sorry,

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.880
CalDAV implementations.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.080
The core of this was a Free/Busy
aggregator based on CalDAV.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.590
It was a CalDAV implementation
from beadwork,

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.000
which is Rensselaer Polytech's open
source implementation of CalDAV.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.600
And then CalDAV proxies with connectors
to non-CalDAV proprietary servers,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.480
such as the Domino's server
and the Exchange server.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.700
In fact, Boeing provided the connector
for the Exchange server.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.080
And IBM provided the connector
for the Notes server.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.740
So we were able to draw Free/Busy data
from these seven different servers,

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.490
one of which was Google Calendar,
and display it all in a summary

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.080
through a web interface.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.040
And being able to go on that
then to start scheduling data.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.000
And this was in response to a challenge,
actually, from another standards

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.520
organization called the Open Group.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.420
One of their members, Boeing,
was desperate for some way to do

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.470
Free/Busy analysis across people in
about 2,000 member organizations,

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.180
member partner companies.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.910
They're spread all over the world.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.230
And they figured that they lose an
enormous amount of time just trying to

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.180
figure out when everybody's available
for a meeting or a conference call.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.800
So they didn't even care whether they
could do automated scheduling if they

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.660
could just do the Free/Busy lookup.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.440
And all of that work is in open source.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.140
That will all be made available by
Rensselaer Polytech for anyone to

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.770
pick up and work on if they want.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.840
I mentioned our technical committees.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.910
Right now we have eight
active technical committees.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:11.640
They're working on authentication
and related to that the discovery

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.640
issues of being able to figure out
what somebody's calendar ID is if

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.200
they're not on your own server.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.950
CalDAV, which is,
and Chris alluded to this also,

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:26.500
CalDAV is directly working on providing
use cases and requirements for the

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.090
specifications that are then being
developed by the primary developers

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.890
of the specs that will then go as
the CalDAV submissions into the

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:38.200
IETF and all three of the primary
authors are active in CalConnect

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:43.200
and active in the CalDAV technical
committee plus some other people.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:47.550
The event publication technical committee
is working on extensions to iCalendar

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:50.290
to support real event publication.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.370
We're talking about things like
concerts where there's a lot of

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.200
additional information you would
like to carry along with an event

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.200
and that kind of information varies
depending upon the kind of event it is.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.190
What you'd want to provide for a
baseball game would differ from a

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:12.200
rock concert would differ from a
speech being given at a university.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.220
So, and native iCalendar doesn't provide
enough flexibility and enough granularity

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.200
to describe these kinds of things.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.530
So they're working on what will
be submitted very shortly now

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.200
to the IETF as a specification
for an extension to iCalendar.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.910
TC Freebusy is the technical committee
that put together the demo that we talked

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.200
about and is going to be working on
expanding that demo to include a new one.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.100
We're expanding that demo to include
all of the vendors that are members

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.650
of CalConnect and some others will
be redoing that demo at our next

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.200
roundtable which I'll mention shortly.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.960
The IOP test committee of course simply
develops the interop testing events and

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:49.200
standard scripts and things like that
which we make available on our website.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.670
We have a technical committee in
the mobile area which is working

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.180
on being able to do calendaring
into mobile devices and we're not

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.200
talking about synchronization,
well we're talking about

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:58.200
synchronization here of course.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.180
One of the problems with the sync
being that it's not content sensitive

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.200
so you can happily sync something
that your phone can't deal with.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.200
But real calendaring onto
mobile devices in the future.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.580
Real time which is working on
things like the protocols that are

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:18.200
actually required to do things like
synchronous Freebusy determination.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:24.560
And the use case technical committee
which is primarily involved in developing

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.200
the use cases that will be part of
building the specification system.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.860
So in fact the specifications when
done actually can be used to implement

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:37.200
things that meet the requirements
that people actually needed in their

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.200
calendaring systems when they have them.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.200
And then I mentioned two
TCs that have just finished.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.030
One which worked on proposed
changes to time zone,

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.320
the time zone specifications and one
proposed changes to recurrence as

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.590
they currently exist in iCalendar
to simplify these things somewhat

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.800
and make them more implementable.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:00.550
I mentioned I was going to make a
proposal for people to get involved with

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.400
us and we have a small organization.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.440
It's relatively new.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.720
It's about 18 months old.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:10.340
We are growing and we need help.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.620
We need more people that are actively
involved in doing things such as

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:18.250
helping to define the requirements,
making sure that we have the voices

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:23.300
from different kinds of organizations,
from different developers,

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.820
from different types of users.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.000
And the points that I make here,
the reason to get involved in

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.990
CalConnect is simply that you
can help shape the evolution of

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:35.230
calendaring and both the specifications
and eventually the products,

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.700
identifying real world
requirements and use cases.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.010
If your organization has
needs that you're not sure

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:44.090
anybody is really meeting,
and most large organizations are

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:47.830
uncomfortably certain that there
aren't any products that really do

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.800
what they actually wanted to do,
this is an opportunity to help

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.860
work directly with the developers,
if you're a developer,

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.640
it's an opportunity to work
directly with the developers.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.500
And of course,
help drive the rest of the calendar

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.140
community towards interoperability.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:11.280
If you're interested, visit our website,
which is calconnect.org.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.880
I mentioned that we have
three member meetings a year.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.500
Non-members may attend as
observers to see what's going on

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.000
and see if they're interested.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.450
As a matter of fact,
our next roundtable is at the

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:25.210
end of September being hosted
by Apple Computer in Cupertino,

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.180
or you can email or call
me for more information.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:32.210
And of course, with everyone else,
I'll be around after the meeting

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.130
if anyone wants to talk more.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.000
And thank you very much.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.940
Thank you Dave, and I'd like to second
his plea for you to join.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.110
If you're a developer,
you want to join because you want

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.140
to help to define the standard.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.440
You also want to make sure that your
stuff works with everybody else's stuff.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:57.350
If you're in higher ed,
you want to be there so that you

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:01.240
can let the other people defining
the spec know what it is you need.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.960
Because you can actually help
define the spec so that it meets

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.790
the needs of your university.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:12.000
So, talked a lot about interoperability,
and I'd like to prove that

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.420
there's some interoperability,
and I'm going to invite Grant Baillie

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:21.000
and Jeffrey Harris from the
Open Source Applications Foundation to

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.800
come up and give you a demo of,
to speak a little bit about OSAF,

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:33.860
and to also do a demo of Chandler
working with the Apple iCal Server.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:33.860
Thanks, Chris.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:40.400
So yeah, this is going to be a little
bit of a two-man show.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.940
I'm just going to go through a couple
of slides and then Jeffrey is going

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:51.090
to come up and do the real demo
part of the sub-presentation here.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.640
So, not surprising given who I work for,
the stuff we're showing is an open source

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.370
application and its name is Chandler.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.590
I was kind of looking through
these slides and they're

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.110
in kind of a funny order,
so I'm going to make a big boo-boo and do

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:08.620
a random walk around the bullet points,
so don't try to follow

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.100
too closely at home.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:16.210
So basically what Chandler is,
is it's a personal information manager.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:17.860
This is the third bullet point,
by the way.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.460
And what it really is,
is it's a hub for all

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:25.400
your personal information,
calendars, tasks, emails, and notes.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:30.800
And then there's that nice phrase,
orchestration of shared PIM info.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.150
There the word orchestration points
to the fact that we have this great

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.970
communications infrastructure and
these powerful computers that can

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:42.360
accumulate all this information.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.480
But what that really leads
to is people being really

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.400
swamped by their information.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.770
And so, you know,
people end up with inboxes with

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.460
huge numbers of emails in them.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.830
Emails don't get replied to,
people miss their meetings,

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:57.450
people miss deadlines, stuff like that.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.440
So we're really hoping to kind
of help address that problem.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.370
And the other word in that
phrase that's good is shared.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:15.400
So, and that really points to the stuff
we get by participating in CalConnect.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.940
That we really would want to
enable people to use the software.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.940
And that's really what
we're trying to do.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.600
We're trying to enable a whole
bunch of different kinds of shared

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.940
calendars from just classic group
where scenarios on a single server to,

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:30.920
say, a group of roommates or friends or
people working across companies.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.970
So I'm going to leap back
up to my first bullet point,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.990
which is the stuff we're going
to show is currently in what's

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:41.230
considered an alpha state,
which means that we're

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.000
really using it internally.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.320
And amongst other things,
we're running our shared

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.480
office calendar on it.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.480
And since it's open source,
you can download it at any point.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.350
But really, we're expecting it to
be beta early in 2007,

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:59.480
which means that it would sort of be
generally usable for the general public.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.850
And then, of course,
the important thing is

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.300
that we're cross platform.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.480
So we run on both Mac architectures.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480
We run on Windows.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.410
And we run on a couple
of different Linuxes.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.010
So actually moving along in
order to the second bullet point.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.020
We are open source.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.980
We're mostly written in Python.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.020
We didn't go write the whole
thing from scratch ourselves.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.020
We leverage a whole bunch of third
party open source Python libraries.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.230
For instance,
to do the cross platform GUI,

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.020
there's a library called WX Python.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:40.020
And also some of our subprojects are
available for use outside of Chandler.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.140
And there are two examples here
which really are kind of the core

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.020
of our CalDiv implementation.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:50.020
Our Zanshin,
which is a high level CalDiv library.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.520
And then VObject,
which is used to read and

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.020
write iCalendar format.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.230
And so it turned out when Apple went
to go do their own open source

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:06.020
calendaring server in Python,
they needed an iCalendar library.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.020
And that's the one they ended up using.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:13.990
In general, Apple's implementation also
lies on top of a third party.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.020
And so we're hoping that they'll
be able to use that as well.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.020
And then we're hoping that they'll
be able to use that as well.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:23.810
And since we actually use that as well,
we're hoping that there'll be future

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:26.940
opportunities to use one another's code.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.480
Now I'm gonna leap down to
the last point which is that

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.620
we also have a CalDAV server.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.420
Its name is Cosmo.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:38.190
It's kind of a more traditional,
Java-based server.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:41.560
It supports the base CalDAV spec.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.200
It also supports like being able
to subscribe from Tiger iCal.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:50.650
And it also has a web front end which
is all that nice AJAX-y goodness

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.200
that people seem to like nowadays.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.590
And actually I'm mentioning
that not just as sort of a

00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:01.810
shameless plug for our server,
but actually to talk a little bit about

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:05.020
open standards and interoperability.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:09.470
In general,
more people having more servers is

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:14.700
good in the end for the end user,
for the customer.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.810
It gives them more choice.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.540
The servers in the end all,
servers and clients end up

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.140
having different focuses.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.580
And so in general,
you can find something that's

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.100
more tuned to what you need.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.450
To get sort of a little biblical,
there's the phrase that

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.860
faith without deeds is dead.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:33.950
In the standards world,
it turns out that, first of all,

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:37.080
standards without
implementation are dead.

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.080
And even more importantly,
from the customer choice point of view,

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:46.080
is that implementations without
interoperability are dead.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.060
So we're very,
very happy to be part of CalConnect.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:55.090
We're very happy in particular to attend
their interoperability testing events,

00:49:55.090 --> 00:50:05.060
where basically you can sit down with
all the other vendors and hash out bugs

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.500
and code you've recently introduced,
figure out where your interpretations

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:35.030
of the standards differ,
and that kind of thing.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.040
In fact,
the next interoperability event is

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.040
being hosted by our good friends
from Apple in about a month's time.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.040
And it would be really good to go there
and to see the server that we've kind

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.040
of guessed must exist for quite a while.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.040
And also to have stuff like iCalendar
testing against our CalDev server too.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.040
So that should be really great.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:51:05.020
So, for our contact information,
we're at osafoundation.org.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.020
If you want to find out
more about Chandler,

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.020
the client,
you can go to chandler.osafoundation.org.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.020
The server Cosmo is at
cosmo.osafoundation.org.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.020
We have various mailing lists,
various public mailing lists.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.020
The one for sort of high-level
product design or for stuff like,

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.020
oh, I downloaded it and
I can't get it to launch,

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.020
that would be design
at osafoundation.org.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:11.260
And then there are two developer lists
for the client and server listed there.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.400
Again, they're for more sort
of technical questions.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.060
So that's the end of what I have to say.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.960
And here's Jeffrey.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.520
Thanks, Grant.

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:27.420
Boy, there are a lot of you.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.580
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Harris.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.980
I'm a developer at OSEF.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.420
So this is Chandler.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.940
Now,
you'll notice this is running on Windows,

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.770
GASP.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.820
I would have loved to use
OS X instead of Windows,

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.820
but they really wanted
us to show it on Windows.

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.080
It's much prettier on OS X.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.150
So this is Chandler.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:49.510
As Grant mentioned, it's a PIM.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.040
Right now what you're looking
at is our dashboard view.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.940
And what we're really focusing
on are the workflows for triaging

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.560
lots of different PIM concepts.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.080
So if you look here, this is a task.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:06.140
And then I also have events.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.120
These little details are icons here.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.830
You can select different things,
and you can make things

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.790
be events or tasks,
and they're all heterogeneous

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.000
in individual collections.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.980
And you can triage things,
so you can see here that I have three

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:23.710
now events that are green and three later
events that are yellow and a done event.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.950
The idea is that you really want
to focus on the things that you

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.540
want in your attention right now.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:33.310
Part of what we've done is allow you
to have lots of different collections.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.960
So this is my work collection
of things to focus on,

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.000
like give this demo.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.540
I also have a home collection.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.520
And you can overlay them
just as you can in iCalm.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.140
And here's everything all together.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.460
Now, this is all fairly textual.

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.760
If we wanted to, we could go over to the
little mini calendar here,

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:57.390
and we could say focus
on the apps team meeting.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.440
And we could switch views
over to a calendar view.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.460
You could probably guess that we
were going to have some calendar

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.620
instances at the CalDev talk.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.920
So here's our... Here's our
view of the home collection and

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.030
the work collection overlaid,
and I'm going to overlay

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.200
my choir collection too.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.920
So, one of the things that we can do
is let's say I realize that this

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:24.140
afternoon one of my friends is going
to be at Stump the Experts tonight,

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:27.560
so I'll make a new event
for that and call that...

00:53:28.000 --> 00:54:13.400
[Transcript missing]

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.080
Let's see, to access it,
I don't have open directory things,

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:21.720
so I have to actually know
username and password to access it.

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:22.900
and there we go.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:27.310
It's downloading all of the relevant
things and if we go and look at fun,

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:28.140
here it is.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:32.260
Let's go.

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:50.000
[Transcript missing]

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:56.040
and I'm gonna invite Chris or
someone up to come and demonstrate

00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:01.030
that in fact that changed the fund
collection up on the CalDAV Server.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:08.800
[Transcript missing]

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.740
We've actually got this up.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.540
We didn't show it in the
right perspective necessarily,

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:19.790
so let me turn off my other
calendars and show that...

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.100
Which week was this in?

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.340
Looks like it was July 30th.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.500
July 30th.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:30.310
Oh, that helped too.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:53.600
[Transcript missing]

00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:09.400
[Transcript missing]

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:29.100
[Transcript missing]

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:36.290
So I want to talk about iCal
Server and its integration with

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.290
the rest of Mac OS X Server.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.000
So, as I've mentioned probably twice,
maybe three times already,

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.390
we have full integration
with Directory Services,

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.800
which means we support Open Directory.

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.920
If you've got an
Apple Directory deployment,

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.200
Directory Services will
do the mapping for you,

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.400
same for LDAP.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:59.880
You probably can't read
the fine print there,

00:56:59.880 --> 00:56:59.880
but that's okay.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.520
No, actually all it says is that there
is one additional attribute you need

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.110
to add to your directory schema,
which is basically the address

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:08.950
of the calendar for each user.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:16.250
We also support Kerberos.

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.510
So the client and the server
both support Kerberos.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.240
And like all services on Mac OS X,
we provide a graphical interface

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.400
for administering that,
so Server Admin has support for Calendar.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.300
It's very,
very simple to set up right now.

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:33.800
We'll probably add a few more features
before we ship the final version.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.960
For now, that's all we have.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:40.780
And the new Server Preferences
application supports it as well.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:44.080
And there's a new application
called Teams Directory,

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.260
and Teams Directory does
a few different things.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.720
One is it's basically an
address book for your directory,

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.580
so it allows you to browse all
of the users in your directory.

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:58.450
It also allows you to browse
things like rooms and resources,

00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:59.780
such as projectors.

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.240
And in addition to that,
it also allows you to do things like

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.450
create rooms and create projectors
and add maps to those things so

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:06.780
you know where they're located.

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:10.370
And this all integrates directly
with iCal Server and iCal.

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.280
And then on the IT front,
we tried to make our data store

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.040
as IT friendly as possible.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.000
How many IT people like dealing
with problems when they can't

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.860
see what the problem is?

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:24.800
One guy back there.

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:24.980
All right.

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:29.070
So the data,
as you saw in the previous slides,

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:33.810
the data format we're using is actually
just iCalendar files on the disk.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.640
And those are textual files.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.960
If there are problems,
you can go in there and take a look

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.560
at them and see what the problem is.

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.970
Files by themselves are not very fast.

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:44.140
So we do have a database
that backs that for indexing.

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:45.650
And that's where we get our speed.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.620
But that database can
be thrown in the trash,

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.430
and it'll get rebuilt automatically.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.500
We basically use it for performance only.

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.400
This creates a very resilient system.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.460
It also allows you to do things
like per account backup and restore.

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.640
A lot of calendaring systems
require-- not that there are a lot

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.400
of calendaring systems out there,
but most calendaring systems

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.110
require that you bring down the
entire calendar server in order

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:07.720
to fix one problem on one account.

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.050
iCal Server doesn't require that.

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.480
And because the files are
all living there on disk in a

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.830
format that is easy to read,
these are all parsable.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.100
You can write your own
tools to manage the files,

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:22.200
to provide status on the files,
to provide statistics on your server.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:26.510
In general, the whole thing is basically
very easy to troubleshoot.

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.670
In addition to that,
the data that's going over

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:34.090
the wire is HTTP and WebDAV,
which gives you the XML and iCalendar.

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:37.720
So it's all very easy to
troubleshoot over the wire.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:44.250
Of course,
this is all protected with SSL,

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:45.090
but you can disable SSL when
you're trying to troubleshoot

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:45.090
to look for problems.

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.560
Let's talk a little
bit about scalability.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:54.490
So we designed this thing to be
extremely flexible so that you could

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.900
scale it the way you want it to scale.

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:59.360
So it can certainly start off
small and grow your organization.

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:03.610
We support a variety of different
configurations in terms of scaling.

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:05.640
Different organizations have
different ways of scaling,

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.990
and we understand that.

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.760
And because of that,
it makes it very cost efficient

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.640
for you to build out your
system when that time comes,

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:15.370
when your organization
gets big enough to do that.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:19.240
So, if you're a small business,
you can run everything on one server.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.310
Your directory server,
your calendar server, your web server,

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:24.280
your mail server can all
be run on one server.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.230
Get a little bigger, move the mail server
off to another server,

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.450
move your directory server
off to another server.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:34.030
When you start getting bigger,
maybe add some load balancing

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:39.640
hardware in front of the machine,
add more calendar servers,

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.760
and when you get as big as
we'd like you all to get,

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:44.500
purchase an XAN.

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.500
And hook that up to the calendar servers.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.500
iCal Server can support shared
storage on the back end,

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
it can support partitioned
storage between servers,

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.470
so it's extremely flexible.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.000
Then the last thing I want to talk
about is Darwin Calendar Server.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.050
So, we built, obviously,
we're obviously including a

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.910
server with Mac OS X Server,
but we're taking that same

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:12.940
source code and it is identical,
exactly the same source code,

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:18.150
in fact it's the same open source,
or the same subversion repository

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.150
that our engineers use,
and we're open sourcing that.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:36.200
[Transcript missing]

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:40.130
apache license version 2 so that's a
mistake it's not apsl it's actually

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:45.820
an apache license which is a much more
lenient license and as grant mentioned

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:51.080
the server's written in python and
it lives on top of twist the twisted

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.840
framework and it lives as a twisted
caldav module it's a new module that's

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.960
being added that lives on top of twisted
and it's available today at this um url

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.500
and my understanding is that we need a
more powerful server because the server

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.600
is getting a little overloaded right
now but feel free to download it anyway

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.860
So we're providing a server
that is open sourced,

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.870
uses open standards,
and those two together mean

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.600
developer opportunities basically,
and I know there are a

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.300
lot of developers here.

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.940
So I want to encourage you guys
to look at the technologies,

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.090
look at the server,
and create some new products

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.100
around calendaring and events.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.300
So build clients for mobile devices.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.300
Build some bridges to
legacy calendaring systems.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.300
I won't name the legacy
calendaring systems.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.300
There are too many to name.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.300
Anyway.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:49.390
But the protocol total, you know,
this standard completely allows that,

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:53.270
and we've actually done a little bit
of experimental work in that area.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.750
No,
we're not doing an Exchange Connector,

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.300
so don't read that wrong.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.860
But there is actually an
open source project called

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:03.300
Open Connector that is starting
to do a CalDAV bridge to Exchange,

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300
which is pretty interesting.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.180
If you want to jump on that
project and help them out,

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.300
that'd be great.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.290
You can build rich
collaborative websites.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.470
You don't have to deal with
events and calendaring because

01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:17.300
iCal Server or Darwin Calendaring
Server already do that for you.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.870
You can focus on the interesting
things in your application

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:21.300
or your interesting web app.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.510
And then for the love of God,
somebody please create a multi-user

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.300
project management piece of software.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.590
I'm begging you.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:42.520
And the first person to do
it in a way that I like,

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:42.520
I will personally buy
you an iPod Shuffle.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.420
And as you guys look at the technologies,
I'm sure you're going to dream

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:50.910
up all sorts of things you can
do with events and calendaring,

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.080
knowing that a lot of the work is
already done for you under the hood.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.400
So, let's help the world get it together.

01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:59.900
Right?

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.120
We see the opportunity for
all sorts of interoperability.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.090
And as Dave mentioned,
we're kind of like,

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:10.460
we're kind of at this point where
mail was when you still had to use

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:15.470
percent signs and dots and didn't
have at signs in your email addresses.

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:18.460
This is where we are
with calendaring now.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:21.740
And I think in five years,
it's going to be just,

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.940
it's going to be expected that
anything that does calendaring

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:24.940
works with CalDAV and iCalendar.
