WEBVTT

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.720
Welcome to Apple's go-to-market session,
the last session of the day.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.340
And we're really excited
to be here today.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.470
My name is Paul Papageorge,
Senior Director of Marketing,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.380
of Developer Marketing,
and we've got a really

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.240
good session for you today.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.700
This, out of the 147 sessions this week,
is the only non-technical session.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.870
So if you're on the wrong flight,
it's time to get off

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.700
this plane right now.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.810
So we've got some great stuff for you.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.340
Joining me on stage for part of the
presentation today is Wayne Pfeffer

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.620
from Apple's Retail Store.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.330
He's got some great stuff about retail
strategies and about some specific

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.900
things about the Apple Retail Store.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.960
Also joining us is Erik Lammerding
from Developer Relations Partnership

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.860
Management.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.640
He's got an awesome success story
about what's happened with a

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.000
developer since last year's WWDC.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.520
So in thinking about a
go-to-market session,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.830
we could talk about theory.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.190
We could talk about marketing.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.190
But what I really want to do today is
make it as practical for you as possible

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.460
and think about your marketing plan.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.360
How can you make your own marketing
plan or add this to your marketing plan?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.010
So we really want to go with some content
and with some marketing ideas that will

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.790
be practical and usable for each of you,
things like building

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.510
awareness of your product,
exposure of your product,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.730
how to co-market with Apple,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.780
Do you have a plan for Macworld?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.820
We've got a great program
to talk about today.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.630
Things like advertising, sales promotion,
and as I mentioned,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.690
some great things about
retail distribution.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.740
So let's get into it.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.920
I want to talk about a few things.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.640
Let's talk about exposure.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.160
How do you get exposure?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.970
What are some no-brainer
things for you to do?

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.800
And we're going to talk about a
few of those things right now.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.140
So exposure starts at Apple.com.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.240
There's a bunch of ways and a bunch
of places on Apple.com for you,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.680
for developers, and we're going to go
through each of those.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.590
So, the Apple.com homepage.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.570
We get tons of traffic.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.770
Right on the homepage is
the Made for Mac button.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.390
That's the Mac Products Guide.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.390
DotMac has an entire developer
program for developers who

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.600
have DotMac integration.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.300
Widgets.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.940
If you have a widget,
we've got a place for you on apple.com.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.530
And of course,
we have the Mac OS X Downloads site.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.800
We're going to go through each of these.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.590
There's a lot of new information we
want to make sure you know about.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.590
Let's start with Mac OS X Downloads.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.640
So, as you know, Mac OS X Downloads,
destination for all things Mac OS X,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.550
it gets a staggering
600,000 page views per day.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.680
Even more impressive,
120,000 downloads a day.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.010
So if you're not there,
we're going to talk about how to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.700
get your app on Mac OS X downloads.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.820
Widgets, if you've got a widget, again,
the place to be is the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.820
Dashboard Widgets site.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.820
It's the most comprehensive
listing of widgets.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.110
Over 400,000 page views a day
with an equally impressive

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.670
80,000 downloads a day.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.850
And as I mentioned,
if your product has .Mac integration,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.080
the .Mac site,
now with over one million members,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.830
has an entire developer program that
has some really robust co-marketing

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.080
programs for .Mac programs.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.760
And you can be showcased
as a Mac developer.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.170
They have a sub-site within .Mac
where it's called .Mac Spoken Here,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.520
and some great apps are featured.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.700
There's co-promotion,
really good marketing programs.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.290
Now, we mentioned the Mac Products Guide.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.140
Most of you know the Mac Products Guide.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.290
It's the most complete listing
of Mac products in the world,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.570
23,000 products and counting.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:35.600
[Transcript missing]

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.570
You click on that home page,
you go to the entire section

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.190
of the Universal Apps,
and these apps are all

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.270
categorized by application type.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.460
If you were to click
on one of these apps,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.520
the other thing that's new about this,
let's say Doom 3 in the Games section,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.600
it brings up the
information about Doom 3.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.430
As you may be able to see here,
there's a Buy Now button.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.220
So if you're in the Apple Online Store,
it will take you right

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.260
to the Online Store where
there's customer reviews,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.730
and you can add it to your shopping cart.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.600
The other thing that's new about
the MPG is there's an entire new

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.090
arrivals section on the home page.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.360
So if you submit your product
to the MPG or you update

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.440
your product on the MPG,
you'll be featured on the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.100
home page for two weeks.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:35.070
Now an example of this, as you can see,
we scroll down the home page of the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.070
MPG and the one on the bottom right

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.400
About a month ago was Serene Saver.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.290
Now,
they were on the homepage for two weeks,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.990
and after being featured on the homepage,
they realized downloads

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.500
and sales increased by 4x.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:57.020
And we're talking about
simple exposure for you,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.150
and it's been working for
the programs on the MPG.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.080
The other thing that you
may not know about the MPG,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.740
and here I brought up a page
of Apple's small business site,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.400
Apple's got a lot of
vertical marketing sites,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.020
a lot of marketing sites that
feature third-party products.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.000
And so you can see this one as
an example of small business.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.240
Small business is broken into
verticals that include architecture,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.440
health, legal.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.760
And let's just take
architecture as an example.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.860
You go to the architecture page,
and on the bottom right

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.220
or on the sidebar there,
if we were to click on

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.640
design and drafting,
if you were to click there,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.600
It actually goes right into the MPG.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.470
So this is a great way to get your app,
again,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:46.120
not only on the standalone side of MPG,
but within Apple's marketing

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.620
sites that does a lot of the
marketing around complete solutions.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.640
So those are some simple things
for you to take advantage of now.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.710
And the good news is all
those things are free,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.640
and they're designed for you to
be as part of your marketing plan.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.640
Now there's a few marketing programs
I wanted to talk about before we get

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.420
Wayne up here to talk about retail.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.100
One is called Hot Deals.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.710
How many are familiar with Hot Deals?

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.400
Okay, a smattering of you.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.360
We have just overhauled the
Hot Deals program to be able to

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.840
include every developer and every
product represented in this room.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.270
So what is Hot Deals?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.380
Hot Deals is a site at Apple that
features promotions of your products,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.860
whether they're from
the Apple online store,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.740
from other online retailers.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.790
Now we've added the ability for
developers who may not even be going

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.920
through retail or selling online,
just selling off of their site,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.450
you can get promoted on the Hot Deals
page and on the Hot Deals site.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.400
So how does it work?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.480
What do you have to do?

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.900
Well,
you just have to provide your promotion,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.330
your limited time offer.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.970
Apple will do the rest.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.840
We'll feature you and market
you on the Hot Deals site.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.230
We will promote it on
many Mac enthusiast sites.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.110
And that, in turn,
drives traffic back to your product,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.970
back to your site.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.780
The second program that I want to
talk about is being rolled out.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.910
In fact,
you're the first ones to hear about it.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.990
And it's regarding Macworld 2007.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:28.780
So we've been working very
closely with the Macworld folks,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.950
and we've put together a marketing
package that we think you're

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.950
going to be excited about.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.200
It's an ADC exclusive.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.700
In about an hour,
it'll go live on the website

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.040
for the entire ADC base to see,
but you're going to be the

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.200
first ones to look at it today.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.700
And it's a complete package
around Macworld 2007.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.700
It provides exhibit booth space
at Macworld in San Francisco,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.850
advertising in Macworld Magazine,
and online promotion on

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.700
the various Macworld sites.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.950
So the booth, picture your product here.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.560
In fact, here's an ADA winner.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.480
We're already working on the
signage because one of the

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.100
prizes is exhibiting at Macworld.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:20.780
It has the logo of your company,
product information, internet connection,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:20.780
power, complete turnkey just to
show up with your product.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.840
And the exciting thing is that it's going
to be part of the ADC Developer Pavilion.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.980
We've reserved space at
Macworld to have your booth,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:35.910
your exhibit area, all in one area,
and we will be showcased together as

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.700
a group as the ADC Developer Pavilion.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.270
And in addition to that,
it'll be located near the Apple booth,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.310
so the traffic will be awesome.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.010
Now, we didn't want to make this...

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.330
But wait, there's more.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.420
We didn't want to make
it a one-week event.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.620
I mean, this is great,
but a marketing plan needs

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.860
to be more than the one week.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.160
And so we've added advertising.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.940
And again,
we're closely with the folks at Macworld.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.080
And this marketing package includes
three months of advertising in

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.780
Macworld Magazine-- December,
January, and February.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.410
So both before to drive
traffic and then after,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.620
to follow up after the show.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.790
And here, we have eighth-page ads
running for three months.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.690
and your ad would go there.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.120
And we'll have a special section
featuring all those in the

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.960
pavilion and in this showcase
in the print advertising.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.060
In addition, your product, this, in fact,
will take this very idea of a showcase

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.800
from print advertising to online,
and Macworld has various sites.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.850
You would be not only featured there,
but as you may be able to see here,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.440
there's a demo button
and a buy now button,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.940
and that will be included
for your product.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.700
So we'll demo it right off of
the Macworld sites and drive

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.720
traffic back to your site.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.560
And again,
this is three months of online promotion.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.250
So together,
we've got exhibiting at Macworld 2007,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.550
print advertising before and after,
and an online promotion for three months,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.150
an entire package that could be a really
powerful part of your marketing plan.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.980
So how much would you pay for all this?

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.530
Well, if you priced all this out,
it's about $37,000.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:35.040
And we're happy to work really
closely with Macworld to be able

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.040
to make this entire package,
three-month package,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.200
for you guys exclusively
for under $5,000.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.040
Now, we're going to talk in a little bit
about how to take advantage of this

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.780
because tonight could be the night.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.310
You're going to see
it for the first time.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.660
It's going to go live
for the greater ADC base,

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.680
and we want to give you guys the first
shot at it because spaces are limited.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.210
But if all of you want it,
we're going to make it

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.910
available for all of you.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.710
So stay tuned for later
in the presentation,

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.710
and we'll talk about how we're
going to gather afterwards.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.600
Now, everything I just talked about
is going up on a website,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.270
a brand new part of the ADC site.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.270
Now, obviously, ADC,
we all know and love for

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.980
its technical content.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.380
And today,
we're rolling out an entire new

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.880
section around business and marketing.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.390
And everything you saw,
you've heard so far today,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.900
and you will hear later,
will be up on the site.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.820
As you can see here, Hot Deals,
the Macworld package.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.680
The Mac Products Guide widget.mac
Mac OS X downloads.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.430
Everything has a Submit
Now button or Apply Now button.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.730
Very actionable.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:55.770
And so whether you're
taking notes or not,

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.140
you'll be able to get all this
content afterwards and be able

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.140
to take advantage of all of this.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.310
So with that,
I'd like to ask Wayne Pfeffer from

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.980
the Apple Retail Store to come up here
and share some cool things with you.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.380
Wayne.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.900
Thank you.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.760
All right.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.720
So what I want to talk
to you guys about today

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.380
is retail,
and how do you get your product from

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.350
where it is now to a retail channel?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.140
And retail includes not
only the Apple Retail Store,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.440
but everybody else out there, CompUSA,
Best Buy, and the online guys, too,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.240
like the Amazons and CDWs.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.360
So I've broken this
into two sections today.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.780
The first will be a high-level overview
about how to get into retail in general,

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.760
and the second piece will
be specific to Apple Retail.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.900
If you were to bring your
product to Apple Retail,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.880
what are the buyers there looking for,
and how are they building

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.100
their assortments?

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.740
So let's go ahead and dive right in.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.740
So we've got the developer,
you've got your product, and what's next?

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.620
How do I get, ultimately,
my product on shelf?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.500
So there are three people out there,
in addition to Apple Developer Relations,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.280
that can help you.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.460
These are publishers, distributors,
and vendor reps.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.820
Now,
each of these three has a different level

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.020
of service that they'll provide for you,
and then, obviously,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.660
associated with that,
the more service you're going to require,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.880
the higher the cost.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.730
So as we go through this presentation,
keep in mind that

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.740
whichever one you choose,
or whichever combination you choose,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.420
the more people that you add
in that distribution chain,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.720
the higher the cost is going to be.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.910
So at the end of the day,
you're going to want to make sure

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.120
to weigh the cost and the benefit,
and make sure that this

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.060
makes sense for you.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.320
So how do you know what
each of these does for you,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.910
how much they cost,
and who to go to first?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.260
And that really is going to
depend on where you are in your

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.940
product development lifecycle.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.830
And so there are three
kind of key things.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.980
It'll help you determine which
of these people you go to,

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.060
a publisher, a distributor,
or a vendor rep.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.930
And we'll start with pricing.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.660
Pricing sounds easy enough, right?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.420
I'm going to sell it at $59.99,
and I'm going to go to market.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.490
But if you price too high, what happens?

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.130
Product will sit on shelves,
and you're going to end up

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.660
possibly with product coming back,
and then it doesn't work for you,

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.400
the developer, or for the retailer,
or the distributor,

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.200
or channel partner that you've used.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.850
So at the opposite end of the spectrum,
if you price too low,

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.200
think about the customer
connotation out there.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.110
If you have a product that's
selling for $4.99 on a shelf,

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.790
as a customer,
you're going to think that it's cheap.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.960
And I'm talking cheap
not in terms of price,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.880
but the value.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.030
So price, when we think about setting
a price on a product,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.560
is really the customer's perceived value.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.780
So it's pretty scientific,
and it's very critical

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.260
to going to market.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.220
So pricing is one of the key elements
that you're going to want to consider

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.830
and think about where you are
before you go into the market.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.020
And I think that's going to be a key
element in your approach to pricing.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.080
So I think that's going to be a key
element in your approach to pricing.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.570
or a vendor rep.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.570
The second one is packaging.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.130
So many of us here,
we've written a product,

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.630
we've got code we might be
selling via download right now,

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.740
or taking advantage of some of the
opportunities that Paul covered,

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.390
but we don't have a physical package yet.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:05.510
Packaging is extremely important,
because when you're in a retail setting,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.380
think about it as a customer.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.250
You're looking at a
whole wall of software,

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.150
and what's going to grab your attention?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.770
You as the developer are
not there to explain,

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.240
to explain to a customer why this
product should be purchased over

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.010
a similar product in the market.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.540
So you want to make sure that
you've got an attractive box,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.050
and that you leverage the real
estate on the back of the package to

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.920
call out the features and benefits.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.940
And I'm going to get more
into packaging later.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.730
And then the third piece
is marketing strategy.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.180
Paul covered it a little bit,
but it's very, very important.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.240
The process of bringing a product to
market doesn't stop with pricing it,

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.800
putting it in a box,
and getting it on a shelf.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.800
So what happens once that
product gets to a shelf?

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.590
Resellers out there in the
market are going to expect there

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.800
will be some kind of marketing
effort behind it on your part.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:59.800
And that could be as high end as a
huge Target circular on a weekend,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.800
all the way down to simple things
that are very cost effective,

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.800
like being loaded on a demo
machine in a retail location,

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.210
or getting a shelf talker placed
under it to call out some features,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.260
things like that.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.780
And this is just three of the
things that are pretty high level,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.780
that you need to think about before you
decide which partner is right for you,

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.580
a distributor, a publisher,
or a vendor rep.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.780
So given that, let's go ahead and look at
three different scenarios,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.680
and which partner can help you.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.780
So let's assume that you've
got all three of these.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.740
You've got pricing,
you've got awesome packaging,

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.440
you've got a marketing budget set aside,
and you already know the

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.770
activities that you're going
to be able to do in the market.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.780
In this case,
you can go straight to a distributor,

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.380
and then the distributor will
help you to aggregate product

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.760
and send to each reseller.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.760
The good thing about a distributor
here is that if you as a developer

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.760
were able to get your product
into one of these retailers,

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.760
for you to sign an individual
contract with each and every

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.610
reseller would take a long time.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.760
A distributor,
you can sign one contract with them,

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.760
work out the details,
and leverage their existing

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.760
relationships with the resellers.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.630
They will manage the inventory for you,
help you with the collections, returns,

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.740
everything.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.100
So a distributor is a really
good person to go to if you've

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.720
already got your market plan set,
your pricing, and a package version.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.740
Notice there's one step between you,
the developer, and the resellers.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.740
This is going to be your
lowest cost to market,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.740
because only one other person
is handling your product.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.490
But let's say we don't have
all three of these yet.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.030
Then what do we do?

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.290
One other partner that we
could go to is a publisher,

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.510
and the publisher in turn can
leverage their relationship

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.690
with these distributors.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.320
So say we don't have packaging yet.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.450
We've got a price point for our
product because we know about some

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.760
similar products in the market,
and we know the features

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.380
and benefits of our product,
and we've lined them up,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.620
and we think we can charge a $10 premium,
or we want to go out at the same

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.190
price and try to take market share,
but we don't have packaging yet.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.860
You can work with a publisher who in
turn will help you get packaging either

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.190
in-house or with a third-party vendor
that they've got relationships with.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.750
The publisher will then leverage their
relationships with buyers at each of

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:19.150
these resellers to help you place your
product and then help you to ship product

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.860
in through distribution and ultimately
end up on shelves at major retailers.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.620
But again,
we've added one more level here.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:31.240
So when you need to go to a publisher
to help get packaging or pricing,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.320
or even advice on promotional strategies,
it's going to add another layer of cost.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.070
So keep that in mind
as we go through this.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.360
And then in the third scenario...

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.080
Let's say we're very new to market.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.890
We don't have a lot of this down yet.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.160
We might need help with everything.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.280
We don't know which price
point we want to go out at.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.890
A marketing strategy might be
something that's completely new to us.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.270
A vendor rep is really somebody
that's going to partner with you and

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.580
help you take your product to market.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.040
So these vendor reps usually already
have relationships with publishers,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.120
distributors,
and buyers at all of the major retailers.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.750
They will be able to partner with you,
give you trends,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.660
specifics on each retailer,
which ones you might want to target.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.540
They'll already know the certain
programs that each reseller has available

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.950
for you to promote your product.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.200
At one retailer,
you might be able to do an

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.820
end cap with your product.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.120
Another retailer may not let you do that,
where you think,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.450
I'm going to do end caps everywhere,
and that's how I'm going to sell product.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.180
They'll help you to understand
the different nuances that

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.080
every retailer has out there.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.220
They'll help you connect with packaging,
and they will help you to develop a,

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.430
a promotional strategy.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.580
So in general, a vendor rep will add the
highest level of service,

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.720
work with the publisher,
potentially to get packaging,

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.620
and ultimately you'll still end
up going through a distributor

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.860
to get into a reseller.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.000
So I leave a distributor
up here on every page,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.420
or every slide, because in general,
you're going to be using a distributor

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.900
to get in to one of the major retailers.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.820
On some occasions,
there is the distinct possibility

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.220
that you could go direct,
realistically in 90% of the cases,

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.160
you're going to end up
using an aggregator,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.100
a distributor,
leverage their existing relationships,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.570
and get product in that way.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.590
So here,
we've got the highest level of service.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.460
You've really got a business partner
and your vendor rep that's going to walk

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.640
you through all the steps of the way,
lead you in the right direction.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.730
They're going to possibly
use the publisher to help

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.130
you develop your packaging,
and then you're going to end up

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.160
with product at a distributor
to ultimately get it on shelves.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.780
So, what about Apple retail?

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.120
I'm one of the software buyers
for Apple retail and manage

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.880
the software assortment.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:53.890
So if I were to meet with any one
of you and look over the product,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:53.890
what are we specifically looking for
to add products into the assortments?

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.200
and we kind of have a
distinct assortment,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.720
or we think that we do,
because we see our stores

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.900
as a bit different than a
typical retailer out there.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.380
The high level of service,
the creative bars, the studio bars,

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.280
the theater demos,
we think that there's a lot

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.580
of value add to not only just
putting the product on the shelf,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.730
and everything that goes on behind
that is making sure we have the right

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.120
assortment for our customer base.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.720
So I'm sure that a lot of people here
have been into an Apple retail store,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.390
and if not,
I have a two minute video clip

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.640
that's kind of going to go through
what Apple retail is all about,

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.270
and for those of you that have been in,
I'm sure you'll probably

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.690
recognize some of the stores.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.810
So let's go ahead and roll that.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:57.540
We're opening a new store almost
every other week or even once a week.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.200
We're in four different countries,
soon to expand.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.290
Sales are increasing like crazy.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.960
In the mall locations,
our sales per square foot are

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.670
higher than anybody around us.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.670
So, what are we looking for in order
to come into the retail assortment?

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.840
And I gotta say, on a daily basis,
we're constantly looking for new,

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.080
great applications out there,
and would love to look at

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.290
everything that's out there,
add to our assortment.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.830
We're constantly changing,
and when applicable,

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.610
if we've got a lot of great new apps,
we can always figure out a way

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:33.340
to get more space allocated
and add some things in.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.470
So, I think this bodes well
for everybody here.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.720
So, if we were to have a meeting
and talk about getting a

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.960
product into Apple retail,
what kinds of things would the

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.740
Apple retail buyer be looking for?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.830
So, let's start with product.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.780
So, I have this up here,
consumer-focused.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.240
If you look at the retail stores and
the traffic that's coming through,

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.020
we saw last quarter over 17
million visitors in one quarter.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.780
The holiday quarter,
we were seeing 2 million.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.160
We're seeing 2 million people per week.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.160
Incredible amount of
traffic coming through.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.210
Lots of demographics,
but the vast majority of the people

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.050
that we're seeing are consumers.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.470
And I say consumer as opposed
to the business customer,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.390
but keep in mind,
for those of you that have a productivity

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.270
application or a high-end graphics app,
we still do a high amount of

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.430
sales to business customers.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.090
We've got special small to medium
business teams out there that

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.370
are doing inbound and outbound.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.900
So, there's still definitely a place
for the product in the store.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.160
But as we were to look at what's
on the floor in the assortment,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.570
consumer-focused is
what we go after first,

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.000
and an extension of the Mac platform.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.190
So, when we're evaluating a title,
we really need to make sure that this

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.040
is the right solution for Apple and
that it's enhancing the user's

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.210
experience of their Mac hardware.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.060
So next, packaging.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.240
Again, consumer focus,
knowing who that target customer is.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.240
If you've got a consumer app,
you want to make sure that you're

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.420
speaking to the customer in
terms that they'll understand,

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.830
letting them know how this
product will benefit them.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.100
Obviously using the appropriate logos,
calling out customers are now

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.310
looking for that universal logo,
so it acts also as a

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.090
marketing piece for you.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.240
And product differentiation
on the packaging.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.520
And I think packaging is
very important because,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.980
like I said,
when you're walking through a retailer

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.730
and you're looking at a wall of software,
you've really got three to five

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.010
seconds to catch that customer's
attention so that they pick up your box.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.240
So I want to dig a little
bit deeper into this and talk

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.720
about what I mean on packaging.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.740
So here, on the left-hand side,
we've got the front of the box,

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:39.770
probably a high-resolution graphic that
kind of talks to what your product is,

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:43.500
obviously the product name,
the appropriate logos.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.370
And on the front,
you really want to make sure that

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.220
you're talking to the right people.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.860
And on the right-hand side,
you really want to keep it kind of

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.250
clean and not put too much text,
like paragraph form you

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.880
probably want to avoid,
maybe a couple of bullet points

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.160
on what the product does,
who the customer might be

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.720
and how they'll use it,
or even like a tagline.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.430
But again, the front of the box,
since you're not in the store

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.900
making an assisted sale,
this is what's going to get the

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.280
customer walking down the aisle to
grab that box and want to know more.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.830
The back of the box is really where you
want to leverage your real estate and

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.300
talk more about what the product does,
how it's different than products

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.190
that are out there in the market.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:27.100
The back of the box is really where you
want to leverage your real estate and

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:39.100
talk more about what the product does,
how it's different than products

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:45.180
that are out there in the market.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:45.940
So that's packaging.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.600
And third, price.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.240
So again, target customer.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.370
If you've got a consumer application,
maybe an education title

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.810
for first to second graders,
probably not going to go

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.110
out at $100 price point.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.400
If you have a high-end productivity
app that's for a business

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.110
user or a pro photographer,
you want to look at who

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.730
that target customer is,
where it fits in with other products that

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.220
are out there and priced appropriately.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.100
So I think pricing often gets overlooked.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.440
It sounds simple to just say I'm
going to sell at $199 or $299.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.260
But there's a lot of science behind it,
and you really got to think

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.230
about how that's going to affect
the success of your product.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.760
Again, differentiation.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.760
Knowing how your product is similar
or different to other products.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.650
If there's a similar product
in the market and you've added

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.170
new and improved features,
are you going to price at

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.300
the same price point as that
product and try to take share?

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.240
Or do you think that your
features warrant a $10,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.350
$20,
$30 price premium and go out that way?

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.130
So it just depends.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.120
It depends on how you think
your product is positioned.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.820
And the third thing here is margin.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.630
So at the end of the day,
this needs to make sense for everybody,

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:54.290
right?

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.060
For the retailer, for the distributor,
the vendor, the vendor rep,

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.370
the publisher, and you, the developer.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.290
So think about when you're setting price.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.660
Once you've added up all the costs
that it takes you to get to market,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.800
and then what is the retailer
going to require to justify the

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.570
shelf space in their stores?

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.980
At the end of the day,
how much is left over for you,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.120
the publisher, or you, the developer?

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.470
So if you sold a $100 title and
the retailer is requiring 30 points

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.750
of margin or 30%, then $70 is left
to flow back through that chain.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.210
And after your distributor touches it and
you pay for the packaging and everything

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.310
else that's helped you get to market,
you need to make sure that

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.820
the cost benefit is there and
that this makes sense for you.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:44.740
So, summary for Apple retail,
what are we looking for?

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.490
Product that's an extension
of the Mac platform,

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.490
universal apps, attractive price points,
and awesome packaging.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:50.700
What does this all mean?

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.740
Once you've met with an Apple buyer,
you've got all this in line,

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.220
and they say, yeah,
we want to bring it in.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.220
Does this mean that of the 155 stores
that we have open worldwide right now,

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.640
does it go into every single store?

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.800
And the answer is maybe.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.690
And the answer is it depends.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.010
And it depends on the application.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.540
It depends on the price point.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.670
It depends on what other titles
are out in the market right now.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.460
But one of the good things that
we have is we're pretty flexible.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.440
We've got several different footprints.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.940
We're in almost every major market.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.900
We're in every major market in the U.S.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.860
So we can kind of pick and choose where
it makes most sense for that product.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.790
Now, probably as the developer,
you're going to say, well,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.500
I want to be in every single store.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.440
That gets me the most exposure.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.780
But think about it.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.660
At the end of the day,
if the product goes into a store

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.390
and just sits on the shelf,
after some amount of time,

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.930
the math isn't going to work,
and that product's going to

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.770
end up coming back to the
distributor and then back to you.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.270
So we really want to work
together on this and make sure

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.940
we put it into the right stores.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.640
And that's what some of our
footprints allow us to do.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.770
Now, say we went into half of the stores.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.040
What happens in the other half of the
stores is if somebody walks in and says,

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.900
I want to buy such and such title.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:58.650
I heard about it.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.420
It's awesome.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.160
I want to buy it.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.130
Well, down here I have online.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.970
Every terminal and every single
retail store serves as a kiosk.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.300
So if a customer walks in and says,
I want the upgrade to this,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.760
and we don't carry it on the floor,
we can walk them over to kiosk.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.940
They can type in all their
customer information,

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.280
credit card info.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.330
It'll ship to their house.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.690
If it's a title that's over $50,
it'll ship free.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.960
So three days later, they end up,
they've got the package at their door.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.730
So even if you are only in a
subset of the retail stores,

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.260
you're virtually in every store.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.140
And then it becomes a
question of promotional.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.940
How do we let those store associates
know that that product is there?

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.400
And that goes back to
your marketing plan.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.530
And that's it for retail.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.560
I want to go ahead and
introduce Eric Lambert.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.070
now and talk about a
real life success story.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.580
Thanks, Wayne.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.000
We heard all this great stuff that
Paul talked about for marketing.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.590
Wayne talked about retail.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.420
What we thought would be fun is to
capture a story about a developer

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.720
that leveraged all of this and
realized some really great success.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.990
That developer is this company
called Plask that makes a

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.900
product called Comic Life.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.820
I'm curious, how many people have heard,
or seen, or used this product?

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.060
OK, it looks like just about every
hand went up in the room.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.080
Let me tell you how they got to the point
of having every hand go up in the room.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.000
And what better way to tell
a story about a comic book

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.330
application than doing a comic?

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.410
So this all started with a colleague
of mine calling me and saying,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.100
"Erik,
you've got to check out this application.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:39.570
It's great.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.440
My kids love it.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.400
Your kids would love it.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.780
You can make comic books."
So I downloaded it,

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.340
took a look at it.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.250
It's a beautiful Cocoa UI.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.490
One of the things that we really look for
is how are you leveraging the platform?

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.000
You've heard a lot about
that at the conference.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.270
What are you doing with our tools?

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.500
How are you paying attention
to the user experience,

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.100
et cetera?

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.100
And this was one of those
apps that really grabs you.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.020
It's intuitive.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.990
It's beautiful.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.700
It's fun.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.900
It's whimsical.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.890
They did a great job.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.660
So I thought,
I'm going to get on the phone,

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.120
and I'm going to call these guys.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.600
I've never heard of them.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.240
Who are they?

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.710
They're doing great stuff.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:20.070
And I ended up talking to the gentleman
who's up on the upper left-hand side,

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:24.940
Robert Grant, and he gives me a little
description about this company.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.970
Three guys, one in South Carolina,
one in Switzerland, one in Melbourne,

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.430
Australia,
and they collaborate online and

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:34.770
build this great application.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.220
Well, they've grown a little bit
more than the three now,

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.990
so they're doing well.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.920
And they start telling me the story.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.490
Well, first of all, they're, of course,
using Apple's tools.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.100
Xcode.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.960
You've heard about Xcode and
Xcode 3.0 here at the event.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.780
I talked to Robert.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.930
I said, well, you're coming to the
developers conference,

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:52.500
aren't you?

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.480
Well, I'm not sure.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.600
And I talk him into coming and hook
him up with some of our engineers.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.100
At this point, we're on the cusp of
pushing Tiger out the door.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:07.660
We've got these great technologies
like Quartz Extreme and Core Image,

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.380
etc.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.530
And over a weekend,
he turns all this stuff on.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.180
So great filters in the application,
so forth.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.720
Great developer story.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.840
He also tells me, you know,
those eyesight cameras,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.300
you can plug them in, take your picture,
plug it into the comic

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.580
strip that you're building.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.690
Well,
they come to the developers conference,

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:37.110
and lo and behold, they win an award at
the Apple Design Awards.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.560
They get connected with the
.Mac team to a great promotion.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.970
Not only do they do a promotion,
but their application is

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:44.670
actually integrated with .Mac.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:50.310
You make this beautiful comic,
hit a button, it's published to the .Mac

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.250
-- to your .Mac web page.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.460
And that's something I really
encourage you to think about.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:36:01.510
There's so many creative things
you can do and easily -- by easily

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.510
integrating with the .Mac service.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.940
After that, they get connected with a
company called Freeverse.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.190
Freeverse,
similar to what Wayne was talking

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.200
about with finding a publisher,
helped get their product published,

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:17.000
boxed,
and put on the shelf at our retail store.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.090
And after that,
I hear from the people who

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.700
do our software bundling,
they say, "This is a great app.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.620
We want it on the machines." So now,
every Mac that goes out the

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.000
door is bundled with Comic Life.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.850
It's a great story about how a small
developer really took advantage

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.510
of all the things that we offer,
put it together,

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.670
and realized great success.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.980
So, Paul?

00:36:49.600 --> 00:39:18.100
