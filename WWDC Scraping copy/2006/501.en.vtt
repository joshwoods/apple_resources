WEBVTT

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.470
Welcome everyone to the
Mac OS X Server Overview session.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.180
So we have a lot of stuff to
cover today in Mac OS X Server.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.780
We're going to go deep into some of
the stuff that's new in Leopard Server.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.580
And we've been working
on this for a while,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.240
and so we're really excited
to be able to share with you,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.050
to have you guys all here,
and to be able to talk about the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.000
new features of Leopard Server.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.250
Those of you who have been using
the product for a while know

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.230
that we've stayed consistent to a
strategy that we've had throughout

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.860
the development of Mac OS X Server.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.250
We've taken an industry
standard Unix operating system,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.870
we've picked from among the best open
source packages that are available,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.160
and we've tied them together,
integrated them to make sure that

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.080
they all work together and tie them
together with Apple ease of use.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.480
It's been over five years now that
we've been releasing Mac OS X Server.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.690
And from the beginning back
into 2001 all the way up to now,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700
we're on our seventh release.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.030
Actually, we have two new releases today.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.610
The first, Tiger Server on Intel,
or Tiger Server Universal,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.900
is a port of the existing
Tiger Server onto the Intel hardware.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.970
So Mac OS X Server now runs
on Intel and supports the new

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.320
Mac Pro and XServe hardware.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.470
But we're going to spend the bulk
of this presentation talking about

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.600
what's new in Leopard Server.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.440
And for the next hour,
we're going to go into

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.220
detail about four areas.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.220
We're going to talk about the
server foundations and improvements

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.800
we've made in the server,
as well as improvements to the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.390
services and some new services as well.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.640
We're going to talk about streamlined
server setup and how we've improved

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.140
the management of the server.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.150
We have our new iCal Calendaring Server.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.300
And we're going to talk about Teams,
which is a new wiki and a set of

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.040
web services in Leopard Server.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.620
So to start with,
and to talk about server foundations,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.320
I'd like to welcome to the stage,
Kazu Yanagihara.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.960
He's our senior engineering
manager for Leopard Server.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960
Kazu?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.510
Thanks, Greg.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.220
Good afternoon.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.740
It's nice to see you all again.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.930
See you just once a year.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.490
So let's start with the base OS.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.540
For those of you who are
new to Mac OS X Server,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.280
it's based on the solid foundation
provided by Mac Chrono and BSD.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.160
It offers all the key features
that are expected in modern OS,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.400
such as protected memory,
unified buffer cache,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.760
journaled file system, link aggregation,
and on and on and on.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.110
It's also fully Unix compliant,
so it's really easy to port software

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.290
from other Unix platforms to ours.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.250
And we now have 64-bit.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.970
As Simon Patient mentioned earlier,
we are now fully, fully 64-bit,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.240
support 64-bit on both
PowerPC and Intel platforms.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.140
Everything from the low-level
libraries all the way up to GUI.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.950
And some of our services,
such as QuickTime Streaming

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.320
Server and MySQL,
can be ported to 64-bit so they can

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.090
take advantage of the large data set.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.620
Also on the Leopard platform,
the 32-bit applications run natively

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.300
side-by-side with 64-bit apps.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.300
So there's no emulation mode and
there's no performance penalty.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.250
Let's talk about Open Directory,
which is Apple's directory

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.700
and authentication system.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.650
The directory portion is based
on the industry standard LDAP,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.400
and Corvus is our primary
authentication mechanism,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.400
although we do support a
large number of legacy methods

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.400
such as APOP and Chrome MD5.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.060
The audio really also fits really
nicely with other directories such as

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.040
Active Directory or NIS or Fluff BIOS.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.040
Excuse me.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.960
And lastly, we support replication.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.100
So if you need to have the large
deployment of open directory,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.800
you have that.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.790
You can have up to 64
replicas right now on Tiger.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.000
And this is what's new in Open Directory,
or some of them.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.690
First, we have support for
cross-domain authorization in

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.590
addition to authentication.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.950
We also have RADIUS integrated
into Open Directory now.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.070
Thank you.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.400
And it's based on free,
ready-to-open-source projects.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.850
So if you have a bunch of
airport base stations to manage,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.740
you can do so now in a centralized manner
using open directory users and groups.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.250
And lastly,
we now have cascading replication

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.280
or the multi-tier replication.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.120
So you will no longer have the 64 limit,
and you can have hundreds and

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.230
hundreds of replicas if you have
large deployment of open directory.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.540
So that's a few of the
new features in Leopard.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.630
And if you're interested in this topic,
we've got a lot more to talk about,

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.720
so there's a session dedicated to
it at 2:00 tomorrow in this room.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.200
And actually, that's all I had for the
foundation portion since we got

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.360
a lot of new stuff to talk about.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.060
So let's jump right into the services.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.700
As Greg mentioned earlier,
we have lots and lots of services,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.840
and we seem to be adding
new services every year.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.380
And we have more than a few
to add this year as well.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.480
And most of them are based
on open source projects,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.310
and then many of those that we
develop are also open source,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.580
the QuickTime streaming server,
the iCal server, Bonjour, and so on.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.210
So now let's take a look at some of
the existing services and some of

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.640
the enhancements we made to them.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.700
And let's start with mail.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.260
So interesting one is
the group mailing list.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.260
Now you can simply send email
to any open directory group,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.620
and behind the scene,
the mail server does the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.470
old configuration for you,
and all the members of the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.170
group receive the email,
so you no longer have to create a

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.170
separate mailing list configuration.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.650
Another big ticket item is
the Active-Active clustering

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.220
using XAN as a backend.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.930
You cannot do it with NFS because
we rely on some locking semantics

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.190
that's supported by XAN,
but this should really help people deploy

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.040
much wider deployment of our mail server
as well as high availability solution.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.560
Also got the vacation messages
as well as 64-bit mail services.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.370
iChat Server is now based on Java 2,
which has a brand new code base.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.080
And it's also fully XMPP compliant,
so you can now federate with

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.640
any XMPP servers out there,
including Google Talk.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.340
And we want to make sure that
any communication that you

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.050
have between servers is secure,
even over the public internet.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.400
So we now support certificate-based
encryption as well between servers.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.590
And one of the most requested features
for iChart Server from the previous

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.060
release was the chart archiving,
where every single message that

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.100
passes through the server gets
saved and archived so you can

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.000
search and retrieve them later.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.870
So this is really important to a lot of
companies out there for legal reasons,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.870
so we have that in the product now.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.540
And last but not least,
we do have Kerberos support for both

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.100
iChat Server and iChat Client in Leopard.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.980
Which means if you are
binding to Active Directory,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.100
you no longer have to pass
Createx Pass over the network.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.090
So that's iChat Server.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.910
Let's move on to the web front.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.320
So now we promoted Apache 2
to the first-class citizens,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.580
so you get to choose which
version of Apache you want to use.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.580
And it depends on what you choose,
we automatically configure things behind.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.780
For example, if you select Apache 2,
we automatically configure PHP 4,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.940
or if you have Apache 2, PHP 5.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.820
And also, you can use our admin
GUI with ease of version,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.980
so you get to pick,
and you can basically do

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.820
anything you want with it.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.690
We are also including Ruby on
Rails with Mongrel in this release

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.000
for your rapid development pleasure.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.720
But we also include ModFastCGI,
so if you want to, you can use Ruby on

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.610
Rails with Apache as well.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.680
You have the choice there.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.100
Both JBoss and Tomcats
get the version upgrade,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.410
and both Apache 2 and MySQL are 64-bit.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.100
The Apache 1 is going to
stay as a 32-bit server.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.560
And if you're interested
in this technology area,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.590
we have a separate session on Wednesday,
and we have a couple of cool demos,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.400
so hope you guys can make that.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.340
QTSS.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.800
So one of the most requested features,
mostly from the higher education,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.090
was support for open
directory integration.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.060
So we're working on that right now for
both authentication and access control.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.970
We're also working on 3GP version
6 support for improved quality

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.090
of service on your streaming to
cell phones and handheld devices.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.580
And again,
the QTSS is also going to be 64-bit.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.040
Let's talk about X Grid 2.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.210
There are a couple of
interesting features here.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.320
Scoreboarding is a feature where
the individual agents can assign

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.180
scores to themselves based on the
configuration and capabilities.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.680
For example, CPU speed,
the types of GPU it has,

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.620
or even free disk space.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.430
And those scores get sent
back to the controller,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.300
and then the controller assigns
jobs to the agents that are most

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.500
qualified based on the scoreboarding.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.670
So basically,
you can have a much smarter grid,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.300
and the end result is you
have faster job execution.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.890
The Grid Anyway API is a new API that
helps you make your application

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.020
transparent when you use X Grid.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.880
What API does is takes the job
and checks to see if there's a

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.200
grid available on the network,
and if there is, it distributes.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.740
But if there's not,
it simply just loops back

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.770
and executes it locally,
which means the application

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.990
doesn't have to have two separate
code paths to use X Grid now.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.590
And also supports directory-based
configuration now.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.190
And we do have a separate
session on Friday if you're

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.190
interested in this topic.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.700
Managed Desktop gets a bunch
of new features as well.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.610
Got the nested group support,
application launch restrictions,

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.890
and we now finally have
command line tools.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.590
So if you don't like the GUI,
you can do it from the

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.480
command line as well.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.880
The external account is the feature where
you can take your home directory and

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.800
then move it to your portable device,
FireWire drives,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.900
so you can carry your home
directory wherever you go.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.460
Yep.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.270
We are also expanding and
adding a bunch of new plugins.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.770
So some of them include
support for parental control,

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:14.350
dashboard, front row, VPN,
internet sharing, and on and on.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.860
Yep.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.610
We are also expanding and
adding a bunch of new plugins.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.180
So some of them include
support for parental control,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.650
dashboard, front row, VPN,
internet sharing, and on and on.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.090
And on the system imaging front,
we're going to have a brand new

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.810
system image utility that's much,
much easier to use.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.840
And it's going to be also integrated with
Automator so you can create a workflow

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.950
template and use it over and over.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.400
And again,
here you have command line tools as well.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.720
So that's actually what I had
for the existing services.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.290
So now let's talk about
some of the new ones,

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.040
starting with Spotlight Server.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.930
So with Leopard,
you can search any network volumes

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.030
that's mounted real transparently
as if it's a local volume.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.670
So all the new features of
Leopard is going to be supported,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.590
including recent items, Quick Look,
and so on.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.350
Access Control is enforced
and there's no configuration,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.360
so out of the box you can
simply mount any server volumes

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.140
and you can do the search.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.790
The DVD you have supports
spotlight searching on AFP only,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.220
but before we ship we're
going to have support for SMB.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.660
We also have this Apache module
that lets you do spotlight

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.640
searching from your web client,
so if you're interested you

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.090
can take a look at that.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.240
And now let's talk
about Podcast Producer.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.960
What is it?

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.430
It's a complete solution that lets
you create and publish podcasts.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.220
So let's think of an example,
university environment.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.560
What a lot of people want there is
really capture all the lecturers

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.340
out there and make them available
as a podcast to everybody,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.340
all the students and
perhaps to the public.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.500
And Podcast Producer lets you do
that without having any manual steps.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.960
So let's take a look at how it works.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.680
So going back to the lecture example,
in the lecture hall,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.480
you probably have a camera
sitting in the back.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.850
And when the professor
walks into the lecture room,

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.950
all he has to do is use our
new remote camera control

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.760
software to start the camera.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.760
And you get to do that either via our
new Cocoa app or from using your browser.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.080
And then all those machines
that's connected to camera,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.880
we have this new video recorder software.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.030
And what it does is it takes
the raw input from the camera,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.740
converts it to H.264,
and then when the lecture is done,

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.360
it uploads it to the server.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.030
And this podcast producer server,
it's sort of the brain of this

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.760
whole system that coordinates
different activities and also

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.740
does things like access control.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.760
So in this particular case,
when the file gets

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.640
delivered to the server,
what it does is it tells

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.700
the workflow engine to start
processing that movie file.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.070
And this workflow engine is just
simply a cluster of X Grid agents

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.480
that's sharing the same shared volume.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.220
X, typically,
but it could be NFS as well.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:25.300
[Transcript missing]

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.980
And when the whole processing is done,
what the server does is it tells the

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.770
publishing servers that the output file
is ready for delivery to the end user.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.300
And typically for the podcast,
it's a weblog server,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.280
but you can also deliver via
a QuickTime streaming server.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.400
Maybe you have a high-res
version of the movie,

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.550
so you can make it available
in two different ways,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.320
or even just post it to the web
server so you can do the web download.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.140
In addition, optionally,
you can also send an email notification

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.900
to a set of users that you specify
with the URL inside so they know

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.950
when something new comes in.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.260
So it's real complete end-to-end
solution that lets you capture,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.280
process, and deliver.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.800
And one thing to note there is the only
manual process there was the professor

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.160
walking up and then starting the camera.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.300
Everything else is automated
and taken care of for you.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.820
So now let's take a look
at this example again.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.480
So with this system,
by the time the students leave the

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.680
lecture and go back to their dorm room,
the podcast is already waiting for

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.170
them in the iTunes application or
synchronized to the iPod so they

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.010
can take it after a study session,
for example.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.280
So it's a real single-click
publishing solution.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.880
It's also very scalable.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.950
The example you saw had a lot of
different systems working together,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.100
but in its simplest form,
you can run everything

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.000
on a single machine.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.740
For example,
if you are producing one or two podcasts,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.280
maybe that's sufficient.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.870
But in most cases,
you have something like this or

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.710
start with something like this.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.220
And as needed,
you can continue to expand.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.090
For example,
you may want to put a bunch more cameras,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.440
one for each classroom,
so you may have like 50 of them.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.550
And then as a result,
if you get a lot more files coming

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.640
in and processing gets slow,
you can simply add CPU to the grid.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.800
And if your disks start to get full,
no problem, just add more X Server Raid.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.350
XSAN can support up to 2 petabytes,
I heard.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.840
And also XSAN supports
dynamic volume expansion,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.440
so without bringing
the whole system down,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.090
you can continue to expand this system.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.100
And if your end users start complaining
that podcast delivery is getting slow,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.200
you can simply cluster all these servers.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.400
So you can have the farmer of servers,
something like this.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.390
Oh, guess the slide got messed up.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:47.420
All right, next let's talk about the
extensibility and customizability.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.460
So as you can see here,
it's very modular.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.790
And there are a lot of opportunities
for you to plug into this whole system.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.700
Example is this video recorder.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.100
What it does is it just creates a
file and uploads the file via FTP.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.440
So what you can do is if
you have an application,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.830
you may want to add menu items saying
"Publish to Podcast Server" and let

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.220
people just upload the file to our system
and we're going to take care of the rest.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.390
We can process it for you and
we can publish it for you.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.280
Also, looking at this workflow engine,
we have this basic set of tools,

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.390
which are simply just Unix
command line tools that gets

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.400
executed by X-Grid agents.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.940
We ship maybe 10 or so real basic tools,
so there's an opportunity for you to

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.700
come up with something real cool there.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.830
Just throw it into the tools
directory and it's going to work.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.990
And lastly,
the output file that this whole

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.100
processing produces is just going
to be sitting on that shared file

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.040
system at a well-known location.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.320
So if you have any server application,
you may want to actually take the

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.040
file and do anything you want with it.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.300
You may want to distribute
using BitTorrent,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.360
or some of the universities may want to
integrate with their Sakai-based systems.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.510
So a lot of opportunities here.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.890
Podcast Producer is also real secure.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:06.620
It's integrated with Open Directory and
uses it to do different access controls

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.690
using Open Directory users and groups.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:16.870
So not just anybody can go up
to the camera and start the

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.870
recording and generate podcasts.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.630
So that's sort of the four minutes
overview of what Podcast Producer is.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.700
It's a complete end-to-end solution that
lets you do single-click publishing.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.300
It's also very scalable from one
machine to hundreds of machines.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.440
It's modular and extensible
and customizable,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.040
and it's also secure.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.760
And we don't have this
software on your DVD just yet,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:41.610
but we do have a session on this
topic dedicated to it on Wednesday,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.830
and we're going to be showing you a demo,
so if you're interested,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.160
please attend that session.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.720
And that's all I had for
the foundations portion.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.800
So now I want to talk about one of
the key features of Leopard Server,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.780
the easy management.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.920
So one thing we've been thinking
about is our admin tools.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.160
And one thing we've been realizing
is it's still not good enough and

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.660
easy enough for the novice users,
but at the same time,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.480
it's not powerful enough for
the high-end advanced users.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.250
So in Leopard,
what we have is two different

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.670
modes in which you can set
up and manage the servers.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.710
The standard configuration is people
like small business owners or people

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.600
who need to manage their own work
groups within the institution,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.660
or people who don't have
IT staff and just want to use

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.710
the server in a real basic way.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.940
The dance configuration is for
IT staff and for specialized

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.690
deployments such as mail clusters.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.480
So now let's first take a look at
the standard configuration and see

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.210
how we made it real easy to use.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.810
Starting from the out-of-box experience,
we now have a much

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.220
streamlined server system.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.950
So the first thing you get to
do is pick between the standard

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.560
and advanced configuration.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.720
And if you pick that standard,
you only have a few more

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.080
additional panels after that,
and then the system also tries

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.940
to figure everything out for you.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.460
So you don't actually have
to make a lot of decisions.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.240
In fact, not only does it set
up the server itself,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.560
but it also tries to set up the network.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.450
For example,
it sets up the NAT settings on

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.590
your router so all the services
on your server work just right.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.940
We've also added basic user management.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.600
So if you're a small business owner,
you can just add all the

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.780
employees right here.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.300
You can even take pictures here,
which means by the time you're done

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.030
with those few steps in Setup Assistant,
your whole server is ready to go.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.860
The service is up and running,
the users are defined,

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.140
the network is ready,
and your group is ready

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.570
to start collaborating.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.530
You don't have to even launch
an admin application to

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:38.530
manage your server after that.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.840
If you want to,
you can customize server settings,

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.130
and we have brand new
tools for you for that.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.200
It's called Server Preferences.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.740
The GUI is something that looks
pretty familiar to a lot of people.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.740
It looks just like
System Preferences here.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.600
It's real easy to use.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.240
And we also have a brand new
dashboard widget that lets you

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.510
monitor how the server is doing.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.410
And again, it's real easy to use GUI,
and it's real simple.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.330
And in general,
we also try to automate things

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.140
for you as much as possible.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.100
So one example is that
the firewall feature.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.440
This is a feature where
Mac OS X Server is constantly

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.180
looking for the network traffic.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.580
And if it detects any
network intrusion attempt,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.710
we automatically reset the
firewall settings so that that

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.310
particular IP address is blocked
for a certain period of time,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.310
and you get notification for that.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.640
We also have a backup of the server
based on the Time Machine technology,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.660
and you can use it to
backup not just data,

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.260
but also server settings.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.950
And you can restore in a granular
fashion if you want to as well.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.810
And again, after the initial setup,
everything's automatic,

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.430
so you can kind of forget about it.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.880
So sort of the philosophy around this
standard configuration is we want

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.450
to keep it real simple and as much
as possible automate things for you.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.100
So now what I would like to
do is invite Jeff Michaud and

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.860
Greg Vaughan to give us a quick demo
of Server Preferences and Widget.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.590
Thanks, Kazu.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:14.080
Can we have demo on the screen?

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.940
There we go.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.140
So I want to show a little bit
about our new administration

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.060
apps called ServerPreferences.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.100
And what I've got here
is a Leopard server.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.320
It's in standard configuration.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.480
So when you install
standard configuration,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.530
you get in your doc
ServerPreferences by default.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.780
The more advanced administration
tools are still present.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.940
And you can configure
them in if you want.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.340
And the thing about ServerPreferences,
it's designed to work in conjunction with

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.780
the more advanced administration tools.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:55.640
So if there's more power you need,
you can always jump into

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.930
the Workgroup Manager.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:17.710
and Server Admin.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.710
So the first thing you see here is these
are the services that are running out of

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.710
the box on the standard configuration.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.710
We've got Calendar, iChat, File Sharing,
Mail and Website.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.710
One service that's also running
that you don't see here is

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.710
an Open Directory Server.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.710
And

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.290
Okay.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.100
DNS is a good thing.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.240
So this configuration is
good for a small business,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.420
and you see I've created some
users here in my local directory.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.680
I've got a user account for Greg,
and he's going to log in later.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.910
He's got his network account information.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.860
He's going to log in later,
and he's going to want to

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.630
auto-configure his applications.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.000
I also notice I haven't
created an account for myself.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.900
I want to be sure when Greg hooks up,
connects up,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:13.100
and gets his accounts and his
applications auto-configured

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.230
that he sees me online.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.100
So I'm going to go ahead and
create an account for myself.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:26.670
If I can type correctly.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.340
And I can go in here,
I could take a picture if I wanted to,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.120
I could edit my contact information,
I can set basic access

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.130
controls on my services.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.180
Again, if you need more control,
you can go into Worker

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.780
Manager and do more.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.820
So that's the user panel.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.880
I'll show you a couple of the other
services and what the settings look like.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.180
So here's mail.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.590
So what you've got is
just the basic stop,

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.240
start, relay, welcome message,
and spam filtering.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:08.260
So I'm going to go ahead
and set a welcome message

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.210
because when Greg logs in,
I want him to feel welcome.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.400
So there's our welcome message
is all set and ready to go.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.980
And again, if you want more control, say,
over the spam filtering,

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.360
you can go into Server Admin and do that.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.580
Similarly with iChat,
just the basics here, stop, start,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:40.090
the server-to-server federation that
was mentioned in the last session,

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.140
and logging.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.790
Again,
if you want more control over logging,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.170
go ahead and use the more
advanced tools to get that.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.510
And we've also got backup.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.200
Backup is interesting because it
uses the time machine technology

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.800
that you heard about today to
backup the server settings and data.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.040
So I can go into this panel and
I can choose my data store location.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.230
I can choose whether I want to schedule
it or to back it up immediately.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.450
And it's going to go and
actually for all the services,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.610
it's going to backup their data,
backup any user data

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.220
that goes along with it.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.390
So for example,
if you've misconfigured a service or

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.150
one of your users lost their email,
one of their email messages or something,

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.600
if you've got a backup,
you're all ready to go.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.250
You can go ahead and restore it.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.900
So I click Restore,
and I can choose one of my--

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:39.620
One of my backups here.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.850
It's actually going out and
looking through the sparse

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.640
backup that Time Machine made.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:51.320
And so here I can choose
selectively what I want to restore.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:51.320
So that's the...

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.330
Backup and Restore functionality.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:01.790
As Kazu mentioned,
we've also got a dashboard widget,

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:01.790
and it's for

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.790
Monitoring and Notification.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.860
So you see again I've got my
services here that are running.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.800
I've got this basic status
indicator and some status text here.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.700
And I've got some a graph up
here that I can use for a CPU,

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.230
or I can view my network activity.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.070
And it's also useful for notification.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.950
So we're going to demo that
by using our adaptive firewall

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.000
that Kazi mentioned earlier.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.500
And what the adaptive firewall
does is it watches traffic on

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.300
various services when it sees
something it thinks is suspicious,

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.440
it will actually block out that
IP for some amount of time.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.960
So Greg, who's clearly not happy about
being up in the city here,

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:47.770
has decided to hack into my server
using AFP with a bad password.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:47.770
And

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.690
And there we see we've got the
notification that something happened.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.670
A suspicious activity.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.760
I'll click on that and I'm notified
there's an attempted intrusion

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.320
and that's Greg's IP address.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.410
And you can see his access
has been temporarily blocked.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.300
So that is server preferences
and I'll give it back to Kazu.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.500
Right, so we made the setup and
management of server much,

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.190
much easier,
but we didn't want to stop there.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.140
We wanted to go one step further.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.730
So looking at typical setup,
you need to set up server, the network,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.100
but also client.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.130
And that's the part that's
a real pain in the butt,

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.430
because if you're doing it,
you have to set up application

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.510
on each machine and every single
application on each machine.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.410
And if you're having your end user do it,
it's very error-prone.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.440
So we wanted to automate that.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.200
So in Leopard,
what the client can do is it can

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.130
pull configuration information
from the server and automatically

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.780
configure all those different clients.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.600
And not only just configures itself,
but also it can dynamically update.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.480
So for example, if you change the host
name of the server,

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.230
all the setups on the client machine,
every single client machine

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.460
automatically gets updated as well.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.670
So what I would like to do now is have
Greg Vaughan give us a demo of that.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.600
Okay, so here we have a standard
install of Leopard.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.710
So normally-- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.020
Demo 3?

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.260
There we go.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.150
So normally when you first launch Mail,
it's going to come up with

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.060
its standard setup assistant.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.600
Mail's setup assistant is fairly easy,
but there's still a few pieces of

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.300
information that the administrator
needs to communicate to the client

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.980
and tell them which fields to type
in various addresses and usernames.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.820
And in addition to Mail,
there's also other apps

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.480
that they need to configure.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.800
So we decided to get rid of all
the separate configuration of apps.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.550
So now I'm going to
launch Directory Utility.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.000
It's going to go out on the network,
and via Bonjour,

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.420
it's going to find out the server
that Jeff set up here and ask

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.340
whether I want to join that server
and start using its services.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.000
I'll click that I do.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.990
I now need to type in the
username and password that

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.280
Jeff set up for me on the system,
and I also need to type

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.490
in my local password.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.170
Now it's going to ask whether
I want to go and configure all

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.400
my services to use the server.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.480
This would be the normal choice,
but if you want to configure

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.250
your applications manually,
you're free to do so.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.060
In addition,
we separately ask whether you

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.320
want to configure Time Machine to
backup your data to the server.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.240
It's a separate option because if you
have your own personal laptop that

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.970
you're bringing into your company,
you may choose to use the server but

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:57.700
configure Time Machine yourself to
backup your own data at home rather than

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.900
backing it up to the company server.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:04.100
So I'll choose to backup
all my data to the server.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:08.290
So now it's going and it's configuring
all my applications to use the server.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.080
In addition,
it's actually creating a disk

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.370
image on the server that's going
to be my Time Machine repository

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.830
for all my backed up data.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.440
Now that it's done that,
I'm going to log out and log back

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.150
in again to use my new settings.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:31.700
It's now picked up my user picture
that I previously took on the server.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.550
And I log in.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.160
So now when I go to mail,
instead of coming up

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.400
with the setup assistant,
it's going to be configured for

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:50.170
my mail application and it's
going to connect via Kerberos.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.470
So I click on it and
there's my welcome message.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.480
In addition,
it's configured my address book.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:04.050
So if I wanted to send an email to Jeff,
I could just start typing in its name

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.690
and it'll auto-complete his address or
any address of any user on the server.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.260
Similar,
we've done the same thing for iChat

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.040
now so that when I launch iChat,
it comes up.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.590
I'm automatically connected to
the server again via Kerberos.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:24.990
In addition,
all the people in my work group have been

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:31.480
automatically added as my buddies so that
I can see that Jeff's online and I could

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:31.480
just double-click to send him an iChat.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.980
Then finally, we've also,
as I chose earlier,

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.160
to configure Time Machine.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.720
So, oops,
I didn't want to launch that again.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.020
I wanted to launch this.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.500
So if I go into System Preferences
and go to the Time Machine Preference,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.580
it's going to go and now it's going
to mount the volume off the server and

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.220
it's going to mount my backup image.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.860
So I could choose Backup Now and
backup all my data to the server.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.970
This is actually just a sample of the
things we configure on the client.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.550
There's a few more things that
we automatically configure

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.260
to use the server services.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.840
But basically,
we're just trying to do everything

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.390
we can to make it easy to just get
going and start using the server.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.260
So back to you, Kazu.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.930
Great.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.140
All right,
so that's the standard configuration.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.280
It's much easier to set up and much
easier to set up not only the server,

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.840
but also the clients.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.800
Now let's talk about
advanced configuration and

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.280
server admin real briefly.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.150
So here are some of the new features that
we're implementing in a server admin.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.130
The first thing we did was we
redesigned the UI a little bit

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.770
with a focus on ability to navigate
among lots of different servers.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.240
So you now have this three
column browser on the top,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.890
the one on the left for list of servers,
one in the middle, the list of services,

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.100
and the one on the right,
specific panel for the

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.420
particular service.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:06.230
And we also made a change so the
service column in the middle lists

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:11.120
only those services that are enabled,
although you can actually

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.170
customize if you want to.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.670
So here's an example of
the mail overview panel.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:16.670
Here's another one for the
settings panel for the mail.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.260
And if you have only just one or two
servers and don't want to do all this

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.820
navigation in this browser and you want
to keep the GUI a little bit simpler,

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.770
you can collapse the GUI.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.840
So you just have the bar on the
top indicating where you are and

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.320
just use that bar as the pop-up
menu to navigate between services.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.140
So you have a choice here.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:40.130
And this is something we're still
kind of playing around with it.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:40.130
So we may change before we ship,
but some improvements there.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.170
The last thing we added was the
Service Configuration Assistant for

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.120
configuring services initially.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.140
Here's an example for the mail server.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:54.230
So with this, just with, I think,
three panels,

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.230
you can create a mail cluster.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.710
Other features include
tiered administration.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.190
So this is a feature where different
admins have different permissions.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.280
For example,
the admin A may be able to do everything,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.430
while B can only reset the password,
while C can manage

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.790
AFP server and SMB server,
for example.

00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:13.030
We also have a bunch of
different improvements in terms

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.890
of monitoring the server so you
can see how the server is doing,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.100
performance and security and so on.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.480
And we are also adding the event
notification functionality as well.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.870
A lot of this is not yet in the build,
but something's going to start to

00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:29.040
show up in subsequent releases,
so if you're interested,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.800
please look for them.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.770
So that's it for the easy management.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.830
So let's summarize.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:41.180
We have this brand new Express Setup
application that's fast and complete.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.390
We have brand new server preferences
and widgets that's real simple and

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:48.000
we do things for you automatically.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.890
And not only we set up and
configure servers and network,

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:53.800
but we also do the automatic
configuration of all the clients.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.300
So within a minute you can
set up the whole workgroup.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.750
And at the end,
we also have server admin which

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.010
we're going to continue to evolve
with scalability and advanced

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.800
features as a focus point.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:09.930
And that's all I have to say today and
I would like to invite Michael Lopp who's

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:13.320
going to tell us all about iCal Server.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.510
Good afternoon.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.580
Let's have some fun.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:28.980
How many of you are happy with
your mail server right now?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.050
Show of hands.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.350
Mail server.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:31.840
Really?

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.950
That bad?

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:33.640
Oh, really?

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.180
Okay, well.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.360
How many of you are happy with
your calendar server right now?

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.370
Okay.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.040
No one.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.600
That's good.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.680
Well,
there's good news coming for you today.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:57.070
All you IT types who have
been waiting for Steve to say,

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:57.070
we got one more thing,
and you wanted that thing to be...

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.200
and the rest of the team.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.200
That's great.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.810
You can kind of share those calendars,
but they don't really

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.200
talk to each other much.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.080
They don't have any sort of common
protocol to talk to each other.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.980
So what we wanted to do with
iCal Server is create an open

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.200
platform for calendaring.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.630
We want to start the conversation
about calendaring again because

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.200
there hasn't been a lot of innovation
in our opinion in a long time.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.330
So with iCal Server,
you can start using iCal or you can use

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.200
the open source application foundations,
Chandler client.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.180
You can use Mozilla Sunbird.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.150
You can use Safari to do
web-based calendaring.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.200
All of these are supported
because iCal speaks CalDAV.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.200
CalDAV is the new protocol that we're
adopting as part of iCal Server.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.200
Thank you.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.020
Okay,
so it's also a standards-based platform,

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.200
but it's also all the features
that you're expecting,

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.880
everything that you need for calendaring.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.490
So, of course, free busy,
rooms and resources,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.160
so you can invite rooms,
you can invite projectors into meetings,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:36.880
proxy support, delegation, attachments,
an amazing mobility story because, again,

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.570
we're built on standards.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.170
Directory integration,
so all your users and groups,

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.890
you can interact with
iCal Server securely,

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.390
and obviously, work group support.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.960
That's all the features,
but there's another feature.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.880
Your question is,
is it going to work for my business X?

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.570
And the answer is, yep.

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:58.000
and many more.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I hope it better.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.250
So if you just have a single
server running calendar,

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:07.620
iCal Server as well as open directory,
whatever other services you have,

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.440
works great.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.430
Your company's growing.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.500
Congratulations, you've got more people,
your growth is going up,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.760
add more servers.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.740
Maybe you're going to
need a round-robin DNS.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.740
You need more servers.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.580
You need an open directory server.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.540
Maybe you need XSAN.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.620
More hardware, that's a good thing.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:30.380
iCal Server is designed to scale to
all sorts of different deployments.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:35.760
And we want your feedback
on that as part of the seed.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.800
The rubber hits the road when
you actually see it working.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.970
So I've asked Red DuTta,
who's the iCal engineering manager,

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:46.120
to come up here and give us a
demo of iCal Server with iCal.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.190
Thank you, Michael.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.790
Thank You Michael,
so what I want to show you is the latest

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.640
version of iCal that the team's been
very busy working on and one of the first

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:03.770
things you're going to notice is it still
looks like the same old iCal that you

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.090
know and love there's not a big leap you
have to make there to figure this out but

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:13.300
one of the things you'll see under the
preferences panel is this new accounts

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.490
pane now we try to make this really
simple and just to kind of show it off

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.840
I'm going to add an account for myself.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.020
I'm going to call it
the Company Calendar.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.730
One of the things that we tried to
do to make this simple was all you

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:32.380
really need to know to set this thing
up is your username and password.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:37.720
Now, if you watch just for a second
with your server address,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.360
we're going to fill that out for you.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.160
So you don't even really need
to know your server address.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.360
All you need to know is
your username and password,

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.920
and we'll fill it out.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.880
And you can see iCal
as you know and love.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.990
Now, for those of you who aren't
that familiar with iCal,

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.290
basically the way you do it is
you create different calendars.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.880
You can categorize things that way,
colorize however you want.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.120
And one of the things I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a new calendar,

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.620
and I'm going to call it "Important" for
meetings that are really important to me.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.320
And I can make that any color
I want to help categorize things,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.020
but since it is important,
I'm going to leave it at the color red.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.740
And so one of the other things
I do want to point out is you

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:27.060
can VPN from home into this,
and you'll see the exact same view.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.250
Your calendar names will be the same.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.420
The colors will be the same.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.940
It'll look the same as if
you're in work or at home.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.040
So let me try and schedule a meeting.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:43.980
So our senior VP Bertrand always wants
to know how things are moving along,

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.980
so why don't I try and schedule a meeting
with him to give him a quick demo.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.540
So I'm going to go ahead and
start with the name of iCal.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.170
And one of the things I can
do is just simply start typing

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:59.650
in his name as an attendee,
and it auto-completes, and I'll pick him.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.340
Oh, and one of the things
I can see right away is,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.470
oh, he's busy at the time that I picked.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.140
And so what I'll do is maybe
I'll drag it to a different time.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.780
Maybe he's available around 3:30.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.900
And, well, once again,
he's not available.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.620
So let me see.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.540
Maybe he's available in the morning.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.940
And I see that he's free.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.500
So this was kind of great because
I knew who I wanted to invite,

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.900
but what if I didn't know?

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.280
Well, I can still see people
in the address book,

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.880
but now I can tie into open
directory and get anybody who I want

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.680
who's there in open directory.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:45.500
I can pick conference rooms from the
rooms or projectors from the resources.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:52.800
So, that's pretty much the
CalDAV support as we've added it.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.280
Now, one of the other things that
you might have noticed over here

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.920
is this little notification.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.880
So, if I click on it,
all of a sudden I can see

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.880
sitting here waiting for me is an
invitation to integrating with iCal.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:10.580
It's the session, 3.30 tomorrow,
and it's from my teammate, Matt DiMaggio.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.780
Well, I think I really want
to be there to this,

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.720
so I'm going to accept it.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.580
In my calendar,
I'm going to categorize it to important,

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.800
and I'm going to reply
that I've accepted.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.640
So, that's sending, receiving,
making meetings,

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.220
all this kind of stuff you'd want
to do with a corporate calendar.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.830
So, with that,
I want to tell everyone that

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.800
there's a much more detailed demo
tomorrow at 10:30 in the morning.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.840
And turn it back over to Michael.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.850
Okay.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.850
How cool is that?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
I've been waiting to do
that in iCal for years.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.280
OK, so as I said,
this is built on CalDAV.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.760
And I want to talk a little
about the standard here.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.220
But I first want to talk about
other standards in this space.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.360
There's one called CAP.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.020
It was approved about six months
ago as an RFC or something.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.280
But it didn't see widespread adoption.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.250
And the reason is it was really complex.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.760
People didn't want to
reinvent a brand new protocol.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.300
And that's why we chose CalDAV,
because it's built on existing protocols.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.980
At the bottom there,
you're looking at HTTP.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.460
We all know what that is.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.990
It's very tested.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.000
It's very firewall friendly.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.380
On top of that, we've got WebDAV,
which is our repository and

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.200
our way to manage collections
of what's next to that,

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.020
which is the iCalendar file format,
which you know.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:42.420
And on top of that is iTIP,
which is the beginning of scheduling.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.740
And then on top of that
is the rest of scheduling,

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.100
all the server scheduling,
which is one specification,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.100
as well as a set of
methods that actually,

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.900
as part of WebDAV,
that actually allow us to do calendaring.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.000
So to talk a little bit more
about the consortium that

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.690
is driving the CalDAV spec,
I'd like to bring Dave Thouless

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.440
up here to talk about CalDAV.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.340
Dave?

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.260
DAVE THOULESS: Gizzy.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:16.380
Thank you for having me here.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.700
As you said, my name is Dave Thewlis.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:21.660
I'm the Executive Director of the
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium,

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:27.780
which is called CalConnect by
everybody to the point where you

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:27.780
often don't remember it's the
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:34.610
Which button we have here?

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:34.610
Obviously it's the wrong one.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.200
I'm defeated by technology.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.200
There we go.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.200
There we go.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.040
Okay, so what I'm actually going to talk
about very briefly is CalConnect,

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.200
the consortium.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.200
So what is it?

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.200
It's an IT consortium.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.200
It is a partnership.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.200
We style it as a partnership
between developers and customers.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.040
And as you'll see,
that means we have a variety

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.190
of different types of members.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:05.260
We have a relatively fancy
set of words in our mission,

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:09.430
but fundamentally what it boils down
to is that we are working to drive

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.200
interoperability between different
calendaring and scheduling systems.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:18.010
That means interoperability to exchange,
calendaring to schedule between iCal,

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.610
iCal Server, Lotus Notes,
Microsoft Exchange,

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.200
Oracle Collaboration Network.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:29.200
Oracle Collaboration Suite,
Google Calendar, and so on and so forth.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.040
That is the dream,
and the dream is starting to come true.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.190
What do we do?

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.540
We develop requirements and use
cases for the standards for the

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.180
protocols that are going to be
instantiated in implementations.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:46.330
We help to evolve changes to those
standards to support the evolving

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:51.180
world of calendaring in areas like
event publication and authentication.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.200
We conduct interoperability
testing between the two.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.500
We conduct interoperability
testing between existing calendar

00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.200
implementations and for implementations
against the specifications.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:05.200
And what we're trying to do is push
our industry towards interoperability

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.750
so that we don't have isolated
islands of calendaring that can't

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.200
communicate with one another.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:18.330
The kinds of organizations
involved in CalConnect:

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:25.160
calendaring vendors, academia,
major institutions, commercial companies,

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.130
open source developers,
governmental energies,

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:32.490
non-government organizations,
and individual members.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.380
Members of CalConnect,
this is not a complete list,

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:39.480
although it's pretty good.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.440
You can see we have many
of the major vendors.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.320
We have some of the
open source developers.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.720
We have a number of major universities.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.630
And one of the reasons I'm here
is to announce that Apple not

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:54.950
only has joined CalConnect,
but has been an active and very active

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:57.980
member of CalConnect since January.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:02.780
They have been one of the primary
drivers of the CalDAV specification,

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.180
moving that forward to
becoming an internet standard.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.860
I'll be talking a little bit
more about CalConnect next

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.880
morning and the inside Leopard.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.880
Thank you very much.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:13.880
Thank you.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.090
Okay, so more good news.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.780
So as of right now,
if you go to this URL,

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.900
you can download iCal Server as
Darwin Calendaring Server.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.800
We are giving iCal Server to
the open source community

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.090
under the Apache license.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.370
From what I hear was announced earlier,
our servers are already

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.100
getting hit right now.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.150
So again, we want to start the
conversation about calendaring,

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.100
about innovation in calendaring.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.710
The best way to do that is to get
it out there and get it as part of

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.080
the open source community as well.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:58.980
There's a session that's going
to be this Thursday at 9 a.m.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.080
to talk about the open source efforts.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.170
It's going to be great.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:06.500
All the details about the standards,
the different specs we're doing,

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:07.750
it's going to be great.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:11.660
Of course, you also have iCal Server,
which ships the power as

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.240
part of Mac OS X Server.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.860
If you've got more of an IT bent to you,
there's a session tomorrow which is

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.160
going to be talking about the nuts and
bolts of iCal Server deployments and all

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.900
the details that you need to know about.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.570
Okay, so we saved the best for last.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.830
this is the big one.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.550
Teams.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.700
You've probably heard about
it a couple sessions now,

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.360
and you have no idea what that icon is.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:41.800
What exactly are we
talking about with Teams?

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.020
I'm going to give you a little
context before I tell you what it is.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.630
The question I have for you is,
you get up on Monday morning,

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:50.340
you're going to work,
you get your coffee, and you're working.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.520
You've got all these applications
on your desktop that are

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.140
begging for your attention,
and you're doing stuff.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.180
You're doing stuff for the company.

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.740
You've got, if you're using Mac OS X,
you've got Spotlight,

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.740
the means that you go and
find things on your desktop.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.340
You've got iCal,
which is suddenly much more

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.220
interesting with iCal Server.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.980
That manages your day, your meetings,
the people that you

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.340
need to interact with.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.460
You've got Mail.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.610
As Steve was saying this morning,
he lives in Mail.

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:17.530
I live in Mail.

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:21.130
My daily routine, every day when I leave,
I write a little note to myself.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:21.900
This is what I need to do.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.500
These are the specs I need to read,
all this stuff.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.690
I send it off.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.900
It is the repository of a huge
amount of organizational information.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.840
And you've got Safari,
your research tool,

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.040
your web surfing tool,
obviously gathering how you

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.260
gather a lot of information.

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:37.550
And you've got iChat,
which is your means of

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:39.720
talking to your coworkers.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.110
How you're making decisions.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.140
My phone hasn't rang in years at Apple.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.400
It's usually a lawyer if someone's, like,
the phone's ringing.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.930
Everyone else is either mailing
me or they're using iCal,

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:50.730
iChat.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:51.700
So what's the point here?

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:56.020
You've got all of this information
sitting on your computer.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:59.940
Everything, and I guarantee that
some of that information,

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.780
someone else in your company needs,
but they can't get to it because

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.540
it's sitting on your computer.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.280
The game is not you.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.780
The game is we.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.120
You've got all of these different
people with this information.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:17.280
What we need is a space to put all
this information so we can easily

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.020
share it and everyone can have access.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.780
That's what Teams is.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.380
So Teams is an application.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:25.440
Let's go back to that icon again.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:25.480
Very pretty.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:25.580
It's an application as
well as a set of services.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:25.780
The application is called Teams.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:25.780
It's an application as
well as a set of services.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:25.780
The application is called Teams.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:25.780
It's a very simple application.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:25.780
It's a very simple application.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:32.750
It's an application as
well as a set of services.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.750
The application is
called Teams Directory.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.030
It's got two roles.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.630
Role number one is a directory viewer.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.440
You need to go find someone
in your open directory.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:46.620
All the people, all the locations, maps,
resources, brilliant UI,

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.120
great way to view your
directory information.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.280
And you need that for iCal as well.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.090
The other role is to create teams,
to create groups of people.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:55.120
And you need to have a team.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:55.120
You need to have a team.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:55.120
You need to have a team.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:01.180
And to create the set of services
that goes along with each group.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:02.450
And here's the killer part.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.260
There's no admin involved.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.520
If you have given someone
rights to do this,

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.200
they can create a group
and they can get the wiki,

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.750
the weblog, the account,
all that stuff with

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:13.290
no admin intervention.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:16.350
So that's Teams Directory.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.210
Then we have the Wiki.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.450
I'm not going to say anything about
this because you just got to see

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:24.540
the demo because this is the best
wiki you're ever going to see.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.870
We've got the weblog,
which is very similar from a

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:29.470
technology perspective as a wiki,
but socially,

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.530
weblogs are sort of used differently.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.900
So we'll take a look at that.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.850
We've got group calendaring,
web-based group calendaring

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:39.960
on top of iCal Server,
and we've got contacts as well.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:44.740
So the only way to understand
really what Teams is,

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:45.490
is to get a demo.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:53.480
And what I'd like to do
is I'd like to bring up,

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:53.890
who's the engineering manager
for Teams and iCal Server-- busy

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:53.890
guy-- to give us a demo of Teams.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.900
Thanks, Michael.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.850
Hey, we got the right demo machine,
I think.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.610
Good.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:12.440
Okay, so as Michael mentioned,
Teams is more than just a wiki,

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.610
but I'm going to kind of focus on that.

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.150
But before that,
let me kind of give you the kind of

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:18.390
the lay of the land of the front page.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.270
So the way Teams works is you
can basically let anybody in

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.180
your organization create a team,
or you can lock it down

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.540
to just certain people.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.590
It's up to you.

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:29.800
What that means is that
you can run multiple wikis,

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.840
multiple web calendars,
all on one server.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.600
So what happens then is that every,
once a team is created,

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.140
every team gets a website.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.400
If you go to the top,
look at the top of this page,

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:45.760
you'll see a link to a wiki,
link to a web calendar,

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:47.110
and a link to a web blog.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.140
So these are all things that are
included with every team that you create.

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:54.060
This is actually the front page,
there's content in the middle.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.810
And let me back up just a little bit.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.590
So this is actually just a sample
of one of the wikis that we,

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:00.440
we actually do use this internally.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.260
This is a sample team for
the Leopard Server project.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.330
So the center section is editable.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:10.870
And this is generally where you would
place content that was just kind of

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.800
high level information about your team,
whatever your team was doing,

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.130
your project, anything.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.810
And then over on the right,
you'll notice some sidebar

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.220
over here with what's hot,
shows things that have

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.860
been marked as important,
upcoming events.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.500
This is data actually coming
out of the calendar showing

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.320
things that are coming up.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.010
And it's coming from the CalDAV server,
CalDAV server, of course.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:33.780
And what's new,
shows you pages or objects

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.350
that have changed inside the
your team's content repository.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.570
So as I said, I want to focus on wiki.

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:41.020
So let me go to one of the wiki pages.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.780
So everybody here probably
uses a wiki someplace.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.890
You either use Wikipedia if you're
involved in any open source projects,

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.140
they all have wikis.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.440
And more recently,
a lot of corporations that

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.380
are non-engineering driven
are using wikis as well.

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:04.440
Apple, for example,
has wikis all over the place.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.740
Unfortunately, they're not these because
this didn't exist.

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.330
So what ends up happening
is that you've got,

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.470
you know, wiki server in this
engineering team group,

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.300
one in this engineering group,
and they're all different.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.730
They're all being managed by engineers,
and it's really difficult.

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.490
The other problem is some
people might say it's better if

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:24.080
it's been managed by engineers,
but I would never say that

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.740
because I'm here in an IT session.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:30.020
So the other problem with wiki,
another problem with wikis is that

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:35.110
they all use markup languages and
the markup languages are difficult.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.740
Some people think that markup languages.

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.880
are an intelligence test.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.440
I kind of disagree with that philosophy.

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:45.060
That you end up going to this mode
where you're typing in markup,

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:46.980
doing a preview to see
if it got messed up.

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.100
It usually did get messed up.

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.910
You go back into edit mode
in the markup language,

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:51.840
go to preview and you just
kind of go back and forth.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.670
And it's just real pain.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.360
And adding images and
attachments is a disaster.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.530
You basically end up having to mount
an FTP server or an AFP server,

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:03.920
upload content,
go back up into your markup language,

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:08.960
type it in some bizarre
bracket or two brackets.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.460
I'm not sure.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.570
It depends on the wiki to link off
to that content on another server.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.240
Okay.

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.440
So anyway,
that's my diatribe on how bad wikis are.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.800
Let me show you how ours isn't bad.

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.600
So as I said, this is a wiki page here.

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.730
I'm going to go up here
and click the Edit button.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:28.090
If you watch closely,
you'll see a toolbar pop down.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:38.200
And the wiki has now gone into edit mode,
so I can start adding content.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:42.720
I can select that content,
go up to the toolbar,

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.370
and make it bold and underlined.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:51.870
I can do things like indent it,
outdent it.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.340
and that sort of thing.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.240
And when I'm done, I just click Done.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.370
Or before I click Done,
I can add a comment saying,

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.930
What I did, and the reason we do
that is that we kick up,

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.190
like all wikis,
we keep a complete history on every

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.440
change that you make on the wiki.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.380
So you can never screw anything up.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.320
You can't lose anything.

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.220
It's the beautiful thing about wikis.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.640
So click done.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.500
It's saving this up to the server.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.310
It's all AJAX kind of driven,
and I'm done editing.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.100
So it's very, very simple.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.860
I mentioned-- I want to also
show you a little bit about

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.260
how we manage links and images.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:35.480
So to start off--

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:40.220
Let me-- I'll add a little
bit of content at the bottom.

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.000
Start off by adding a link.

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.460
If I use the right keyboard,
it might be easier.

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:56.920
So in this place,
we're adding-- we're keeping links

00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:03.560
of rumors about features that people
thought were going to be in Leopard.

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:09.910
Learn how you-- I'm
very new with a mouse,

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:10.700
so.

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.040
So I'd select the text,
just go up to the toolbar

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.980
and click on the link tool.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.020
And you'll notice a few things.

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.510
So first, we give you a list of existing
pages that are already in the wikis.

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.700
If I wanted to-- oh,
and I did accidentally--

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.750
I can just click on one of those
pages and it'll create a live link.

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:33.300
So let me get back to where I was.

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.500
Oops.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.570
Select that text.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:43.060
Go back up here.

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.680
Keep my hand off of the
keyboard or off the mouse.

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.080
So we're showing at the top here
pages that have matching tags.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.500
And I'll talk a little
bit about tags later.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.380
But basically,
it's showing me the pages that

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:56.170
are probably related to this.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:00.510
The page I'm about,
or to the page I'm typing on right now,

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.060
also shows me recently viewed things.

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.420
We feel that when you're
building out a wiki,

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.930
the things you've viewed recently
are probably the things you

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:07.300
want to link together later.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.710
I can also type in just a raw URL at
the bottom if I wanted to link to

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:14.570
an external site or if I happen to
know the URL for an internal page.

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.610
And the last thing I can
do is I can do new page,

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.560
and this is really important in wikis.

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.590
So one of the beautiful things about
a wiki is as you're editing content,

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.440
you can very quickly put
placeholders in for pages that

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.320
you're going to go fill out later.

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.320
And that's what this new
page setting allows me to do.

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.020
So I'm going to create the new page.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.780
Page has been created.

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:37.340
I'm still editing my existing content.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:38.840
I will fix my spelling error.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.540
I click done, and I've now got a link.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.940
So links are very, very easy.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:48.500
I'm going to pop over to that link and
maybe now add some content to that page.

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.050
page.

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.100
So let me select that text.

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:58.050
And I've got a rumor from some
rumor site that I'd like to paste

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:03.030
in for everybody else to look at
and wonder who leaked the rumor.

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:05.520
So let me select that text.

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:07.440
And paste it in.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.230
And you'll notice something
pretty interesting here.

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.630
It kept all of the formatting.

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:15.220
If this had come off of a real website,
it would have worked properly,

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:17.080
even the link.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.090
Even the links that are there work.

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.900
So that slide got dug to death.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.470
All my bulletin is intact
and go back into edit mode.

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.980
But I want to add a picture to this.

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:41.240
So let me click down here and
click on the Insert Picture icon.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.130
All I have to do is browse
to my local picture,

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:50.440
click Choose, insert that picture,
and it's uploading it to the server.

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.770
It's putting it in the
repository into the right spot.

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:58.410
And somebody was playing with
my demo before I came up here.

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.160
Known bug.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:31.840
Okay, good.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.350
You guys remember where I was?

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:36.690
Okay, adding a picture, so.

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:44.130
Go to the picture icon,
browse to my file, select my file.

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:48.300
It will upload very,
very quickly to the server.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.000
And there it is.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:01:00.800
Click Done, and I've got a completely
edited wiki page.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.980
It's thumbnail the image for me.

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.260
If it were a really large image,
I could show you that.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.700
We also show history.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.340
It's very nice.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.070
You can go back and look at
prior versions very quickly.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.540
Done with that.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:17.860
And the last thing I wanted
to talk about is tags.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.440
So one of the problems-- one of
the great things about wikis,

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:25.660
actually, is that they're all about
organically creating content,

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.600
linking that content together,
and making it possible to search

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:31.560
across all of that content really,
really easily.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.670
I think that's great,
but we wanted to add a little

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.860
bit more structure to that.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.890
So we added tagging.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:38.220
We don't have any tag clouds.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.100
I apologize to anybody
who's waiting for that.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.660
And tabs are easy.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.050
Just go up into the tag bar up here,
type your tag, hit Tab,

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:49.750
go to the next tag.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.930
In there, if I want to remove a tag,
I can just take it and

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:00.380
drag it off of the tag bar.

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.540
Very, very simple.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.740
And when I'm done, what do tags give me?

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:13.650
Well, I can do things like
click on the WWDC tag,

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:17.500
and I'll get a page of results
that shows me all of the things

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.900
that have been tagged with WWDC.

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:24.290
If I want to find things that have
been tagged with rumors and WWDC,

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.130
I can filter that down and
look just for those things.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.760
So it makes it very, very simple.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.880
Nothing's tender.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.840
And then up here,
you see a search dialog.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.460
That does exactly what you would expect.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.830
It'll search across the entire wiki and
find you all content that contains the

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:42.500
search term that you've typed in there.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.620
So moving back to the main page.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:52.240
You may have noticed that
the tags I put in there,

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.290
one of those tags was hot.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.640
This is actually Paris Hilton's
favorite feature.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.810
So putting the tag hot into any
item is kind of a special tag.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.700
And what that means is put that item
up here in the what's hot section

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.940
because that's your way of telling
people that this is very important and

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:09.580
you want them to look at it right away.

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:13.660
And like I said before,
Teams is a bunch of stuff.

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:15.920
The Wiki is just one piece of it,
and you should definitely check

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.080
out the session on Wednesday where
we go through everything.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.800
Thank you, Michael.

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.900
How cool is that?

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.340
We get the web.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:37.600
All right, so as Chris mentioned,
we have a session again

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.110
on Wednesday at 10:30.

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:44.040
And let me tell you,
you haven't seen anything yet.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.340
We've got so much more
in Teams to show you.

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:49.100
And you just got to come
to the session to see it.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.040
I want to leave you with four thoughts
really quickly about what you've

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.460
been seeing here inside of Teams.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:58.190
First off, integrated services in Search.

01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:02.130
When I go to the website,
when I go to a team site,

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.850
what I see on the Wiki is the same
thing as I see on the web log,

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:06.230
is the same thing I see on the calendar.

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:07.390
It's a shared experience.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.040
So it's very easy for
folks to get to and fro.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:13.820
Search, like Chris said,
is across all of the services.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.300
Tags.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.680
We've made it a first-class citizen.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:24.560
We want to push down the
organization of information down

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.140
to the folks who are doing it.

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:32.760
We've seen it every,
it's going to be across all the services,

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.180
and we really think it's going
to give people the ability to

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:36.180
kind of create organic hierarchy,
organic workflow.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:38.420
History.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.850
I'm a nerd, so I love version control.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.250
And this is version control.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.830
It's a common feature
in every single wiki.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.020
But what's neat about this
is wikis never forget.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.830
Every single change
I can go see who did it.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.320
I can see when they did it.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.710
I can see what they did.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.480
And probably the most interesting thing,
if you choose to actually

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.520
put comments in it,
it's the context of what they did.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.700
I often go to Wikipedia and I look
at the recent changes on Hot Pages

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.570
because it's just as interesting as the
content because you can see why people

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.060
are changing what they're changing.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.980
And finally, WYSIWYG.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.620
It's pretty.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.590
I get that it's pretty.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.620
That's not the point.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:17.500
The point is to lower the bar
in terms of accessibility.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.910
We want everybody in the organization
to be coming in and using this content

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:26.920
because we know that content becomes more
valuable the more that people can get in,

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.500
use it, and edit it.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.110
And that's why we want to make
it the simplest wiki out there.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:34.580
So learn more.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:34.880
Again.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.640
There's a Wednesday session at 10:30.

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.960
And we've got a special
guest for that as well.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.240
And we're going to have an amazing demo.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.080
And with that,
I will bring Greg Burns back up.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.580
Thank you.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.700
Thanks Michael.

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:54.500
So, we're going to wrap it up.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.820
So as you leave here,
I'd like you to remember four

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.790
things about Leopard Server.

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:00.700
The first is the server foundations.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:06.700
We've made improvements to the OS and
the services in Leopard Server,

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.330
and we've added new capabilities.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:12.320
We have 64-bit at all layers of the
operating system and new services like

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.740
Spotlight Server and Podcast Producer.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.330
Easy management.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:19.560
We've made the server much easier to
set up both the server and the clients,

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.710
and this is great for setting
up the server in small

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:23.300
businesses or in work groups.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.340
We have the iCal Server,
open source and open

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.600
standards with CalDAF,
and Teams, wiki and web services.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.210
So, you heard there's a lot of
sessions throughout the week

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.940
on all these new services.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.400
We also have labs throughout the week.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.580
There's the IT Lab on Level 1.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.350
We have times throughout the
week when we have engineers

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.820
from the Mac OS X Server team.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.440
And also, we have a lot of people from
the Mac OS X Server team.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440
And also other teams like the
Apple Remote Desktop team.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.440
So check your schedules
and drop by the lab.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.980
It's open from now until Thursday.

01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:57.020
And if you want more information,
our contact at Apple is Skip Levens.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.750
He's our server technology evangelist.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.400
You can contact him at skip@apple.com.
