00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.900
So, Apple product strategy for business.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.530
And as I mentioned,
we've been getting a little bit

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.400
more attention lately around our
enterprise use of our products.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
This is from Federal Computer Week.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.300
This is,
when you think about Apple computer

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.400
and Macintosh systems,
you probably don't think about servers,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.400
but think again.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.960
And this increased attention is partly,
and honestly,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.430
I think due to the fact that
we've transitioned to Intel,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.500
and for whatever reason,
I think there are people who

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.400
feel maybe more comfortable
in the IT space with Intel.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.190
But really,
I think what's driving this is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.400
that we have a complete platform
that is tuned for business.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.380
Starting from Mac OS X,
which is of course Unix-based,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.400
fits in very well in the server room.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.400
As well as on the desktop.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.450
On the desktop,
we are really the only environment

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.290
that combines the power of Unix,
plus the ability to run

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.400
Microsoft productivity applications
on that very same desktop.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.750
A very nice suite of pro applications
for companies that either have it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.400
as their business to manage media,
or as more and more is true,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.390
it's part of your
business to manage media.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.360
And the Apple applications for managing
media are really second to none.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.840
Servers and storage, of course,
since we've introduced

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.390
our One-U Server product,
and now as you've seen,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.400
are transitioning that
to a Quad Intel product.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.740
That is going to be, I think,
of increasing interest to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.400
people who are looking for that,
you know, not just a nicely designed,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.180
nice appearing product,
but a product that actually fits

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.630
into the server room and gives
you the price performance that

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.370
really drives everything there.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.400
Especially when you start
looking at heating issues.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.270
And you saw some of the heating
information earlier today.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.270
We're going to go a little
bit deeper into that.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.660
Service, of course,
Apple provides world class

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.400
service for our products.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.210
Sales, pro sales service and support that
really is tuned for businesses

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.400
and what businesses need.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.890
And then finally,
none of this works without the software

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.320
and the software produced by the
people who attend this conference.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400
We're at 22,000 titles and growing.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.140
In addition, of course,
we have a great number of other

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.400
software products in the world.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.400
We have a lot of software products.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
We have a lot of software products.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.600
We have a large number
of IT solution partners,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.400
many of whom are represented
here at this conference.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.400
People like Oracle, SAP, TIBCO,
Cisco System.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.580
Some nice point solutions, for example,
Backbone for enterprise

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.400
level backup of data.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.290
A lot of partners that were helping
us bring the Mac into the enterprise.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:06:57.200

[Transcript missing]

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.360
So talk a bit now about
Apple's established markets.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:10.400
And as we move out into the IT space,
there are some markets where we've been

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:16.600
present all along and actually provide
great examples of how IT challenges have

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.000
been met and met with Apple solutions.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.600
And we're going to have
some examples of that today.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:30.180
Examples of our established markets:
education, design, pro audio and video,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.280
science and technology, government.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.100
Some of these are enterprise
level deployments.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.670
For example,
education has some of the largest

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.600
institutional deployments around
that would give any Fortune 500

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.640
deployment a run for their money.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.660
And of course,
government tends to be large as well.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.090
I need to say no more.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.100
Design, pro audio and video,
science and technology.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.280
Both examples of smaller
medium-sized businesses,

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.100
but also are oftentimes a
portion of a large enterprise.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:07.240
So in pharma, you have the science and
technology desktops where they do

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.100
these days genetic engineering.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.970
Or in many Fortune 500 companies,
you have the IT shops.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.200
First experience with Macs was
in the audio and video in the

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.100
creative services in that shop.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.700
And they had to make those fit in.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.540
And so we're going to have some examples
of how we can fit in with the rest

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.670
of the corporate IT infrastructure.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.700
So the first one we're going to
talk about is Apple on campus.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.670
And as I mentioned,
the campus IT administrator

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.820
has all of the same issues
that any IT administrator has,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.690
plus some.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.690
And they are dealing with the
mission of educating their students,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.700
not just making money.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.810
They have to be on the leading
edge in order to take advantage of

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.700
the technology that's out there.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.600
The kinds of products we produce
make creation by the students

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.700
and the teachers very simple.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.700
Even things like iLife add to the
ability to create for the students.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.700
Broad distribution,
campuses are highly networked.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.300
They need to get their
content that's created,

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.700
whether it's courseware or student work,
broadly distributed on the campus.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.700
So that means XSERVs and XSERV raids.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.700
And then finally, mobility.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.700
And this is an area where education
is a big part of our lives.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.700
Education is a leading indicator.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:28.820
Education was the first place we saw
that laptop volume was going to surpass,

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.700
and it already has by a large margin,
desktop volume.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.700
And this will hit the
rest of our world as well,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.680
and is in the process of
hitting the rest of our world.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.590
But even beyond that,
hypermobility with the iPod.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.700
And you find large numbers of
students and teachers innovating

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.700
with how to integrate the MacBook,
the MacBook Pro,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.700
and the iPod for a complete
learning environment.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.700
So here to tell us a little bit about
that is I'd like to introduce Anton C.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.700
Harfman,
who is Associate Dean for Technology and

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.020
Facilities at the College of Design,
Architecture, Art,

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.700
and Planning at University of Cincinnati.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.700
So welcome.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.180
Thank you, Bud.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.900
Thank you so much, Bud.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.720
I really appreciate the honor.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.460
It's such an honor to present here.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.910
And let me start off by
apologizing for the tie.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.410
The College of Design, Architecture, Art,
and Planning is four schools

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.000
with a total of 13 programs.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.290
The College of Design,
the College of Architecture and

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.230
Interior Design,
the School of Art,

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.060
and the School of Planning.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.210
I'm sorry, those are all schools.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.680
It must be the tie.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.960
This is a quick tour of
our building as well.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.180
As you can see,
there are no right angles.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.400
If you're drunk,
I'm told the building does look straight.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.540
It's the first building on
the University's master plan.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.040
We have 2,400 students in our
college with 110 full-time

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.750
faculty and 30 plus staff.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.520
The University of Cincinnati itself
is a Research I institution

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.850
with 35,000 students.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.960
It's a very design-rich environment.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.340
We have a really broad collection of
contemporary signature architecture

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.800
on campus that makes this a
really incredible environment.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.050
This has all recently been
done in the last 10 years.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.000
The University of Cincinnati has
a history of Apple at our college.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.310
The history begins in 1999 when
we were unable to keep up with the

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.960
pace of technology and we couldn't
afford to maintain all the labs,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.190
so we asked our students to bring
their own personal computers,

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.480
which they did.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.360
They brought every variety of,
so you can imagine, Gateway, Heathkit,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:40.980
and so on.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.840
Only four students in our program in
architecture chose to bring an Apple.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.860
Huge monitors sitting on
these drafting tables made it

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.020
impossible to build a computer.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.420
It was impossible to build conventional
study models or do large drawings.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.770
And then furthermore, the studio faculty,
of which I was one,

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.470
were spending all of our time
solving IT and network issues

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.880
and no time teaching design.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.390
Well, I marched right into the
chair's office and said,

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.680
"We're either going to drop computers
from the curriculum or we're going

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.640
to move to a laptop environment,
and we're going to do it

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.560
with one platform only."
It was a hard sell at first,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.260
but as I made the argument,
they seemed to go along.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.180
Architecture, graphic,
and digital design all went that way,

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.260
and that was a good chunk of our
student population in the college.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.170
And all first-year students in
those programs came with PowerBooks.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.170
The others in the college
came with other stuff.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.000
The argument was pretty easy to make.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.500
They're minimal IT.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.540
We didn't want to invest
in IT in the school.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.040
We'd rather have another faculty member.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.690
They were very intuitive
and very powerful and

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.840
graphically interesting to use.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.660
And moreover, they were well-designed.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.860
If we're a college of design and we're
interested and curious about design,

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.200
we ought to be using
well-designed products as well.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.800
Practice what you preach, in other words.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.270
The first wave of this laptop tsunami,
of all of these laptops

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.840
arriving on our doorstep,
forced us to change some

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.580
things critically right away.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.460
The administrative structure
just wasn't working.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.430
We had these silos with individuals
reporting to other individuals,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.020
and when somebody in
their area wasn't working,

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.260
they were picking their nose.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.970
We immediately moved to
a horizontal structure,

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.740
made it more team-like,
and fit a little bit better

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.180
with the academic model.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.380
Physically, we were able to reduce
our labs one per year.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:34.380
We moved from six mediocre
labs to three high-end labs.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.260
The third one I didn't show a picture
of because it's the other one.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.710
So these are two of our high-end labs.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.100
The other thing that's interesting
with this many laptops in the

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.440
building is any classroom is
by default now a computer lab.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.070
The students all have really
pretty good computers,

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:57.180
and wherever we are,
we can make this a lab.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.020
We teach a lot of classes that way.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.870
In architecture,
it allowed us to get smaller

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.860
desks because no longer are
they doing these huge drawings.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.420
They're doing all of their stuff in
Photoshop or Illustrator on their

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.860
small laptops and printing out really
huge plots and pinning those up.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.730
So we could get by with smaller desks,
increase enrollment, more revenue.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:17.860
Yay.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:25.120
So the curricular changes that we
found necessary to make was to teach

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.980
IT fundamentals across the board.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.890
And we teach it across the college
at the freshman level as well.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.530
So in our first year,
all 520 of our freshmen

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.980
take the freshman class.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.980
They all sit in this room.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.790
It's quite amusing.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.810
It cuts across all 13 disciplines,
and they learn basic

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.860
things for the full year.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.050
They're learning things like
basic fundamental graphic skills,

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.980
3D motion, and web applications.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.310
This obviously is not
a first-year project,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.980
but this student was once
a first-year student.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.980
Other curricular changes.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.780
In architecture,
we teach this immersion studio.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.780
We force 18 credits,
totally integrated content.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:05.160
So the only way to manage all of this
was we forced our students to subscribe

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.470
to iCale so that they could tell
what's going on every week or every

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.780
day or every hour for that matter.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.780
As you can see,
that second week is pretty intense.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.250
The second wave of the tsunami allowed
us to make some critical changes in the

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.760
infrastructure and the virtual space.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.940
In the infrastructure,
we did an evaluation and decided

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.580
to support all these laptops.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:30.570
It would be advantageous to
move to XServe and XServe Raids.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.420
So we chose them because
of the hardware monitoring,

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:39.810
the headless installation and management,
as well as the swappability of the

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.580
hard drives and the flexibility
that gave us and the availability.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.540
The XServe X Raids,
we have currently 22 terabytes

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.530
of available storage.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.580
We give each of our students
4 gigabytes of storage.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.580
The video students,
it's basically on demand.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.380
Most of them get about 100 or so.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.180
Some of them get about
200 or 200 gigabytes.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.180
They're very powerful
and very easy to set up.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.370
Furthermore,
they're managed by one IT person for

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.180
all 1,200 students in the building as
well as all the Macs in the building.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.000
He's sitting right over here.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.180
His name is Pete Akins.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.470
If you have questions for him.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.470
At the IT reception,
he'll be there to answer all

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.200
the technical questions since
I have no clue what I'm doing.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.480
This has allowed us also to
develop a portal and management

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.540
infrastructure as well.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.190
We use out-of-the-box
solutions like Samba,

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.960
OpenLDAP, Kerberos, and so on.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.360
And most importantly,
we use an alter Apache, MySQL,

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.080
and PHP which come
native on the machines.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.450
And we use those basically
to develop our own intranet.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.350
We are not really totally satisfied with
the university's purchase of the web

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.960
portal for the student body at large,
so we've been developing our own

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.360
home folder and web management
and course management system.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.990
We call this DAP space.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.850
DAP is the acronym for Design,
Architecture, Art, and Planning.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.170
We have our own discussion and
bulletin board and wiki-based web

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.980
content management and a whole
bunch of other features to integrate

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.640
other databases like facility asset
enrollment management as well.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.960
And we custom develop these things
as we go and as we need a new tool.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.140
Culturally, as you can imagine,
this has had a huge

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.450
impact on our college.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.930
Seventy percent of our
students come with iPods.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.200
100% of them, though, have laptops,
so they're all podcasting,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.540
so it's just a question of mobility.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.750
But they all have laptops and
they're all downloading podcasts

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.600
of lectures and music and so on.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.690
Wireless, sort of.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.940
I say that because there's
a slew of people on the side

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.940
here who are all plugged in.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.400
We have the same plague.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.180
Even though we can download
anywhere in the building,

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.620
you can't recharge
anywhere in the building.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.870
While we're speaking,
the electricians are adding about

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.920
100 outlets to the public spaces of
our building so that the students

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.740
with their laptops can recharge.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.040
And I'd like to end with
this last two slides here.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.930
If you draw your eye to the right side,
upper right-hand corner,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.420
you'll see one of our newest students.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.680
His name's Ethan,
and he is a sculptor that

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:16.260
resides as the concierge in
that great hall in our building.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.860
And the interesting story
here is that the dean,

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.620
when he entered the building after
the weekend that it was installed,

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.680
really thought it was real
and yelled at him and said,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.040
Young man, you come down right now.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:27.920
And went and called security.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.700
security.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.480
Until someone told him he's not real.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.590
Even with a faux plug,
the students tried to plug into the

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.860
false plug there for quite some time,
which is why we're

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.640
adding these other ones.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.080
So thank you very much.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:53.700
Thanks a lot.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:00.620
This next customer is going
to be very interesting.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:05.440
This is actually all of it says
Apple in the studio and it is Apple in

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.980
a studio production environment,
but it's actually a story about

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.620
availability and scalability.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:18.120
And of course most CIOs understand
that when you're near the end of the

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.540
quarter and you have to close the book,
uptime becomes super important.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.430
And if you're down,
you hear from the CFO, the CEO.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.440
But nothing compares with a
production studio environment where

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.220
you're deadline based and that's
what we're going to hear about.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:40.660
24/7 availability is an absolute
necessity as well as scalability

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.760
so that you can have appropriate
fault tolerance and appropriate

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.260
performance to meet the needs.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:52.700
So of course Apple is well entrenched
in the studio market with production.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.720
We have products like
Final Cut Studio and Logic Pro for

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.400
sound and rock solid SAN servers
and XServe and XServe RAID for

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.220
meeting the needs of that market.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:09.980
I'd like to introduce JJ Franzen
who is CIO and technology

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.740
supervisor at South Park Studios.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.830
So JJ.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.000
Thank you, Bud.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.100
As Bud said,
I'm the technology supervisor

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.210
for South Park Studios.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.080
Some of you are probably asking,
what does that mean?

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.260
That means I have the
coolest job on the planet.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.200
I get to play with all the toys.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.120
The render farm, the file servers,
the workstations,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.290
even Matt and Trey's Xboxes.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.050
I touch it all.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.740
I get to play with everything.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.250
Another cool aspect of my job is I get
to know how everyone else does their job.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.520
I get to look over the shoulders of the
artists while they sketch new characters,

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.540
while they animate the other characters,
while they record audio

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.360
on the audio booths.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.730
I get to be part of every single
thing and see how the episodes evolve

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.360
over the course of a production.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.740
I'm also the guy who writes all those
little pieces of glue that production

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.720
requires to make things flow smoothly,
to get data from one part to the next,

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:06.360
and so on.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.340
But if I've done my job properly
while we're in actual production,

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.360
I'm the digital equivalent
of the Maytag repairman.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.360
I sit there and do nothing,
waiting for something to break.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.360
Hopefully nothing ever does.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.650
So, let's go over the production process
of making a South Park episode.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:31.360
South Park began as a cardboard cutout,
stop motion animated short that then

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.080
was decided to make a TV series out of.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.240
But the pilot for that TV series took
over two and a half months to develop.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.660
Obviously they couldn't do 13
episodes a year at that scale,

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.910
so they had to use computers.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:47.840
So we developed over the course
of nine years now a production

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.750
process that is very streamlined,
very organized, and very, very fast.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.440
First stage, the script.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.110
Most animated series,
or most TV series in general,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.300
start with a full script
before they do anything.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.970
We get a few pages.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.490
We get those few pages
Thursday before the Wednesday it airs.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.060
And we get a few more
pages every day after that,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.980
so we literally don't know what's
going to happen from day to day.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.780
Not until Tuesday around 9 or 10 when
we get the final pages of script.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.730
After we get that script,
we begin the storyboard process.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.100
And that's where we take those texts and
we actually convert them into images.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.180
We'll do a comic book version of the
episode to see how things looked,

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.240
how things are staged.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.100
This is also where we
design our characters,

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.100
our backgrounds, and color design.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.210
While that's going on,
Matt and Trey will go into

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.860
the audio booth and record
all the dialogue for the show.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.850
They even do the females
because you never know if

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.750
the audio is going to change,
so we don't bring our females

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.490
in until the very last minute.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.670
Once those two stages are done,
we begin the animatic stage.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.080
And that's where we take the
audio and those individual frames

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.270
of the storyboard and time out
the still frames to the audio.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.450
This gives the mat and tray a chance
to see how things are flowing.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.600
It also gives us a chance to see how
long each shot needs to be for animation.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.260
While the animatic stage is going on,
we have the setup stage.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:12.320
That's where we take those character
designs and background designs

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.640
and locations and model them.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.230
We get them rigged, get them going,
getting prepared for animation.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.650
After that's done, we go to lip sync.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.800
Lip sync is the thankless job.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.320
This is the one job where they sit there,
listen to the audio,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.590
and animate just the mouths.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.000
That's all they do.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.020
It's a thankless task,
but we're very dedicated to it.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.560
After all of that is done,
we can finally get to animation,

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.920
where a shot spends most of its time.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.390
This is where they'll do everything else.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.000
The bobbing heads, the blinking eyes,
the dancing, the talking,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.100
everything else is done there.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.190
And this basically is the primary
part of the iterative process where

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.640
we'll do a first pass at a shot,
send it through the pipeline,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.840
Trey will look at it if he likes it,
great,

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.850
if he doesn't he goes back through.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.610
Our render queue has evolved over
the years to the point that it's a

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.410
completely automated process now.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.880
The artist clicks a button,
and from then on out,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.680
the editor gets a signal saying
it's ready to be brought in.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.270
No one has to touch anything.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.380
It's a very smooth system.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.690
We're using Cube, XN, NFS.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.960
It's all very slick.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.930
We're using, in fact,
Shake to convert every single individual

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.060
frame into a QuickTime movie for import.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.290
So for those of you who like
Shake can say that Shake is used

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.140
on every shot in South Park.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.940
After that,
it goes to the editing bay where

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.240
Trey will actually sit down and
edit every part of every show.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.900
He's very directly involved
in the entire process.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.310
The retake process, as I mentioned,
we go through.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.830
It's a very iterative process.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:36.900
If Trey likes something, he's great.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.870
If he doesn't, he'll make notes.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.340
There have been times where a shot
will come through that completely

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.900
changes where he's going with the show.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.400
Just because of one little
extra thing an animator did,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.900
it completely inspires
him in another direction.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.050
After we finish all of that,
we get video locked,

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.900
which means no more animation is done.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.640
That's usually around 7:00 or 8:00 AM,
Wednesday, the day it airs.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.490
After we get video lock,
audio still has another

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:03.000
couple hours synchronizing
audio to the final animation.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.230
Once all that's done,
we then roll off the videotape,

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.150
take it for color correction,
and then upload it from Comedy Central's

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:12.040
Los Angeles office to the
New York office where they broadcast it.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.970
That usually happens about an hour,
hour and a half before

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.070
it goes on the air.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.540
Now, on very rare occasion,
if everyone's really kicking

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.070
butt and we're all doing great,
there's tenth stage we reach.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.760
Okay, so this is how we do it.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.040
This is what we use.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.560
We use all the standard protocols.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.990
We have servers dedicated
for every individual job.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.460
We have a server dedicated just
to serving data to the artists.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.500
Another one just serving
data to the render farm.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.990
Another one is just dedicated to
converting those frames to QuickTimes.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:51.000
We have another one
dedicated just doing backup.

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.000
You can see all the tools we use.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.600
And from the entire staff
and crew of South Park,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.170
I'd like to thank all you developers
for making those tools and

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.910
enabling us to make the show we do.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.000
Thank you.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.160
Thanks a lot.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.800
Okay,
finally we have Apple in the laboratory,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.700
Apple in science.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:28.560
And this is a great example of a
challenge which is to build a very

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.440
highly collaborative environment
and to leverage open source.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.790
In the sciences, Mac has actually taken
off in the last few years.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:43.880
Part of that is due to the interest in
visualization and of course the great job

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.620
we do at providing visualization tools.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.590
And the Cinema HD display
has helped a lot there.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.040
As well as groundbreaking
applications from third parties,

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.280
but also open source.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.460
Especially in the bioinformatics
field where most of the applications

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.840
that are used in that field were
written in the era of open source.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.430
That means in the 1990s or later.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.440
And so what this has led to is a
great amount of sharing in that

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.640
community between researchers,
both commercial researchers as well

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.920
as researchers at institutions.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.330
StructureBiologyGrid.org,
I think associated with

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:30.520
the Harvard Medical School,
but actually a distributed

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:35.640
collaborative environment is
going to be talked about by Dr.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.770
David Goharra from
Washington University School of

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.360
Medicine Center for
Computational Biology.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.690
So, David.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.590
Thank you, Bud.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.640
It's really a great pleasure to be
here today and for the opportunity

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.650
to be able to share with you some
of the work that we've been doing

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:59.210
and some of the ways that we've
integrated Apple technology in the lab.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.740
But before I do that,
I'd like to give you a little bit

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.810
of background about SB Grid and
some of the things that we do.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.830
SBGrid started in the
lab of Steve Harrison at

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:11.580
Harvard Medical School out of a
need to unify and standardize the

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.010
software and computing environments
that his lab members were using,

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.660
with a specific focus on
x-ray crystallography,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.900
electron microscopy, and NMR.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.980
My primary responsibility as part
of SBGrid is to identify performance

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.680
bottlenecks in our users' calculations
and then to develop solutions to help

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.900
them get those calculations done faster.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.380
Since its inception,
SBGrid has expanded to 14 other

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:39.000
institutions across the country,
and we now have over 50 labs and

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:43.680
support over 500 users with software.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.250
Almost all of the applications we
use are open source software and

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.770
can be run from the command line.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.600
And so any system we use has
to provide a UNIX environment.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.600
And because we're dealing
with open source applications,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.580
we need developer tools
and performance tools.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.600
We need everything that's
required for porting,

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.600
building,
and optimizing open source applications.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.190
As structural biologists,
molecular visualization is very,

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.520
very important to us.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.600
We want to be able to relate
structure to function,

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.600
and so we need to see what's going
on with large molecular assemblies.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.820
And so having access to
high definition displays,

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.970
fast graphics cards,
and stereo graphics hardware

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.170
is not only important for us,
it's an absolute requirement.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.760
We typically tend to turn
over or upgrade our hardware

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.900
faster than we decommission it.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.560
And so anytime we bring new
system types into the mix,

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.700
they have to be able to work well
in a mixed computing environment.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.260
So interoperability is really key.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.250
But probably the most important thing
for us is the fact that the types

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.550
of problems that we deal with are
extremely computationally expensive.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.310
I'm going to give you an
example of that in a little bit.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.980
What's really key to us is the fact that
we need systems that are priced well,

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.400
that are fast, and that are reliable.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.630
And so what we really strive to do is
we want to minimize the bottlenecks that

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.850
are introduced by the calculation itself,
and have the science and the

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.830
understanding of that science
be the rate-limiting step

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.210
in everything that we do.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.480
And so having systems that
ship with multiple CPUs,

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.870
vector units,
and highly tuned vector numeric

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:23.400
libraries that we can use out of the
box are very important features for us.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.010
Our first entry into high-performance
computing solutions from Apple was

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.200
a 14-node XSERV G5 cluster.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.340
And that system was commissioned
primarily for some of the EM work that

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.320
was being done in the Harvard labs.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:39.860
On the desktop, we're using primarily
Power Mac G5s and iMac G5s.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.520
We've seen some of the
Intel Macs coming in as well.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.630
And in terms of our
graphics workstations,

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.760
we're still using the Power Mac G5s,
now with dual LCD displays.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:53.640
And in the case of stereo graphics,
we'll attach CRT monitors to those.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.640
So let me give you just one quick example
of how we've used the technologies that

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:04.400
ship with these systems to be able to
speed up some of our users' calculations.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.900
We had a user that was performing
a calculation that would take

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.100
about 10 days per iteration.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.790
And at the end of that,
he'd sit in front of the

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.440
graphics workstation,
move some things around,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.550
analyze the results, of course.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:16.990
That's what we were
referred to as analyzing it.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.470
And then he'd resubmit
it for calculation again.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.100
And so what this really meant was
that he was spending about three

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.340
days out of the month on this
actual portion of the project,

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.750
and the rest of the time he
was simply waiting for results.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:33.700
And so the performance tools that
are provided with Xcode Shark told

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.160
us immediately that we're spending,
with this particular application,

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.340
we're spending about 30% of our time
allocating and deallocating memory.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.400
And that this memory allocation turned
out to just simply be for scratch space.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.320
And so we could move that allocation to
the beginning of the program's execution,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.010
and we could immediately get the
runtime down to about seven days.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.060
Continuing on,
we could see that the program

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.520
was doing a lot of two things.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.530
It was moving data around,
it was transposing it,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.040
three-dimensional data set,
and it was calculating a lot of FFTs.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.600
And if you're on a Mac and you want
to do either one of those two things,

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.350
the first place you really want to
look is the Accelerate framework.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:12.620
Some of the fastest FFTs available
anywhere are in Accelerate.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.800
And so after integrating Accelerate,
we were able to get the

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.330
runtime down to about 5.6 days.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.550
And so then continuing on,
what we could see was that the

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.580
application was doing a lot of similar
operations on these large chunks of data,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.450
and that the operations that
were occurring over here could

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.950
be done independent of the
operations that were over here.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.300
And so then after
multi-threading the application,

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.650
we could get the runtime
down to about 3.7 days.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.900
And so at this point, I say, "Okay, hey,
that's not bad.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.850
Take it back to the user and to the
user's boss." And the user's boss

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.090
happened to actually be my boss.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.260
And the user's boss, who was my boss,
was happy, and so the user was happy,

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:45.100
and so I was happy.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:46.500
Great.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.500
And so normally we just sort of leave
it there and move on to something else,

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.900
but we didn't.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.780
In fact,
the story gets a little bit better

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:59.400
because what I realized is that in
thinking about the problem a bit more,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.830
the particular calculation that
this user was doing was inherently

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:07.300
a parallel calculation that was
masquerading itself as a serial one.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.370
And so we backed off on
the multi-threading code,

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:15.400
and instead I wrote a Cocoa app that
would break the job up into chunks,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.860
send it off to XGrid,
and then XGrid could farm it out.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:21.040
And so what we ended up with
is a calculation that was

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.300
taking 5.6 days on one CPU and
originally 10 days on one CPU.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.500
We could farm it out to 26 CPUs and
get the calculation down to 0.2 days,

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.300
or roughly about five hours.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.380
And so what this meant was that
the user could start the job

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.700
in the evening before he left,
and when he got back in in the morning,

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.590
the results were now waiting for him.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.880
So it was a complete opposite.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.630
And this is just one example of how
we've been able to take advantage

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.570
of some of the technologies that
ship with Apple hardware and

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.300
software to really get some great
performance out of our applications.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.280
And so when people come up and ask me,
you know, "Well, why OS X and why Apple?"

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.820
I usually respond with,
"Well,

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:02.420
why not Apple?" Almost everything we need
comes in the package with the system,

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.270
ready to go out of the box.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.240
And if we add up all the features that we
use and factor in price and performance,

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.270
reliability, interoperability, Unix,
it simply makes sense for us.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.200
And given the announcement
that was made this morning,

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.560
it makes more sense,
given the hardware that's now

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.200
going to become available to us.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.200
And so this is why we use Apple.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.200
This is why we continue to use Apple.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.190
And that's it.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.200
Thank you very much.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.200
Great.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.200
Thanks.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:38.190
Thanks a lot.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:42.460
Before we get into our next session,
I just want to say thank

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.470
you to these customers.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:49.800
And really, customers like these are
worth their weight in gold.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:55.850
Because what they do is they push
us on issues of price performance,

00:43:55.850 --> 00:44:03.550
scalability, availability, manageability,
and really help us to focus on

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.740
innovative ways to solve those problems.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.910
And also give examples to the rest
of the industry as to innovative

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:12.570
ways to solve those problems.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.580
And again,
thank you for coming to speak here.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:24.300
Next, we're going to talk about XSERV as
well as OS X Server Leopard.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.620
For XSERV, the hardware,
we're going to ask Michael Culbert,

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:32.850
who's Distinguished Engineer, Scientist,
Technologist in

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:35.160
Apple Hardware Engineering.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:46.160
Michael,
you're going to talk about XSERV.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:54.590
Thanks a lot.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.400
Let you take it over.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.400
Thank you.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.400
Hello.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.060
So we're done.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.040
It's been quite a year.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:14.920
XServe is the last product that we'll
be shipping as part of the transition,

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.420
but it's also the
fastest and the coolest,

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:18.490
and was one of the most fun.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.640
It has two dual-core
Intel Xeon processors in it,

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:26.880
64-bit throughout,
and of course supports tremendous

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.000
amount of performance and memory.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.910
We're going to go through that.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:35.530
The dual-core Intel Xeon that's
been codenamed Woodcrest is the

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.430
new Core 2 microarchitecture.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.820
It's full 64 bits throughout,
1.33 GHz front side bus,

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.140
this thing screams.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.340
Four megabytes of shared L2,
which is really, really important for

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.240
these high performance,
particularly in the science

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:53.320
and video industries where a
lot of rendering and a lot of

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.300
manipulation of data needs to happen.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:46:00.100
It's also got the first full 128-bit
vector engine that Intel has done.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:03.370
It's optimized for power efficiency,
as you'll see in a little bit,

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.870
and it's built using their most
advanced 65 nanometer process.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.700
Now, it's over five times
faster than the XSERV G5.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:20.020
5.4 times on integer specint
rate and about 3.7 times on

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.330
floating point specFP rate.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:29.350
has superior power efficiency,
3.88 times more compute per watt

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:33.030
than the Intel Xeon that it replaces.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.320
And as you notice,
the PowerPC G5 was actually not

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.060
much better than that original
Intel Xeon in this metric.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.590
So it's a tremendous improvement
in density that you can achieve

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:48.400
in a data center or in compute
in the same physical volume.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.860
It's a very high bandwidth
server architecture.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.030
We focused a lot of time and
effort making sure this thing can

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:59.140
really behave well as a server
as well as a compute engine.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.730
So we have 21.3 gigabytes a
second of processor bandwidth

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.240
to those two processors.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:09.750
We have a 256-bit wide,
667 megahertz memory system.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:13.030
Again, very, very well balanced,
21 gigabytes a second of

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.500
main memory bandwidth.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.700
Dual 8x PCI Express expansion slots.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.000
That's two gigabytes a second per slot.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.710
So you can get quite a bit of file
system bandwidth if you're using

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:26.200
this directly with an XServe RAID as
part of an XAN or anything like that.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.240
Very, very high I/O bandwidth.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.040
And of course the built-in drives.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.000
We now support SATA and SAS drives.

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:39.200
So you can actually get tremendous
performance with the drives built in.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.980
As you can see, scientific benchmarks,
LINPACK is used.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:47.300
To demonstrate the
overall system throughput.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:52.970
So you have tremendous memory system,
processor, and disk performance

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.700
that lead up to a very,
very good LINPACK result.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:01.270
Almost three times faster in
double precision and 3.2 times

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.450
faster in single precision.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.300
Super fast memory back set up,
fully buffered DIMMs, 2x the capacity,

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.390
32GB in a single 1U system,
increased high availability features

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:18.150
to keep these things up and running,
ECC with on-demand scrubbing,

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.420
CRC protection of the data,
so the transactions between the

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.990
memory DIMMs and the systems
are protected with CRCs,

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:30.650
giving the system the ability
to recover from transient errors

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.810
rather than coming to a halt.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.540
There's massive memory
bandwidth in this machine,

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.620
2.1 times more than
the original XServe G5.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:41.000
And that is what helps reflect
the benchmarks you saw earlier.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.740
Tremendously flexible storage.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.830
The SATA, of course, is no small feat.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:52.390
2.25 terabytes of internal hot-plug
storage in this 1U machine.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.240
24x7 server rated drives,
very very important.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.460
And of course, if you want really
really high performance,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.960
with the SAS drives you
get 125 MB/s per drive,

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.420
3.5 ms of seek.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:09.090
These are ideal for large
database applications,

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:13.020
anything that really has very
very I/O intense operation.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.730
As you can see,
this is just comparing SATA and

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.240
SAS in the same machine.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.400
Both of them are quite fast,
but the SAS is really unbelievable.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.840
125 megabytes a second.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.340
Remember, you have three of those drives,
so you actually have three times

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.180
that bandwidth if you stripe them.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.560
And the seek time means that
for large data sets with random

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.810
access behavior like a database,
you have tremendously high

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.970
performance right in the box.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.300
And then of course the I/O.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.810
We have two, as I said,
two by eight PCI Express card slots.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.440
One is a standard slot
for 6.8 inch cards,

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.140
so fiber channel cards and the like.

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.300
And one is actually a full 9
inch slot which allows you to

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:56.130
put fairly large graphics cards
and other things in that slot.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.720
There's 50 watts of total
power available for the slots.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.400
And the long slot can
actually support PCI X cards,

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.450
which gives you the ability
to use cards that haven't yet

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:09.890
transitioned to PCI Express in
the same server form factor.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.910
So, there were a lot of customer
requested features which you guys

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.900
have been waiting for for a while.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:20.600
We have dual core processors,
we have redundant power supplies,

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:24.400
we have remote lights out management,
which I'll demonstrate in a minute,

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.390
and built-in graphics.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.360
The built-in graphics does not
occupy one of those two slots,

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.670
so you get the graphics
and the two slots.

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.400
So, take the cover off this thing.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.500
There's some other very,
very subtle but important

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:42.900
improvements as well.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:48.900
This machine has a tremendous amount
of thought put into the thermal design.

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:53.350
It's actually quite a bit
quieter than its predecessor and,

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.490
very importantly,
has a very direct clean airflow

00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:58.900
path through the machine.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.900
So, even in a non-ideal machine room,
which a lot of these find their way into,

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:08.900
it can tolerate pretty adverse
environments with ease.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.900
Of course, we have the dual
redundant power supplies.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.880
The dual Intel processors
are in the center.

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.490
As you can see,
the airflow is straight through

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.670
the three drives in the front.

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:24.080
32 gigabytes of RAM on the side there.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.500
Not in front of the processor,
which a lot of other servers do.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.340
This is again making the thermal
environment substantially better.

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.700
The two PCI Express slots,
dual onboard gigabit Ethernet ports,

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:37.160
the built-in graphics, mini DVI,
and we didn't take anything off either.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.700
FireWire 800, USB 2,
the DB9 serial are all still there.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.370
Of course, this is really,
really important.

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:49.500
Redundant power supplies, hot swappable,
fully load sharing, you only need one of

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.500
them to run the machine.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.240
Again, the ECC, on-demand scrubbing,
embedded diagnostics,

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.300
and integrated software RAID.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.300
So the lights-out management.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.590
It's based on the IPMI 2.0 protocol.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.930
We can remotely power on/off
and restart the server.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.810
It's Ethernet access with encryption,
and the server monitor application,

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:10.100
which you're already familiar with,
will control this.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.100
So I'm going to demo it here.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.830
We have this rack over on
the side that's basically,

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.300
this laptop of course is
connected to the projector,

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.590
it's got wires hanging off of it,
but running the server monitor app,

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.100
you can see one of the machines here,
this little pip is reflecting

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.270
that it's on the net,
but it's off.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.680
See, it's half full.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.330
So we're going to go ahead
and power that machine on.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.990
And while we're at it,
we're going to take the top one here,

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.100
and if you watch the rack there,
you'll see the lights come on.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.100
We're going to take the top one here,
which is running,

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.070
and we're going to just go
ahead and shut that one down.

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:47.100
So you'll see, I don't know if probably
most of you can't see it,

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.590
but we did put them in
the top of the rack.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600
You can see the lights on.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.090
One of them go on and the other
one went off as it shut down.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.910
So, that's the demo.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:57.840
And it actually worked!

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:07.520
So anyway, and of course,
it's really the software that

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.640
makes this an amazing machine.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.900
We've built this incredibly
fast piece of hardware,

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:11.720
but guess what?

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:18.710
It has all of
Mac OS X Tiger Server in the box,

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.710
which makes it an
incredible server story.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.900
and to come tell us a lot
more about what's new in

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.450
Mac OS X Server for Leopard,
Greg Burns,

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:28.590
our Senior Director of Server and
Software Storage Solutions.

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.020
Thanks, Michael.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:39.770
So we've got three new updates
today actually in server software.

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:42.930
And the first one is
Tiger Server Universal.

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:46.060
This is an update to the
existing Tiger Server that

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:47.500
we shipped today on PowerPC.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.010
And as the name says, it's universal.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:51.890
It runs on the new Intel boxes.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:55.720
It runs on the Mac Pro and the XServe
as well as the other Intel Macs.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.300
And it's actually the first version
of the Mac OS X operating system

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.070
that's universal in a sense.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.070
And it runs on a single image.

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:04.530
What does that mean?

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:08.690
That means that a single image on
disk will boot Mac OS X server and

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.090
run it on both Intel and PowerPC.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:19.710
If you have a lot of servers
and you need to image them,

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.400
it makes your job vastly simpler.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.560
Of course,
it gives you access to the power

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.350
and the performance of the new
Mac Pro and the XServe and the 64-bit

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.820
address space of the Xeon processor.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.300
And we've made a few
enhancements in the OS.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:35.170
We've improved some of the locking
and data structure allocation in the

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:39.380
kernel to allow it to scale better
as a server on the new hardware.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.700
So that's Tiger Server Universal.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.640
Mac OS X servers completed
the transition to Intel,

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.520
and that's available now.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.970
Second product is XAN 1.4.

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.490
This is our storage
area networking product.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.600
And if you're doing a video workflow,
if you're consolidating

00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:00.200
storage behind your servers,
it's the fastest,

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:03.410
it's the highest performance
way to connect all your Macs

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.130
into a single storage pool.

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:09.700
It scales up to two petabytes
and it provides uptime through

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.630
redundant metadata controllers.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.230
So XAN does all this today.

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:14.010
So what's new?

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.640
Well,
I'm sure you've guessed it's universal.

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.900
So it runs on the new
Mac Pro hardware and AXSERVs and

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:24.300
you can mix and match Intel and
PowerPC systems on the same SAN.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:28.420
And we have one more feature
that's new in XAN 1.4 and that's

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.550
Access Control List support.

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:37.570
Up till now, XAN has been limited by
Unix access privileges,

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:41.200
and that's fairly difficult to map into
your workflows in your shared workgroups,

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.700
especially in video workgroups.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.620
And so we've removed that limitation,
and it's now fully compatible

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.130
with Tiger Access Control List.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:51.120
So you can map it to your workflow
and not have to map your workflow

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:53.300
into your access privileges.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.160
So XAN 1.4 has also made
the transition to Intel.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.640
So our biggest release today that
we're working on now is Leopard Server.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:05.670
This is going to be shipping
in the spring of 2007,

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.640
and we have a lot of new features coming.

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:09.730
So here's just a few.

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:11.420
The first is the iCal Server.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.850
This is a complete calendaring server.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.700
And it's got everything that you'd expect
from a full-fledged calendaring server.

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:25.660
So,
users can schedule events and meetings,

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.790
you can send invitations, receive them,
you can search free busy time, proxies,

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.200
access control,
all the features you'd expect.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.460
And the most important feature is
that it's built on an open standard,

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.200
CalDAV.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.200
So it not only works with
the iCal client in Leopard,

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:46.200
but it also works with other clients such
as Mozilla's Sunbird or OSAF's Chandler.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.200
We've designed it from the
ground up to be scalable.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.640
So you can start simple with
one server and then grow as you

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.200
need to with multiple servers
all sharing the same calendaring

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.200
database on the back end with XAN.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.830
And because we want to
promote the adoption of this

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.580
server as well as CalDAV,
we're actually releasing

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.790
the complete open source,
the complete source to the server as open

00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:12.580
source as the Darwin Calendar Server and
that will be available this

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:14.200
week under the Apache license.

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:25.290
So another new service
in Leopard is Teams.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.670
Teams is a wiki and a set of web
services that easily allows groups

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.700
or project teams to create and share
information using Leopard's server.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.940
We use wikis a lot inside of
Apple and they're really powerful,

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:41.210
but sometimes the usage model can
be really arcane and some of the

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:42.700
markup language is hard to use.

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.690
We've solved all that in Teams.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:45.700
Teams uses Ajax.

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.700
It's all truly what you
see is what you get.

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.920
It's direct editing.

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.700
If you can use a word processor,
you can use Teams.

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:53.720
And so Teams is new.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.900
It's a wiki service in Leopard's server.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.700
And it's more than just that.

00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:59.620
It also has a lot of
other services as well.

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.610
So there's shared group calendars.

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.680
You can publish information
through blogs and podcasts.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.860
So it's truly a rich set of services
for Teams to create and share content

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.700
using Leopard's server through the web.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:16.670
Now both Teams and iCal
Server actually use open directory.

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:17.700
They're actually integrated there.

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:22.700
So all of the information they need,
such as groups and shared contacts,

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:26.810
resources, rooms, locations,
other things like that,

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:28.660
are all now stored in open directory.

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.770
And so we've introduced another
application as well called the

00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:35.010
Teams directory that actually lets
normal users who need to work with

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.700
these entries create and manage these.

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.700
So you can create
project teams or groups.

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.700
You can manage their membership,
rooms and locations,

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.700
resources that are used by iCal.

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.700
All of these can be created
using Teams directory.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.930
using Teams directory.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:53.760
Another new feature in Leopard
Server is streamlined setup.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:55.840
Tiger Server was already
very easy to set up,

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.010
and we've made it even simpler.

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.600
So it's very quick to get
the server up and running.

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:02.600
But also, it's not just the server,
it's also the clients as well.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.360
We've automated the client setup,
so all your applications in the

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:09.190
client that work with the server,
such as mail, chat, calendaring,

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:12.510
time machine, etc., can all be easily
configured to work with the

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.060
server in just a few clicks.

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.730
So if you need to set up a server
with a collection of clients,

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:19.450
it's very easy, very quick,
and there's truly no day-to-day

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:20.580
management that goes into it.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.900
And in addition, as part of our server
management enhancements,

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.640
we've also integrated backup.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.530
So now the server uses time
machine to backup your server

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.160
settings and data as well.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.990
Spotlight Server allows you to easily
search for content both locally

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:39.200
and now on your server as well.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.980
So in Leopard,
when you do a Spotlight search,

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.000
it will transparently search for all the
content on your mounted server volumes.

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:49.660
There's no configuration required
and it'll support all the features,

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:53.000
the new features of Spotlight
such as advanced search queries.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.840
On the server,
everything happens automatically.

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.000
You don't need to configure it.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.880
The indexing happens automatically
for all your content.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.370
It's done in the background at a lower
priority so it doesn't interfere with

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.000
the performance of your services.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.300
And of course, as you would expect,
it adheres to the file access

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.100
privileges so people only see
the results for the files that

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.000
they're actually allowed to access.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.160
We have another new service
called Podcast Producer.

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:19.400
Podcast Producer is an end-to-end
solution for capturing,

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.500
encoding, and publishing content
on the web as a podcast.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:27.380
It's great for people who quickly and
easily need to be able to capture audio

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.010
or video feeds and publish them out.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.550
You can set up an automatic workflow
so that you can capture video or

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:35.710
audio content on a Leopard client.

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:39.460
It's automatically uploaded to the server
where it can be encoded in any number

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.560
of formats that QuickTime supports.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.760
And then it's published out to
the web as a podcast via RSS.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.490
It's integrated with Open Directory to
control who can publish

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.300
content through your services.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.500
And all the encoding is
hosted on top of XGrid.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.050
So you can start with a single server,
but then you can grow as

01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.260
your encoding needs grow.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:04.060
So it's a great end-to-end solution
for rapidly capturing content

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.560
and getting it out to the web.

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:18.100
So the iCal Server, Teams Wiki,
Spotlight Server, Podcast Producer,

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.510
these are a few of the major
new services in Leopard Server.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:23.300
There's a whole bunch more.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.110
We have clustering in the mail services.

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:30.840
We have a federation of instant
messaging servers with iChat Server 2.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.930
We have the ability to host
distributed computing without a

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.600
dedicated controller in XSquare 2.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.710
As well as in the CoreOS foundations,
we have the ability to

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:43.270
perform 64-bit computing now
at all layers of the system.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.960
So there's a lot of stuff that's new.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.140
We don't have time to go
into all of it right now,

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.990
but the good news is there's
another session right after this,

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:53.980
the Mac OS X Server overview session.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.560
We're going to spend that whole
session going more into Leopard Server,

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.600
so I hope I'll see you there.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.280
Thank you.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.490
Thanks Greg.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:16.420
So, to summarize,
things we're focused on for business:

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:19.540
standards-based,
that's been true all along,

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:28.730
interoperable, especially with Windows,
best price performance, open source,

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.500
and of course security.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:36.270
Now, at this WWDC we actually have a
lot of things going on that are of

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:39.470
interest to the IT professional.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:46.610
We have sessions,
or actually labs downstairs,

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:48.500
right across from the IT lab.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.120
Apple in the Lab,
which is scientific computing,

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.500
Apple in the Studio, Apple on the Campus.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.500
You should especially go take
a look at Apple in the Lab.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.500
One of the things we have there is
a smaller version of the IT lab.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.720
If you heard about the
Hyper Wall at UC Irvine,

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.460
we've got a smaller version of that,
which is a huge number of pixels

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.300
done with a mosaic of displays.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.310
We also have community
areas in digital media,

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:16.600
system administration,
and scientific computing,

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.690
and as I mentioned,
the IT lab across from the

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:22.500
Apple Lab Studio and Campus.
