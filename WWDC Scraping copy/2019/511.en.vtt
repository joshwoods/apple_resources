00:00:01.516 --> 00:00:06.036
[ Music ]

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:08.846
>> Hello, I'm Tim Hatcher an

00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:10.066
engineer on the WebKit Team.

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.886
I'm going to talk about

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:13.406
Supporting Dark Mode in Web

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:13.876
Content.

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:18.036
When macOS Mojave introduced

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:20.056
Dark Mode, users and developers

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:21.926
naturally began to ask about web

00:00:21.926 --> 00:00:22.766
content.

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:25.766
Over the decades web content has

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.166
traditionally been light in

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.356
color leading to a very bright

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.966
experience when mixed among

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.716
newly Dark Mode aware apps.

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:36.036
The WebKit team has been working

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.306
to standardize a way for

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:39.416
developers to style web content

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.486
for Dark Mode, which I'm happy

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:43.026
to announce is available in

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:45.786
Safari 12.1 on macOS Mojave and

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:50.876
with iOS 13's system wide dark

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:53.266
appearance, you will see the

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.996
same Dark Mode styling for web

00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:57.106
content in Safari for iOS.

00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:01.116
Throughout this video I'll be

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:03.486
using Safari in my examples, but

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:04.566
this support is not just

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.706
available in Safari.

00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:08.936
It is also available in mail and

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.806
in your app when showing content

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:11.636
in web views.

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.056
There are three areas I want to

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:16.006
cover in this video.

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:18.826
One, general styling support for

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:19.836
Dark Mode on the web.

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:23.296
Two, some specific cases that

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:24.696
apply to email messages.

00:01:25.496 --> 00:01:27.146
And, three, tools you can use to

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:28.966
debug web content in Dark Mode.

00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:32.266
Let's get started.

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:35.986
I've been working on a new blog

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:37.526
to document some recent trips

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:38.896
I've taken around California.

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:42.376
While designing the site to be

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:43.816
responsive for mobile and

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:45.976
desktop visitors, this would be

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:47.586
a good time to add support for

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:48.276
Dark Mode.

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.446
Dark mode can be viewed as a

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:52.026
progression of responsive web

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:54.646
design, another way to adapt to

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:56.746
the circumstances of the device.

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:59.416
It is important to note that

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:01.336
Safari and WebKit will not auto

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:02.506
darken your content.

00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:04.716
As the web developer, you are in

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:06.536
control of how your content will

00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:08.756
appear to users using the dark

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:09.795
system appearance.

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:12.236
Let's take a look at how we can

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.846
transform this light page design

00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:16.546
into a Dark Mode ready site.

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:18.866
The main way to signal that your

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.986
content supports Dark Mode is to

00:02:20.986 --> 00:02:22.996
adopt the new color scheme style

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.716
property currently being

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:26.986
specified for inclusion in the

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:28.226
CSS standard.

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:31.016
Specifying the values light and

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:32.896
dark on the root element lets

00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:34.416
the rendering engine known both

00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:35.646
modes are supported by the

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:36.456
document.

00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:39.046
This changes the default text

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:40.216
and background colors of the

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:42.386
page to match the current system

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:44.436
appearance, standard form

00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:47.116
controls, scrollbars and other

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:49.236
named system colors also change

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.376
their look automatically.

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:53.246
Let's take a look at how adding

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:54.606
that property to my blog

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:55.556
affected things.

00:02:57.346 --> 00:02:59.096
You can see the background color

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:01.126
changed from white to black and

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:02.676
most of my text completely

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:03.816
disappeared into the black

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.796
background; that was not what I

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:06.576
was expecting.

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:08.746
Let's take a look at some of the

00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:11.036
style rules for this page to see

00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:11.846
what is happening.

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:15.526
Here are the main style rules

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:16.726
for the affected areas of the

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:17.306
page.

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:20.646
For the text that disappeared

00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:22.266
the black was being set as the

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:23.456
text color on the body.

00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:25.686
I also have a dark gray text

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:27.406
color for the level 1 headings,

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:28.976
which doesn't have a high enough

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:30.226
contrast with the black

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:30.826
background.

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:33.276
By default, the text color of

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:34.656
the body will be black and light

00:03:34.656 --> 00:03:34.966
mode.

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:37.956
Since that is what I wanted on

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:39.786
this page I can just delete the

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.506
color property override from my

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:42.416
style sheet.

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:44.366
Now that I'm using the color

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:46.086
scheme property, the default

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:47.556
text and background color will

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:49.426
both automatically change to the

00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:50.656
Dark Mode values.

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:53.526
For the other colors in my style

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:55.566
sheet that I want to keep, I can

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:57.336
use something called CSS custom

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:58.976
properties otherwise known as

00:03:58.976 --> 00:04:01.206
CSS variables to centrally

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:02.886
define them for use throughout

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:04.146
my site style sheets.

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:06.846
Using CSS variables makes it

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.746
very easy to later adapt the

00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:09.976
style sheet for Dark Mode.

00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:11.976
Let's see how that will work.

00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:16.016
We simply take the color values

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:17.875
and move them to a central place

00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:19.606
like the root element rule we

00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:21.125
added for the color scheme

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:21.776
earlier.

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:25.846
For these colors we define a

00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:27.826
variable name signified by a

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:29.356
double hyphen prefix.

00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:33.086
Now we can return to the

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:35.136
original style rules where I am

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:36.816
still using the static color

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:40.366
values and change them to use

00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:41.596
the variables we defined

00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:44.046
referencing them by name using

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:45.876
the VAR function which looks

00:04:45.876 --> 00:04:46.466
like this.

00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:48.906
This style sheet is now ready to

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:50.706
support a dark color scheme.

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:54.586
Like responsive design

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.366
breakpoints for different device

00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:58.336
widths, we can use a media query

00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:00.436
to conditionalize for Dark Mode.

00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:02.726
Specifically, if the user

00:05:02.726 --> 00:05:04.486
currently prefers a dark color

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:04.996
scheme.

00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:10.106
We can override the same CSS

00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:11.636
variables we defined earlier for

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:13.996
light mode with Dark Mode

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:15.436
appropriate color values.

00:05:16.076 --> 00:05:17.186
Now let's take a look at what

00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:18.556
the page looks like with these

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:19.456
changes applied.

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:22.436
We go from this where we only

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:23.976
added the color scheme property

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:26.936
to this where the text and

00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:29.196
header colors properly adapt to

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.026
the dark appearance, but what

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:31.926
about images?

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:33.866
Like the hero picture here of

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:34.836
the Mojave Desert.

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:37.996
The Mojave Desert image is

00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:39.456
included by an image element

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.266
that is sourcing a JPEG on my

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:41.746
server.

00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:44.116
We can easily adapt this code

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:46.026
using another responsive design

00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:46.556
technique.

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:49.086
Specifically, the picture

00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:50.696
element, which is a great way to

00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:52.336
source multiple versions of an

00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:54.456
image based on various device

00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:56.796
characteristics using the same

00:05:56.796 --> 00:05:57.736
media queries.

00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:00.316
Here I specify an alternate

00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:01.976
image of the Mojave Desert at

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:04.206
night using the same media query

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:05.496
that was used earlier for the

00:06:05.496 --> 00:06:07.256
Dark Mode colors I can

00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:09.256
conditionally load a night image

00:06:09.256 --> 00:06:11.096
for users that prefer a dark

00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:12.096
color scheme.

00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:15.076
So we go from this where I was

00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:16.576
using one image for both color

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:19.406
schemes to this where the desert

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:20.986
image is adapted to the dark

00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:23.336
appearance and now the site is

00:06:23.336 --> 00:06:26.356
ready for both dark and light

00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:27.196
appearances.

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:31.216
To recap you want to use the new

00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:32.886
color scheme property to declare

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:34.346
support for light and Dark

00:06:34.346 --> 00:06:34.846
Modes.

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:36.646
This informs the rendering

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.516
engine what color schemes your

00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:40.866
content was designed for so it

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:43.116
can adapt the default colors and

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:44.326
controls to match.

00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:48.836
When the default colors are not

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:49.916
enough, use the

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:51.556
prefers-color-scheme media query

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:52.766
for custom values.

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:55.656
You can use the same media query

00:06:55.796 --> 00:06:57.216
along with other responsive

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:59.426
images in the picture element

00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:02.116
for Dark Mode ready sources and

00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:04.806
consider using CSS variables

00:07:05.086 --> 00:07:06.646
when adopting color schemes.

00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:08.406
It will be easier to maintain

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.356
both appearance modes across

00:07:10.356 --> 00:07:10.976
your content.

00:07:12.116 --> 00:07:13.796
That brings us to Dark Mode and

00:07:13.796 --> 00:07:14.746
email messages.

00:07:16.026 --> 00:07:18.156
Just like mail in macOS Mohave

00:07:18.306 --> 00:07:20.156
simple email messages composed

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:22.786
directly in mail on iOS 13 are

00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:24.936
ready to go in both light and

00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:27.196
dark appearances even if they

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.306
include in-line image

00:07:28.306 --> 00:07:29.736
attachments like you see here.

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:32.356
This is the case because of

00:07:32.356 --> 00:07:33.606
mail's auto darkening

00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:35.936
transformations that get applied

00:07:36.226 --> 00:07:38.056
to these simple email messages.

00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:42.246
However, if you are an email

00:07:42.246 --> 00:07:43.866
template designer creating

00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:45.546
designs for a campaign that

00:07:45.546 --> 00:07:47.476
includes remotely loaded images,

00:07:48.056 --> 00:07:49.376
you will need to adopt the same

00:07:49.376 --> 00:07:50.966
styling techniques I covered

00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:52.606
earlier for web content.

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.506
Without adopting the color

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.076
scheme property mail will

00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:57.786
display your email message in

00:07:57.786 --> 00:07:59.366
the light appearance and will

00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:01.246
not employ any auto darkening

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:03.166
transformations that simple

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:04.516
email messages receive.

00:08:05.696 --> 00:08:07.706
Here is the same email message

00:08:07.836 --> 00:08:10.266
with Dark Mode styling including

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:11.736
the color scheme declaration.

00:08:12.236 --> 00:08:13.946
It is now perfectly adapted to

00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:15.356
the dark system appearance.

00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:19.296
To recap simple email messages

00:08:19.296 --> 00:08:20.996
will auto darken even if they

00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:22.106
include in-line image

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:24.556
attachments and rich email

00:08:24.556 --> 00:08:27.256
messages with remote images like

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.226
custom email marketing campaigns

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.086
will use the light color scheme

00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:31.846
by default.

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.405
You can declare support for the

00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:36.106
dark color scheme in your

00:08:36.106 --> 00:08:38.476
marketing email messages and use

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.376
the media query for custom color

00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:41.876
and image customizations.

00:08:43.936 --> 00:08:45.666
Now let's talk about tools to

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:46.916
debug Dark Mode content

00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:48.676
specifically Web Inspector.

00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:51.386
In macOS, we added the dark

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:53.306
appearance to Web Inspector when

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:54.806
your system is in Dark Mode.

00:08:55.316 --> 00:08:57.186
This was a very popular request

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:58.806
from web developers, and I'm

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:00.426
very happy we have it now.

00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:03.296
Not only did we add the dark

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:04.796
appearance there are a couple

00:09:04.796 --> 00:09:06.496
tools to help you debug your own

00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:07.776
content in Dark Mode.

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:10.626
The first is a new color scheme

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:12.616
toggle in the elements tab that

00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:14.276
will change the page appearance

00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:16.136
without requiring you to toggle

00:09:16.136 --> 00:09:17.696
the entire system appearance

00:09:17.696 --> 00:09:18.496
every time.

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:21.096
So if you like using Dark Mode,

00:09:21.476 --> 00:09:23.166
you can quickly test how your

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.256
pages will look in the light

00:09:25.256 --> 00:09:26.726
appearance with this button.

00:09:29.146 --> 00:09:31.426
Like before the style sidebar

00:09:31.426 --> 00:09:33.146
shows any rules that match for

00:09:33.146 --> 00:09:35.526
the selected element including

00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:36.716
any media queries.

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:39.476
In this case, you can see the

00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:41.176
prefers color scheme media query

00:09:41.176 --> 00:09:43.696
definitions of color variables

00:09:43.696 --> 00:09:45.196
on the WebKit.org site.

00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:48.016
And that is Dark Mode and Web

00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:48.656
Inspector.

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:50.346
Check out some of the other

00:09:50.346 --> 00:09:52.116
Safari and WebKit sessions for

00:09:52.116 --> 00:09:53.836
details about other great new

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:55.836
features in Web Inspector for

00:09:55.836 --> 00:09:57.026
Safari 13.

00:09:58.136 --> 00:09:59.656
In summary, remember that web

00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:01.376
pages and rich email messages

00:10:01.376 --> 00:10:02.896
need to opt into Dark Mode.

00:10:03.396 --> 00:10:05.346
Safari and WebKit will not auto

00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:06.556
darken your content.

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.276
For simple email messages you

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.196
don't have to worry.

00:10:10.606 --> 00:10:12.196
Mail darkens them to match the

00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:14.046
system appearance automatically

00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:16.066
and now you can use Web

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:17.716
Inspector to test your content

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:19.536
in light and Dark Modes with the

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.016
new color scheme toggle in the

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:21.876
elements tab.

00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:24.126
I look forward to seeing what

00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:25.496
you will do with this support

00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:27.476
and how your sites and apps will

00:10:27.476 --> 00:10:29.286
look in Dark Mode on Mac and

00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:29.946
iOS.
