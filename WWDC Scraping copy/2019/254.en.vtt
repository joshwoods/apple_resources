00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:04.500
[ Music ]

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.876
>> Good morning everyone.

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:16.976
>> Good morning.

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:19.576
>> My name is Jordyn Castor and

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:21.056
I work here at Apple on the

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:23.146
Accessibility Design and Quality

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:23.636
Team.

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:29.456
I'm so excited to be here today.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:32.735
Accessibility is built into our

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:34.496
hardware and software design

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:35.446
here at Apple.

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:39.356
We believe accessibility is a

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:41.606
human right and it's one of our

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:42.476
core values.

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:46.206
When I download an app, there's

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.566
an expectation that it just

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:49.356
works.

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:51.866
And I'm able to access all of

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.266
the buttons, controls, and

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.206
information using VoiceOver.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:59.386
To be honest, I give an app a

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.166
first 30 second glance and if I

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.776
can't access any of the

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:06.236
functionality, I delete it.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:08.896
Now, I really, really want to

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:09.956
use your applications.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.766
I do. But, one of the most

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.916
crucial aspects to our built-in

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:17.346
features like VoiceOver, Speak

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:20.496
Screen, and Voice Control being

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:22.156
able to access the functionality

00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:24.406
of your app is by the labeling

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:26.186
of your buttons, and text

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.496
fields, controls, and other

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:29.026
elements.

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:33.866
So today, I'm going to talk to

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.956
you about what an accessibility

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:38.616
label is, understanding the

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:40.646
context for writing great

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:43.496
labels, and best practices.

00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:48.446
So, let's -- so what is an

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:49.556
accessibility label?

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:55.056
Well, the definition is pretty

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:55.456
short.

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:57.916
It's a localized string that

00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:59.736
succinctly identifies the

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.096
accessibility element.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.836
But let's unpack that a bit.

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:06.706
Identifies the accessibility

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:07.106
element.

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:09.466
What does that mean exactly?

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.906
It's a human readable, human

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:15.146
understandable label that gives

00:02:15.186 --> 00:02:17.336
context and meaning for the

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:19.326
elements in your app.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.756
And writing the code is pretty

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:23.466
simple too.

00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:26.026
It's just getting or setting a

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:26.446
string.

00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:28.826
But I get it.

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:30.496
It's actually pretty difficult

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.766
to accurately label the elements

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:34.306
in your app.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.866
And as it turns out, that's all

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.286
about the context.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.666
So that's what I'm going to help

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:44.066
you understand in the next few

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.026
minutes, is the importance of

00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:48.486
understanding context.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.776
So, let's dive right in.

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:54.256
What should the label of this

00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:56.886
button be in your app?

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:00.426
Well, by default it might be

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:01.116
called plus.

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:03.186
And I might be able to figure

00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:03.896
out what you meant.

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:07.606
But, let's look at that with a

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.386
bit more context.

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:15.016
What about in a nav bar across

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.216
from a back button?

00:03:16.586 --> 00:03:18.816
This is pretty common in iOS

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:19.016
apps.

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:21.296
What should the label of this

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:22.466
button be here?

00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:27.296
Add? Well, that might be just

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:27.776
dandy.

00:03:28.076 --> 00:03:30.556
If I'm in a notes app and I hear

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:33.096
the word add, I'm going to know

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:34.276
that that's going to add a new

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:34.716
note.

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.366
But remember, these labels are

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:38.736
supposed to be succinct.

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:43.066
In a shopping context I might

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.756
need to clarify that a bit

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:47.066
further to distinguish this app

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:49.146
button from other actions like

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.546
Add to Favorites.

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:53.826
So, we might need to call that

00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:54.466
Add to Cart.

00:03:56.656 --> 00:03:58.716
And, what if there were dozens

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.246
of Add to Cart buttons?

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:02.806
In this context I might expect

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:05.036
VoiceOver to say, add peanut

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:05.946
butter to cart.

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:08.496
And hopefully it's not crunchy

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:09.636
peanut butter.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.116
To bring it back to the original

00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:15.056
example, what should the label

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.826
of this button be in your app?

00:04:18.076 --> 00:04:24.326
Well, that all depends on the

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:25.976
context.

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:30.116
So, now let's talk about some

00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:31.106
best practices when considering

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:32.986
what a label should be.

00:04:33.796 --> 00:04:36.046
First and foremost, always,

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:38.066
always remember to add labels to

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:39.136
your apps.

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:40.016
This is crucial.

00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:42.656
If a label's not added,

00:04:42.786 --> 00:04:44.246
VoiceOver might speak something

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:44.646
like.

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:47.646
>> Button, button, button.

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:50.216
>> And for all I know guys, that

00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:51.666
could be the Delete hard drive

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.966
Partition button and I wouldn't

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:54.596
want to press that.

00:04:56.606 --> 00:04:58.696
If there is no label added and

00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:00.396
if there's an image in the

00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:01.926
button or if there's an image

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.096
within the button, VoiceOver

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.286
might speak something like --

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.186
>> Plus underscore icon

00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:09.256
underscore outline underscore

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:10.156
hash nine, nine, nine, nine,

00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:11.766
nine, nine, dot.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.036
>> What? What does that even

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:14.546
mean?

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:20.006
So please, please guys, add

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:21.696
labels.

00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:23.776
VoiceOver knows what the element

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:25.646
in your apps is based on the

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:26.396
element type.

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:30.216
So, it's redundant to add text

00:05:30.276 --> 00:05:32.126
to your string like button or

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:32.566
tab.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.486
And if you do, VoiceOver would

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:36.616
read out the label like --

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:38.486
>> Add button button.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:41.086
>> Hearing this though --

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:42.666
>> Add button.

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:43.986
>> Makes much more sense.

00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:48.896
Remember to update the label

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:50.196
when the UI changes.

00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:52.986
So, if you have an add button --

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:54.746
>> Add button.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.366
>> That changes to a delete

00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:56.756
button --

00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:59.476
>> Delete button.

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:01.396
>> Remember to update your UI so

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:02.296
that the label, so that

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.536
VoiceOver will speak the correct

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:07.306
state of the button.

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.746
When there's multiple buttons

00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:12.076
with the same action like adding

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.166
an item to the cart, remember to

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:15.426
provide the context.

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:18.716
Here it's not clear what I'm

00:06:18.716 --> 00:06:19.076
adding.

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:20.866
>> Add button.

00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:22.976
>> Am I adding the peanut

00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:26.526
butter, the bananas, or the

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:27.146
cookies?

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:29.086
Oh, I love cookies.

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:32.506
The context is much more clear

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:33.216
here.

00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:36.486
>> Add peanut butter button.

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:37.436
>> Oh, we're adding the peanut

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:37.926
butter.

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:39.696
Hopefully it's not crunchy.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:45.226
Avoid redundant labels.

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:47.836
So, if I'm in a music player the

00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:49.836
context is clear that we're

00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:51.476
dealing with songs.

00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:54.156
So, having VoiceOver speak --

00:06:55.306 --> 00:06:56.966
>> Play song button.

00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:00.556
>> Or next song, is unnecessary.

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:02.786
I'd much rather hear VoiceOver

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:03.316
speak --

00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:05.196
>> Play button.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:08.176
>> Just the word play.

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:11.566
It's also great to add labels to

00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:12.956
your animations, such as your

00:07:12.956 --> 00:07:13.536
spinners.

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:15.306
So that VoiceOver will let me

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:17.146
know that the content in your

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:18.156
app is --

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:20.156
>> Loading.

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:21.106
That's really important.

00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:25.046
So, this --

00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:27.496
>> Delete items from the current

00:07:27.496 --> 00:07:28.726
folder and add it to the trash

00:07:28.726 --> 00:07:29.096
button.

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:30.436
>> That is too verbose.

00:07:31.476 --> 00:07:33.626
Remember, we want these labels

00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:36.356
to be as succinct as possible.

00:07:37.526 --> 00:07:39.516
And, the context really makes

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:41.226
things in your app clear.

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:42.406
So, this --

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.256
>> Delete button.

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:46.666
>> Would be just fine.

00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:51.626
But verbosity isn't always a bad

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:52.156
thing though.

00:07:52.936 --> 00:07:55.516
Oftentimes verbose descriptions

00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.446
when in appropriate situations

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.136
is really what makes your app

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:00.746
fun and memorable.

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:02.886
The developers of the Cookie

00:08:02.886 --> 00:08:05.046
Monster sticker packs have added

00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:07.876
verbose but really fun labels to

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:08.526
their stickers.

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:11.076
So now, VoiceOver speaks --

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:13.216
>> Me happy face eat small

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:15.456
cookie, om nom nom button.

00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:16.856
>> I love that.

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:18.166
That is so awesome.

00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:20.176
These Cookie Monster stickers

00:08:20.246 --> 00:08:22.776
are intended to be fun and just

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.306
make a person smile.

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:26.556
Whether you can see the sticker

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.116
or you hear the label.

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:30.856
So, let's review.

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:35.846
Remember to add labels so that

00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:37.846
VoiceOver doesn't speak "button,

00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:39.586
button, button."

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:43.796
Don't include the element type

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:45.646
in your label because VoiceOver

00:08:45.646 --> 00:08:47.516
gathers that info already.

00:08:47.936 --> 00:08:50.616
So, hearing add button button is

00:08:50.616 --> 00:08:51.576
unnecessary.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.016
Update the labels when your UI

00:08:55.226 --> 00:08:55.646
changes.

00:08:56.276 --> 00:08:57.526
So, when you have that add

00:08:57.556 --> 00:08:59.016
button that changes to a delete

00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:00.906
button, remember to update your

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:02.396
label so VoiceOver reads the

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:03.836
correct state of the button.

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:09.236
Avoid redundancy like play song,

00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:11.146
next song, previous song.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.846
In a music player, remember to

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:16.516
provide enough context so I know

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:17.876
whether I'm adding peanut

00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:19.586
butter, bananas, or those

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:20.976
awesome cookies to my cart.

00:09:24.536 --> 00:09:26.066
Add labels to your meaningful

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.486
animations like spinners, so

00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:30.876
that VoiceOver will read that

00:09:30.876 --> 00:09:32.446
the content in your app is

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:35.986
loading or in progress.

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:39.416
Avoid verbose labels like delete

00:09:39.416 --> 00:09:41.016
current item from the trash and

00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:42.366
move it.

00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:44.176
Unless you have a great reason

00:09:44.176 --> 00:09:45.216
like those awesome Cookie

00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:46.846
Monster stickers.

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:51.626
I really hope you've enjoyed

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:53.396
learning about best practices

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.586
for labeling your apps.

00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:57.526
But if you're ever curious what

00:09:57.526 --> 00:09:58.676
your app would sound like to a

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:01.026
VoiceOver user, I really

00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:03.266
encourage you to turn it on and

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:04.166
swipe around.

00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:07.066
It's really a great opportunity

00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:08.906
to improve your app for

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:09.386
everyone.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:10.866
Thank you so much.
