00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:11.836
>> Hi. I'm Jay.

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:13.456
I'm a designer on the Siri and

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:14.186
Shortcuts team.

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:15.746
And today, we'll be talking

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.036
about how to design great

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.786
shortcuts for your apps.

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.426
We're going to cover three main

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:22.836
topics today.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.126
First, I'll talk about looking

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:26.306
at all the use cases of your

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:27.936
app, and deciding which ones

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.206
might make sense as shortcuts.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.345
Then, I'll talk about how to

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:33.056
make these shortcuts

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.336
discoverable in your apps.

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:37.956
And, finally, I'll walk through

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:39.426
how to design a great Siri

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:40.406
experience for the new

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.686
interactive capabilities of

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.296
shortcuts in iOS 13.

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:46.526
Now, stepping back for a moment,

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.276
shortcuts in general are a great

00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:49.086
way to bring your app's

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:50.356
functionality in front of more

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:52.316
users in more places in the OS.

00:00:52.876 --> 00:00:53.836
So, let's take a look at the

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:54.696
places where your apps'

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:56.316
shortcuts can appear to get a

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:57.536
feel for what might be useful.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.516
If you tell the system when the

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:02.786
user does something in your app,

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:04.156
the system can automatically

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:05.416
suggest a shortcut when it

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.726
predicts the user will next want

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:07.456
to do that action.

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.386
And, these shortcuts can appear

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:10.846
in lock screen and search.

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:13.046
Here, this shortcut lets you

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:14.466
quickly start a guided workout,

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:15.826
you usually do at this time of

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:15.916
day.

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:20.286
If a user adds a shortcut to

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:21.926
Siri, by assigning it a custom

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:23.566
phrase, they can invoke it at

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.966
any time with their voice.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.086
Here, the shortcut lets them

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.116
order their usual dinner.

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:30.306
In one quick confirmation step,

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:31.496
the user can get some great

00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:32.886
Mediterranean food.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.646
Another great use for shortcuts

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:38.116
with Siri is getting information

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:39.246
hands- and eyes-free.

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:42.106
So, to your HomePod, if you have

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:43.526
a transit app shortcut, you can

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.626
say, Hey Siri, bus schedule.

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:47.516
And, Siri will speak out the bus

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:48.686
schedule information from your

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:49.000
app.

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:53.996
And, you can also incorporate

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:55.516
your app's functionality as part

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:56.696
of a multi-step shortcut.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.596
Here, the shortcut handles your

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.366
evening routine, ordering soup

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:01.626
in time for your arrival home,

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.326
playing your favorite music for

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:04.756
your car ride, and showing the

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.486
fastest directions.

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:09.836
So, looking at these examples,

00:02:10.186 --> 00:02:11.266
we can see that shortcuts are

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.486
great for accelerating

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.316
frequently used, useful actions

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:15.046
your app can do.

00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:17.446
Presenting information at a

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:20.296
glance, or with your voice, or

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:21.746
as building blocks for powerful

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:23.526
multi-step shortcuts, where your

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:24.986
app can work alongside others.

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:28.656
We introduced Siri shortcut

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.556
suggestions in iOS 12, so look

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.366
back at past sessions for more

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.746
information on how to develop

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:34.726
great shortcuts to be

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:36.336
automatically suggested on lock

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:37.226
screen and search.

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:39.526
Today, I'm going to focus on how

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.626
to make shortcuts to take

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:41.826
advantage of the new Siri

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:43.496
capabilities in iOS 13.

00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:45.416
We're going to walk through how

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.756
to prioritize the features in

00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:47.966
your app that might make for

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.026
good Siri shortcuts.

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:51.816
To do that, let's take a look at

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.846
one of our favorite apps,

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:54.526
SoupChef, which lets you order a

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:56.256
wide variety of soups for pickup

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:56.846
or delivery.

00:02:57.686 --> 00:02:58.846
Let's walk through the design

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:00.226
process for making a SoupChef

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:01.286
shortcut.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.206
List out all the things that

00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:05.886
your app can do.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.086
When doing so, start thinking

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:09.276
about things that a user might

00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:10.426
want to repeat with their voice.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.146
So, with SoupChef, you can do

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:14.526
things like browse the menu of

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:14.846
soups.

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:16.256
Order a soup.

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:17.816
Check your order status, or view

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:18.466
past orders.

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:20.426
Let's take a look at some of

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:20.976
these features one by one.

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:26.876
Browsing a menu is a very visual

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:28.046
activity that requires a lot of

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.366
structured information that

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:30.576
won't translate well to voice.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:32.846
It requires scrolling, tapping,

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:33.726
and navigating.

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:35.756
And, it provides information

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:37.146
that isn't likely to change from

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:38.566
invocation to invocation.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:41.626
And, it's more of a means to an

00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:43.136
end, and not a valuable action

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:44.026
in and of itself.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.836
So, this might not be a good

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:48.466
candidate for a shortcut.

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:52.236
Checking an order status could

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:53.366
be something a user might want

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.446
to do with their voice, getting

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:55.736
a quick summary of information

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:56.556
from Siri.

00:03:57.306 --> 00:03:58.846
But, it's also only applicable

00:03:58.846 --> 00:04:00.296
for a narrow window of time,

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:01.426
right after a user's ordered

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:01.826
something.

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:04.316
So, this is something that you

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:05.726
could consider allowing users to

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:07.546
turn into a shortcut, but maybe

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:08.956
only if your delivery periods

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:10.076
are long, or have multiple

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:10.496
phases.

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:15.196
And viewing past orders is nice

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:16.245
to have, but I don't know about

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:17.586
you, I'm not regularly checking

00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:17.805
that.

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:18.956
So, not a great shortcut.

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:24.606
Ordering a soup is a very

00:04:24.606 --> 00:04:25.486
valuable activity.

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:27.226
In fact, the most important

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:28.056
activity of your app.

00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:29.356
And, you can imagine it being

00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:30.856
repeatable if a user has a

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:31.966
favorite soup.

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:33.876
So, let's call this a pretty

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:35.016
good candidate for a shortcut.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:39.776
So, in summary, a great use for

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:40.926
shortcuts will be something that

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.406
is valuable, or interesting to

00:04:42.406 --> 00:04:42.736
repeat.

00:04:43.886 --> 00:04:45.346
Doable with your voice by not

00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:46.886
relying on visuals or tapping.

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:49.436
And, invokable in many contexts.

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:50.766
So, the shortcut isn't just

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:52.096
applicable during a small window

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:54.146
of time.

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:55.526
So, now that we know that we

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:57.036
want users to be able to reorder

00:04:57.036 --> 00:04:59.016
soup with shortcuts, let's take

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:00.216
a look at how we might make that

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.206
discoverable in your app.

00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:03.176
We provide a standard Add to

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.606
Siri button, that makes it easy

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:06.096
for users to see what features

00:05:06.096 --> 00:05:07.566
in your app can be turned into a

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:08.226
Siri shortcut.

00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:09.966
But use it thoughtfully.

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:13.156
Don't do this, where you put an

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:14.826
Add to Siri button on every item

00:05:14.826 --> 00:05:15.556
on your main menu.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:17.506
As beautiful as the button is on

00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:19.146
its own, repeating it like this

00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:20.386
looks ugly, and it's not really

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:20.976
relevant here.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:22.806
The user's probably just trying

00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:23.756
to make an order in the first

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:24.066
place.

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:25.366
And, these buttons are getting

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:25.766
in the way.

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:28.196
And, these could be items that

00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:29.336
the user has never ordered

00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:29.786
before.

00:05:29.786 --> 00:05:31.146
So, it doesn't make sense to

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:32.516
suggest reordering them just

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:33.226
yet.

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:35.976
Instead, look at opportunities

00:05:35.976 --> 00:05:36.906
where you can present it in a

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:38.316
focused UI, where you have a

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:39.636
clear signal that a user might

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:40.526
want to repeat something.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:43.686
For example, it might be better

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:44.936
to show an Add to Siri button

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:46.346
right after a user has ordered

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:46.706
something.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.716
The logic being, if a user's

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:49.796
found it good enough to order

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:51.516
before, the user's more likely

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:52.466
to want to order it again.

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:54.226
And, you're not interrupting

00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:55.696
anything a user's trying to do.

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:56.806
They just finished their order,

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.056
so this is a good opportunity.

00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:01.676
To make the Add to Siri button

00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:02.846
fit in to your app's visual

00:06:02.846 --> 00:06:05.176
appearance even better, you can

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:06.896
now customize the corner radius

00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:07.426
of the button.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:11.026
And, you can have its appearance

00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:12.246
automatically change based on

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:13.366
the user's light or dark mode

00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:13.716
preference.

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:16.936
Now, if you've tried really

00:06:16.936 --> 00:06:18.696
hard, like really hard, and the

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:20.226
button's visual style doesn't

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:22.006
fit into your app, you can make

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:22.696
your own button.

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:23.886
But, you should replicate all of

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:25.236
Add to Siri's functionality.

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:29.276
The standard Add to Siri button

00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:30.926
shows the user's shortcut phrase

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:31.606
once configured.

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:32.966
And, this is a good way to

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:34.326
remind the user what they can

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:36.046
say to run the shortcut.

00:06:36.956 --> 00:06:38.666
Tapping on it will reveal a

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.926
standard sheet which allows the

00:06:39.926 --> 00:06:40.726
user to edit or delete the

00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:40.976
shortcut.

00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:46.796
If you want a centralized place

00:06:46.796 --> 00:06:47.926
in your app where you list all

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:49.376
your shortcuts, it might be too

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:50.516
much to have the Add to Siri

00:06:50.516 --> 00:06:52.336
button on every row, like we saw

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:52.716
earlier.

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:55.506
So, instead, you're free to use

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:56.746
standard UIKit elements.

00:06:58.056 --> 00:06:59.536
Just make sure that when a user

00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:01.196
sets up a shortcut, just like

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:03.556
the Add to Siri button, you show

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:04.756
the phrase the user has set up

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:05.426
the shortcut with.

00:07:06.286 --> 00:07:07.676
Tapping on it should also reveal

00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:08.816
the sheet, where you can edit or

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:09.606
delete the shortcut.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:12.966
So, let's get back to users

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.006
setting up the shortcut for the

00:07:14.006 --> 00:07:15.156
first time.

00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:19.166
Once the user taps on the Add to

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.496
Siri button, they'll see the Add

00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:21.886
to Siri sheet, where the user

00:07:21.886 --> 00:07:23.386
can choose what phrase to use to

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:24.436
invoke the shortcut.

00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:27.696
In iOS 13, your app can pre-fill

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:29.356
a shortcut of your own choosing.

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.146
And, most users will probably

00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:32.596
just assign this phrase if you

00:07:32.596 --> 00:07:34.176
provide it, so make sure you

00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:36.906
provide a good default.

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:38.686
Order Soup is a good, short,

00:07:38.686 --> 00:07:40.136
memorable phrase in this case,

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.666
that the user might want to

00:07:41.746 --> 00:07:42.916
genuinely want to use for the

00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:43.286
shortcut.

00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:45.276
Let's take a look at another

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:46.316
example, and take a break from

00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:49.496
soup for a while.

00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:50.626
Checking the bus schedule.

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:52.456
While this might look like a

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:53.796
sensible phrase, given how

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:55.396
relatively short it is, there

00:07:55.396 --> 00:07:56.616
are plenty of opportunities for

00:07:56.616 --> 00:07:58.116
the user to forget words, or

00:07:58.116 --> 00:07:59.016
switch words around.

00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:00.946
They might try to say, Look up

00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:01.736
the bus schedule.

00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:03.546
Or, the bus schedule for the 35.

00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:04.696
Or, just drop the "the"

00:08:04.696 --> 00:08:05.416
altogether.

00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:08.286
While Siri will do its best to

00:08:08.286 --> 00:08:10.026
match these to the phrase, users

00:08:10.026 --> 00:08:11.216
can still get pretty creative

00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:12.306
when trying to recall longer

00:08:12.306 --> 00:08:12.716
phrases.

00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:15.056
So, this might not be the best

00:08:15.056 --> 00:08:15.776
suggested phrase.

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:19.666
Instead, keep it short, at

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.016
around three or fewer words.

00:08:21.526 --> 00:08:22.916
Try limiting it to a proper

00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:24.546
noun, or just a verb and an

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:24.986
object.

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:26.766
This reduces the chance that

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:28.246
users will mix up word order, or

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:28.976
use different prepositions.

00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:33.486
OK.

00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:34.506
A user wants to set up a

00:08:34.506 --> 00:08:35.635
shortcut for ordering tomato

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:35.936
soup.

00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.056
But, what if the user wants the

00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:39.056
shortcut to do something

00:08:39.056 --> 00:08:40.275
slightly different every time,

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:41.736
like order a different soup.

00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:44.936
In iOS 13, users can tap on the

00:08:44.936 --> 00:08:46.716
cell under the Do area, and

00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:49.176
customize how much information

00:08:49.176 --> 00:08:50.506
is pre-baked into the shortcut

00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:52.276
by simply tapping on one of the

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:53.626
fields.

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:55.586
The user can choose to leave

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:57.186
certain fields blank, like the

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:58.226
type of soup itself.

00:08:58.556 --> 00:09:00.876
And, when they do that, Siri can

00:09:00.876 --> 00:09:02.336
ask for this missing information

00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:03.416
on your app's behalf.

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:06.046
Now, ideally a shortcut has very

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:06.986
minimal interaction.

00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:08.746
After all, it should accelerate

00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:09.856
people to something that they do

00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:10.386
frequently.

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:13.296
So, when you present the ad to

00:09:13.296 --> 00:09:14.846
Siri sheet, the action should

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.686
include as much information as

00:09:16.686 --> 00:09:18.156
possible, to run the shortcut

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:19.326
with just one or two steps.

00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:21.616
In this case, this shortcut goes

00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:22.646
straight to the confirmation

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:23.806
screen, because everything is

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:24.666
already specified.

00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:27.406
But, what happens when a user

00:09:27.406 --> 00:09:28.506
chooses to leave everything

00:09:28.506 --> 00:09:30.346
blank, and wants to specify all

00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:31.686
of the details of their order in

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:32.786
an interaction with Siri?

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:36.746
Let's take a look at how we

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:38.266
might design a complete ordering

00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:38.976
soup interaction with Siri.

00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:44.906
Think about what information you

00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:45.936
need to know in order to carry

00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:47.096
out a soup request.

00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:48.696
Like, the kind of soup it is.

00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:50.296
Whether you're ordering for

00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:51.126
delivery or pick up?

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:52.256
And, if you're ordering for

00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:53.606
delivery, what location are you

00:09:53.606 --> 00:09:54.646
delivering to, and if you're

00:09:54.646 --> 00:09:55.886
ordering for pickup, what you're

00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:56.556
picking up from.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.376
To start thinking about the

00:09:58.376 --> 00:09:59.536
order and manner in which you

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:00.806
might collect this information,

00:10:01.046 --> 00:10:02.016
you should think of your app's

00:10:02.016 --> 00:10:03.556
interaction as a conversation

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:05.596
between your user and Siri.

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:08.526
And, one way to visualize this

00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:10.396
conversation is with a script,

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:11.756
which is useful for quickly

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:13.386
jotting down one conversational

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:14.326
path.

00:10:15.676 --> 00:10:17.246
Of course, there isn't just one

00:10:17.246 --> 00:10:18.216
path you can go down.

00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:19.666
You should write down all of the

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:20.756
possible paths in which the

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:21.706
conversation might go.

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:24.246
For example, a user could say an

00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:25.546
option that's not supported by

00:10:25.546 --> 00:10:25.886
your app.

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:27.866
In that case, Siri should

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:29.276
probably indicate that to the

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:29.956
user.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.586
Now, handing over a book of

00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:34.086
scripts might get unwieldy as a

00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:36.406
design specification, so, at the

00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:37.346
end of the process, you'll

00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:38.506
probably end up with something

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:40.556
more like this; a flow diagram

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:41.776
that covers all the possible

00:10:41.776 --> 00:10:43.116
states and transitions within a

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:43.766
conversation.

00:10:44.786 --> 00:10:46.736
Now, there are specific ways

00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:48.326
that Siri can present choices,

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:50.226
and handle user input, so let's

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:51.036
dive straight into the

00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:52.816
conversational patterns you have

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:53.616
at your disposal.

00:10:54.156 --> 00:10:57.286
The first pattern that you have

00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:58.046
is the prompt.

00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:00.226
This is the most open-ended way

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.686
you can collect a value from the

00:11:01.686 --> 00:11:01.986
user.

00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:04.196
You should write your prompt as

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.716
a question, and phrase it in a

00:11:05.716 --> 00:11:07.326
way that sets the user up for a

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:10.726
well-formed response.

00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:13.066
When a user says something that

00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:14.086
might mean multiple things to

00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:15.716
your app, you can present an

00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:16.926
option list which allows the

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.476
user to specify which one they

00:11:18.476 --> 00:11:18.716
meant.

00:11:19.536 --> 00:11:20.866
This is called a disambiguation

00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:21.176
prompt.

00:11:22.696 --> 00:11:24.086
You can minimize disambiguation

00:11:24.086 --> 00:11:25.536
prompts, which add another step

00:11:25.536 --> 00:11:27.516
to your conversation, by

00:11:27.516 --> 00:11:28.826
presenting an option list up

00:11:28.826 --> 00:11:29.136
front.

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:31.336
Notice that the user has said

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:32.846
their shortcut phrase, Order

00:11:32.846 --> 00:11:34.366
Soup, and went straight to the

00:11:34.366 --> 00:11:34.716
list.

00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:36.996
You should use this instead of a

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.506
free-form prompt if there's a

00:11:38.506 --> 00:11:39.846
constrained list of options to

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:40.306
choose from.

00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:42.686
Make sure your prompt dialog

00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:44.146
encourages choosing from a list.

00:11:44.596 --> 00:11:45.546
Questions that start with the

00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:46.886
word "which" work really well

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:46.976
here.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.476
When using s shortcut without a

00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:54.156
display, Siri will read out

00:11:54.156 --> 00:11:54.706
options.

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:57.026
Like on AirPods, on HomePod, or

00:11:57.026 --> 00:11:57.966
when the user says Hey Siri.

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:04.226
And, Siri will read these out as

00:12:04.226 --> 00:12:05.076
you would provide them in your

00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:05.566
visual UI.

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:07.786
But, you can imagine that this

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:09.246
could get verbose, especially if

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:10.136
a lot of the options are

00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:10.536
similar.

00:12:11.756 --> 00:12:13.136
To improve this experience, you

00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:15.136
can separately specify how Siri

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:16.806
reads your options out loud, by

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:18.276
providing pronunciation hits

00:12:18.426 --> 00:12:19.746
that you can add to each option.

00:12:21.056 --> 00:12:22.136
Let's take a look at a slightly

00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:22.826
different example.

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:24.786
The user has asked for Noodle

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:25.316
Soup.

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:26.146
And, there are two kinds.

00:12:26.936 --> 00:12:28.026
Instead of saying Beef Noodle

00:12:28.026 --> 00:12:29.716
Soup, or Veggie Noodle Soup, you

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.196
might want to just say Beef or

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:31.556
Veggie?

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.776
So, consider only reading out

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:35.276
the details that differentiate

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:37.806
between each item.

00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:39.936
Now, conversations are a two-way

00:12:39.936 --> 00:12:41.266
street, so you also have to

00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:42.736
account for what the user might

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:43.056
say.

00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:44.986
And, the user may not use the

00:12:44.986 --> 00:12:46.216
exact words that you've labeled

00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:47.516
the option with.

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.746
To handle natural variations in

00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:52.876
responses, for each option, you

00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:53.836
should provide Siri with

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:55.226
synonyms that mean the same

00:12:55.226 --> 00:12:56.186
thing as that option.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:58.126
So, when the user just says

00:12:58.216 --> 00:12:59.696
Beef, it'll match to Beef Noodle

00:12:59.696 --> 00:12:59.966
Soup.

00:13:00.456 --> 00:13:02.536
When coming up with these

00:13:02.536 --> 00:13:04.026
synonyms, you should also keep

00:13:04.026 --> 00:13:05.436
in mind that the phrasing of

00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:06.386
your question impacts the way

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:06.976
the user may respond.

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:12.956
So, if you have a more casual

00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:14.406
way of describing the options,

00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:15.766
like the one with meat, or the

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:17.586
vegetarian one, you should make

00:13:17.586 --> 00:13:19.496
sure that you recognize the user

00:13:19.496 --> 00:13:20.646
repeating that kind of phrasing

00:13:20.646 --> 00:13:20.976
back to Siri.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.476
If a user provides a response

00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:28.536
that you want to be extra sure

00:13:28.536 --> 00:13:29.566
about, like a value of

00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:31.066
particularly high consequence,

00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:32.816
you can provide a parameter

00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:33.806
confirmation prompt.

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:35.876
But, use this judiciously, and

00:13:35.876 --> 00:13:37.276
only for truly exceptional

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:38.866
cases, as this slows the user

00:13:38.866 --> 00:13:39.500
down.

00:13:42.216 --> 00:13:43.866
One alternative way of using a

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.786
parameter confirmation prompt is

00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:47.276
if your app has its own logic

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:48.486
for predicting what a user might

00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:48.756
want.

00:13:49.736 --> 00:13:50.836
You can present your best guess

00:13:50.866 --> 00:13:52.126
to the user, and they can either

00:13:52.126 --> 00:13:53.906
confirm it, in which case, yay,

00:13:53.906 --> 00:13:54.656
they don't have to provide

00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:55.496
additional details.

00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:57.756
Or, they can deny it, in which

00:13:57.756 --> 00:13:59.256
case you can fall back to a more

00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:00.036
open-ended prompt.

00:14:01.196 --> 00:14:02.206
If you can guess what the user

00:14:02.206 --> 00:14:03.696
wants, it's a great way of

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:04.686
making your shortcut interaction

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:04.976
even faster.

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:11.476
At the end of the flow, consider

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.106
using a confirmation prompt that

00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:14.406
applies to the action as a

00:14:14.406 --> 00:14:16.056
whole, particularly if the

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:17.226
action itself is of high

00:14:17.226 --> 00:14:17.756
consequence.

00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:20.386
In this step, you can confirm

00:14:20.536 --> 00:14:21.946
all of the details of the action

00:14:21.946 --> 00:14:23.276
about to be performed that's

00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:24.616
relevant to the decision, like

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.316
price and delivery time in a

00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:27.826
visual user interface that you

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:28.776
can fully customize.

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:30.686
Note that for actions in the

00:14:30.686 --> 00:14:32.056
ordering category, the system

00:14:32.056 --> 00:14:33.556
requires the user to confirm.

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.036
So, make sure, if you fall under

00:14:35.036 --> 00:14:36.556
that category, you provide a

00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:37.686
great confirmation experience.

00:14:38.406 --> 00:14:41.846
But, remember that your shortcut

00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:43.506
can be run by a user not looking

00:14:43.506 --> 00:14:44.786
at a screen, so you should

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:46.286
provide dialog for voice-only

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:46.886
experiences.

00:14:47.546 --> 00:14:48.926
In this case, we provide

00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:50.526
additional dialog to help the

00:14:50.526 --> 00:14:51.316
user make a choice.

00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:54.806
The purpose of this additional

00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:56.666
dialog is to provide information

00:14:56.716 --> 00:14:57.706
that can't otherwise be

00:14:57.706 --> 00:14:59.026
displayed in a visual user

00:14:59.026 --> 00:14:59.406
interface.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.696
So, think of this extra dialog

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:03.536
as a spoken equivalent of the

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:05.116
most important information you

00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:05.796
would otherwise draw in a

00:15:05.796 --> 00:15:05.976
display.

00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:11.606
Finally, your response.

00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:13.896
Siri will indicate the status of

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:14.366
the action.

00:15:14.916 --> 00:15:16.436
You can provide a visual UI

00:15:16.436 --> 00:15:17.606
summary here to describe

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:19.196
additional details, like who's

00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:19.916
going to be delivering your

00:15:19.916 --> 00:15:21.586
soup, and the latest estimated

00:15:21.586 --> 00:15:22.296
delivery time.

00:15:23.196 --> 00:15:24.816
Notice that we just say, "OK.

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:25.966
Ordered" here, because we're

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.206
using a display to show the

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:28.146
additional information.

00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:30.656
For voice-only experiences, you

00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:31.716
should specify a more

00:15:31.716 --> 00:15:32.626
descriptive dialog.

00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:36.426
And, again, think of this extra

00:15:36.426 --> 00:15:38.276
dialog as a spoken equivalent of

00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:39.826
the most important information

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:41.166
of the response UI you would

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:41.886
draw on a display.

00:15:45.776 --> 00:15:46.676
When you're thinking about your

00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:47.936
confirmation and response

00:15:47.936 --> 00:15:49.526
dialog, you should keep in mind

00:15:49.576 --> 00:15:50.466
that you'll need to select a

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:51.806
category for your shortcut.

00:15:52.556 --> 00:15:53.726
When you define your shortcut in

00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:55.546
Xcode, select the category that

00:15:55.546 --> 00:15:56.606
is the closet match to your

00:15:56.606 --> 00:15:57.656
shortcut's functionality.

00:15:58.386 --> 00:15:59.406
In our SoupChef case, it's

00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:00.156
pretty clear that the order

00:16:00.156 --> 00:16:00.976
category fits the bill.

00:16:05.576 --> 00:16:07.246
In confirmation prompts, Siri

00:16:07.246 --> 00:16:08.186
will provide the question

00:16:08.186 --> 00:16:09.566
itself, based on the category

00:16:09.566 --> 00:16:10.056
you select.

00:16:10.686 --> 00:16:12.346
So, don't include a question as

00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:13.696
part of the confirmation dialog

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:14.676
you customize, highlighted in

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:14.966
white here.

00:16:19.326 --> 00:16:21.036
In response dialog, Siri will

00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:22.146
provide a status that is

00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:23.296
appropriate to the category.

00:16:23.846 --> 00:16:25.486
Your custom dialog gets appended

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:26.826
to the end of the dialog Siri

00:16:26.826 --> 00:16:27.246
provides.

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:32.106
Voice interactions should also

00:16:32.106 --> 00:16:33.716
be as robust as possible, to

00:16:33.716 --> 00:16:36.126
avoid forcing the user to open

00:16:36.126 --> 00:16:37.616
the app to continue manually.

00:16:38.526 --> 00:16:40.156
For example, you should provide

00:16:40.206 --> 00:16:41.566
clear error messages if a

00:16:41.566 --> 00:16:42.986
parameter value is invalid.

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:44.916
Siri will then automatically

00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:46.066
re-prompt for that value.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.626
You should also avoid getting

00:16:48.626 --> 00:16:49.826
yourself into this scenario in

00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:50.386
the first place.

00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:51.936
If you're presenting option

00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:53.216
lists, make sure you don't

00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:54.326
present any options that you

00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:56.436
know to be invalid at runtime.

00:16:59.326 --> 00:17:00.156
You should also consider

00:17:00.156 --> 00:17:01.656
opportunities to dig users out

00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:02.086
of holes.

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:04.306
Users may include values like

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:05.326
delivery location in their

00:17:05.326 --> 00:17:06.856
shortcut, since it's usually

00:17:06.856 --> 00:17:08.286
just their home, and so they get

00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:09.126
used to not saying their

00:17:09.126 --> 00:17:10.715
delivery location to Siri.

00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:12.096
One day they might use the

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:13.146
shortcut when they're far from

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:13.455
home.

00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:15.066
You should check for that case,

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:16.046
and prompt for a different

00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:16.455
location.

00:17:17.695 --> 00:17:19.215
And, for whatever reason, users

00:17:19.215 --> 00:17:20.286
might want to continue running

00:17:20.286 --> 00:17:21.576
the shortcut in your app.

00:17:22.406 --> 00:17:23.876
They can tap anywhere in your UI

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:24.675
to do that.

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.806
So, when you present UI, keep in

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:28.606
mind that the whole area is one

00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:30.346
big button that opens your app.

00:17:30.686 --> 00:17:31.806
So, don't draw elements that

00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:33.276
look individually interactable.

00:17:33.526 --> 00:17:34.046
They can't be.

00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:37.126
Make sure that when a user does

00:17:37.126 --> 00:17:39.076
tap this area, your app opens up

00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:40.676
to the right place, with all of

00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:41.966
the information the user has

00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:43.346
already provided up until that

00:17:43.346 --> 00:17:46.726
point, filled out in the app.

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:48.946
And, finally, we encourage you

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:50.206
to take time when writing

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:50.696
dialog.

00:17:51.046 --> 00:17:52.316
It's not something that you can

00:17:52.316 --> 00:17:53.866
just do a quick pass at, to have

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:55.076
something to demo, and then

00:17:55.076 --> 00:17:55.926
leave in your final shipping

00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:56.296
product.

00:17:57.066 --> 00:17:58.856
Remember, that in a voice

00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:00.476
interaction, language is the

00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:01.216
user interface.

00:18:01.856 --> 00:18:03.126
So, you should treat the words

00:18:03.126 --> 00:18:04.856
in your Siri interaction with as

00:18:04.856 --> 00:18:06.856
much respect and care as you do

00:18:06.856 --> 00:18:09.396
the pixels in your app.

00:18:09.586 --> 00:18:10.596
With that said, let's walk

00:18:10.596 --> 00:18:11.186
through a small set of

00:18:11.186 --> 00:18:11.656
guidelines.

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.066
Don't be overly polite or inject

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:16.926
too much personality.

00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:18.666
Users who want to customize

00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:19.866
their soup will hear this

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.386
non-essential dialog every time

00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:23.126
they run this shortcut, which

00:18:23.566 --> 00:18:24.416
will get irritating.

00:18:25.206 --> 00:18:27.936
When in doubt, test it.

00:18:28.326 --> 00:18:29.766
Listen to Siri speak your

00:18:29.766 --> 00:18:30.246
dialog.

00:18:30.706 --> 00:18:32.146
How does your dialog feel to you

00:18:32.146 --> 00:18:33.396
after the third time hearing it?

00:18:33.966 --> 00:18:34.666
What about the 10th?

00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:37.186
If parts of it feel annoying, it

00:18:37.186 --> 00:18:38.596
might be a good signal that you

00:18:38.596 --> 00:18:40.346
should reduce the verbosity of

00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:42.976
your dialog.

00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:44.566
Dialog should be concise,

00:18:44.956 --> 00:18:46.506
neutral, and communicate the

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:47.556
type of response that you're

00:18:47.556 --> 00:18:48.016
expecting.

00:18:48.526 --> 00:18:52.646
Don't include your app name in

00:18:52.646 --> 00:18:53.276
your dialog.

00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:56.006
Your app will already be

00:18:56.006 --> 00:18:57.506
attributed, visually, via your

00:18:57.506 --> 00:18:58.946
confirmation and response UI,

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.056
and occasionally via Siri's own

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:01.556
additions.

00:19:01.556 --> 00:19:03.906
So, just take your name out.

00:19:03.906 --> 00:19:04.956
Don't worry, your brand is safe.

00:19:09.616 --> 00:19:11.116
Similarly, you shouldn't include

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:12.516
your user's name in your dialog.

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:15.396
Siri may at times speak the

00:19:15.396 --> 00:19:17.146
user's name on HomePod to verify

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:17.736
their identity.

00:19:18.196 --> 00:19:19.706
If your app does so as well, it

00:19:19.706 --> 00:19:20.856
might sound repetitive and

00:19:20.856 --> 00:19:21.256
annoying.

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:25.426
So, just take your name out.

00:19:27.756 --> 00:19:28.946
Avoid using first-person

00:19:28.946 --> 00:19:30.576
pronouns, since Siri isn't

00:19:30.576 --> 00:19:32.086
performing the action, your app

00:19:32.086 --> 00:19:32.306
is.

00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:34.346
It's a subtle distinction, but

00:19:34.346 --> 00:19:35.226
it's an important one.

00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.736
By saying "I" or "we" in Siri's

00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:39.676
voice, users might think Siri

00:19:39.676 --> 00:19:41.166
has a better understanding of

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:42.316
your app's capabilities than it

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:43.766
does, and might try to take

00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:45.476
follow-up actions that your app

00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:46.826
and Siri can't understand.

00:19:47.296 --> 00:19:51.526
Instead, present options

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:53.276
neutrally, using words like

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:53.756
"here" or "there are a few

00:19:53.756 --> 00:19:53.976
options."

00:19:58.346 --> 00:20:01.296
So, what have we learned today?

00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:04.386
Shortcuts are meant to elevate

00:20:04.386 --> 00:20:05.466
your app's most repeatable

00:20:05.466 --> 00:20:05.836
features.

00:20:06.576 --> 00:20:09.106
You should use the Add to Siri

00:20:09.106 --> 00:20:10.956
button to make sure users know

00:20:11.196 --> 00:20:12.026
what they can turn into a

00:20:12.026 --> 00:20:14.046
shortcut from inside your app.

00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:16.636
You should make your Siri

00:20:16.636 --> 00:20:18.546
interactions logical, concise,

00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:19.286
and robust.

00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:22.576
And, you should take extra care

00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:23.566
when writing dialog.

00:20:24.646 --> 00:20:24.976
Thank you.
