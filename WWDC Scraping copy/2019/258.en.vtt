00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:10.006
>> My name is Janum Trivedi, and

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:11.466
I'm an engineer on the UIKit

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:12.466
frameworks team.

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:15.666
First, let's talk about

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.276
architecting your app for

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:18.236
multiple windows.

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:20.786
On iOS 13, supporting multiple

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:22.776
windows is a fantastic way to

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:24.016
make your existing apps more

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:26.006
useful and allow your users to

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:26.976
be substantially more

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:27.556
productive.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:31.576
We'll be going over three

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:32.746
primary topics today.

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:34.666
We'll get started by doing a

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.436
quick overview of the changes to

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.176
the application life cycle that

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:39.856
will allow multiple windows on

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:41.236
iOS 13 to be possible.

00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:44.856
Then, we'll dive deeper into the

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:47.206
new UIScene delegate and we'll

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:48.436
talk about what kind of work you

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:49.896
should be doing there.

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:52.816
Finally, we'll go over some best

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:54.386
practices in ArchitectureKit so

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.346
you and your team can take

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:56.926
advantage of to make sure you

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:57.906
provide your users with a

00:00:57.906 --> 00:00:59.506
consistent, seamless

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.236
multitasking experience.

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:06.356
Now, to get started, let's talk

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:07.866
about some of the roles and

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.046
responsibilities of the App

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:10.976
Delegate in iOS 12 and before.

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:13.876
The App Delegate had two primary

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:14.166
roles.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.436
The first was to notify your

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:17.266
application of process level

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:17.716
events.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:19.286
So, the system would notify your

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.476
App Delegate when your process

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:22.056
was launching or was about to

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:22.656
terminate.

00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:24.976
But it also had the second role,

00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:26.846
which was letting your

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.066
application know the state of

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.566
its UI.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.446
So, via some methods like did

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:34.776
enter foreground and will resign

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:36.616
active, the system will let you

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:37.846
know your UI state.

00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:41.586
And this is totally fine in iOS

00:01:41.586 --> 00:01:42.666
12 and before, because

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:44.686
applications had one process and

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:46.666
also just one user interface

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.366
instance to match it.

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:51.096
So, today your App Delegate

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:52.086
probably looks a little bit

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:53.976
something like this, except

00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:55.406
maybe not quite this short.

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:59.156
So, in your did finish launching

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:00.376
with options, you do a couple

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:00.716
things.

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:02.706
First you do some one-time

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.536
non-UI global setup, like

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:05.856
connecting to a database or

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:06.716
initializing your data

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:07.376
structures.

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:09.886
And immediately after that, you

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:11.136
set up your user interface.

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:14.756
And again, this is totally valid

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:17.006
in 12 and before, but iOS 13's

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:18.156
pattern is invalid.

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:21.186
Why? Because applications now

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.176
still just share one process but

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.026
may have multiple user interface

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:27.576
instances or scene sessions.

00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:32.406
That means the responsibility of

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:33.596
the App Delegate needs to change

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:33.846
a bit.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.496
It's still responsible for

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:37.106
process events and life cycle,

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:38.796
but it's no longer responsible

00:02:38.796 --> 00:02:40.166
for anything related to your UI

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:40.756
lifecycle.

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:43.186
Instead, that'll all be handled

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:45.156
by your UIScene Delegate.

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:47.436
Well, what does that mean for

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:47.716
you?

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:50.436
Any UI setup or teardown work

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.536
that you used to do in your App

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:53.716
Delegate now needs to migrate to

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.166
the corresponding methods in

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:56.076
your Scene Delegate.

00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:59.986
In fact, on iOS 13, if your

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:02.006
application adopts the new scene

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:03.876
lifecycle, UIKit will stop

00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:05.276
calling the old App Delegate

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:06.976
methods that relate to UI state.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:09.266
Instead, we'll call the new

00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:11.806
Scene Delegate methods, and it's

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:12.936
pretty simple since there's a

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:14.976
1-to-1 mapping for most of

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:15.316
these.

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:18.346
But don't worry - if you want to

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:19.696
adopt multiple windows support

00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:21.146
on iOS 13, that doesn't mean you

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:22.626
need to drop support for 12 and

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:23.066
before.

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:25.366
If you're back deploying, you

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:26.676
can simply keep both sets of

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:28.356
these methods and UIKit will

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:30.586
call the correct set at runtime.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:35.086
Now, before we dive into the

00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:36.886
exact delegate methods, there's

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:37.876
one more additional

00:03:37.876 --> 00:03:39.276
responsibility that the App

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:40.206
Delegate gets.

00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:41.756
And that is the system will now

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:43.436
notify your App Delegate when a

00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:44.886
new Scene Session is being

00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:46.736
created, or an existing Scene

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:48.176
Session is being discarded.

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:51.276
Let's make this lifecycle a

00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:52.786
little bit more concrete.

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:54.316
Say I've been working on this

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:55.806
little blue app right here and I

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:56.876
want to launch it for the first

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:57.246
time.

00:03:57.456 --> 00:03:58.556
Let's go through the call stack.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.826
First, your App Delegate's going

00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:02.996
to get the same did finish

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:04.016
launching with options call.

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:05.536
Again, it's still fine to do

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:07.716
your one-time non-UI setup here.

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:10.906
Then immediately after that, the

00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:12.346
system's going to create a scene

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:12.936
session.

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:15.306
But before it creates the actual

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:16.875
UI Scene, it's going to ask our

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.836
application for UIScene

00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:19.685
configuration.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.946
This configuration specifies

00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:24.086
what scene delegate, what story

00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:25.606
board, and if you specified,

00:04:25.606 --> 00:04:27.106
what scene subclass you want to

00:04:27.106 --> 00:04:28.116
create the scene with.

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:31.376
It's worth noting that you can

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.026
define these scene

00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:34.046
configurations either

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:36.136
dynamically in code or

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:37.956
preferably statically in your

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:38.986
info.plist.

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:41.536
This also gives you an

00:04:41.536 --> 00:04:42.886
opportunity to select the right

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:43.726
configuration.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:45.266
You may have a main scene

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.086
configuration, and you may have

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.046
an accessory scene.

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:49.306
So, you should look at the

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:50.466
options parameter that's

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:52.536
provided here, to use that as

00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:53.896
the context to pick the right

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.386
scene configuration.

00:04:55.886 --> 00:05:00.536
Once you've defined these, for

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:02.476
example in your info.plist, it's

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:02.946
really simple.

00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:04.136
You just refer to it by name,

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:06.436
making sure you pass in the role

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.196
of the incoming sessions role.

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:11.096
Great.

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:12.886
Now our app is launched.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.626
We have a scene session.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.026
But we don't see any UI, and

00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:17.606
that's where our scene delegates

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:20.116
did connect to scene session

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:21.066
comes in.

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:23.406
Let's look at what kind of work

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:23.966
we should do here.

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:25.046
This is where you set up your UI

00:05:25.046 --> 00:05:27.676
window with the new designated

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:29.516
UI window initializer.

00:05:29.806 --> 00:05:31.126
We'll notice that we pass in the

00:05:31.126 --> 00:05:32.286
window scene provided.

00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:35.426
But importantly, we need to also

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:37.636
check for any relevant user

00:05:37.636 --> 00:05:40.626
activities or state restoration

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:42.216
activities to configure our

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:42.806
window with.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.856
We'll talk about that more in a

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:45.500
second.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.746
Yay, now we see our app.

00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:50.856
So, what happens when one of our

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:52.316
users actually swipes up to go

00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:52.996
back home?

00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:57.226
Well, the old familiar will

00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:58.746
resign active and did enter

00:05:58.746 --> 00:06:00.576
background methods get called on

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:01.306
your scene delegate.

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:02.736
But, now there's something

00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:03.266
interesting.

00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:05.586
At some point in time after,

00:06:05.816 --> 00:06:07.456
your scene may be disconnected.

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:08.896
Well, what does that mean?

00:06:09.116 --> 00:06:10.276
Well, in order to reclaim

00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:13.036
resources, the system may at

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:14.356
some point after your scene

00:06:14.356 --> 00:06:15.826
enters the background, release

00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:16.786
that scene from memory.

00:06:17.096 --> 00:06:18.616
That also means your scene

00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:20.096
delegate will be released from

00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:21.716
memory and any window

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:23.206
hierarchies or view hierarchies

00:06:23.436 --> 00:06:24.686
held by your scene delegate will

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:25.986
be released as well.

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:29.126
This gives you an opportunity to

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:31.016
deallocate and release any large

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.256
resources in memory that were

00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:33.676
retained by somewhere else in

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:35.696
your application that related to

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:36.406
this scene.

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:38.916
But it's important to not use

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:40.336
this to actually delete any

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:41.976
user data or state permanently,

00:06:42.226 --> 00:06:43.926
as the scene may reconnect and

00:06:43.926 --> 00:06:44.726
return later.

00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:49.966
But then let's talk about what

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:51.996
actually happens when our user

00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:53.966
actually swipes up on a scene

00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:55.436
session on switch and explicitly

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.526
wants to destroy it?

00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:59.326
Well, the system will call our

00:06:59.326 --> 00:07:01.716
App Delegates didDiscardSceneSessions.

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:05.236
This finally gives us an

00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:06.556
opportunity to actually

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:08.106
permanently delegate any user

00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:09.296
state or data associated with

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:11.326
the scene such as an unsaved

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:13.306
draft in a text editing app.

00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:16.176
Now, it's also possible that one

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.856
of your users removed one or

00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:19.356
more UIScenes from the switcher

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.176
by swiping up while your actual

00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:22.446
app process was not running.

00:07:23.316 --> 00:07:24.586
If your process was not running,

00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:25.746
the system will keep track of

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:27.536
the discarded sessions and call

00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:28.516
this shortly after your

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:29.796
application's next launch.

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:36.136
Now, let's talk about some

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:37.616
architecture patters that you

00:07:37.616 --> 00:07:38.816
can consider integrating into

00:07:38.816 --> 00:07:39.346
your apps.

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:43.556
We'll start by talking about

00:07:43.556 --> 00:07:44.476
state restoration.

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:48.086
In iOS 13, state restoration is

00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:49.536
no longer a nicety.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.216
It is crucial for your

00:07:52.216 --> 00:07:53.416
application to implement

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.206
scene-based state restoration.

00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.126
Let's go over why that is.

00:07:58.426 --> 00:07:59.286
Here's our app switcher.

00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:01.286
I have a document app and I'm

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:02.356
planning a road trip and I have

00:08:02.436 --> 00:08:03.416
four different sessions of

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.526
different documents open right

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:04.756
now.

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.006
But I'm really focusing on

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.506
packing list and agenda.

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:12.176
At some point, these other two

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:13.226
backgrounded road trip and

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.486
attendee scenes, have been

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:16.116
disconnected and released by the

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:16.616
system.

00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:18.896
If I don't implement state

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:20.886
restoration here, when I go back

00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:21.896
to the road trip, I'm not going

00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:23.546
to return to the state that I

00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:24.256
was previously in.

00:08:24.256 --> 00:08:25.056
I'm not going to scene the

00:08:25.056 --> 00:08:26.336
document that I was editing.

00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:28.176
Instead, I'll just start over,

00:08:28.176 --> 00:08:29.296
like it's a brand-new window,

00:08:29.296 --> 00:08:31.166
and that's not a great user

00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:31.776
experience.

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:34.275
Well, how can we resolve this?

00:08:34.946 --> 00:08:36.645
iOS 13 has a brand-new

00:08:37.346 --> 00:08:39.515
scene-based state restoration

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:39.806
API.

00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:41.576
And it's super simple.

00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:45.396
It works by not any more

00:08:45.396 --> 00:08:47.486
encoding view hierarchies, but

00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:49.496
instead just encoding the state

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:51.276
which will allow you to recreate

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:51.996
your window.

00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:56.236
This is all based on NSUser

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:56.946
activity as well.

00:08:56.946 --> 00:08:57.856
So, if your application

00:08:57.856 --> 00:08:59.376
leverages powerful technologies

00:08:59.376 --> 00:09:00.696
like spotlight search or

00:09:00.696 --> 00:09:02.336
handoff, you can use these same

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:03.686
activities to encode the state

00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:04.136
of your app.

00:09:04.796 --> 00:09:06.076
It's also worth noting that in

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:08.196
iOS 13, the state restoration

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.646
archive that you give back to

00:09:09.646 --> 00:09:11.656
the system will match the same

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:13.236
data protection class of the

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:14.336
rest of your application.

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:19.966
What does this look like in

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:20.906
code?

00:09:20.906 --> 00:09:22.156
Well, in our scene delegate, we

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:23.356
implement state restoration

00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:25.796
activity for scene and then I

00:09:25.796 --> 00:09:29.346
call a method that finds the

00:09:29.346 --> 00:09:31.506
most active relevant user

00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:33.086
activity form in the current

00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:33.496
window.

00:09:34.046 --> 00:09:35.526
Then we return that.

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:38.366
After some time, when that scene

00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:39.496
re-enters the foreground and

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.746
becomes connected, we check if

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.176
the session contains a state

00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:44.286
restoration activity.

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:46.596
If it does, we use that

00:09:46.596 --> 00:09:47.076
activity.

00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:48.656
If not, we can create a

00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:50.446
brand-new window without any

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:50.776
state.

00:09:51.886 --> 00:09:53.546
This means that no matter what,

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:55.396
our users will never notice when

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.026
scenes get disconnected in the

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:58.236
background because they

00:09:58.236 --> 00:09:58.626
shouldn't.

00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:03.156
Finally, let's talk about one

00:10:03.156 --> 00:10:05.346
more important issue that you

00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:06.816
may run into when adopting

00:10:06.816 --> 00:10:08.026
support for multiple windows.

00:10:08.196 --> 00:10:09.756
And that is how to best keep

00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:11.496
application scenes in sync.

00:10:11.496 --> 00:10:13.656
Let me make this more concrete.

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:15.256
I've been working on a new chat

00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:17.396
application right here, and as

00:10:17.396 --> 00:10:18.866
we see, I just recently added

00:10:18.866 --> 00:10:20.456
support for multiple windows on

00:10:20.456 --> 00:10:21.236
iOS 13.

00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:23.666
And I have a chat with my

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:25.786
friend, Giovanni, who will join

00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:27.086
me on stage in a couple minutes,

00:10:27.736 --> 00:10:28.896
and notice that we're viewing

00:10:28.896 --> 00:10:30.046
the same conversation in two

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.076
different view controllers and

00:10:31.076 --> 00:10:32.536
two different scenes at the same

00:10:32.536 --> 00:10:32.886
time.

00:10:34.036 --> 00:10:35.276
So, let's say I want to send

00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:36.826
Giovanni a message and let him

00:10:36.826 --> 00:10:37.846
know I'm ready for lunch.

00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.866
Oh, only one of our scenes

00:10:40.866 --> 00:10:41.376
updated.

00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:43.706
So, why is that?

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:46.816
Well, it turns out that on iOS,

00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:47.976
a lot of apps are structured in

00:10:47.976 --> 00:10:49.486
this kind of way in which view

00:10:49.486 --> 00:10:51.026
controllers receive an event,

00:10:51.446 --> 00:10:52.766
maybe via button tap, me

00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:53.846
pressing the send button.

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:56.086
And then the view controller

00:10:56.086 --> 00:10:57.786
itself updates its own UI.

00:10:58.716 --> 00:11:00.166
After that, our view controller

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:01.826
notifies our model or model

00:11:01.826 --> 00:11:02.436
controller.

00:11:02.436 --> 00:11:05.266
And this is mostly okay when we

00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:07.046
just are talking about one user

00:11:07.046 --> 00:11:07.856
interface instance.

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:10.146
But now if we introduce a second

00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:11.816
view controller in a different

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:13.166
scene that's showing the same

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:15.296
data, at no point is this new

00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:16.666
view controller being notified

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:18.596
to update itself with this new

00:11:18.596 --> 00:11:18.916
data.

00:11:19.816 --> 00:11:20.446
That's an issue.

00:11:20.966 --> 00:11:24.556
Well, we can resolve this.

00:11:24.606 --> 00:11:25.976
Architecturally, now if our view

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.186
controllers, upon receiving an

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:29.536
event, immediately and only

00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:31.356
notify our model controller,

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:32.986
then we can have our model

00:11:32.986 --> 00:11:35.416
controller actually notify any

00:11:35.416 --> 00:11:36.686
relevant subscribers or view

00:11:36.686 --> 00:11:37.946
controllers, telling them that

00:11:37.946 --> 00:11:39.196
they should update with this new

00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:39.996
data.

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:42.536
There are a number of ways that

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:43.196
we can do this.

00:11:43.196 --> 00:11:44.146
We can use delegates,

00:11:44.146 --> 00:11:45.046
notifications.

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:46.696
We can even use the fantastic

00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:48.086
new Swift Combine framework

00:11:48.086 --> 00:11:48.836
released this year.

00:11:49.716 --> 00:11:51.116
But let's go over a lightweight

00:11:51.116 --> 00:11:52.526
Swift example that you can

00:11:52.526 --> 00:11:53.646
consider integrating into your

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.096
apps.

00:11:54.666 --> 00:11:55.976
Here's the current method that

00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:57.356
gets called when I press the

00:11:57.566 --> 00:11:58.786
return button on sending a

00:11:58.786 --> 00:11:59.336
message.

00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.076
We create a message model

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:01.426
object.

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:03.306
My view controller updates its

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:03.866
own views.

00:12:04.446 --> 00:12:07.096
And then we notify our model

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:08.746
controller to persist this.

00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:11.056
And the first thing we need to

00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:11.916
do is this view controller

00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:13.756
should not be mutating its own

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:14.406
view state.

00:12:14.886 --> 00:12:16.086
Instead, we're just going to get

00:12:16.086 --> 00:12:16.646
rid of that code.

00:12:16.746 --> 00:12:18.196
We'll add that back later in a

00:12:18.656 --> 00:12:18.836
second.

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:22.706
Now, let's look at what that

00:12:22.706 --> 00:12:24.836
model controller add method is

00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:25.446
actually doing.

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:26.576
It's pretty simple.

00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:28.406
All we're doing is persisting

00:12:28.406 --> 00:12:29.176
that new message.

00:12:30.096 --> 00:12:31.286
But we actually want the model

00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:33.556
controller to now notify if any

00:12:33.556 --> 00:12:34.526
other view controllers or

00:12:34.526 --> 00:12:35.826
connected scenes that there has

00:12:35.826 --> 00:12:36.476
been an update.

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:40.456
How are we going to send this

00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:41.186
update down?

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.936
We want a structured way to

00:12:43.936 --> 00:12:46.276
package this event such that

00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:49.366
it's strongly typed and it's

00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:51.166
easily debuggable and testable.

00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:52.576
So, let's go ahead and actually

00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:54.116
create a new type and we'll call

00:12:54.116 --> 00:12:55.206
it update event.

00:12:55.206 --> 00:12:56.516
It's a Swift enum with

00:12:56.516 --> 00:12:57.536
associated values.

00:12:58.066 --> 00:12:59.736
So, we'll add a new message

00:12:59.736 --> 00:13:00.026
type.

00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:02.276
This is the object that our

00:13:02.276 --> 00:13:03.506
model controller is going to

00:13:03.506 --> 00:13:04.836
create on receiving a new

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:06.626
message and will then send down

00:13:06.626 --> 00:13:07.876
to any relevant view controllers

00:13:07.876 --> 00:13:08.456
or scenes.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:10.896
Because we want to post this,

00:13:10.896 --> 00:13:12.496
we'll use NSNotification center

00:13:12.716 --> 00:13:14.076
as the backing store for this.

00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:15.826
So, we'll add this handy post

00:13:15.826 --> 00:13:17.636
method that lets us in one line

00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.286
create a new update event and

00:13:19.286 --> 00:13:20.896
then post it to any subscribers.

00:13:21.456 --> 00:13:24.186
The implementation is fairly

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:25.166
straightforward.

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:27.006
We just post a notification to

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:28.486
the new message notification

00:13:28.486 --> 00:13:29.646
name channel.

00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:31.376
But the trick here is that we're

00:13:31.376 --> 00:13:32.696
including the update event

00:13:32.926 --> 00:13:34.826
object itself in the

00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:35.766
notifications object.

00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:37.096
This will come in handy, as

00:13:37.096 --> 00:13:41.446
we'll see in a second.

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:42.956
Now, when our model controller

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:44.166
is notified that a new message

00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:45.926
was added, after we persist it,

00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:47.166
we can just create this new

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:49.066
event and call post.

00:13:51.546 --> 00:13:53.466
Then, if we look at how we have

00:13:53.496 --> 00:13:54.696
to change our view controllers,

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:57.396
we observe this new event.

00:13:57.676 --> 00:13:58.976
In this case, the new message

00:13:58.976 --> 00:13:59.836
notification name.

00:14:00.286 --> 00:14:01.716
And then we create a handler

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.366
method that we get the

00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:06.066
notification from in the arguments.

00:14:06.816 --> 00:14:08.126
And remember, when we pass the

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:09.646
update event as the

00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:12.426
notifications object, we can now

00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:14.076
pull that event right back out

00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:15.426
from the notification.

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:18.736
Then, we can easily switch on

00:14:18.736 --> 00:14:20.506
the kind of case of the event

00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:22.886
and because we created an

00:14:22.886 --> 00:14:25.166
associated enum, we can pull the

00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:26.726
message out.

00:14:26.986 --> 00:14:28.616
Now, we can update our user

00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:29.326
interface here.

00:14:32.536 --> 00:14:33.736
So, let's see what happens when

00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:34.896
I send Giovanni that same

00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:36.786
message after implementing this

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:37.496
new architecture.

00:14:38.196 --> 00:14:39.696
Hey! All of our scenes update.

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:45.876
[ Applause ]

00:14:46.376 --> 00:14:47.866
So, we've gone over a lot today.

00:14:48.076 --> 00:14:48.976
We've gone over some of the

00:14:48.976 --> 00:14:50.886
differences in the app versus

00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:51.736
scene delegate and the

00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:53.296
differences in responsibilities.

00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:54.806
We've also gone over some of the

00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:57.586
major scene delegate methods and

00:14:57.586 --> 00:14:58.836
what kind of work you should do

00:14:58.836 --> 00:14:59.066
there.

00:15:00.156 --> 00:15:01.306
We also talked about why state

00:15:01.306 --> 00:15:02.736
restoration is so crucial for

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.616
you to use on iOS 13 and how you

00:15:04.616 --> 00:15:06.726
can leverage the new scene-based

00:15:06.896 --> 00:15:07.926
API to do so.

00:15:08.606 --> 00:15:11.166
Finally, we talked about some

00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:12.596
high-level patterns for creating

00:15:12.596 --> 00:15:14.066
a one-way data flow such that we

00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:15.296
can keep all of our scenes in

00:15:15.296 --> 00:15:16.456
sync while they share the same

00:15:16.456 --> 00:15:16.776
data.

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:17.716
Thank you.
