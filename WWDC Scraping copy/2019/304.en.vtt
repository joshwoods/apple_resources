[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.706
>> Hello. My name is Ashley

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:20.346
Carroll, and I'm a consulting

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:21.796
engineer from New York focused

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:22.626
on app development.

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:24.926
I spend my time working with our

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:26.556
largest business, government,

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:28.306
and education customers, helping

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.536
them build and distribute great

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:31.536
apps for their employees.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.336
Welcome to App Distribution From

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:35.206
Ad Hoc to Eenterprise.

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:37.326
So who here in the room today

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:38.576
has had to distribute an app

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:39.046
before?

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.556
Just a few hands, right.

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:42.736
You're in the right place.

00:00:42.736 --> 00:00:44.116
So, pretty much everyone has had

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:46.056
to do this, and whether you're

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:48.106
building apps for the App Store

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:50.036
or focusing on building

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:52.116
customized private apps for

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:53.576
business or enterprise, you

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:54.466
should learn something today.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.686
I want to begin by taking a step

00:00:57.736 --> 00:00:59.106
back from app distribution and

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:00.866
talk about the life cycle of an

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.836
app from its earliest

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:02.456
beginnings.

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:04.355
Most of us probably know this

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.146
part of the process inside and

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:06.316
out.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.326
It all starts with an idea for a

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:09.506
problem that you want to solve.

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:11.406
You figure out what to build.

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:13.236
You create a great app, and it

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:14.356
makes it into the hands of your

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:17.106
users, most often through the

00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:18.496
App Store.

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:20.606
Today, we'll be focusing on that

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:23.156
last bit, how users actually get

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:25.106
your app onto their devices.

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:28.296
It seems simple, and for lots of

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:29.826
apps on the store, it is.

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:31.486
But there's actually a number of

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:32.606
different ways that you can

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:33.986
distribute an app.

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:36.506
And that depends on who your

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:37.866
customer is.

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:40.556
This is all about finding the

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:42.186
right way to reach your users.

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:43.886
Your users could be the general

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:45.756
public or business and education

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:46.286
customers.

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:48.036
Depending on who your app is

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:49.786
for, there are different ways to

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:50.396
distribute it.

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:52.426
There are four distribution

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:53.136
methods that we're going to

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:53.526
cover today.

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:57.756
Ad hoc, App Store, in-house, and

00:01:57.756 --> 00:01:58.356
custom apps.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.386
How do you determine which path

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.626
is the most appropriate for you?

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:05.206
This depends on a number of

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:07.186
factors, and some questions you

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:09.136
might ask along the way include

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:10.866
who's the audience for this app.

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.436
Who's going to maintain the

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:13.976
source code?

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:16.156
Are you building the app for you

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:17.176
or for someone else?

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:19.076
Is someone buying this app for

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:20.256
their employees or students to

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:20.566
use?

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:23.536
All of this comes down to asking

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:25.626
who, and we can focus that on

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:27.446
who was using the app and who is

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:27.936
buying the app.

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:33.876
Knowing that the customer and

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:35.496
the user are not always the same

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:37.296
person or entity is critical to

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:38.756
mastering the different ways

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:40.086
that apps can be distributed and

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:41.456
figuring out where your app

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:42.006
fits.

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:43.886
If you can identify your

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:45.386
audience, it becomes a lot

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:46.636
easier to pick the right

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:47.786
distribution mechanism.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:50.176
Most often, an individual is the

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.606
both the customer and the user.

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.256
They download your app from the

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.006
App Store on their own device

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.066
and then use it themselves.

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:58.696
Ad hoc distribution lets you

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.226
distribute to a limited number

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:02.586
of devices that you choose for

00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:04.726
testing, and the App Store lets

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:05.676
you distribute apps to the

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:06.436
general public.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.646
Now, sometimes when dealing with

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:10.816
the business and education

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.186
market, the customer is actually

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:14.876
an organization, and they're

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:16.706
purchasing apps on behalf of a

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:18.646
group of users who will use

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.346
those apps on either devices

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:21.936
that that organization provides

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.216
to them or on their own devices.

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:28.576
So there are two different ways

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:29.916
that you can distribute apps in

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.366
this scenario, in house and

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:33.256
custom apps, and those both let

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:35.926
you distribute apps privately to

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:36.626
organizations.

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:40.396
Your app might have different

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:41.746
reasons to use all of these

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:42.756
distribution methods at

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.436
different times in its lifetime

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:46.156
or simply live in one of them,

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:47.736
and different distribution

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:49.466
mechanisms are associated with

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:51.316
different types of memberships

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:52.686
in the Apple developer programs.

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:55.686
We're going to walk through each

00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:57.146
of these distribution methods

00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:57.476
today.

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:00.466
The expectations around each and

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:01.886
everything that you need to know

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.246
to figure out where your app

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:05.936
fits.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:07.416
We'll do this by following an

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:08.896
app on a distribution journey

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.716
from its very beginnings as a

00:04:10.756 --> 00:04:12.136
prototype, through the App

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:13.906
Store, and through being

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:15.536
customized for a business to be

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:17.305
distributed privately in a few

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:17.995
different ways.

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:21.305
That app is LunchControl.

00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:23.646
LunchControl is an app for

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:24.906
collaborative food ordering, and

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.396
when we're talking about

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:28.306
LunchControl, I want you to

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:30.076
imagine yourself as the

00:04:30.076 --> 00:04:30.926
developer for this app.

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:33.076
We'll begin with how

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:34.606
LunchControl came to be.

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.586
This whole journey starts with

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:38.686
ordering lunch at the office.

00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:40.826
Everyone loves to get takeout,

00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:43.156
but the process for ordering and

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:45.386
for a big group of people is

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:46.556
daunting and time consuming.

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:47.966
You have to figure out what

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.896
everyone wants to eat and go

00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:50.826
through each of the orders to

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:52.386
make a consolidated list.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:54.576
So, make sure you remember that

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:55.796
Trevor doesn't like tomatoes,

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.016
whatever your boss' usual is,

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.816
and that the new guy, Rod was

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:02.726
it, said he wants a turkey club.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.236
Does this sound familiar to

00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:04.636
anyone?

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:06.936
It takes way too long, so it's

00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:09.106
almost not worth ordering, and

00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:10.166
it really sounds like a great

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.886
problem to solve with an app.

00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:13.146
So you give it a try, and you

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.186
come up with a prototype.

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:16.796
To build your prototype, you've

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:18.546
downloaded Xcode, started

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:20.076
exploring the SDK, and you've

00:05:20.076 --> 00:05:22.546
logged in using your Apple ID.

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:23.836
I'm sure most of you know how to

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:24.976
get started because you've

00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:26.496
probably already published apps

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:27.986
to the store, but we're going to

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:29.436
review this part of the process

00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:31.626
quickly, just so that everyone's

00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:32.896
on the same page, and you really

00:05:32.896 --> 00:05:34.346
get a full picture of app

00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:36.126
distribution from start to

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:37.386
finish, and hopefully you'll

00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:39.416
learn something new along the

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:40.496
way.

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:41.556
This is your prototype.

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:43.456
You can select items from the

00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:44.826
menu and create a group order.

00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.246
All of the items are nicely

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.686
summarized, and it even breaks

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:49.806
up the cost per person.

00:05:50.276 --> 00:05:51.486
But how would you actually get

00:05:51.486 --> 00:05:52.916
this prototype running on your

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:53.496
devices?

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:56.126
You can sign into Xcode with

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:57.776
your Apple ID and leverage the

00:05:57.776 --> 00:05:59.146
free account that comes with it,

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:00.566
called the Personal Team.

00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:02.936
This enables you to explore the

00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:04.366
SDK and test apps on your

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:04.926
device.

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:06.986
You can only deploy a limited

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:08.556
number of apps to a few devices,

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:10.476
and they expire after a few

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:12.326
days, so this isn't a real

00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:14.006
distribution method.

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:16.946
Here's what you see in Xcode

00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:17.856
once you're logged in with a

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:18.706
personal team.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.656
You build and run your app.

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:21.766
Xcode installs it on your

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.076
device, but in order for it to

00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:24.666
be able to launch, you'll need

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:25.696
to trust your developer

00:06:25.696 --> 00:06:27.136
certificate on your device.

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:29.526
This is what that process looks

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:29.786
like.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:31.406
You can trust the developer

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:32.506
certificate by going into

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:35.166
settings, general, profiles, and

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.066
device management.

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:40.686
Here are a few best practices to

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.266
keep in mind for personal teams.

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:45.056
These accounts are really meant

00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:45.686
for learning.

00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:47.806
The assumption is that you're

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.626
going to be deploying to devices

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:53.206
that you own, and this isn't for

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:54.896
distribution beyond your own

00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:55.546
devices.

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:58.266
Some capabilities like CloudKit,

00:06:58.656 --> 00:07:00.796
Siri, or APNS aren't available,

00:07:01.276 --> 00:07:02.426
and there's no way to publish

00:07:02.426 --> 00:07:03.456
apps to the store with this

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.416
program or debate a testing with

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:06.166
other users.

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:09.246
The goal for LunchControl is to

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:10.686
go beyond this learning stage.

00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:12.906
So, let's talk about the first

00:07:12.906 --> 00:07:13.996
way that you can distribute

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:14.626
LunchControl.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:17.096
Ad hoc distribution can be

00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:18.526
utilized to distribute apps for

00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:19.026
testing.

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:23.116
Up until this point, you've been

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:24.466
walking around to different

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:25.726
people's desks to take their

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:27.646
orders and mostly just testing

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:28.986
the app in the simulator and on

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:29.606
your own device.

00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:31.406
You're really ready to have a

00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:33.236
few friends try it out and get

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:34.216
feedback and see if you've got

00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:36.286
something special, and you also

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:37.776
think that integrating with Siri

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:39.036
and push notifications would

00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:40.466
make the experience even better,

00:07:41.806 --> 00:07:43.106
which aren't available with

00:07:43.106 --> 00:07:43.926
personal teams.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.416
Membership in the Apple

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:48.076
Developer Program is required in

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:49.306
order to distribute an app to

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:49.666
others.

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:51.926
So, this is the point where if

00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:53.726
you don't already have an

00:07:53.726 --> 00:07:54.836
account, most developers would

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:56.736
sign up, either as a company or

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:58.726
an individual, and once you're

00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:00.596
signed up, you're ready to start

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:04.286
distributing to others.

00:08:04.496 --> 00:08:05.556
When you leverage ad hoc

00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:07.376
distribution, a limited number

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:08.736
of users can install your app

00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:10.446
directly from their devices for

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:10.946
testing.

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:13.176
The process requires that you

00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:14.676
register their device from the

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:16.326
developer website, and there are

00:08:16.326 --> 00:08:17.626
a limited number of devices that

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:18.766
you can register for both

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:19.966
development and testing.

00:08:21.236 --> 00:08:23.176
That's 100 devices per product

00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:24.136
family per year.

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.396
For your average user,

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:29.396
registering a device involves

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:30.626
connecting it to a Mac and

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:32.126
getting the device identifier,

00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:33.946
either from the finder's sidebar

00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:35.936
or retrieving it from Xcode,

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.015
which means that you as a

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.236
developer would need physical

00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:39.436
possession of their device.

00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:42.806
You then take that identifier

00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:43.956
and add it to the Apple

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.716
developer website, and once you

00:08:45.716 --> 00:08:47.016
have their device registered,

00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:48.946
you're ready to create a build

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:51.176
and install it for them.

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:52.356
There are several different

00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:53.756
alternatives for installing ad

00:08:53.756 --> 00:08:54.866
hoc builds for testers.

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:56.616
You can tether the device to

00:08:56.616 --> 00:08:58.656
your Mac and install with Xcode

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:00.286
or Apple configurator, which is

00:09:00.286 --> 00:09:01.486
available on the Mac App Store,

00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:03.166
or you can host the app

00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:04.546
somewhere and enable

00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:05.596
over-the-air installation.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.216
This is a manual way of

00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:10.026
achieving a limited distribution

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:11.036
to a small group.

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:15.646
This program is designed to let

00:09:15.646 --> 00:09:17.356
you deploy to registered devices

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.446
for the purpose of testing.

00:09:19.186 --> 00:09:21.216
It's not a long-term or scalable

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:23.126
distribution solution, and the

00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:24.596
provisioning profiles used to

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:26.316
sign these apps expire yearly,

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:28.196
so eventually the apps will stop

00:09:28.196 --> 00:09:30.066
working or need to be re-signed.

00:09:31.106 --> 00:09:32.916
For larger teams, it's really

00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:33.886
important to take note of the

00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:34.586
device limits.

00:09:35.146 --> 00:09:36.586
It can be hard to develop for

00:09:36.586 --> 00:09:38.406
new products if you run out of

00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:39.986
devices, which is why you have

00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:41.096
to be careful when using

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:43.176
development devices for testers.

00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:45.346
These device limits are reset

00:09:45.346 --> 00:09:47.266
once per year, and if you're

00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:48.716
curious about when your device

00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:50.076
counts are going to be reset for

00:09:50.076 --> 00:09:51.206
your account, you can go to the

00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:52.296
member page on the developer

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:54.136
website and look at the reset

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:54.376
date.

00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:58.976
Ad hoc distribution gave us the

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:00.236
ability to test with a few

00:10:00.236 --> 00:10:00.726
users.

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:03.446
You quickly realize that ad hoc

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:04.956
distribution isn't scalable as

00:10:04.956 --> 00:10:05.986
the number of people who want to

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:07.096
test the app grows.

00:10:07.616 --> 00:10:08.906
So, let's talk about the App

00:10:08.946 --> 00:10:09.216
Store.

00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:12.426
The App Store offers a much

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:13.796
better way to do beta testing

00:10:13.836 --> 00:10:15.016
for a large group of users.

00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:17.436
User interest in LunchControl is

00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:18.916
growing, and you want to expand

00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:20.086
your audience to include more

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:20.706
testers.

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.566
TestFlight makes it really easy

00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:26.146
for both developers and users to

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.526
try out apps, and installation

00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:29.766
and updates are simple.

00:10:30.186 --> 00:10:31.586
You could scale up to 10,000

00:10:31.586 --> 00:10:32.046
testers.

00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:33.946
The builds last for three

00:10:33.946 --> 00:10:35.786
months, and for a user,

00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:37.526
installing an app is a familiar

00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:38.516
and simple process.

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:40.956
TestFlight beta builds for

00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:42.596
external testers do go through

00:10:42.596 --> 00:10:43.146
app review.

00:10:43.756 --> 00:10:44.796
So, you need to make sure that

00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:45.906
you're following the App Store

00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:46.936
review guidelines before

00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:48.656
submitting, and the app needs to

00:10:48.736 --> 00:10:50.066
be stable and ready for a

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.046
broader audience to test.

00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:53.276
However, if you're making a

00:10:53.276 --> 00:10:55.016
build available to only members

00:10:55.016 --> 00:10:56.546
of your App Store connect team,

00:10:57.086 --> 00:10:58.406
review isn't required.

00:10:58.896 --> 00:11:00.896
And TestFlight is only available

00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:01.956
to members of the Apple

00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:02.876
Developer Program.

00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:06.726
TestFlight is built right into

00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:07.486
App Store Connect.

00:11:08.346 --> 00:11:09.506
For those of you who are only

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:10.766
familiar with the Apple

00:11:10.766 --> 00:11:12.576
Developer Enterprise Program and

00:11:12.576 --> 00:11:13.836
have probably never used App

00:11:13.836 --> 00:11:15.396
Store Connect before, this is

00:11:15.396 --> 00:11:16.016
what it looks like.

00:11:16.716 --> 00:11:18.446
App Store Connect enables you to

00:11:18.446 --> 00:11:20.086
easily upload, submit, and

00:11:20.086 --> 00:11:21.936
manage your apps on the App

00:11:22.026 --> 00:11:22.286
Store.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.166
All of your TestFlight builds

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:25.966
are available to see here, and

00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:27.366
you can invite testers to test

00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:28.736
your app.

00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:29.846
Testers can install your app

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:31.456
from the TesFlight app on their

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:32.076
devices.

00:11:32.556 --> 00:11:35.606
Once you invite a tester in

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:37.086
TestFlight, they will receive an

00:11:37.086 --> 00:11:38.596
email invitation to beta test

00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:39.816
your app.

00:11:40.276 --> 00:11:41.266
They can review all of the

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:42.786
testing details that you provide

00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:44.506
and install the app to start

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:47.686
testing right away.

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:49.096
Once you're satisfied with the

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:50.686
stability of your built, the

00:11:50.686 --> 00:11:52.516
next step is submitting to the

00:11:53.156 --> 00:11:53.936
App Store.

00:11:54.076 --> 00:11:55.886
For LunchControl, you've made

00:11:55.886 --> 00:11:57.696
some updates, added features

00:11:57.696 --> 00:11:59.016
based on feedback from your beta

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:00.836
testers, and really iterated on

00:12:00.836 --> 00:12:01.376
your design.

00:12:02.006 --> 00:12:03.156
You're ready to list the app for

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:04.906
sale, and you've even updated

00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:08.536
your app icon.

00:12:08.726 --> 00:12:10.236
You've done the hard work to get

00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:11.436
your app ready for submission.

00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:14.546
Let's consider who the user and

00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:15.686
who the customer is here.

00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:17.946
Both are the general public,

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:19.656
which makes this app appropriate

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:21.076
for the public app store.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:23.806
Any individual can download and

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:25.446
use your app, and the person who

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:26.926
is buying it is also the person

00:12:26.926 --> 00:12:28.106
who's using it.

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:30.956
Here are a few things you should

00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:32.326
know about how App Store

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:33.266
distribution works.

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:35.876
Both individuals and

00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:37.396
organizations can sign up for

00:12:37.396 --> 00:12:38.886
the Apple Developer Program to

00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:40.096
distribute to the App Store.

00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:42.526
Apps are available to the

00:12:42.526 --> 00:12:44.006
general public based on the

00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:45.056
markets that you choose to

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:47.216
support, and the apps are hosted

00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:49.126
and reviewed by Apple.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.356
This means that developers are

00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:54.276
expected to know and follow the

00:12:54.276 --> 00:12:55.846
App Store review guidelines.

00:12:56.746 --> 00:12:58.546
It's also expected that you keep

00:12:58.546 --> 00:12:58.866
current.

00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:00.636
This means supporting new

00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:02.216
hardware and screen sizes,

00:13:02.566 --> 00:13:04.586
modern APIs, and new features,

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:05.766
like all of the exciting things

00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:06.716
that we've announced this week.

00:13:07.616 --> 00:13:10.056
And just to reiterate, the App

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:11.826
Store is appropriate for apps

00:13:12.076 --> 00:13:13.496
that are for the general public,

00:13:13.906 --> 00:13:14.816
which means that if you're

00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:15.616
building an app for the

00:13:15.616 --> 00:13:17.846
employees of a specific company

00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.936
to use, the public App Store is

00:13:19.936 --> 00:13:21.356
probably not the most

00:13:21.356 --> 00:13:22.446
appropriate place for it.

00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:25.036
Let's talk about a few more

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:26.636
scenarios that developers might

00:13:26.636 --> 00:13:30.836
run into in the App Store.

00:13:31.036 --> 00:13:32.676
First, let's talk about the

00:13:32.676 --> 00:13:34.116
ability for a customer to

00:13:34.116 --> 00:13:35.966
purchase your app in bulk for a

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:36.706
group of users.

00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:38.656
There are programs in place that

00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:41.186
enable you to do this.

00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:42.916
For LunchControl, a bunch of

00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:43.946
your friends are teachers at a

00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:45.546
local school, and their school

00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:47.056
wants to purchase the app in

00:13:47.056 --> 00:13:48.466
bulk for all of the faculty to

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:48.856
use.

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.626
As a developer, if you want to

00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:53.196
offer them a discount, you need

00:13:53.196 --> 00:13:54.166
to make sure that this is

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.296
enabled in App Store Connect.

00:13:55.476 --> 00:13:58.556
In this case, your user is still

00:13:58.556 --> 00:13:59.326
the general public.

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:00.716
So a group of teachers who would

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:02.416
be using your App Store app, but

00:14:02.416 --> 00:14:03.586
the customer that's doing the

00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:04.826
purchasing is actually the

00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:06.106
school that they're working for.

00:14:07.436 --> 00:14:09.556
Customers use Apple Business

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:11.336
Manager or Apple School Manager

00:14:11.336 --> 00:14:12.366
to purchase apps like

00:14:12.366 --> 00:14:13.946
LunchControl from the App Store

00:14:13.946 --> 00:14:15.696
in bulk and distribute them to

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:16.276
their users.

00:14:18.186 --> 00:14:20.006
To verify that an education

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:22.006
customer can purchase your app

00:14:22.006 --> 00:14:23.596
at a discount, you would take a

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:24.526
look at the pricing and

00:14:24.526 --> 00:14:25.986
availability section in App

00:14:25.986 --> 00:14:26.546
Store Connect.

00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:29.746
The default availability option

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:32.006
for an app is available at a

00:14:32.006 --> 00:14:33.866
reduced price for educational

00:14:33.866 --> 00:14:34.596
institutions.

00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:36.866
If the educational institution

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:38.766
purchases 20 or more licenses,

00:14:38.966 --> 00:14:40.106
and you have this enabled for

00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:40.376
them.

00:14:40.706 --> 00:14:41.966
They'll receive a 50 percent

00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:44.056
discount, and Apple School

00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:45.716
Manager is required for them to

00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:46.456
make this purchase.

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:53.526
Next, I want to discuss proper

00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:55.316
versioning for an app and how to

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.606
handle adding additional

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:57.136
features.

00:14:58.556 --> 00:14:59.796
As LunchControl grows in

00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:01.796
popularity, more and more

00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:03.616
feature requests are coming in,

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.016
and more organizations start to

00:15:06.016 --> 00:15:07.066
become interested in leverage

00:15:07.066 --> 00:15:07.326
the app.

00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:10.756
Some users or organizations may

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.786
ask you to add features that may

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:14.016
not make sense for your entire

00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:16.226
audience, but you need to be

00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:17.426
careful about versioning your

00:15:17.426 --> 00:15:18.866
app in the app store

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:19.596
appropriately.

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.016
As you start to expand your

00:15:22.016 --> 00:15:23.446
customer base and consider

00:15:23.446 --> 00:15:24.696
offering multiple versions of

00:15:24.696 --> 00:15:26.416
your app on the store to various

00:15:26.416 --> 00:15:29.506
clients or even variations of

00:15:29.506 --> 00:15:30.766
your app for different types of

00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:33.546
users, like if having an admin

00:15:33.546 --> 00:15:34.836
and a regular version made sense

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:36.586
for you, you want to handle

00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:37.866
versioning and your app store

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:38.906
presence appropriately.

00:15:39.466 --> 00:15:42.216
This is what could happen if

00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:43.386
LunchControl doesn't manage

00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:44.256
their App Store presence

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:44.806
properly.

00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:46.796
This is actually a real example

00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:48.586
from the App Store, just using

00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.096
the names from Liquid Oxygen

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:51.796
Company and LunchControl.

00:15:52.436 --> 00:15:53.356
Don't do this.

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:55.206
When a user searches the App

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:57.076
Store for a given name, this is

00:15:57.076 --> 00:15:58.146
what they might see if you

00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:59.256
version your app this way.

00:16:00.046 --> 00:16:01.196
They have no idea which app to

00:16:01.196 --> 00:16:02.726
pick, and if they pick the wrong

00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:04.146
one, they might not be able to

00:16:04.146 --> 00:16:06.126
log in or use it and might not

00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:07.496
behave in a way that's expected.

00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:09.156
This is a really frustrating

00:16:09.156 --> 00:16:11.096
experience for a user, and it's

00:16:11.256 --> 00:16:12.976
easily overcome by managing your

00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:14.876
versions better in software and

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:16.236
moving your customer base

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:17.596
forward as you make changes to

00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:19.426
your app and your product.

00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:21.316
What developers should do

00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:23.036
instead is consolidate app

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:24.936
versions as much as possible.

00:16:25.376 --> 00:16:27.666
Ideally, it's one app, just like

00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:28.436
you see here on the left.

00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:30.416
This does require more

00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:32.066
development work, but in the end

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:33.196
it's a much better customer

00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:35.816
experience, and if you as a

00:16:35.816 --> 00:16:37.546
developer start getting requests

00:16:37.546 --> 00:16:39.146
for lots of different customized

00:16:39.146 --> 00:16:40.796
versions of your app, it might

00:16:40.796 --> 00:16:42.436
be a good time to talk about how

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:43.776
you could deliver those versions

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:45.576
privately using custom apps,

00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:47.436
which we'll get into in a few

00:16:47.436 --> 00:16:47.806
minutes.

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:51.576
The final App Store scenario I

00:16:51.576 --> 00:16:53.546
want to cover is building an App

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:55.246
Store app for someone else.

00:16:56.086 --> 00:16:58.186
Your company, Liquid Oxygen,

00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:00.396
LLC, might be approached by a

00:17:00.396 --> 00:17:01.936
customer to build their own

00:17:01.936 --> 00:17:02.676
public facing app.

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:04.996
In this case, we're going to

00:17:04.996 --> 00:17:07.096
talk about Liquid Oxygen being

00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:08.236
approached by a restaurant

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.406
chain, Taco Bar, to create their

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.756
App Store app for them.

00:17:13.756 --> 00:17:15.346
Taco Bar loves what you've done

00:17:15.346 --> 00:17:16.896
with LunchControl and really

00:17:16.896 --> 00:17:17.876
wants you to build them an app

00:17:18.056 --> 00:17:19.195
where customers could place

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:20.925
orders, find the Taco Bar

00:17:20.925 --> 00:17:23.366
locations near them, and pay for

00:17:23.366 --> 00:17:23.786
their food.

00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:25.675
They currently don't have an App

00:17:25.675 --> 00:17:27.195
Store presence, so this would be

00:17:27.195 --> 00:17:29.796
their flagship app, and you, as

00:17:29.796 --> 00:17:31.096
a developer, don't want to give

00:17:31.096 --> 00:17:32.386
Taco Bar your intellectual

00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:32.906
property.

00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:35.676
In this scenario, the user of

00:17:35.676 --> 00:17:37.176
your app is still the general

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:38.866
public, and the customer is

00:17:38.866 --> 00:17:39.956
actually Taco Bar.

00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:41.916
You would be building an app for

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:44.996
Taco Bar for their customers

00:17:45.386 --> 00:17:46.866
while still maintaining control

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.266
of your intellectual property

00:17:48.856 --> 00:17:50.836
and running Liquid Oxygen, LLC.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.146
This is a brand-new app that

00:17:53.616 --> 00:17:54.926
will have a separate bundle ID

00:17:54.926 --> 00:17:56.916
and will exist on the App Store

00:17:56.916 --> 00:17:58.226
alongside LunchControl.

00:17:58.776 --> 00:18:00.826
This is not simply publishing

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:02.356
the same app under a different

00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:02.996
customer name.

00:18:03.346 --> 00:18:04.316
It's a new and distinct

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:04.986
experience.

00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:08.416
So, how would Liquid Oxygen work

00:18:08.416 --> 00:18:10.026
with Taco Bar as a third-party

00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:11.526
developer when building an App

00:18:11.696 --> 00:18:12.416
Store app for them?

00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:13.836
What's the best way for them to

00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:14.526
work together?

00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:18.226
Taco Bar is hiring Liquid Oxygen

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:19.666
to build an app and submit it to

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.286
the store under their developer

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:21.616
account.

00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:24.186
The developer has to join Taco

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.616
Bar's developer program and

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:27.246
provide a build of the app for

00:18:27.246 --> 00:18:29.076
Taco Bar to submit to the store.

00:18:29.796 --> 00:18:30.866
This is what that workflow

00:18:30.866 --> 00:18:31.506
should look like.

00:18:32.896 --> 00:18:34.406
The two developer roles that

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.956
Taco Bar should assign to Liquid

00:18:35.956 --> 00:18:38.866
Oxygen are Developer and

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:39.426
Marketing.

00:18:40.146 --> 00:18:41.616
This would allow them to upload

00:18:41.616 --> 00:18:43.186
bills and provide marketing

00:18:43.186 --> 00:18:44.336
metadata like the app's

00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:45.886
description and screen shots.

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:48.586
The admin role should remain

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:49.736
internal to Taco Bar.

00:18:51.136 --> 00:18:53.156
This enables Taco Bar to control

00:18:53.156 --> 00:18:54.606
TestFlight distribution,

00:18:54.876 --> 00:18:57.556
pricing, submission, and go live

00:18:57.556 --> 00:18:58.266
on the App Store.

00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:00.916
The app manager role should also

00:19:00.916 --> 00:19:01.646
remain internal.

00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:04.946
Here's what it looks like to add

00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:06.456
and manage users in App Store

00:19:06.456 --> 00:19:06.776
Connect.

00:19:07.826 --> 00:19:09.366
Users with the admin and app

00:19:09.546 --> 00:19:11.476
manager roles can create and

00:19:11.476 --> 00:19:13.546
edit users and also restrict a

00:19:13.546 --> 00:19:15.936
user's access to specific apps

00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:16.556
in the account.

00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:19.256
Make sure to limit third-party

00:19:19.256 --> 00:19:21.346
developer access to only those

00:19:21.346 --> 00:19:22.546
apps that they're working on.

00:19:23.536 --> 00:19:25.816
But note, user access cannot be

00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:27.586
restricted to specific apps on

00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:28.546
the developer site.

00:19:29.616 --> 00:19:31.606
Users will have access to all of

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:33.396
the bundle IDs on the developer

00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:33.656
site.

00:19:34.676 --> 00:19:36.436
You can see here that Tracy is

00:19:36.436 --> 00:19:38.286
the developer, and she has

00:19:38.286 --> 00:19:40.456
access to the Taco Bar app only.

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:43.376
And if LunchControl and Liquid

00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:45.996
Oxygen, LLC, were no longer to

00:19:45.996 --> 00:19:47.396
have a relationship with Taco

00:19:47.396 --> 00:19:48.766
Bar, the customer could always

00:19:48.766 --> 00:19:50.036
remove them as a third-party

00:19:50.036 --> 00:19:51.156
developer later on.

00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:55.076
If you're developing an app for

00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:57.606
a business, that business is the

00:19:57.606 --> 00:19:59.246
only one allowed to submit to

00:19:59.246 --> 00:19:59.816
the App Store.

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:02.066
That means that apps must be

00:20:02.066 --> 00:20:03.586
submitted under client accounts,

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:06.156
and customers of Taco Bar are

00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:07.526
going to expect to be

00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:09.166
downloading an app from Taco

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.976
Bar, Ltd., not from Liquid

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.246
Oxygen, LLC.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.126
For more information on this,

00:20:14.126 --> 00:20:15.356
you can review to App Store

00:20:15.356 --> 00:20:17.956
review guidelines section 5.2.

00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:20.796
Powerful roles like admin and

00:20:20.796 --> 00:20:22.206
app manager should be limited

00:20:22.206 --> 00:20:24.396
for third-party developers, and

00:20:24.396 --> 00:20:25.856
customers should also limit app

00:20:25.896 --> 00:20:28.266
access to only the apps that

00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:29.986
they'll be working on, and you

00:20:29.986 --> 00:20:31.176
should also follow the best

00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:32.456
practices for app versioning

00:20:32.456 --> 00:20:33.236
that we discussed.

00:20:33.786 --> 00:20:36.346
That concludes our discussion

00:20:36.576 --> 00:20:37.756
about the different scenarios

00:20:37.756 --> 00:20:38.616
where you would distribute a

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:40.926
public-facing app through the

00:20:41.456 --> 00:20:42.446
App Store.

00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:43.506
For the remainder of the

00:20:43.506 --> 00:20:45.106
session, we're going to talk

00:20:45.106 --> 00:20:46.626
about two ways to distribute

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:48.426
apps that are customized for a

00:20:48.426 --> 00:20:50.416
business, intended to be used

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:52.636
privately and internally by that

00:20:52.636 --> 00:20:53.076
business.

00:20:53.746 --> 00:20:55.056
The first one we'll talk about

00:20:55.126 --> 00:20:56.576
is in-house distribution.

00:20:57.646 --> 00:20:58.926
Let's check back in on

00:20:58.926 --> 00:20:59.536
LunchControl.

00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:02.636
Exciting things are happening,

00:21:02.706 --> 00:21:04.666
and Acme Company has approached

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:06.656
you to build them a custom

00:21:06.656 --> 00:21:08.096
version of LunchControl for

00:21:08.096 --> 00:21:09.416
their corporate cafeteria and

00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:11.246
catering services so that their

00:21:11.246 --> 00:21:12.606
employees can order food and

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:13.886
have the same great experience

00:21:13.886 --> 00:21:14.736
that you offer in your app.

00:21:15.646 --> 00:21:17.046
This would mean incorporating

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:18.236
their back-end system into the

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.216
app and building a totally

00:21:20.216 --> 00:21:21.376
customized version for them.

00:21:22.546 --> 00:21:24.776
In this case, Acme Company is

00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:25.816
going to be the customer

00:21:26.216 --> 00:21:27.846
purchasing a custom app for a

00:21:27.846 --> 00:21:29.576
group of users who happen to be

00:21:29.576 --> 00:21:30.366
their employees.

00:21:31.076 --> 00:21:32.856
We'll call it Acme Co. Café.

00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:35.346
Knowing that the audience for

00:21:35.346 --> 00:21:37.246
this app isn't public, it's the

00:21:37.246 --> 00:21:38.866
employees of a company, it's

00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:40.766
apparent that a public app store

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.026
isn't appropriate for this use

00:21:42.026 --> 00:21:42.376
case.

00:21:43.326 --> 00:21:44.626
When we think about apps for

00:21:44.626 --> 00:21:46.096
internal use, there are two

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.426
distribution methods that come

00:21:47.426 --> 00:21:50.076
to mind, in-house and custom

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:51.126
apps.

00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:54.166
In a previous world, Acme

00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:55.726
Company would probably have an

00:21:55.726 --> 00:21:57.086
Apple Developer Enterprise

00:21:57.206 --> 00:21:58.686
Program account and would

00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:00.346
utilize in-house distribution to

00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:00.956
deploy this app.

00:22:02.206 --> 00:22:04.306
For a very long time, this was

00:22:04.306 --> 00:22:05.526
the only way to do it.

00:22:06.456 --> 00:22:08.326
But recently, we've enabled the

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:09.986
ability for these types of apps

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:11.926
to be hosted on the App Store's

00:22:11.926 --> 00:22:13.706
infrastructure via custom apps,

00:22:13.706 --> 00:22:15.586
and there are a host of benefits

00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:16.176
to doing so.

00:22:17.376 --> 00:22:18.476
While the Apple Developer

00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:20.796
Enterprise Program still exists,

00:22:21.296 --> 00:22:22.476
it's no longer the standard

00:22:22.476 --> 00:22:23.856
mechanism for distributing

00:22:23.856 --> 00:22:25.026
private internal apps.

00:22:25.896 --> 00:22:27.176
There are some exceptions where

00:22:27.176 --> 00:22:28.906
it still may be appropriate, but

00:22:28.906 --> 00:22:30.256
for the vast majority of those

00:22:30.256 --> 00:22:31.826
building private internal apps,

00:22:32.276 --> 00:22:33.776
custom apps is going to be the

00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:34.416
way forward.

00:22:35.016 --> 00:22:38.516
In-house distribution, we'll

00:22:38.516 --> 00:22:40.156
just cover it so that you know

00:22:40.156 --> 00:22:41.346
how it works if you do run into

00:22:41.346 --> 00:22:41.516
it.

00:22:41.876 --> 00:22:43.166
So, in-house distribution

00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:44.836
enables you to control the

00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:47.056
entire distribution process and

00:22:47.056 --> 00:22:48.026
host the app yourself.

00:22:48.646 --> 00:22:50.226
It requires membership into the

00:22:50.226 --> 00:22:51.376
Apple Developer Enterprise

00:22:51.456 --> 00:22:53.236
Program, but there are strict

00:22:53.236 --> 00:22:54.696
eligibility requirements to get

00:22:54.696 --> 00:22:56.826
into that program, and it really

00:22:56.826 --> 00:22:58.276
is meant for those cases that

00:22:58.276 --> 00:22:59.616
really can't be solved by custom

00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:00.576
app distribution.

00:23:01.306 --> 00:23:02.696
Regions where Apple business

00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:04.836
manager doesn't work, use cases

00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:05.616
for state and federal

00:23:05.616 --> 00:23:07.406
government, or use cases where

00:23:07.406 --> 00:23:08.736
there are other intellectual

00:23:08.806 --> 00:23:10.586
property issues could still

00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:11.486
qualify for in-house

00:23:11.486 --> 00:23:12.226
distribution.

00:23:13.216 --> 00:23:15.386
Organizations utilizing in-house

00:23:15.426 --> 00:23:17.336
distribution should own and

00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:18.746
maintain the source code so that

00:23:18.746 --> 00:23:20.016
they can do their own build to

00:23:20.016 --> 00:23:20.976
maintain the project.

00:23:21.656 --> 00:23:22.846
Distribution is handled

00:23:22.846 --> 00:23:24.316
completely outside of the App

00:23:24.316 --> 00:23:27.376
Store by the organization and is

00:23:27.376 --> 00:23:28.916
usually done by MDM.

00:23:29.816 --> 00:23:32.936
If you do find yourself in a

00:23:32.936 --> 00:23:34.116
situation where you're leverage

00:23:34.116 --> 00:23:35.766
in-house distribution, there are

00:23:35.766 --> 00:23:36.806
a few things that you should be

00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:37.306
aware of.

00:23:38.206 --> 00:23:40.166
First and foremost, the apps

00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:42.246
that you deploy using in-house

00:23:42.276 --> 00:23:44.706
distribution must only go to

00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:46.576
your employees and cannot be

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:47.736
made available to others.

00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:50.226
Apps are signed by the

00:23:50.226 --> 00:23:52.036
organization with a distribution

00:23:52.036 --> 00:23:53.416
certificate, and that

00:23:53.596 --> 00:23:54.706
certificate needs to be

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:55.086
protected.

00:23:55.146 --> 00:23:57.906
If it were to be compromised or

00:23:57.906 --> 00:23:59.806
revoked for any reason, all of

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.156
the apps that you deployed with

00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:02.436
that certificate would stop

00:24:02.436 --> 00:24:04.546
working immediately, and they

00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:06.306
would need to be re-signed and

00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:07.016
redeployed.

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:09.586
As you might imagine, that could

00:24:09.586 --> 00:24:13.066
be catastrophic for a business.

00:24:13.186 --> 00:24:14.666
Additionally, certificates will

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.036
expire every three years, and

00:24:16.476 --> 00:24:19.006
the provisioning profiles expire

00:24:19.006 --> 00:24:19.506
annually.

00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:20.756
So you need to manage that

00:24:20.756 --> 00:24:22.506
certificate lifecycle and plan

00:24:22.506 --> 00:24:23.826
for frequent releases of your

00:24:23.826 --> 00:24:25.396
app that are aligned with it.

00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:28.236
Beta testing and hosting of the

00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:29.656
apps needs to be handled by the

00:24:29.656 --> 00:24:31.596
organization and MDM, and

00:24:32.086 --> 00:24:33.576
there's no TestFlight access for

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:34.306
enterprise accounts.

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:36.956
Apps are also going to need

00:24:36.986 --> 00:24:38.376
periodic access to the internet,

00:24:38.976 --> 00:24:40.846
which makes it very difficult to

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:42.706
deploy apps in air gap networks.

00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:46.696
Based on what we just talked

00:24:46.696 --> 00:24:48.506
about, in-house distribution

00:24:48.506 --> 00:24:49.966
isn't going to be a good fit for

00:24:50.126 --> 00:24:50.316
Acme.

00:24:51.506 --> 00:24:53.466
Let's move onto Custom Apps.

00:24:53.606 --> 00:24:54.826
This is the new way forward.

00:24:55.346 --> 00:24:58.006
This scenario could work one of

00:24:58.076 --> 00:24:58.496
two ways.

00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:01.316
The developer could simply offer

00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:02.536
the app for sale to them via

00:25:02.756 --> 00:25:04.616
Custom Apps under their own

00:25:04.616 --> 00:25:06.086
account, which would protect

00:25:06.086 --> 00:25:07.326
their intellectual property.

00:25:07.886 --> 00:25:09.176
This could be described as

00:25:09.226 --> 00:25:10.286
business to business, and this

00:25:10.286 --> 00:25:11.336
is actually the way that Custom

00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:12.136
Apps used to work.

00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.546
Alternatively, the developer

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:15.726
could negotiate with Acme

00:25:15.726 --> 00:25:16.876
Company and provide them source

00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:18.436
code, and they would handle the

00:25:18.436 --> 00:25:19.516
submission of the Custom App

00:25:19.646 --> 00:25:21.606
themselves under their own Acme

00:25:21.606 --> 00:25:23.386
account, which we could describe

00:25:23.386 --> 00:25:24.406
as business to self.

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:26.996
Either way, Custom Apps is the

00:25:26.996 --> 00:25:27.756
right solution.

00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:31.386
How does Custom App distribution

00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:31.646
work?

00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:34.326
Custom Apps are part of the

00:25:34.326 --> 00:25:36.046
Apple Developer Program and are

00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:38.196
hosted by Apple in Apple

00:25:38.196 --> 00:25:39.026
Business Manager.

00:25:40.146 --> 00:25:41.896
Custom Apps used to be available

00:25:41.896 --> 00:25:43.276
only to developers selling an

00:25:43.276 --> 00:25:45.266
app to another organization, but

00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:46.606
you can now use it to distribute

00:25:46.606 --> 00:25:48.146
internally to your own employees

00:25:48.586 --> 00:25:49.876
just like you would leverage

00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:51.126
in-house distribution.

00:25:51.956 --> 00:25:53.286
This make it much easier to

00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:54.076
distribute apps to your

00:25:54.076 --> 00:25:56.976
employees, and Custom Apps works

00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:58.586
for distributing to employees,

00:25:58.856 --> 00:26:01.456
partners, clients, franchisees,

00:26:01.456 --> 00:26:02.246
or affiliates.

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:05.016
Customers can also distribute

00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:07.186
licenses via MDM or leverage

00:26:07.186 --> 00:26:08.696
redemption codes.

00:26:09.566 --> 00:26:11.066
For those of you who are used to

00:26:11.066 --> 00:26:12.306
the Apple Developer Enterprise

00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:14.126
Program, Custom Apps offers a

00:26:14.126 --> 00:26:14.786
lot of benefits.

00:26:15.546 --> 00:26:17.136
You'll only need one program to

00:26:17.136 --> 00:26:18.556
manage both your App Store and

00:26:18.556 --> 00:26:20.086
your internal apps.

00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:22.046
The apps won't expire, so you

00:26:22.046 --> 00:26:22.866
don't need to worry about

00:26:22.866 --> 00:26:24.726
distribution certs being revoked

00:26:24.726 --> 00:26:25.386
or expiring.

00:26:26.776 --> 00:26:28.596
While with in-house distribution

00:26:28.596 --> 00:26:29.666
you could only distribute to

00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:31.636
employees, Custom Apps actually

00:26:31.636 --> 00:26:32.706
allows you to reach a broader

00:26:32.706 --> 00:26:34.046
audience, including business

00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:34.676
affiliates.

00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:37.456
It's also easier to work with

00:26:37.456 --> 00:26:38.736
third-party developers because

00:26:38.736 --> 00:26:40.516
you can get and distribute an

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:42.276
app from them without having

00:26:42.276 --> 00:26:43.576
access to the source code, and

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:44.936
there's no re-signing of

00:26:44.986 --> 00:26:45.896
binaries involved.

00:26:47.066 --> 00:26:48.366
You can also take advantage of

00:26:48.366 --> 00:26:50.036
the App Store's auto update

00:26:50.036 --> 00:26:51.726
infrastructure, features like

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.806
caching and app thinning as well

00:26:53.806 --> 00:26:55.586
as the TestFlight and App Store

00:26:56.136 --> 00:26:57.876
Connect tools.

00:26:58.046 --> 00:26:59.316
Here's how you would actually go

00:26:59.316 --> 00:27:00.536
about submitting a Custom App.

00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:03.246
First, you would confirm that

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:04.636
your account is properly set up

00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:05.776
to support Custom Apps.

00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:07.846
Both app agreements need to be

00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:09.566
active, and you need to provide

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:11.196
banking and tax information.

00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:13.686
You can leverage roles to define

00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:15.226
proper access for the project

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:17.036
team once you have the app set

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:17.906
up.

00:27:19.076 --> 00:27:20.786
A developer would create a new

00:27:20.786 --> 00:27:22.316
app identifier in the member

00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:23.716
center of the developer website

00:27:23.716 --> 00:27:25.926
and also a new app record in App

00:27:26.056 --> 00:27:26.506
Store Connect.

00:27:27.786 --> 00:27:29.416
Anytime that you want to list a

00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:31.216
custom app for sale, you need to

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:33.376
create a new app ID and a new

00:27:33.376 --> 00:27:34.016
app record.

00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:36.246
The same bundle identifier

00:27:36.246 --> 00:27:38.176
cannot be available in both the

00:27:38.236 --> 00:27:40.596
public App Store and privately

00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:41.296
as a custom app.

00:27:41.906 --> 00:27:43.226
They're totally separate apps

00:27:43.546 --> 00:27:45.436
with separate bundle InDesign.

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:48.386
Next, you would upload a build

00:27:48.696 --> 00:27:49.896
and attach it to the working

00:27:49.896 --> 00:27:53.946
version in App Store Connect.

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.156
Beta testing would be done with

00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:55.676
TestFlight.

00:27:56.766 --> 00:27:58.286
When Beta Testing is complete,

00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:00.506
all of the app metadata and

00:28:00.506 --> 00:28:01.836
finalized marketing material

00:28:01.836 --> 00:28:03.656
should be verified and added.

00:28:03.656 --> 00:28:08.286
You would then list the app for

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.156
sale as a custom app in the

00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:11.616
pricing and availability

00:28:11.616 --> 00:28:12.086
section.

00:28:13.396 --> 00:28:15.096
Note, once an app is submitted

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:17.036
for review as either a custom

00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:19.026
app or a public app, you can't

00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:20.596
go back and change the audience

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:22.666
from public to private for vice

00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:23.596
versa later on.

00:28:24.276 --> 00:28:25.896
To list the app for sale as a

00:28:25.896 --> 00:28:27.076
custom app for business, you

00:28:27.656 --> 00:28:29.556
need to provide the customer's

00:28:29.556 --> 00:28:31.786
DEP ID and organization name.

00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:35.636
The DEP ID is a unique

00:28:35.636 --> 00:28:36.996
identifier given to the

00:28:36.996 --> 00:28:38.706
organization when they enroll in

00:28:38.706 --> 00:28:39.836
Apple Business Manager.

00:28:42.076 --> 00:28:44.206
Finally, you would submit the

00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:45.016
app for review.

00:28:46.426 --> 00:28:47.536
Once it's approved and

00:28:47.536 --> 00:28:49.636
available, you customer can

00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:53.646
purchase and distribute the app.

00:28:53.886 --> 00:28:55.416
Purchasing is done through Apple

00:28:55.416 --> 00:28:56.246
Business Manager.

00:28:56.846 --> 00:28:58.336
The customer would enroll at

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:00.436
business.apple.com, and with

00:29:00.436 --> 00:29:02.156
this program, they can buy App

00:29:02.156 --> 00:29:03.836
Store apps, custom apps and

00:29:03.836 --> 00:29:05.626
books in bulk, and deploy to

00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:06.746
their devices and users.

00:29:07.486 --> 00:29:08.836
They can also do app license

00:29:08.836 --> 00:29:09.406
management.

00:29:10.196 --> 00:29:11.566
Note that this needs to be set

00:29:11.566 --> 00:29:13.006
up in advance of you listing the

00:29:13.006 --> 00:29:14.246
app for sale as a custom app

00:29:14.776 --> 00:29:16.236
because you need that DEP ID and

00:29:16.236 --> 00:29:18.556
organization name to distribute

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:20.226
the app to them.

00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:21.536
And Custom Apps will also be

00:29:21.536 --> 00:29:22.836
available for Apple School

00:29:22.836 --> 00:29:23.936
Manager this fall.

00:29:24.746 --> 00:29:27.646
This is what Apple Business

00:29:27.646 --> 00:29:28.516
Manager looks like.

00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:30.766
Your customer will see the app

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:32.046
that you are listing for sale

00:29:32.046 --> 00:29:35.056
for them under the Custom Apps

00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:36.026
section.

00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:37.556
Let's review what this process

00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:39.326
looks like end-to-end for both

00:29:39.326 --> 00:29:40.626
the customer and the developer.

00:29:41.556 --> 00:29:43.276
The customer first provides you

00:29:43.596 --> 00:29:45.096
with their organization name and

00:29:45.096 --> 00:29:46.306
DEP ID from Apple Business

00:29:46.306 --> 00:29:46.806
Manager.

00:29:47.636 --> 00:29:49.806
Once you have that, when you set

00:29:49.806 --> 00:29:51.026
up the App in App Store Connect,

00:29:51.616 --> 00:29:52.966
in the pricing and availability

00:29:52.966 --> 00:29:54.756
section, you select to make it

00:29:54.756 --> 00:29:56.876
available privately as a Custom

00:29:56.876 --> 00:29:59.196
App for business and specify

00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:00.846
that DEP ID and organization

00:30:00.846 --> 00:30:00.976
name.

00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:03.846
Once the app is submitted and

00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:05.586
approved, the customer can then

00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:07.276
go and purchase licenses of it

00:30:07.536 --> 00:30:08.706
from Apple Business Manager.

00:30:09.306 --> 00:30:12.586
If for some reason you aren't

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:14.796
able to submit a custom app or

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.486
your customer isn't able to see

00:30:16.486 --> 00:30:17.936
an app that you've assigned to

00:30:17.936 --> 00:30:19.726
them, here are a few places that

00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:20.726
you can troubleshoot.

00:30:21.576 --> 00:30:23.136
First, on the developer side,

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:25.246
make sure both the free and paid

00:30:25.246 --> 00:30:27.376
agreements are complete as well

00:30:27.376 --> 00:30:28.236
as all of your banking

00:30:28.236 --> 00:30:28.966
information.

00:30:29.856 --> 00:30:31.406
If the customer isn't able to

00:30:31.406 --> 00:30:33.056
see the app, make sure that

00:30:33.056 --> 00:30:34.236
Custom Apps are enabled for

00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:36.146
their account under settings and

00:30:36.146 --> 00:30:37.656
enrollment info in Apple

00:30:37.656 --> 00:30:38.556
Business Manager.

00:30:39.486 --> 00:30:40.986
It also may take a few minutes

00:30:40.986 --> 00:30:43.016
for the app to become visible in

00:30:43.056 --> 00:30:44.696
Apple Business Manager, so just

00:30:44.696 --> 00:30:45.746
give it a little bit of time,

00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:48.286
and you can also consult the App

00:30:48.336 --> 00:30:49.686
Store Connect help page for more

00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:50.336
information.

00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:54.806
Here are a few things to keep in

00:30:54.806 --> 00:30:56.926
mind about Custom Apps.

00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:58.356
Customers need to have an Apple

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.466
Business Manager account to

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:00.006
purchase your app.

00:31:01.296 --> 00:31:02.806
Apps have to support the

00:31:02.906 --> 00:31:03.906
countries that they will be

00:31:03.906 --> 00:31:04.756
distributed in.

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:07.996
By default, an app is set up to

00:31:07.996 --> 00:31:09.616
support all territories in App

00:31:09.616 --> 00:31:11.556
Store Connect, and you shouldn't

00:31:11.556 --> 00:31:12.616
change this unless you really

00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:13.086
need to.

00:31:13.966 --> 00:31:15.326
It's expected that if you're

00:31:15.326 --> 00:31:16.796
utilizing redemption codes for

00:31:16.796 --> 00:31:18.776
distribution that they won't be

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:20.216
made publicly available, and

00:31:20.216 --> 00:31:21.706
you'll instead make sure they

00:31:21.706 --> 00:31:23.076
make it into the hands of your

00:31:23.076 --> 00:31:24.056
specific users.

00:31:24.686 --> 00:31:27.466
This is a new app that needs to

00:31:27.466 --> 00:31:29.626
go through app review, and the

00:31:29.626 --> 00:31:30.716
review team is going to need to

00:31:30.716 --> 00:31:31.766
be able to access the full

00:31:31.766 --> 00:31:33.886
functionality of the app.

00:31:33.886 --> 00:31:36.206
And once submitted, apps can't

00:31:36.206 --> 00:31:37.876
be moved between public and

00:31:37.876 --> 00:31:38.976
private availability.

00:31:42.096 --> 00:31:43.746
That concludes Custom Apps.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:45.916
We've covered the four

00:31:46.136 --> 00:31:47.366
distribution methods that you

00:31:47.366 --> 00:31:48.856
have to choose from, and the

00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:51.156
easiest way to decide which is

00:31:51.156 --> 00:31:52.626
right for you is to think about

00:31:52.626 --> 00:31:54.816
the audience for your app is

00:31:54.886 --> 00:31:56.186
public or private.

00:31:56.186 --> 00:31:58.706
Ad Hoc lets you distribute to a

00:31:58.706 --> 00:32:00.966
limited private audience for

00:32:00.966 --> 00:32:01.486
testing.

00:32:02.096 --> 00:32:03.066
The App Store lets you

00:32:03.066 --> 00:32:04.226
distribute apps to the general

00:32:04.286 --> 00:32:06.796
public, and In-House and Custom

00:32:06.796 --> 00:32:08.346
App distribution let you

00:32:08.346 --> 00:32:09.766
distribute apps privately.

00:32:10.446 --> 00:32:14.006
Let's review the distribution

00:32:14.006 --> 00:32:15.166
scenarios that we talked about

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:15.576
today.

00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:19.196
What if the app is for the

00:32:19.196 --> 00:32:19.836
general public?

00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:21.946
If the app is for the general

00:32:22.016 --> 00:32:24.846
public, it belongs on the App

00:32:26.636 --> 00:32:26.756
Store.

00:32:26.966 --> 00:32:27.986
What if you don't want to give

00:32:27.986 --> 00:32:29.296
up your intellectual property to

00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:29.926
an enterprise.

00:32:29.926 --> 00:32:31.646
If you don't want to give up

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:33.246
intellectual property, you can

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:34.676
leverage Custom Apps to deliver

00:32:34.676 --> 00:32:37.266
them a private, completed app.

00:32:37.266 --> 00:32:39.036
And if you're writing an app for

00:32:39.036 --> 00:32:40.326
the company where the audience

00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.826
is the general public, you can

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.266
also deliver them a binary to

00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:45.036
upload to their App Store

00:32:45.036 --> 00:32:46.426
Connect account.

00:32:47.756 --> 00:32:49.536
What if your customer doesn't

00:32:49.656 --> 00:32:50.806
have an MDM solution?

00:32:52.026 --> 00:32:53.426
The Custom Apps program along

00:32:53.426 --> 00:32:55.346
with MDM can be used to deliver

00:32:55.346 --> 00:32:57.506
apps to customers who don't have

00:32:57.586 --> 00:32:58.066
MDM.

00:33:01.996 --> 00:33:03.356
What if you're being paid as a

00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:04.806
consultant to build an app for a

00:33:04.806 --> 00:33:05.236
company?

00:33:05.876 --> 00:33:07.586
So you can work in both the App

00:33:07.796 --> 00:33:08.826
Store and the Custom Apps

00:33:08.826 --> 00:33:11.476
program to, as a third-party

00:33:11.476 --> 00:33:12.656
developer, to deliver an app to

00:33:12.656 --> 00:33:13.216
someone else.

00:33:14.156 --> 00:33:15.486
What if Apple Business Manager

00:33:15.486 --> 00:33:17.106
isn't available for my customer?

00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:18.886
So, if Apple Business Manager

00:33:18.886 --> 00:33:20.506
isn't available, your customer

00:33:20.506 --> 00:33:21.786
should be able to leverage

00:33:22.026 --> 00:33:23.516
in-house distribution providing

00:33:23.516 --> 00:33:24.946
that they're building an app for

00:33:24.946 --> 00:33:25.676
their employees.

00:33:26.296 --> 00:33:28.396
And what if the app is employee

00:33:28.396 --> 00:33:28.876
facing?

00:33:30.266 --> 00:33:31.756
Employee facing or private apps

00:33:31.816 --> 00:33:33.176
can be distributed with both

00:33:33.176 --> 00:33:35.706
Custom Apps or In-House, and

00:33:36.396 --> 00:33:38.156
what if you want to distribute

00:33:38.156 --> 00:33:39.726
an app to your own organization?

00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:42.346
You can distribute to your own

00:33:42.346 --> 00:33:43.686
organization using Custom Apps

00:33:44.316 --> 00:33:45.626
or the In-House program.

00:33:46.376 --> 00:33:48.046
To conclude this presentation, I

00:33:48.046 --> 00:33:49.366
want to leave you with a quote

00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:49.936
from a colleague.

00:33:51.376 --> 00:33:52.846
"Apps are like cannonballs.

00:33:53.586 --> 00:33:54.486
It's better to know where

00:33:54.486 --> 00:33:55.806
they're going before they

00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:56.206
deploy."

00:33:57.736 --> 00:33:59.436
Apple wants you to be successful

00:33:59.436 --> 00:34:00.536
and scale your app in the

00:34:00.536 --> 00:34:02.296
smartest possible way, which

00:34:02.296 --> 00:34:04.336
means thinking carefully about

00:34:04.336 --> 00:34:05.636
the user and the customer,

00:34:06.146 --> 00:34:07.216
managing your versions

00:34:07.216 --> 00:34:09.206
appropriately, and knowing and

00:34:09.206 --> 00:34:11.396
understanding the guidelines or

00:34:11.396 --> 00:34:12.525
our developer programs.

00:34:13.356 --> 00:34:14.676
If you understand how this works

00:34:14.676 --> 00:34:16.505
up front, you can pick the right

00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:18.036
distribution mechanism for your

00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:19.916
app and deploy it to your users

00:34:20.255 --> 00:34:21.315
without any friction.

00:34:22.966 --> 00:34:24.906
