00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:08.806
>> Hello. I'm Jonathan Davis,

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:10.536
web technologies evangelist for

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:12.006
the Safari and WebKit teams.

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.236
Welcome to Auditing Web Content

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:15.236
with Web Inspector.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.246
In the process of building web

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:18.946
content, developers have a lot

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:19.956
of details to check.

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.676
Maybe it's following a CSS class

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:24.446
name convention or ensuring good

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:25.796
accessibility on the page.

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:27.886
There can be so many details

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:29.126
that they're easy to forget and

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.556
tedious to find the issues.

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:32.656
A built-in checklist would be

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:33.066
ideal.

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:35.196
Some teams set up automated

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:36.546
testing in a continuous

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:37.916
integration system using

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:39.736
technologies like Safari's

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:41.886
WebDriver, available for macOS

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:43.066
and now iOS.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.066
WebDriver is a great tool for

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.596
catching code changes that break

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:47.966
expected functionality for

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.516
users.

00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:50.736
But for web developers who want

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:51.956
to check that their in-progress

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:53.586
work meets code expectations,

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.946
Web Inspector now includes a new

00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:57.676
audit system available with

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:00.136
Safari 13 on macOS that provides

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:01.736
a quick, easy and more

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:03.076
convenient way to check web

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:03.506
content.

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:07.106
In this video, I'll show you how

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.626
to use audits in Web Inspector,

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:10.666
how to work with tests and

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.606
understand their results, and

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.266
finally I'll cover how to create

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.196
custom audits for your projects.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:18.746
To get started, you'll need to

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:19.966
enable the Develop menu to

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.046
access Web Inspector.

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:24.126
Just load up Safari Preferences,

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.066
click on Advanced and click to

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.066
enable the Show Develop Menu in

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.976
Menu Bar option.

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:34.216
Now just load up a web page and

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:35.306
open Web Inspector from the

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:35.986
Develop menu.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.196
Or use the keyboard shortcut

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:39.096
Command-Option-I.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.706
Let's take a look at WebKit.org

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:43.516
as an example.

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:45.416
Click over to the audit tab.

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.696
And in the left sidebar is a

00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:50.736
list of audits.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:52.966
Click the arrow to the left of

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.286
an audit to expand it.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.896
An audit is a collection of test

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:58.126
groups and tests.

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:00.216
Test groups don't have any

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:01.676
functionality except to act as

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:03.156
organizational containers for a

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.976
collection of individual tests.

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.426
It's easy to run audits.

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:08.876
Click the Start button to run

00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:10.265
all of the available audits.

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:12.426
Or you can right click on an

00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:14.046
audit for a contextual menu with

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:14.876
more actions.

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:17.406
To run a single audit, right

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:18.736
click on the audit and select

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:19.126
Start.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.166
Or you can hover over the right

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.856
area of the side bar and a play

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:23.586
button will appear.

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:25.956
Or click to select it and press

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:26.576
the space bar.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.706
Audits are fast and update in

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:29.766
real time as tests are

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:30.316
completed.

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.436
Another way to control which

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.546
audits are run is to click the

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:37.306
Edit button at the bottom of the

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:38.436
navigation sidebar.

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:42.326
Here you can toggle the

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:44.066
checkboxes on the row next to

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:48.196
individual tests, test groups or

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:49.876
entire audits to selectively

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:54.116
enable or disable them.

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:55.216
Click the done button at the

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.146
bottom when you're finished

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:56.486
editing.

00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:00.726
A list of any collected results

00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:02.436
will appear below the audits in

00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:04.316
a results folder with each of

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:05.976
the results collected into Run

00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:06.596
folders.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.346
Expand the Run folder to access

00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:11.596
the results of the audit for

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:12.056
that run.

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:14.446
The result runs are kept

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:15.896
available across reloads of the

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.686
page so you can modify the

00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:19.786
webpage and rerun the audit for

00:03:19.786 --> 00:03:20.766
updated results.

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:22.576
That way you can compare the

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:23.746
pass rate for example.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.686
Results will be cleared when Web

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:26.806
Inspector is closed.

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:31.256
Clicking on the results of the

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:33.616
demo audit run displays a report

00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:35.386
that shows example result levels

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:36.246
and result data.

00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:39.816
The first three result levels

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:40.936
should be familiar if you've

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:41.966
ever used XCode.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:43.836
The passed level shows a test

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.466
that's passed, meaning the code

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.546
met the expectations of the

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:47.096
test.

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:48.886
Warning is a soft pass.

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:50.486
It says even though the code

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:51.496
passed the test, there are

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:52.536
things that could be changed.

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:54.556
Failed tells you the code did

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:55.856
not pass the test.

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.246
The other two result levels are

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:00.656
special to audits in Web

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:01.196
Inspector.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.456
An error result occurs when the

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:04.686
JavaScript being run for the

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:05.776
test throws an error.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.286
Unsupported is a special case

00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:09.496
that can be used to indicate

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:11.026
when the data being tested isn't

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:12.356
supported by the current page,

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:13.576
such as when there's some

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:14.206
missing API.

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:17.386
Test results can also include

00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:18.976
data from the test in the form

00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:20.815
of DOM nodes or error messages.

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:24.896
Web Inspector includes some

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:26.466
built-in audits by default which

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.186
can be disabled but not deleted.

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:30.366
One of the default audits

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:31.896
provides tests that check a

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.406
webpage for mark-up that meets

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.086
some common guidelines for good

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:35.946
accessibility.

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:38.956
Let's dig into the results of

00:04:38.956 --> 00:04:40.366
running the accessibility audit

00:04:40.556 --> 00:04:41.546
on WebKit.org.

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:44.606
The overall score shows that

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:45.886
WebKit does fairly well.

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:47.296
But there's room for

00:04:47.296 --> 00:04:47.946
improvement.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.006
In the failure cases shown in

00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:52.676
the results, the DOM node where

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:54.386
the failure was detected is

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:55.976
shown as an interactive DOM

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:56.276
tree.

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:58.486
Expanding the DOM tree for the

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:00.306
node allows you to access child

00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:00.796
nodes.

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:02.476
And hovering over them will

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:03.986
highlight the specific elements

00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:05.666
on the page, just like using the

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:06.446
elements tab.

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:12.946
This makes it trivially easy to

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:14.536
understand what code in your web

00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:15.986
content needs improvement.

00:05:17.296 --> 00:05:19.486
To fix this, I can simply click

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.876
this arrow to go right to the

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:22.166
node in the elements tab.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:24.566
The problem is elements with the

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:26.246
role of menu need their child

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:27.996
elements to have a role of menu

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:28.426
item.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.466
So I simply need to add a new

00:05:31.466 --> 00:05:33.326
role attribute with a value of

00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:35.296
menu item to each of the child

00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:36.496
elements of the menu.

00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:38.876
I'm going to quickly add the

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:40.196
missing attribute to each of

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:40.976
these elements.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:45.586
Just a couple more.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:51.026
Okay.

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:52.986
Now I'll switch back to the

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:54.666
audit tab so I can rerun the

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.456
audit and see the new results

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.686
with these changes in the DOM.

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:02.006
Perfect.

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:03.606
The page now passes all of the

00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:04.126
tests.

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:06.046
I simply need to incorporate

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:07.626
those changes into the actual

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:08.616
code for the site.

00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:12.906
You can see how easy it is to

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:14.606
spot problems and fix them all

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:15.826
conveniently within Web

00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:16.336
Inspector.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.196
Audits and audit results can be

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:20.976
exported and re-imported.

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.136
Click the Export button to save

00:06:23.136 --> 00:06:25.006
the results into a JSON file.

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:27.576
They can be re-imported into Web

00:06:27.576 --> 00:06:29.326
Inspector with complete access

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:30.476
to the results, including

00:06:30.476 --> 00:06:32.106
interactive DOM nodes, when

00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:33.876
elements on the page match the

00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:35.036
nodes in the report.

00:06:36.816 --> 00:06:38.366
You can also export the built-in

00:06:38.366 --> 00:06:40.006
audits to see an example of how

00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:41.316
to write your own audits.

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.996
As most teams will have their

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.586
own unique code objectives,

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:46.396
writing your own custom audits

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:47.676
is one of the most powerful

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.236
aspects of using the audit

00:06:49.236 --> 00:06:50.636
framework in Web Inspector.

00:06:51.956 --> 00:06:53.906
They use a JSON format to make

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:54.536
them portable.

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:56.376
Each test is simply a

00:06:56.376 --> 00:06:58.006
stringified JavaScript function

00:06:58.486 --> 00:06:59.876
giving you a simple framework

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.496
with special access to more data

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:02.786
than you can normally access in

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:03.376
JavaScript.

00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:06.206
Being simple JSON, it's easy to

00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:07.856
share your tests with your team

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:08.996
or other developers.

00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:12.046
There's an example ESLint audit

00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:13.516
available on the WebKit blog

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.736
post about creating Web

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:15.616
Inspector audits.

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.046
The blog post goes into detail

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:19.156
about how to write a custom

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.896
audit as well as other powerful

00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:22.526
capabilities of using the audit

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:23.036
framework.

00:07:23.656 --> 00:07:25.886
Simply download the ESLint JSON

00:07:25.886 --> 00:07:28.706
file and you can easily drag and

00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:30.526
drop the file onto Web Inspector

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:31.926
to import it.

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:35.386
Audits in Web Inspector are

00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:37.276
quick and convenient, so I hope

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:38.646
you'll give them a try using the

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:40.196
built-in accessibility audit on

00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:41.336
your own web pages.

00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:44.386
Use the portable audit format to

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:45.636
create your own audits and

00:07:45.636 --> 00:07:47.636
ensure in-progress code meets

00:07:47.636 --> 00:07:48.946
your project standards.

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:51.446
And we love hearing from you and

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:52.676
hope you'll file bug reports for

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:54.216
any issues you find or feature

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:56.006
requests you might have.

00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:57.366

00:07:57.366 --> 00:07:58.716

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:00.276
I've covered, use the links in

00:08:00.276 --> 00:08:02.176
