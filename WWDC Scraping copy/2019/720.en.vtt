00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:07.486
[ Music ]

00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:10.436
>> Hi. I'm Brian Weinstein, an

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.146
Engineer on the Safari Team.

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:14.316
And today, I'm going to talk

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.056
about what's new in Safari

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:16.826
Extensions.

00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:19.506
Safari Extensions let you extend

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:20.646
Safari's behavior.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:22.436
You can enhance a user's

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:24.256
browsing experience by adding

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.196
scripts or style sheets to web

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:28.686
pages, blocking content, and

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:30.056
adding to Safari's UI.

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:34.346
We are going to cover how Safari

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:35.796
Extensions are built and

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:38.406
distributed, how your Safari App

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.606
Extension can be notified about

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.146
the activity of your Content

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:44.656
Blocker, better support for

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:47.176
window, tab, and page management

00:00:47.176 --> 00:00:49.946
in your extension, improvements

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:51.896
made to Safari App Extension

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:54.646
popovers, and some of the best

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:56.566
practices for communicating

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.596
between your Safari Extension

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.266
and its containing app.

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:03.466
There are two types of Safari

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.766
Extensions that I'm going to

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.306
focus on today, Content Blockers

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:10.186
and Safari App Extensions.

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:12.156
Both of these extensions are

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:13.956
bundled with Mac apps which are

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.256
built with Xcode.

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:18.556
When you install an app with a

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:20.166
Safari App Extension from the

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.166
Mac App Store, the extension

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.286
shows up immediately in Safari's

00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:26.316
preferences, ready to turn on.

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:31.086
However, you can also distribute

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:32.406
your app directly from your

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:34.406
website after running it through

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:36.076
the notarization service.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.966
Notarized apps need to be

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.976
launched at least once for their

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:41.946
extensions to show up in Safari.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.186
We love the Safari App

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:45.966
Extensions and Content Blockers

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:46.636
you've created.

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:48.976
We also really appreciate those

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:50.096
of you who suggested

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:52.536
improvements, filed bug reports,

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.316
and commented on the Safari

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:55.546
developer forums.

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.636
One of the features we've heard

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:02.876
the most requests for is a way

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:04.836
for extensions to know when

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:06.566
their Content Blocker performs

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:07.126
an action.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.455
Content Blockers provide a

00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:12.256
declarative list of rules

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.646
defining the content to block or

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.476
hide while using Safari.

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:19.146
Safari requests the list of

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:20.836
rules from your Content Blocker

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:22.056
when it's turned on.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:25.766
The user does some browsing, and

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:27.496
when your Content Blocker flags

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:28.956
a resource as something that

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:32.336
should be blocked, now in Safari

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:35.446
13, Safari tells your Safari App

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:37.476
Extension associated with your

00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:39.016
Content Blocker about it.

00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:41.996
Your users will be able to turn

00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:43.976
on the associated Safari App

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:45.716
Extension if they want to see

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:48.386
statistics from you or they can

00:02:48.386 --> 00:02:50.256
turn on only the Content Blocker

00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:51.646
to keep the most private

00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:52.486
experience.

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.216
Let's take a look at how easy

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.696
this is to do.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.006
The first step is associating

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:00.866
your Content Blocker with your

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:02.976
Safari App Extension in your

00:03:02.976 --> 00:03:04.906
extensions info.plist file.

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:08.586
To do this, add a new entry to

00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:10.596
the NSExtension section of your

00:03:10.596 --> 00:03:12.076
Safari App Extension's

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:13.166
info.plist.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.896
The key is SFSafari Associated

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:18.956
Content Blockers.

00:03:21.176 --> 00:03:23.626
And the value is an array of

00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:25.076
Content Blocker bundle

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:27.386
identifiers that the Safari App

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:29.096
Extension wants to be notified

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:29.526
about.

00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:32.156
One Safari App Extension can be

00:03:32.156 --> 00:03:34.046
notified about multiple Content

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:34.616
Blockers.

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:37.026
One thing to keep in mind is

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:38.906
that the Content Blockers and

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:41.016
the Safari App Extension must be

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:42.426
in the same containing app.

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:48.586
Then, once you've set up your

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:50.376
info.plist, you will need to

00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:52.426
implement a delegate method on

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:53.746
your extension's principal

00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:54.346
object.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:56.926
That method is content blocker

00:03:56.926 --> 00:03:58.876
with identifier, blocked

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:01.746
resources with URLs on page.

00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:04.696
These notifications are batched

00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:06.526
and you will only be notified

00:04:06.716 --> 00:04:09.206
about URLs that your Safari App

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:10.916
Extension has permission to

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:12.996
access in the website access

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:14.796
section of its info.plist.

00:04:16.305 --> 00:04:17.296
That's all it takes.

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:20.886
Now, let's move on to the

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.666
improvements made to window,

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:24.666
tab, and page management.

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:27.606
The first enhancement is another

00:04:27.606 --> 00:04:30.396
frequent request, an API to tell

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:32.126
you when a page is about to

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.536
perform a navigation.

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:35.536
You can pair this with the

00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:37.546
Content Blocker notifications

00:04:37.546 --> 00:04:39.736
you just heard about to know any

00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:41.766
future notifications will be for

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:42.766
a new page load.

00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:46.036
The first enhancement is another

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.816
frequent request, an API to tell

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:50.606
you when a page is about to

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:51.966
perform a navigation.

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.046
You can pair this with the

00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:55.916
Content Blocker notifications

00:04:56.086 --> 00:04:58.196
you just heard about to know any

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:00.206
future notifications will be for

00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:01.236
a new page load.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.116
Or you can use this to follow

00:05:04.116 --> 00:05:06.126
the redirect chain across the

00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:08.456
loading of a specific page in

00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:10.646
order to redirect to a specific

00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:13.166
version of a website or to look

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:14.936
at the URL parameters to

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:16.756
determine if your extension has

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:18.396
already shown its UI to the

00:05:18.396 --> 00:05:18.926
user.

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:21.426
This method will be called on

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:22.726
your extension's principal

00:05:22.726 --> 00:05:25.066
object even if your extension

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:26.406
doesn't have access to the

00:05:26.406 --> 00:05:27.426
target URL.

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:30.006
In that case, the URL will be

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:30.416
nil.

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:33.286
The URL will also be nil if the

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:35.376
user opened their favorites or

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:36.026
their history.

00:05:38.556 --> 00:05:40.816
Let's adopt these new APIs in a

00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:41.696
sample extension.

00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:47.026
At a previous WWDC, when Safari

00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:48.856
App Extensions were introduced,

00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:51.176
we created an extension that

00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:53.386
replaces the word "bear" with

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:54.366
the bear emoji.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.056
Today, I'd like to expand this

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.096
extension to make life easier

00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:00.556
for bears on the internet.

00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:03.066
So far, I've made a Content

00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:06.066
Blocker that blocks all images

00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:10.026
with honey in the URL to remove

00:06:10.026 --> 00:06:11.506
the temptation for sweets.

00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:13.966
Let's associate that Content

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:16.346
Blocker with our existing Safari

00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:17.166
App Extension.

00:06:17.646 --> 00:06:19.866
I'll start by opening the Safari

00:06:19.866 --> 00:06:21.806
App Extension's info.plist.

00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:24.506
To associate a Content Blocker,

00:06:24.706 --> 00:06:27.966
I'll add an SF Safari associated

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:30.506
Content Blockers entry to the

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:31.496
NSExtension section.

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:34.666
I'm going to open the XML viewer

00:06:35.076 --> 00:06:36.586
to paste the source code in.

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:46.576
And then go back to the plist

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:46.916
viewer.

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:55.476
It's an array with one entry,

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.926
the bundle identifier of my new

00:06:57.926 --> 00:06:58.796
Content Blocker.

00:06:59.396 --> 00:07:01.426
The next step is to listen for

00:07:01.426 --> 00:07:02.366
the content blocking

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:02.976
notifications.

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:11.366
What we'll do is build up a map

00:07:11.816 --> 00:07:14.326
between SF Safari pages and the

00:07:14.326 --> 00:07:15.996
list of resources that have been

00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:17.406
blocked on that page.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.306
When we get a notification that

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.796
the Content Blocker blocked

00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:24.896
resources, we find the list of

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:26.866
blocked resources for that page

00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:29.666
and add the resources we were

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:30.516
just told about.

00:07:31.636 --> 00:07:33.706
When a page navigates, we want

00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:34.736
to clear that list.

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:39.936
To do this, we will override

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:43.276
page will navigate to URL and

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:44.816
use that to clear the blocked

00:07:44.816 --> 00:07:46.086
resources for the page.

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:49.026
The last thing we want to do is

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:50.846
set the badge of our toolbar

00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:52.906
item to be the number of blocked

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:54.966
resources on that page.

00:07:57.236 --> 00:07:59.246
When we're asked to validate a

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:02.036
toolbar item for a window, we

00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:03.926
find the active tab in that

00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:06.886
window, find its active page,

00:08:07.806 --> 00:08:09.776
and get the number of blocked

00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:11.856
resources on that page from our

00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:12.206
map.

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:14.126
Let's see it in action.

00:08:15.056 --> 00:08:17.926
We'll build and run Animalify so

00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:19.636
the system can discover our

00:08:19.636 --> 00:08:19.976
extensions.

00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.316
Once we've run the app, you can

00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:31.076
see the splash screen with a

00:08:31.076 --> 00:08:32.996
button to take your users to

00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:34.826
Safari's extensions preferences.

00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:36.666
You can get the splash screen

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:38.796
for free in your app if you

00:08:38.796 --> 00:08:41.056
create a Safari Extension App

00:08:41.326 --> 00:08:41.986
from Xcode.

00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:44.956
Let's launch Safari, which takes

00:08:44.956 --> 00:08:46.046
me to my homepage,

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.616
bearseating.com, so I can have

00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:50.416
some food inspiration for the

00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:50.756
day.

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:53.136
Since I'm just experimenting

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:54.736
with writing Safari Extensions,

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:56.556
I don't have an Apple developer

00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:57.426
certificate yet.

00:08:57.806 --> 00:08:59.666
That's OK because I can

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:02.036
temporarily tell Safari to run

00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:04.246
these extensions by first

00:09:04.506 --> 00:09:06.046
opening Safari's preferences,

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:10.526
going to advanced, and turning

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:11.636
on the develop menu.

00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:15.186
Once I've done that, I can open

00:09:15.186 --> 00:09:17.916
the develop menu and check allow

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:19.146
unsigned extensions.

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:22.006
Let's go in to Safari's

00:09:22.006 --> 00:09:24.476
extensions preferences, turn on

00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:26.176
our Content Blocker and our

00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:28.926
Safari App Extension, and reload

00:09:28.926 --> 00:09:30.006
bearseating.com.

00:09:30.816 --> 00:09:32.946
As you can see, the Content

00:09:32.946 --> 00:09:34.446
Blocker blocked the pictures of

00:09:34.446 --> 00:09:36.426
the bears eating honey, and our

00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:38.056
toolbar time is badged with the

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:40.446
number 3, because there were 3

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.526
resources blocked.

00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:44.526
If I reload the page without

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:46.596
Content Blockers, the toolbar

00:09:46.596 --> 00:09:48.656
item's badge clears and you can

00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:50.156
see the images that were blocked

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:50.526
again.

00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:52.646
And when you reload one more

00:09:52.646 --> 00:09:55.076
time, those images are gone.

00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:57.596
And that's how easy it is to

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.746
adopt content blocking and page

00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:00.976
navigation notifications.

00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:06.916
Those are just a couple of the

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:09.336
many new APIs available to

00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:10.696
Safari App Extensions.

00:10:11.206 --> 00:10:12.386
Let's look at some others.

00:10:13.896 --> 00:10:15.756
We've added the ability to get

00:10:15.756 --> 00:10:17.726
the visible contents of an SF

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:18.766
Safari page.

00:10:19.336 --> 00:10:20.886
Your extension will need to have

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:23.506
access to the URL of the page in

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:25.146
order to get image data from

00:10:25.146 --> 00:10:25.656
this API.

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:28.496
With the latest version of

00:10:28.496 --> 00:10:31.096
Safari, it is now much easier to

00:10:31.096 --> 00:10:32.986
show users content from your

00:10:32.986 --> 00:10:34.646
Safari Extensions bundle.

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:38.766
You can now get the base URL of

00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:40.426
your extension from native code.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.396
There's no need to inject script

00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:42.976
to do this anymore.

00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:49.156
You can navigate a tab to a URL

00:10:49.156 --> 00:10:51.496
directly also without needing an

00:10:51.496 --> 00:10:52.426
injected script.

00:10:55.346 --> 00:10:58.276
And finally, Safari now injects

00:10:58.276 --> 00:11:00.306
the Safari JavaScript object

00:11:00.456 --> 00:11:02.366
into any frames loaded with

00:11:02.366 --> 00:11:03.856
content from your extension,

00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:06.086
meaning those frames can send

00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:07.996
messages to the Safari App

00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:10.156
Extension and receive messages

00:11:10.156 --> 00:11:12.526
from it.

00:11:12.796 --> 00:11:14.826
Safari extensions can now find

00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:17.096
out about all the open tabs and

00:11:17.096 --> 00:11:19.446
windows in Safari, not just the

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:20.716
active window and tab.

00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:24.516
Here, you can see code that gets

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:25.606
all the windows in the

00:11:25.606 --> 00:11:27.686
application, and then for each

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:29.916
window gets all of its tabs.

00:11:36.076 --> 00:11:38.076
You can also get a reference to

00:11:38.076 --> 00:11:40.856
a pages containing tab and the

00:11:40.856 --> 00:11:42.336
tabs containing window.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.486
For example, consider handling a

00:11:45.486 --> 00:11:47.226
message from your content script

00:11:47.336 --> 00:11:49.186
that requires you to update the

00:11:49.186 --> 00:11:50.956
toolbar item in that window.

00:11:51.486 --> 00:11:52.976
You can get the pages containing

00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:55.196
tab and then the tabs containing

00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:55.526
window.

00:12:00.016 --> 00:12:01.766
One thing to keep in mind is

00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:03.156
that a pinned tab will have a

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:05.066
nil containing window because

00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:06.716
they belong to all windows

00:12:06.716 --> 00:12:08.056
instead of a single parent

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:08.426
window.

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:11.926
Those were the improvements made

00:12:11.926 --> 00:12:13.806
to window, tab, and page

00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:14.356
management.

00:12:15.616 --> 00:12:17.846
The last set of API improvements

00:12:18.096 --> 00:12:19.886
are for Safari App Extension

00:12:19.886 --> 00:12:23.136
popovers, which you can now

00:12:23.136 --> 00:12:25.006
programmatically show and

00:12:25.006 --> 00:12:25.606
dismiss.

00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:28.076
A popover is shown by calling

00:12:28.076 --> 00:12:30.626
show popover on an SF Safari

00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:32.736
toolbar item, which you can get

00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:33.826
from the window that will

00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:34.986
present the popover.

00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:37.476
The popover is dismissed from

00:12:37.476 --> 00:12:39.096
your popovers view controller

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:39.676
itself.

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:41.606
All you have to do is call

00:12:41.606 --> 00:12:43.366
self.dismissPopover.

00:12:45.376 --> 00:12:47.366
Let's take a look at improving

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:49.366
our extension by adding some of

00:12:49.366 --> 00:12:50.596
these new APIs.

00:12:53.086 --> 00:12:55.096
Using some of these new APIs,

00:12:55.266 --> 00:12:56.916
I'd like to upgrade my Safari

00:12:56.916 --> 00:12:57.506
Extension.

00:12:58.036 --> 00:12:59.536
When I click my toolbar item,

00:12:59.786 --> 00:13:01.696
I'd like to display a popover

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:02.586
with a table view.

00:13:02.856 --> 00:13:04.916
There will be one row per tab

00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:06.426
and two columns.

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.506
The left column will be a

00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:10.436
screenshot of the tab and the

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:12.316
right column will have the title

00:13:12.316 --> 00:13:13.976
of the page and how many

00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:15.636
resources were blocked from each

00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:16.146
domain.

00:13:17.576 --> 00:13:19.146
The first step in this process

00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:21.136
is telling the popovers view

00:13:21.136 --> 00:13:22.806
controller the state of the

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:25.056
Safari window before showing the

00:13:25.056 --> 00:13:25.666
popover.

00:13:26.186 --> 00:13:28.056
To do this, I'll override

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:30.096
popover will show and have it

00:13:30.096 --> 00:13:31.366
collect this information.

00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:36.866
As you can see, the function

00:13:36.866 --> 00:13:38.536
iterates over all the tabs in

00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:40.366
the window and fills up three

00:13:40.366 --> 00:13:42.656
arrays, one for blocked

00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:47.106
resources, one for images, and

00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:48.496
one for titles.

00:13:49.906 --> 00:13:52.656
For each tab, we get a

00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:54.986
screenshot of the page's visible

00:13:54.986 --> 00:14:00.306
area, the title of each page

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.936
from the pages' properties, and

00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:04.446
the list of blocked resources

00:14:04.446 --> 00:14:05.316
for each page.

00:14:06.436 --> 00:14:08.306
We've also started overriding

00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:10.326
popover view controller to

00:14:10.326 --> 00:14:12.036
return our view controller.

00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:14.126
Let's take a look at our view

00:14:14.126 --> 00:14:14.706
controller.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.466
Set popover state, set some

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:21.206
instance variables in the class,

00:14:21.716 --> 00:14:23.426
and then reloads the table view.

00:14:25.596 --> 00:14:28.106
The last thing we want to do is

00:14:28.106 --> 00:14:30.896
when the user clicks on one of

00:14:30.896 --> 00:14:33.816
these rows, we want to activate

00:14:33.816 --> 00:14:35.956
that tab and then dismiss the

00:14:35.956 --> 00:14:36.556
popover.

00:14:39.466 --> 00:14:40.986
When the table view selection

00:14:40.986 --> 00:14:43.976
changes, we activate the tab the

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:46.266
user clicked on, and then

00:14:46.266 --> 00:14:47.266
dismiss the popover.

00:14:48.206 --> 00:14:49.436
Now let's build and run

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:50.966
Animalify again.

00:14:58.256 --> 00:15:00.256
And we'll launch Safari again

00:15:00.826 --> 00:15:02.006
which loads our homepage.

00:15:02.566 --> 00:15:04.346
And you can see the extensions

00:15:04.346 --> 00:15:05.496
aren't turned on anymore.

00:15:06.076 --> 00:15:07.666
That's because you must allow

00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:09.656
unsigned extensions each time

00:15:09.656 --> 00:15:10.526
you launch Safari.

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.456
Let's do that from the develop

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:12.726
menu.

00:15:14.996 --> 00:15:17.966
And then we'll go to our app and

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:18.846
have it take us to our

00:15:18.846 --> 00:15:19.346
extension.

00:15:20.806 --> 00:15:22.716
We'll turn on the extension and

00:15:22.716 --> 00:15:25.046
the Content Blocker and reload

00:15:25.046 --> 00:15:25.556
the page.

00:15:25.776 --> 00:15:28.566
We'll also open a couple more

00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:29.186
pages.

00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:32.176
You'll notice that when we

00:15:32.176 --> 00:15:33.866
change tabs away from

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:36.176
bearseating.com, the toolbar

00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:37.586
item's badge is cleared.

00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:39.526
Let's open our popover.

00:15:40.776 --> 00:15:42.536
And you can see each tab in the

00:15:42.536 --> 00:15:42.966
window.

00:15:43.496 --> 00:15:45.456
In the first row, you can see

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:47.066
that our Content Blocker blocked

00:15:47.066 --> 00:15:49.566
two resources from beardiet.com

00:15:49.566 --> 00:15:51.906
and one from bearseating.com.

00:15:52.396 --> 00:15:54.206
Let's activate that tab by

00:15:54.206 --> 00:15:56.316
clicking on the first row, and

00:15:56.316 --> 00:15:57.776
we're taken back to that tab,

00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.856
and the popover is dismissed.

00:16:00.316 --> 00:16:01.946
And those are just some of the

00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:03.636
new APIs that we've talked about

00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:03.826
today.

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:10.996
The last thing I'd like to cover

00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:13.056
are some best practices about

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.106
how to communicate between your

00:16:15.106 --> 00:16:17.236
Safari Extension and your app.

00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:20.346
Safari launches your app

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:21.946
extension when necessary.

00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:23.746
There is no guarantee that your

00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:24.456
app is running.

00:16:25.706 --> 00:16:27.586
But if you have an app with an

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:30.076
XPC service, your extension

00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:31.946
might want to communicate with

00:16:31.946 --> 00:16:33.166
that XPC service.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.836
Or you might want to share data

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:38.106
between your Safari Extension

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:38.996
and your app.

00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:40.646
Your extension could have

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:42.326
preferences that the user

00:16:42.326 --> 00:16:43.826
configures in your app.

00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:47.366
To do this, make your Safari

00:16:47.366 --> 00:16:50.166
Extension and XPC service part

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.936
of the same App Group as your

00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:52.176
app.

00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:54.436
This will allow your Safari

00:16:54.436 --> 00:16:56.636
Extension to look up named mock

00:16:56.636 --> 00:16:58.766
services in the same App Group

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:00.436
and you can use the user

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.766
defaults suiteName initializer

00:17:03.006 --> 00:17:04.715
to share data across the App

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:05.096
Group.

00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:08.316
However, let's say the user

00:17:08.316 --> 00:17:10.165
performs an action in your app

00:17:10.356 --> 00:17:12.326
that is best handled by a Safari

00:17:12.326 --> 00:17:13.116
App Extension.

00:17:13.636 --> 00:17:15.185
For example, you're writing a

00:17:15.185 --> 00:17:17.126
password manager and the user

00:17:17.126 --> 00:17:19.205
selects a credential in your app

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:19.726
to fill.

00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:21.656
There's no guarantee that your

00:17:21.656 --> 00:17:23.396
extension is running or that

00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:24.566
Safari is even running.

00:17:25.955 --> 00:17:28.435
There's an API you can call from

00:17:28.435 --> 00:17:30.256
your app to send a message to

00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:31.706
your Safari App Extension.

00:17:32.396 --> 00:17:34.466
Your app calls SFSafari

00:17:34.466 --> 00:17:36.866
Application, dispatch message

00:17:37.046 --> 00:17:39.096
with name to extension with

00:17:39.096 --> 00:17:39.846
identifier.

00:17:40.616 --> 00:17:42.126
This method will only have an

00:17:42.126 --> 00:17:43.736
effect if your extension is

00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:46.156
enabled and the extension must

00:17:46.156 --> 00:17:48.016
be in the same app bundle as the

00:17:48.016 --> 00:17:49.426
code that calls the API.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:53.166
Calling this API will send a

00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:55.466
message to Safari, launching it

00:17:55.466 --> 00:17:56.286
if necessary.

00:17:57.696 --> 00:17:59.866
And Safari will forward this

00:17:59.866 --> 00:18:01.576
message to your Safari App

00:18:01.576 --> 00:18:02.126
Extension.

00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:05.356
Your Safari App Extension can

00:18:05.356 --> 00:18:08.416
listen for these messages by

00:18:08.416 --> 00:18:10.576
implementing message received

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.866
from containing app with name

00:18:13.116 --> 00:18:15.586
user info in your extension's

00:18:15.586 --> 00:18:16.786
principal object.

00:18:17.506 --> 00:18:19.346
Let's take a step back and look

00:18:19.346 --> 00:18:21.116
at all the possible ways your

00:18:21.236 --> 00:18:23.296
app and your Safari Extensions

00:18:23.516 --> 00:18:25.216
can communicate and share data.

00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:29.726
If your app and Safari Extension

00:18:29.726 --> 00:18:31.986
are in the same App Group, you

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.956
can use NSXPCConnection to

00:18:33.956 --> 00:18:35.856
communicate between them or

00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:37.966
share data using user defaults.

00:18:38.236 --> 00:18:40.906
If you want to send a message

00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:43.136
from your app to your Safari App

00:18:43.136 --> 00:18:45.736
Extension, you can use SFSafari

00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:47.806
Application dispatch message to

00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:50.736
send the message, and listen for

00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:52.556
message received from containing

00:18:52.556 --> 00:18:54.816
app in your Safari App Extension

00:18:54.906 --> 00:18:56.036
to handle the message.

00:18:56.456 --> 00:18:59.266
And that's how you communicate

00:18:59.366 --> 00:19:01.256
between your app and your Safari

00:19:01.256 --> 00:19:01.786
Extension.

00:19:04.136 --> 00:19:05.486
That concludes what we're

00:19:05.486 --> 00:19:06.556
covering for today.

00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:08.706
A few of the major things I'd

00:19:08.706 --> 00:19:10.106
like you to take away from this

00:19:10.106 --> 00:19:12.896
video are, you can distribute

00:19:12.896 --> 00:19:14.476
your Safari Extensions through

00:19:14.476 --> 00:19:16.106
the Mac App Store or as a

00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:17.566
notarized app through your

00:19:17.566 --> 00:19:18.086
website.

00:19:19.246 --> 00:19:20.736
You can associate your Content

00:19:20.736 --> 00:19:22.606
Blocker with your Safari App

00:19:22.606 --> 00:19:24.636
Extension so you can find out

00:19:24.636 --> 00:19:25.856
when your Content Blocker

00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:27.436
performs a blocking action.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:29.936
You can use App Groups to

00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:31.886
communicate between your Safari

00:19:31.886 --> 00:19:33.896
Extension and your app.

00:19:35.206 --> 00:19:36.916
All of these APIs we talked

00:19:36.916 --> 00:19:38.766
about today were implemented

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:40.396
because of your feedback and

00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:41.056
requests.

00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:43.346
Please continue to keep filing

00:19:43.346 --> 00:19:45.026
enhancement requests and

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:46.636
reaching out on the forums.

00:19:46.976 --> 00:19:48.276
Thanks, everyone, for taking the

00:19:48.276 --> 00:19:49.976
time to listen, and we can't

00:19:49.976 --> 00:19:51.396
wait to see the extensions you

00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:51.916
come up with.
