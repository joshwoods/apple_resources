[ Applause ]

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.476
>> Hi, everybody.

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:20.856
My name is Cody and I'd like to

00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:22.196
welcome you to the introduction

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:23.976
to RealityKit and Reality

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:24.436
Composer.

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:30.046
So today, the App Store is full

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:32.006
of many different AR experiences

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.026
that utilize the power of ARKit.

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:37.116
And developers of these apps

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:39.416
have a lot of common needs, for

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.536
example, rendering, physics and

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:41.996
animation.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.416
And ARKit makes building AR

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:47.656
experiences pretty simple but

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:48.646
now we're going to make it even

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:48.976
easier.

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:54.776
The developing applications for

00:00:54.896 --> 00:00:57.036
AR, provides very unique

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:58.316
challenges that really don't

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:00.166
exist anywhere else, and it

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.606
mostly centers around the fact

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:03.516
that your virtual content will

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:05.096
now interact with the real world

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:06.196
and vice versa.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:09.246
So if you put like a virtual

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:11.936
lamp into a real living room, it

00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:13.476
should probably light up the

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:14.786
surrounding objects whether

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:16.176
they're real or virtual.

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:18.686
And additionally, any content

00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:20.166
that gets placed in the real

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.076
world should look like it

00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:22.676
belongs there.

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.976
And this can be very important

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:28.216
in a case like online shopping,

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:30.586
where you want to see how the

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:32.246
product will look in your home.

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:35.546
So this gives us a very strong

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:38.506
requirement for a very realistic

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:41.226
render, otherwise, you'll lose

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.286
the illusion of augmented

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:43.996
reality.

00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:47.916
So enter RealityKit, which is a

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:49.616
brand new Swift framework

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:52.166
designed to help you build your

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.196
AR applications and easily

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:58.846
exploit the power of ARKit.

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:01.326
RealityKit is an AR first

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.176
framework, which means that it's

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:04.556
been completely designed from

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:06.546
the ground up with an emphasis

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:08.366
on AR application development.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:10.936
So the framework heavily

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:12.566
emphasizes highly realistic

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.376
physically-based rendering and

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:16.576
accurate object simulation with

00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:17.726
the real life environment.

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:21.076
We also take full advantage of

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:23.626
the power of Swift to deliver a

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.796
high-quality framework that has

00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:27.046
a very simple API.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:32.606
In addition to RealityKit, we're

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:34.056
also introducing Reality

00:02:34.056 --> 00:02:36.836
Composer, which is a Mac and iOS

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:38.356
tool that enables simple

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:40.186
AR-based content creation.

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.816
And its intuitive design is

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:44.386
really targeted at anybody who

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:46.056
wants to make their own content

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:48.636
exist in the world around them,

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:50.766
even allowing you to lay out

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:53.016
your scenes directly in AR.

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:55.556
But before we get into that,

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.656
let's focus on RealityKit and

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:01.416
see it in action.

00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:03.066
So here we have a real living

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.686
room with a couch and a table

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:05.916
and some small objects that are

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:06.616
on the table.

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.336
It's purposely a bit blurry

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:11.186
because the focus of the camera

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:12.456
is very shallow here.

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.456
So with RealityKit, we can add

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:17.156
virtual objects to this world

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:19.406
and believe that they're really

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:20.186
in our environment.

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:25.466
So notice here how very accurate

00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:27.736
lighting and shadows and camera

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:29.856
effects, really helped to make

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:31.706
the object feel like it belongs,

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.846
even something fantastical like

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:35.806
this.

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:37.486
RealityKit helps with the heavy

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:38.966
lifting and making your content

00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:41.436
fit in the world automatically.

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.506
All you have to do is tell the

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.416
framework where you want to show

00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:47.516
up and then supply any custom

00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:48.886
logic that's specific to your

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:49.646
app.

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:53.766
And it's really easy to get up

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.006
and running with your very first

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:55.196
app.

00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:56.716
And in fact for that app you

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:58.706
just saw, I only needed to write

00:03:58.916 --> 00:03:59.756
four lines of code.

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:03.716
So here, I'm placing a

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:05.046
horizontal anchor in the world.

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:06.836
I'm loading a model that's

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:08.556
called flyer from my asset

00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:08.976
bundle.

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:11.766
And I'm attaching that model to

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:12.156
the anchor.

00:04:12.496 --> 00:04:15.076
So over the course of this talk,

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:16.336
I'll dive deeper into what each

00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:17.906
of these concepts mean.

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:21.065
But now that we've seen this

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:22.666
framework in action, let's go

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:23.766
into some of the systems that

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:26.166
make up RealityKit and the

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.776
basics to help you get started

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:28.686
right away.

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:32.816
So to help build your apps,

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:35.156
RealityKit takes care of a lot

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:37.156
for you to all of its built-in

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:37.616
systems.

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:41.426
All of which are integrated with

00:04:41.496 --> 00:04:43.536
other Apple frameworks such as

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:44.816
ARKit and Metal.

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:49.806
So first off, the rendering

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.566
system has a job of making your

00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:53.276
content look amazing and

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:55.846
realistic in a real environment.

00:04:56.856 --> 00:04:57.886
And it does this with a

00:04:57.886 --> 00:04:59.426
physically-based shading system

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:01.296
that accurately simulates

00:05:01.626 --> 00:05:02.626
lighting and material

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:03.176
interactions.

00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:05.806
It's all built on top of Metal,

00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:07.566
it means that it's highly

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:09.326
optimized for Apple devices.

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:11.936
The system takes advantage of

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:13.986
all the Metal has to offer, such

00:05:13.986 --> 00:05:15.706
as multithreaded rendering and

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:17.096
other low level functionality.

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:20.606
And since RealityKit is designed

00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:22.516
for AR applications, the feature

00:05:22.516 --> 00:05:24.506
set of the render is entirely

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:25.526
focused around making your

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:27.986
content look great and in a real

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:28.416
environment.

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.406
On top of rendering, animations

00:05:35.406 --> 00:05:36.956
really helped to breathe life to

00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:38.686
your content and really enrich

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:39.126
your scene.

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.296
And RealityKit's animation

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:43.866
system achieves this through

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:45.596
supporting both skeletal and

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:47.736
transform animations, both of

00:05:47.986 --> 00:05:49.576
which can be imported directly

00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:50.026
from USDZ.

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:52.696
And you can even animate your

00:05:52.696 --> 00:05:54.346
objects procedurally through

00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:55.646
ARKit's motion capture

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:56.196
technology.

00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:01.916
The physics system is

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:03.276
responsible for simulating

00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:05.106
complex interactions between

00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:07.096
content, including real world

00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:07.516
objects.

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:09.656
And it provides a collision

00:06:09.656 --> 00:06:12.166
detection system that supports

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:14.116
several different proxy shapes,

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:16.676
such as box, sphere, or even

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:17.526
compound shapes.

00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:20.596
And it also simulates rigid body

00:06:20.596 --> 00:06:22.966
dynamics, such as mass, inertia,

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:24.876
friction, and restitution.

00:06:31.436 --> 00:06:33.096
RealityKit has built-in support

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:34.156
for networking and it

00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:35.986
synchronizes the entire scene

00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:39.186
across devices, including shared

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:40.826
representations of real world

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:41.136
data.

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:44.006
And it's all built on top of

00:06:44.006 --> 00:06:45.416
Apple's multipeer networking

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:45.776
library.

00:06:47.256 --> 00:06:48.696
This system it works out of the

00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:50.456
box, and it really makes

00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:53.156
building connected apps simple

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:57.486
and automatic.

00:06:57.576 --> 00:06:58.906
RealityKit uses an entity

00:06:58.906 --> 00:07:00.476
component system to represent

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:02.536
object data which gives users a

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.646
really powerful tool to easily

00:07:04.646 --> 00:07:06.286
make content through composition

00:07:06.286 --> 00:07:07.886
of properties as opposed to

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.546
large object inheritance

00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:09.946
hierarchies.

00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:12.176
And you can even create your own

00:07:12.176 --> 00:07:14.186
custom components to add your

00:07:14.186 --> 00:07:16.346
own data and functionality to

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.166
any entity.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.446
And additionally, all components

00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:21.996
automatically synchronize their

00:07:21.996 --> 00:07:24.036
data with other devices in a

00:07:24.036 --> 00:07:26.886
network setting, even custom

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:27.336
components.

00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:29.886
So sharing data is a very easy

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:30.416
operation.

00:07:34.226 --> 00:07:35.736
So far, all the systems that we

00:07:35.786 --> 00:07:37.126
focused on are really

00:07:37.126 --> 00:07:38.486
emphasizing a lot of the visual

00:07:38.486 --> 00:07:40.176
side of AR, but that really

00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:41.106
doesn't capture the whole

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:41.446
picture.

00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:44.436
Audio is also an important

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:46.396
aspect in helping to create very

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:47.796
immersive content that you can

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:49.326
believe is in the real world.

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.286
RealityKit's audio system

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:55.326
understands 3D space and can

00:07:55.326 --> 00:07:57.336
place audio sources on dynamic

00:07:57.406 --> 00:07:57.826
content.

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.636
So this has the effect of making

00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:02.766
virtual objects further from you

00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:04.166
actually sound like they're

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:05.946
farther away, and vice versa.

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:12.436
I'd also like to mention that

00:08:12.436 --> 00:08:15.436
RealityKit has defined a new

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:17.336
file type, known as the Reality

00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:20.016
File, which stores optimized

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:21.806
content that's ready for loading

00:08:21.806 --> 00:08:22.276
into your app.

00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:24.816
And this file can include

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:25.916
everything that your app would

00:08:25.956 --> 00:08:26.226
need.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.316
For example, meshes and

00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:30.236
materials and physics properties

00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:33.066
or even audio sources.

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:34.866
RealityKit does also support

00:08:34.866 --> 00:08:36.895
importing directly from USDZ

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:38.785
files, similar to how AR Quick

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:39.196
Look works.

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:41.515
But using Reality Files will

00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:42.996
give you much faster uploading

00:08:42.996 --> 00:08:44.856
time and much greater control

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:45.576
over your content.

00:08:46.106 --> 00:08:48.756
And you can export these files

00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:50.576
directly from Reality Composer,

00:08:51.116 --> 00:08:52.116
which will be covered later in

00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:53.066
this talk.

00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:58.336
So while using the RealityKit

00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:00.116
API, there's going to be four

00:09:00.116 --> 00:09:01.606
main areas that you're going to

00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:03.086
use no matter what type of

00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:04.176
application that you're going to

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:04.546
be building.

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:07.216
And those include ARView,

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:10.186
anchors, scenes, and entities.

00:09:10.606 --> 00:09:13.666
So let's start with the View or

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:15.166
ARView as it's called in

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:15.886
RealityKit.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.476
So the View takes care of a lot

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:19.746
of the heavy lifting of building

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:21.866
your AR apps, so that you can

00:09:21.866 --> 00:09:22.956
start focusing on your

00:09:22.956 --> 00:09:24.526
experience right away.

00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:26.846
And it comes with a lot of

00:09:26.936 --> 00:09:28.366
useful functionality for you.

00:09:29.016 --> 00:09:30.716
For example, full gesture

00:09:30.716 --> 00:09:33.526
support so that you can add-- so

00:09:33.526 --> 00:09:35.276
that you can respond to any

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:37.926
gesture on iOS devices, which

00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:40.236
allows any entity to easily

00:09:40.236 --> 00:09:43.166
respond to user input, as well

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.456
as very realistic camera

00:09:44.456 --> 00:09:46.206
effects, which are powered by

00:09:46.206 --> 00:09:47.776
the render that really helped to

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:49.466
integrate your virtual content

00:09:49.796 --> 00:09:50.716
into the real world.

00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:54.166
And in fact, ARView will give

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:56.266
you the exact same quality and

00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:57.746
feature set as AR Quick Look

00:09:58.216 --> 00:09:58.946
right out of the box.

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:00.826
So let's take a look at some of

00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:02.426
these camera effects in action.

00:10:05.756 --> 00:10:07.286
So one of the most important

00:10:07.286 --> 00:10:09.186
effects to help content feel

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:10.996
like it's part of the real world

00:10:11.516 --> 00:10:12.946
is very convincing shadows,

00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:14.566
grounding shadows.

00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:17.186
So notice in this video how when

00:10:17.186 --> 00:10:19.086
the shadow isn't present, it

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:20.536
becomes difficult to determine

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:22.336
where this robot is relative to

00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:23.446
the table underneath it.

00:10:23.846 --> 00:10:25.306
Is it floating in space, is it

00:10:25.306 --> 00:10:26.606
sitting on these blocks, it's

00:10:26.606 --> 00:10:27.376
really hard to tell.

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:29.476
But when the shadow is there, it

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:31.276
becomes very clear where this

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:32.756
robot is in 3D space.

00:10:34.036 --> 00:10:35.646
And ARView provides two

00:10:35.646 --> 00:10:36.806
different grounding shadowing

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:38.256
techniques which you can choose

00:10:38.256 --> 00:10:39.556
from to balance performance for

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.746
your particular application.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.486
So either a simple drop shadow,

00:10:44.096 --> 00:10:45.936
or the much more realistic

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:47.046
[inaudible] shadow, which is

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:47.626
what you see here.

00:10:52.996 --> 00:10:54.916
ARView automatically reads the

00:10:54.916 --> 00:10:57.076
camera exposure time, which is

00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:59.186
provided by ARKit to perform

00:10:59.186 --> 00:11:01.516
camera-based motion blur on all

00:11:01.516 --> 00:11:02.926
virtual content in your scene,

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.516
which helps to match the blur

00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:06.856
that's already present in the

00:11:06.856 --> 00:11:07.856
live camera feed.

00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:10.336
I hope I don't make anybody

00:11:10.866 --> 00:11:10.966
sick.

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:15.296
OK. So notice how when motion

00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:16.996
blur is not enabled, this

00:11:16.996 --> 00:11:18.296
content feels like it's just

00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:19.976
stuck on top of the video feed.

00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:32.316
Cool. We built a realistic depth

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:34.126
of field algorithm to model

00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:36.186
varying camera focus, which is

00:11:36.186 --> 00:11:38.156
again using information provided

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:38.776
by ARKit.

00:11:39.716 --> 00:11:40.806
So when the device camera

00:11:40.806 --> 00:11:42.506
focuses on a particular feature

00:11:42.506 --> 00:11:45.536
of the world, ARView will ensure

00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:46.926
that that virtual content

00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:48.936
follows the same focusing

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:49.246
pattern.

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:52.546
So for this video, the focus of

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:53.876
the camera is continually

00:11:53.876 --> 00:11:56.656
shifting back and forth to focus

00:11:56.656 --> 00:11:57.626
on each of these columns

00:11:57.626 --> 00:11:57.976
individually.

00:12:01.516 --> 00:12:06.500
[ Applause ]

00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:12.376
Finally ARView adds digital film

00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:13.856
grain to the virtual content

00:12:14.196 --> 00:12:15.516
provided by the new ARKit

00:12:15.516 --> 00:12:16.556
feature camera grain.

00:12:17.556 --> 00:12:18.946
And since all digital cameras

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:20.446
have some amount of noise and

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:21.846
especially in really low light

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:23.856
situations, adding it to your

00:12:23.856 --> 00:12:26.076
virtual content can really help

00:12:26.076 --> 00:12:28.266
users feel like the content is

00:12:28.336 --> 00:12:29.346
part of that world that they're

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:30.766
seeing and not just something

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:33.276
that's stuck on top of a camera

00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:34.026
image.

00:12:35.096 --> 00:12:36.426
So notice here how when that

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:38.006
robot doesn't have any noise.

00:12:38.686 --> 00:12:39.766
It doesn't feel like it fits in

00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:40.806
the environment very well,

00:12:41.366 --> 00:12:42.706
whereas when the noise comes in,

00:12:42.806 --> 00:12:43.936
it really feels like it's

00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:46.146
beneath the camera image and not

00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:46.916
just on top of it.

00:12:53.496 --> 00:12:54.666
So next let's talk about

00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:56.206
entities which form the main

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:57.386
building block for any

00:12:57.386 --> 00:12:58.396
experience that you're going to

00:12:58.396 --> 00:12:58.746
create.

00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:01.646
All virtual content in your

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:03.196
scene is an entity with

00:13:03.196 --> 00:13:05.026
different types of components to

00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:06.156
give it very specific

00:13:06.366 --> 00:13:07.056
functionality.

00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:10.366
Any entity can be parented to

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:13.316
any other entity, which helps to

00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:14.656
establish the structure of a

00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:17.076
scene and build out a transform

00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:18.456
hierarchy, so it's easier to

00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:19.836
reason about objects within

00:13:19.836 --> 00:13:20.626
their local space.

00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:24.086
So for example, if you have a

00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:25.766
virtual table and a virtual cup

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:27.526
and you want that cup to sit on

00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:30.146
the table, you might parent that

00:13:30.596 --> 00:13:32.116
table entity to the cup entity

00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:32.856
so that they move together in

00:13:32.856 --> 00:13:32.976
space.

00:13:39.496 --> 00:13:41.206
Next, let's talk about anchoring

00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:43.046
and why it's such an important

00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:43.966
concept in AR.

00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:46.946
So in the real world, objects

00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:48.056
are often in motion.

00:13:48.746 --> 00:13:49.956
And if we're projecting virtual

00:13:49.956 --> 00:13:51.496
content into a real environment,

00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:53.686
adapting to that motion is

00:13:53.686 --> 00:13:55.526
crucial for a realistic

00:13:55.526 --> 00:13:56.016
experience.

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:59.646
For example, if you have content

00:13:59.646 --> 00:14:01.116
that's anchored to an image such

00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:02.546
as like a magazine on your

00:14:02.546 --> 00:14:04.726
table, that content should stick

00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:06.066
to it regardless of how that

00:14:06.066 --> 00:14:07.836
magazine moves in the real

00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:08.116
world.

00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:11.436
And RealityKit solves this

00:14:11.486 --> 00:14:13.186
problem by exposing ARKit's

00:14:13.336 --> 00:14:15.486
anchors as first-class citizens

00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:17.876
of the API, supporting all of

00:14:17.876 --> 00:14:19.156
the anchoring types available

00:14:19.416 --> 00:14:21.446
such as plane, body, face, or

00:14:21.446 --> 00:14:21.826
camera.

00:14:22.386 --> 00:14:25.456
And since many surfaces in the

00:14:25.456 --> 00:14:27.446
world can be anchors for

00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:29.296
content, we treat each of these

00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:31.416
anchors as a local root for

00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:32.116
entity hierarchies.

00:14:33.586 --> 00:14:34.606
So to illustrate how anchors

00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:36.346
work in RealityKit, let's

00:14:36.346 --> 00:14:37.226
consider that there are

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:39.066
horizontal and vertical planes

00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:40.016
in the world that we want to

00:14:40.016 --> 00:14:42.286
attach content to such as tables

00:14:42.286 --> 00:14:42.746
or walls.

00:14:43.386 --> 00:14:45.676
Each of these could be utilized

00:14:46.116 --> 00:14:47.316
as an anchor.

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:50.406
And all anchors can have a

00:14:50.406 --> 00:14:51.776
hierarchy of entities that are

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:52.536
attached to them.

00:14:53.276 --> 00:14:55.376
And it's important to note that

00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:56.816
the entire hierarchy of entities

00:14:56.846 --> 00:14:59.486
will not be active until a

00:14:59.486 --> 00:15:01.116
matching anchor is spotted in

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:02.776
the world by ARKit.

00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:05.276
So for example, if you were to

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:07.816
define a horizontal plane anchor

00:15:07.816 --> 00:15:09.256
and attach entities to it, you

00:15:09.256 --> 00:15:10.236
won't actually see those

00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:12.246
entities in your world until

00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:13.456
ARKit has successfully

00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:15.206
recognized a horizontal plane.

00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:17.136
So this prevents content from

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:19.256
just floating in space until all

00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:20.206
the anchors have been found.

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:26.206
So at one time, new anchors can

00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:27.876
be introduced to your scene, for

00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:30.056
example, an image anchor, which

00:15:30.056 --> 00:15:31.886
maybe it's being used to display

00:15:31.886 --> 00:15:33.916
a virtual frame around a real

00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:35.366
life photograph that you have on

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:35.756
your wall.

00:15:36.766 --> 00:15:38.096
So if you decide to move that

00:15:38.096 --> 00:15:40.656
photograph for some reason, say

00:15:40.656 --> 00:15:41.956
you decide you just want it on a

00:15:41.956 --> 00:15:43.106
different wall or it just needs

00:15:43.106 --> 00:15:44.236
to be a little bit to the left,

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:47.046
the virtual frame will move

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:47.606
right along with it.

00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:53.796
And finally, let's take a look

00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:55.706
at the makeup of an AR scene,

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:58.436
any of which is going to follow

00:15:58.436 --> 00:16:00.706
what you see here.

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.326
So you start with the ARView,

00:16:03.456 --> 00:16:05.646
which is the entry point to your

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:07.956
AR world and it contains a

00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:09.606
reference to your scene.

00:16:10.346 --> 00:16:11.956
And a scene has different

00:16:11.956 --> 00:16:13.306
anchors which you can add

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.486
manually as you saw before.

00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:18.026
And every time you load a new

00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:20.676
entity, you can attach it to the

00:16:20.676 --> 00:16:23.626
anchor of your choosing, or to a

00:16:23.626 --> 00:16:26.006
previously loaded entity to form

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:26.826
an entity hierarchy.

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:30.936
So in this example, we have two

00:16:30.936 --> 00:16:32.996
anchors that each form their own

00:16:32.996 --> 00:16:33.606
entity hierarchies.

00:16:37.416 --> 00:16:38.796
So now given all the things

00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:40.406
we've just seen, let's see a

00:16:40.406 --> 00:16:41.606
live demo of some of the stuff

00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:42.006
in action.

00:16:44.516 --> 00:16:49.186
[ Applause ]

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:52.126
So what we'll be doing here is

00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:54.006
we'll be detecting this plane in

00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:56.746
front of me and we'll be placing

00:16:57.496 --> 00:16:59.826
virtual content on this plane

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.776
using the procedural mesh--

00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:04.685
procedural mesh generation

00:17:04.685 --> 00:17:06.445
library in RealityKit.

00:17:07.536 --> 00:17:08.976
So let's bring them out there.

00:17:08.976 --> 00:17:11.226
And I'll also bring in some

00:17:11.226 --> 00:17:14.316
virtual toys that are going to

00:17:14.316 --> 00:17:15.336
interact with these boxes.

00:17:16.296 --> 00:17:16.935
So there we go.

00:17:21.476 --> 00:17:22.526
So notice that the physics

00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:23.715
system is handling the

00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:25.036
interactions between all the

00:17:25.036 --> 00:17:25.806
different objects.

00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:27.346
The animation system is

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:28.986
animating this airplane as it

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:30.246
flies around me.

00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:33.126
And notice how RealityKit is

00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:34.536
automatically handling the

00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:36.556
lighting, the shadowing, and all

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.686
the different camera effects to

00:17:37.686 --> 00:17:39.296
try to make this fit in the

00:17:39.296 --> 00:17:41.156
environment as much as possible.

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:43.806
So this whole app is only a few

00:17:43.806 --> 00:17:45.106
lines of code and really just

00:17:45.156 --> 00:17:48.096
involves loading in the cubes,

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:49.896
loading in the meshes, and

00:17:49.896 --> 00:17:52.016
telling RealityKit where I want

00:17:52.016 --> 00:17:52.406
them to be.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:54.406
And that's that.

[ Applause ]

00:18:02.466 --> 00:18:03.826
So next I'd like to invite Tyler

00:18:03.826 --> 00:18:06.016
on the stage to dive deeper into

00:18:06.016 --> 00:18:07.426
RealityKit and talk more about

00:18:07.426 --> 00:18:07.806
how it works.

00:18:08.516 --> 00:18:11.836
[ Applause ]

00:18:12.336 --> 00:18:12.876
>> Thanks, Cody.

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:16.266
I'm Tyler Casella and I'll be

00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:17.366
walking you through some of the

00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:19.336
features available in RealityKit

00:18:19.336 --> 00:18:20.266
and Reality Composer.

00:18:21.576 --> 00:18:23.346
Let's dive right into it by

00:18:24.026 --> 00:18:25.056
looking at what you'll need to

00:18:25.056 --> 00:18:26.976
get started with your AR

00:18:26.976 --> 00:18:27.566
application.

00:18:33.796 --> 00:18:35.336
So as Cody showed you earlier,

00:18:35.526 --> 00:18:37.006
RealityKit uses the entity

00:18:37.006 --> 00:18:38.566
component design pattern to

00:18:38.566 --> 00:18:40.126
build objects within the world.

00:18:41.026 --> 00:18:42.476
Entities establish the structure

00:18:42.476 --> 00:18:43.696
of your scene and build out a

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:45.206
transform hierarchy so that it's

00:18:45.206 --> 00:18:46.246
easier for you to reason about

00:18:46.246 --> 00:18:47.596
objects within their local

00:18:47.596 --> 00:18:48.076
space.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:49.846
Now if you're not familiar with

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:50.916
the entity component design

00:18:50.916 --> 00:18:52.386
pattern, it's no problem, it's

00:18:52.386 --> 00:18:53.806
actually pretty straightforward

00:18:55.456 --> 00:18:56.266
to use.

00:18:56.266 --> 00:18:58.066
Entities themselves are actually

00:18:58.066 --> 00:18:59.076
comprised of many different

00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:00.726
pieces called components.

00:19:01.066 --> 00:19:02.526
And components defined to be the

00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:04.996
specific behaviors and data that

00:19:04.996 --> 00:19:06.296
can be added to individual

00:19:06.296 --> 00:19:06.866
entities.

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:08.986
Now, unlike strictly

00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:10.926
inheritance-based patterns,

00:19:10.956 --> 00:19:12.286
using entities and components

00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:13.936
allows you to greater use of

00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:17.246
code and more flexibility.

00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:19.766
It actually also provides huge

00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:21.026
performance benefits under the

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.736
hood, both in terms of memory

00:19:22.736 --> 00:19:24.126
layout and multithreading.

00:19:24.406 --> 00:19:26.176
So to help illustrate entity and

00:19:26.176 --> 00:19:27.406
components, let's take a look at

00:19:27.406 --> 00:19:28.006
an example.

00:19:28.946 --> 00:19:31.256
So let's say for example we have

00:19:31.256 --> 00:19:32.576
a couple of object types that we

00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:33.576
commonly use within our

00:19:33.576 --> 00:19:35.906
application, like a ball, lamp,

00:19:35.906 --> 00:19:36.696
and camera.

00:19:37.346 --> 00:19:39.316
Now there's often many pieces of

00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:41.106
behavior that are shared across

00:19:41.106 --> 00:19:41.696
all of them.

00:19:42.296 --> 00:19:43.276
Let's take for example,

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:43.946
anchoring.

00:19:44.776 --> 00:19:46.416
All of these objects need to be

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:48.026
anchored within the world, and

00:19:48.026 --> 00:19:49.126
so we can add an anchoring

00:19:49.126 --> 00:19:52.306
component to all of them.

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:53.726
Now since both the ball and the

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:55.136
lamp has-- have a visual

00:19:55.136 --> 00:19:57.066
representation, we can add a

00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:59.096
model component to both of them

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:00.966
but we omit it from the camera

00:20:01.136 --> 00:20:02.066
because it's invisible.

00:20:03.046 --> 00:20:03.466
And this is where the

00:20:03.466 --> 00:20:05.046
compositional aspect of entity

00:20:05.046 --> 00:20:06.206
component design starts to

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:07.136
become really powerful.

00:20:08.126 --> 00:20:09.906
Now, to allow objects to collide

00:20:09.906 --> 00:20:11.326
with each other, we can add a

00:20:11.326 --> 00:20:13.456
collision component to them, and

00:20:13.456 --> 00:20:14.576
then we continue this until we

00:20:14.576 --> 00:20:15.716
have the combination that

00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:17.026
exhibits the behavior that we're

00:20:17.026 --> 00:20:17.596
looking for.

00:20:18.306 --> 00:20:19.226
And you'll notice that all of

00:20:19.226 --> 00:20:21.536
these objects behave in very

00:20:21.536 --> 00:20:22.346
unique ways.

00:20:22.766 --> 00:20:23.906
But by structuring your code in

00:20:23.906 --> 00:20:25.346
this manner, you're able to

00:20:25.346 --> 00:20:27.446
avoid duplicating code and reuse

00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:27.956
behavior.

00:20:28.606 --> 00:20:31.386
So here we can see how entities

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.276
look in code.

00:20:32.806 --> 00:20:34.516
An entity itself doesn't take

00:20:34.516 --> 00:20:36.166
any parameters to create, but

00:20:36.396 --> 00:20:37.956
once you have an entity, you can

00:20:37.956 --> 00:20:39.356
start adding components to it

00:20:39.496 --> 00:20:40.906
using the subscript operator.

00:20:41.756 --> 00:20:43.636
And in the same manner, you're

00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:44.936
able to remove and modify

00:20:44.936 --> 00:20:46.426
components on these entities.

00:20:47.066 --> 00:20:48.216
This allows you to dynamically

00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:49.996
modify the behavior of an

00:20:49.996 --> 00:20:50.376
entity.

00:20:51.006 --> 00:20:53.666
Now all entities also contain

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:55.136
children on them and you can add

00:20:55.136 --> 00:20:56.816
a child using the addChild

00:20:56.816 --> 00:20:57.246
method.

00:20:58.196 --> 00:21:01.876
And with this hierarchy, setting

00:21:01.876 --> 00:21:03.156
entities position, you're

00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:04.966
defining its position relative

00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:05.686
to its parent.

00:21:06.626 --> 00:21:07.736
Now if you're interested in its

00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:09.256
position in the world, you can

00:21:09.256 --> 00:21:11.556
use the set position relative to

00:21:11.716 --> 00:21:14.316
method and define nil as that

00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:15.076
relative entity.

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:16.756
And this indicates you want

00:21:16.756 --> 00:21:17.506
world space.

00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:19.906
Now we also understand

00:21:19.906 --> 00:21:21.096
developers just want to get

00:21:21.096 --> 00:21:21.986
started building their

00:21:21.986 --> 00:21:23.586
applications, so we provide a

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:25.126
number of useful variations of

00:21:25.126 --> 00:21:27.066
entities that come preconfigured

00:21:27.226 --> 00:21:28.116
and ready to use.

00:21:28.886 --> 00:21:30.136
These cover all of the common

00:21:30.136 --> 00:21:31.866
usages such as establishing

00:21:31.866 --> 00:21:34.466
anchoring, adding visual content

00:21:34.466 --> 00:21:36.446
to your scene or dynamic lights.

00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:38.446
And by instantiating any of

00:21:38.446 --> 00:21:40.456
these entities, all of the

00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:41.836
necessary components come

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:43.466
preconfigured and ready to use.

00:21:43.926 --> 00:21:45.006
So let's take a look at some of

00:21:45.006 --> 00:21:46.106
these entities and how you can

00:21:46.106 --> 00:21:46.536
use them.

00:21:47.336 --> 00:21:48.836
The first of which is

00:21:48.836 --> 00:21:49.596
AnchorEntity.

00:21:50.246 --> 00:21:51.476
And this is our glue to the real

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:52.906
world and often the first thing

00:21:52.906 --> 00:21:53.426
that you're going to be

00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:54.626
establishing within your AR

00:21:54.626 --> 00:21:55.256
application.

00:21:56.456 --> 00:21:57.656
AnchorEntity-- With

00:21:57.656 --> 00:21:59.336
AnchorEntity, you specify what

00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:00.726
it should be anchored to within

00:22:00.726 --> 00:22:01.306
the real world.

00:22:01.726 --> 00:22:03.326
And as that object moves in your

00:22:03.326 --> 00:22:04.966
environment, the AnchorEntity is

00:22:04.966 --> 00:22:06.266
going to stay attached to it.

00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:08.036
And because of this, the

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.416
AnchorEntity is often going to

00:22:09.416 --> 00:22:11.326
be the root of your experience

00:22:11.486 --> 00:22:12.636
and then additional content is

00:22:12.696 --> 00:22:15.686
built on top of it.

00:22:15.946 --> 00:22:17.446
AnchorEntity supports all of the

00:22:17.446 --> 00:22:19.176
anchor types available within

00:22:19.176 --> 00:22:19.616
ARKit.

00:22:20.076 --> 00:22:21.046
This allows you to quickly get

00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:22.156
your content into the real

00:22:22.156 --> 00:22:22.556
world.

00:22:22.876 --> 00:22:24.636
For instance, you can specify an

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:26.346
image or an object that your

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:28.376
content should be glued to, and

00:22:28.376 --> 00:22:29.656
then upon detecting that anchor

00:22:29.746 --> 00:22:31.136
that matches your specification,

00:22:31.566 --> 00:22:32.606
it'll automatically become

00:22:32.606 --> 00:22:33.616
attached and appear in the

00:22:33.616 --> 00:22:33.956
world.

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:37.006
And if you already have an AR

00:22:37.006 --> 00:22:39.076
anchor or an AR raycast result,

00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:40.926
you can anchor to that directly

00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:41.486
as well.

00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:43.576
So let's take a look at how you

00:22:43.576 --> 00:22:45.096
can create anchor entities in

00:22:45.096 --> 00:22:45.446
code.

00:22:46.506 --> 00:22:47.956
Now when you're creating anchor

00:22:47.956 --> 00:22:49.926
entities, you're describing what

00:22:49.926 --> 00:22:51.156
you would like to be anchored

00:22:51.156 --> 00:22:51.406
to.

00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:53.426
So here I'm describing, I would

00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:54.576
like this AnchorEntity to be

00:22:54.576 --> 00:22:56.366
attached to a horizontal plane

00:22:56.816 --> 00:22:58.146
that has a classification of

00:22:58.146 --> 00:23:00.506
table and has a minimum bounds

00:23:00.506 --> 00:23:02.356
of half a meter by half a meter.

00:23:02.886 --> 00:23:05.916
Next, we add that anchor to the

00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:08.066
ARView scene and once added to

00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:09.816
the scene, the anchor doesn't

00:23:09.816 --> 00:23:10.866
necessarily immediately become

00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:11.286
active.

00:23:12.026 --> 00:23:13.576
Remember, if ARKit hasn't

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:15.216
detected an anchor that matches

00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:16.806
that specification, it will

00:23:16.806 --> 00:23:17.716
remain inactive.

00:23:18.526 --> 00:23:19.836
And then once we do detect an

00:23:19.836 --> 00:23:22.056
anchor that matches it, both the

00:23:22.056 --> 00:23:23.176
AnchorEntity and all of its

00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:25.126
sub-entities will become active.

00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:28.446
Now although AnchorEntity is

00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:29.726
often the root entity of your

00:23:29.726 --> 00:23:31.616
experience, there are situations

00:23:31.616 --> 00:23:32.706
in which you're going to want

00:23:32.706 --> 00:23:33.696
multiple of them.

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.376
Take this for example where I

00:23:36.376 --> 00:23:37.666
have content that I would like

00:23:37.706 --> 00:23:39.506
to be anchored to a table, but

00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:40.936
also separate content, I would

00:23:40.936 --> 00:23:42.406
like to be anchored to an image.

00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:44.596
These all exist within the same

00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:46.616
scene but I have two different

00:23:46.616 --> 00:23:48.566
real-world objects that content

00:23:48.566 --> 00:23:49.616
is being glued to.

00:23:51.186 --> 00:23:52.216
Now once you've established what

00:23:52.216 --> 00:23:53.236
you want your content to be

00:23:53.236 --> 00:23:54.566
attached to, the next is

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:55.756
actually getting content in

00:23:55.756 --> 00:23:55.966
there.

00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:57.416
And that's where ModelEntity

00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:58.306
comes into the picture.

00:23:58.496 --> 00:23:59.856
And this is really the workhorse

00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:00.716
of RealityKit.

00:24:01.176 --> 00:24:02.106
This is what you're going to

00:24:02.106 --> 00:24:03.566
find yourself using very often.

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:05.836
ModelEntity comes with all the

00:24:05.836 --> 00:24:07.176
building blocks that you need to

00:24:07.176 --> 00:24:09.156
integrate physics, animation,

00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:10.726
and rendering in the virtual

00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:11.026
world.

00:24:11.896 --> 00:24:13.566
In entity component terms, a

00:24:13.566 --> 00:24:15.266
ModelEntity is an entity with a

00:24:15.266 --> 00:24:16.776
model component, a physics

00:24:16.776 --> 00:24:18.176
component, and a collision

00:24:18.176 --> 00:24:18.676
component.

00:24:18.676 --> 00:24:20.246
And these entities can be

00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:22.136
created dynamically in code or

00:24:22.136 --> 00:24:23.706
you can load them directly from

00:24:23.706 --> 00:24:25.316
USDZ or Reality File.

00:24:25.946 --> 00:24:28.236
So here we're loading a

00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:30.116
ModelEntity from a file and

00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:31.036
you'll notice that we make the

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:32.656
load very explicit with the

00:24:32.656 --> 00:24:33.546
loadModel call.

00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:35.506
This is so that you're always

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:36.556
aware when you're doing

00:24:36.556 --> 00:24:37.586
something that's potentially

00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:38.736
heavyweight and could be

00:24:38.736 --> 00:24:39.906
blocking the render thread.

00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:41.516
And in all of these cases we

00:24:41.516 --> 00:24:42.736
provide you asynchronous

00:24:42.736 --> 00:24:44.766
variants to address that, which

00:24:44.766 --> 00:24:45.786
we'll cover in later-- in a

00:24:45.786 --> 00:24:46.416
later session.

00:24:47.636 --> 00:24:49.106
Now once your model is loaded,

00:24:49.106 --> 00:24:50.506
you simply attach it to your

00:24:50.506 --> 00:24:51.836
anchor and you're good to go.

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:53.176
As soon as that anchor is

00:24:53.176 --> 00:24:54.566
detected, your model will show

00:24:54.566 --> 00:24:55.666
up in the world and remain

00:24:55.666 --> 00:24:56.116
attached.

00:24:56.546 --> 00:24:59.156
Now let's take a look at the

00:24:59.156 --> 00:25:01.206
actual anatomy of a ModelEntity.

00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:03.456
The first item every ModelEntity

00:25:03.456 --> 00:25:05.456
contains is a mesh resource,

00:25:05.966 --> 00:25:07.136
which provides the geometric

00:25:07.136 --> 00:25:09.036
representation of the model.

00:25:10.486 --> 00:25:11.636
Mesh resources can either be

00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:12.936
generated directly as a

00:25:12.936 --> 00:25:14.536
primitive or the result of

00:25:14.536 --> 00:25:16.506
loading from a USDZ or Reality

00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:16.856
File.

00:25:17.426 --> 00:25:19.786
And because meshes are often

00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:21.266
heavyweight, they can be shared

00:25:21.266 --> 00:25:22.926
across multiple entities and

00:25:22.926 --> 00:25:24.386
this also allows us to optimize

00:25:24.386 --> 00:25:25.886
our rendering to match draw

00:25:25.886 --> 00:25:27.156
calls together under the hood.

00:25:28.606 --> 00:25:29.656
Now if you're not getting your

00:25:29.656 --> 00:25:31.526
mesh from a file, you can also

00:25:31.786 --> 00:25:32.906
generate them directly from a

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:34.246
concise set of primitives.

00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:37.036
This includes boxes, spheres,

00:25:37.316 --> 00:25:39.176
planes, and texts which supports

00:25:39.176 --> 00:25:41.206
all of the fonts on our

00:25:42.296 --> 00:25:42.586
platform.

00:25:42.626 --> 00:25:43.936
Now although mesh has defined

00:25:43.936 --> 00:25:45.096
the geometric structure of a

00:25:45.096 --> 00:25:46.696
model, you still need a way to

00:25:46.696 --> 00:25:48.346
define how a model should look.

00:25:48.886 --> 00:25:50.106
And this is where materials come

00:25:50.106 --> 00:25:50.526
into play.

00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:52.966
Materials provide the look and

00:25:53.016 --> 00:25:54.566
feel of an object and how it

00:25:54.566 --> 00:25:55.936
interacts with the light around

00:25:56.516 --> 00:25:56.586
it.

00:25:59.566 --> 00:26:00.856
Now RealityKit provides

00:26:00.856 --> 00:26:01.866
rendering that's physically

00:26:01.866 --> 00:26:03.516
based, which means we simulate

00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:05.056
how light actually behaves in

00:26:05.056 --> 00:26:06.736
the real world, to help ensure

00:26:06.736 --> 00:26:07.466
that it's going to blend

00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:08.396
seamlessly within it.

00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:10.646
And materials customize how an

00:26:10.646 --> 00:26:12.266
object participates within the

00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:12.916
simulation.

00:26:14.126 --> 00:26:15.046
Materials can either be

00:26:15.046 --> 00:26:16.166
predefined when you load a

00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:18.106
ModelEntity or you can create a

00:26:18.106 --> 00:26:19.436
material yourself with some of

00:26:19.436 --> 00:26:20.276
the material types that we

00:26:20.276 --> 00:26:21.686
provide in RealityKit which we

00:26:21.686 --> 00:26:23.026
can take a look at.

00:26:23.736 --> 00:26:25.286
The first of these is

00:26:25.286 --> 00:26:26.096
SimpleMaterial.

00:26:26.906 --> 00:26:28.606
Now typically a physically-based

00:26:28.606 --> 00:26:29.916
material has a lot of

00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:31.406
parameters, and that's because

00:26:31.406 --> 00:26:32.536
lighting in the real world is

00:26:32.596 --> 00:26:33.426
really complex.

00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:35.536
Now SimpleMaterial condenses

00:26:35.576 --> 00:26:36.896
these into a concise set of

00:26:36.896 --> 00:26:38.606
parameters that take either

00:26:38.606 --> 00:26:40.866
scalar inputs or a texture if

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:42.436
you want to vary an input across

00:26:42.436 --> 00:26:43.106
a surface.

00:26:44.796 --> 00:26:46.446
Simple material allows you to

00:26:46.446 --> 00:26:49.076
create a glossy plastic or a

00:26:49.126 --> 00:26:51.086
brushed metal or even a tinted

00:26:51.086 --> 00:26:51.546
glass.

00:26:52.266 --> 00:26:53.696
And you can do this with the

00:26:53.696 --> 00:26:54.846
three main properties,

00:26:55.266 --> 00:26:57.366
basecolor, roughness, and

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:57.776
metallic.

00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:00.676
As the name implies, basecolor

00:27:00.676 --> 00:27:02.236
establishes the overall color of

00:27:02.236 --> 00:27:03.766
the material, allowing you to

00:27:03.766 --> 00:27:05.406
change an object from red to

00:27:05.406 --> 00:27:06.436
blue for example.

00:27:07.536 --> 00:27:09.426
And a metallic parameter itself

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:10.596
actually simulates how

00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:12.716
conductive that material is and

00:27:12.716 --> 00:27:14.006
affects how the light interacts

00:27:14.006 --> 00:27:14.826
with that surface.

00:27:16.066 --> 00:27:17.786
So, having a metallic value of

00:27:17.876 --> 00:27:19.406
zero indicates that it's a poor

00:27:19.406 --> 00:27:19.966
conductor.

00:27:19.966 --> 00:27:21.006
And this actually means that

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:22.526
light tends to transmit into

00:27:22.526 --> 00:27:24.486
that surface making the color of

00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:25.926
the subsurface dominate the

00:27:25.926 --> 00:27:26.556
appearance.

00:27:27.806 --> 00:27:29.406
Now if we up that parameter to

00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:31.856
1.0, this indicates it's a good

00:27:31.856 --> 00:27:33.326
conductor which causes an

00:27:33.326 --> 00:27:34.826
immediate reemission of light at

00:27:34.826 --> 00:27:35.596
the surface level.

00:27:35.596 --> 00:27:36.686
And this is what gives it that

00:27:36.686 --> 00:27:37.376
metallic look.

00:27:38.636 --> 00:27:39.776
And the roughness parameter

00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:41.666
affects that perceived roughness

00:27:41.666 --> 00:27:43.516
of the object and how reflective

00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:44.816
the surface appears.

00:27:48.786 --> 00:27:50.286
Now we also have unlit material,

00:27:50.546 --> 00:27:52.166
which also provides coloring of

00:27:52.166 --> 00:27:53.616
an object, but unlike

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:55.346
SimpleMaterial, it does not

00:27:55.346 --> 00:27:56.336
participate within the

00:27:56.336 --> 00:27:57.706
physically-based rendering and

00:27:57.706 --> 00:27:59.066
is unaffected by the lights in

00:27:59.066 --> 00:27:59.496
the scene.

00:28:00.276 --> 00:28:01.896
So this gives it an overall flat

00:28:02.006 --> 00:28:02.416
coloring.

00:28:03.176 --> 00:28:05.016
This is often useful for text or

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.356
any content that should remain

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.926
bright, even when the

00:28:07.956 --> 00:28:08.826
environment is dark.

00:28:09.856 --> 00:28:11.246
So here we can see an example of

00:28:11.246 --> 00:28:12.146
that in usage.

00:28:12.586 --> 00:28:13.876
Here I placed a virtual

00:28:13.876 --> 00:28:14.946
television within the

00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:16.586
environment and I've used

00:28:16.586 --> 00:28:18.516
SimpleMaterial for the TV box,

00:28:18.806 --> 00:28:20.396
but unlit material for the

00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:21.286
actual screen.

00:28:21.916 --> 00:28:23.116
And you'll see as I turn off the

00:28:23.116 --> 00:28:25.496
lights, the TV dims but the

00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:27.146
screen remains bright, and this

00:28:27.146 --> 00:28:28.326
is because it's unaffected by

00:28:28.326 --> 00:28:29.246
the environment's lighting.

00:28:31.106 --> 00:28:32.676
Both SimpleMaterial and unlit

00:28:32.676 --> 00:28:34.276
material allow for a wide range

00:28:34.326 --> 00:28:36.276
of appearances but RealityKit

00:28:36.276 --> 00:28:37.916
also provides a third material

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.386
that behaves very different but

00:28:39.386 --> 00:28:41.016
it's just as important and

00:28:41.016 --> 00:28:42.276
that's OcclusionMaterial.

00:28:43.646 --> 00:28:44.816
Now instead of affecting in

00:28:44.816 --> 00:28:45.886
object's appearance,

00:28:46.106 --> 00:28:47.946
OcclusionMaterial instead masks

00:28:47.946 --> 00:28:49.976
any objects behind it and falls

00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:51.336
back to the camera pass through.

00:28:52.186 --> 00:28:53.076
This gives the appearance of

00:28:53.076 --> 00:28:54.966
objects moving behind real-world

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:55.556
objects.

00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:58.486
So here we can see common usage

00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.006
in which I've created a plane on

00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:01.656
top of the real-world table and

00:29:02.576 --> 00:29:03.496
then I've applied that

00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:04.706
OcclusionMaterial to it.

00:29:05.516 --> 00:29:07.006
This gives the illusion that the

00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:08.466
object is coming up out of the

00:29:08.466 --> 00:29:08.886
table.

00:29:08.886 --> 00:29:10.076
And you may have noticed this

00:29:10.076 --> 00:29:11.636
during Cody's demo as well.

00:29:12.986 --> 00:29:15.186
Now if you don't do this, it can

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.476
often be difficult to gauge the

00:29:16.476 --> 00:29:18.016
position of an object and can

00:29:18.016 --> 00:29:19.216
really break that immersive

00:29:19.276 --> 00:29:20.956
experience for the user.

00:29:21.546 --> 00:29:24.306
So these cover basic building

00:29:24.306 --> 00:29:25.746
blocks of ModelEntity, and we

00:29:25.746 --> 00:29:26.786
can take a quick look of how you

00:29:26.786 --> 00:29:28.596
can use mesh resource and

00:29:28.596 --> 00:29:30.266
materials in code.

00:29:31.046 --> 00:29:33.186
Here we're generating a box mesh

00:29:33.666 --> 00:29:34.566
and all of our calls to

00:29:34.566 --> 00:29:35.696
dynamically generate mesh

00:29:35.696 --> 00:29:37.406
resources, use the generate

00:29:37.406 --> 00:29:38.366
prefix convention.

00:29:38.716 --> 00:29:39.696
And this is again to make sure

00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:40.786
it's clear that work is being

00:29:40.786 --> 00:29:43.146
done under the hood.

00:29:43.416 --> 00:29:44.286
Now since materials are

00:29:44.286 --> 00:29:45.596
lightweight and fast to

00:29:45.596 --> 00:29:47.126
initialize, they can be created

00:29:47.126 --> 00:29:48.426
directly from their initializer.

00:29:49.766 --> 00:29:51.116
And once you have both your mesh

00:29:51.116 --> 00:29:52.626
and your material, you simply

00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:54.356
create a ModelEntity and pass

00:29:54.386 --> 00:29:54.866
these along.

00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:58.356
And with this, you have your

00:29:58.356 --> 00:29:59.646
basic building block from which

00:29:59.646 --> 00:30:00.646
you can begin building the

00:30:00.646 --> 00:30:02.176
visual content within your AR

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:02.866
experience.

00:30:03.526 --> 00:30:04.606
But if you really want to bring

00:30:04.606 --> 00:30:05.996
it to life, you're going to want

00:30:05.996 --> 00:30:07.476
to add animation as well.

00:30:07.476 --> 00:30:09.636
And as Cody showed you,

00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:11.456
RealityKit supports two primary

00:30:11.456 --> 00:30:14.136
forms of animation, skeletal and

00:30:14.136 --> 00:30:15.286
transform animations.

00:30:16.296 --> 00:30:17.306
These can both be loaded from

00:30:17.306 --> 00:30:19.166
file but transform animations

00:30:19.166 --> 00:30:20.506
can also be created directly

00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:21.416
within RealityKit.

00:30:21.906 --> 00:30:25.186
Both types of animations can be

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:26.666
played from the playAnimation

00:30:26.666 --> 00:30:28.276
method on all entities.

00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:30.006
And when you play an animation,

00:30:30.126 --> 00:30:31.706
you're given back an animation

00:30:31.706 --> 00:30:32.646
controller object.

00:30:33.606 --> 00:30:34.796
This controller allows you to

00:30:34.796 --> 00:30:36.186
control the playback of the

00:30:36.186 --> 00:30:36.806
animation.

00:30:37.706 --> 00:30:39.166
So with it, you can pause a

00:30:39.166 --> 00:30:40.896
playing animation to maintain

00:30:40.896 --> 00:30:42.616
its current timing, or you can

00:30:42.616 --> 00:30:43.616
check the current state of the

00:30:43.616 --> 00:30:46.186
animation and resume it, or even

00:30:46.466 --> 00:30:47.386
stop the animation.

00:30:47.386 --> 00:30:50.736
Now if you don't have any

00:30:50.736 --> 00:30:51.766
animations baked into your

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:53.376
assets directly, you can still

00:30:53.376 --> 00:30:54.626
animate your entities with the

00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:55.576
move to function.

00:30:56.786 --> 00:30:58.016
With this, you first provide the

00:30:58.016 --> 00:30:59.266
transform that you'd like to

00:30:59.266 --> 00:31:00.676
animate to, and here we're

00:31:00.676 --> 00:31:02.676
moving 5 meters forward.

00:31:03.126 --> 00:31:04.936
And then you optionally define

00:31:05.226 --> 00:31:07.176
the relative space that

00:31:07.176 --> 00:31:08.006
transform is in.

00:31:08.316 --> 00:31:09.736
Here it's in the world space, so

00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:10.536
I provide nil.

00:31:12.216 --> 00:31:13.376
Next you provide the duration

00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:14.396
that you'd like the animation to

00:31:14.396 --> 00:31:16.226
take place, and then the easing

00:31:16.226 --> 00:31:17.706
function to define how smooth

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:19.116
that animation should be from

00:31:19.116 --> 00:31:19.876
start to finish.

00:31:20.266 --> 00:31:21.486
And with that, you've created a

00:31:21.486 --> 00:31:23.016
simple transform animation.

00:31:23.646 --> 00:31:27.186
So by combining all of these

00:31:27.186 --> 00:31:29.746
together, RealityKit focuses on

00:31:29.746 --> 00:31:31.086
enabling you to build AR

00:31:31.086 --> 00:31:31.856
experiences.

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:33.656
And this year, in addition to a

00:31:33.656 --> 00:31:35.126
new framework, we're also

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.426
introducing a new tool to

00:31:36.426 --> 00:31:37.906
accompany your AR development

00:31:37.906 --> 00:31:39.506
workflow, and that's Reality

00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:40.026
Composer.

00:31:40.616 --> 00:31:43.396
We're introducing Reality

00:31:43.396 --> 00:31:45.146
Composer for both macOS

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.976
available in Xcode 11, in iPad

00:31:47.976 --> 00:31:49.636
and iPhone available in the App

00:31:49.636 --> 00:31:49.986
Store.

00:31:51.126 --> 00:31:52.286
And with Reality Composer, we're

00:31:52.286 --> 00:31:53.876
really focusing on helping iOS

00:31:53.906 --> 00:31:56.626
developers to easily create AR

00:31:56.626 --> 00:31:58.166
and 3D experiences.

00:31:58.896 --> 00:32:00.486
We know that moving to 3D can be

00:32:00.486 --> 00:32:01.916
a really daunting task, and with

00:32:01.916 --> 00:32:03.096
Reality Composer we want you to

00:32:03.096 --> 00:32:04.626
feel right at home building out

00:32:04.626 --> 00:32:05.606
your AR scenes.

00:32:06.416 --> 00:32:07.386
There's a number of features

00:32:07.386 --> 00:32:08.366
that we've integrated into the

00:32:08.366 --> 00:32:09.616
tool to help you with this,

00:32:09.686 --> 00:32:10.646
which we can dive into.

00:32:11.266 --> 00:32:13.356
Now one of the first things that

00:32:13.356 --> 00:32:14.306
you tackle when you're starting

00:32:14.306 --> 00:32:15.936
a new project is often simply

00:32:15.936 --> 00:32:17.046
just getting stuff into the

00:32:17.046 --> 00:32:17.436
world.

00:32:17.746 --> 00:32:18.696
And we wanted to make sure this

00:32:18.696 --> 00:32:20.446
was easy, by already providing

00:32:20.446 --> 00:32:21.846
you a set of content that you

00:32:21.846 --> 00:32:23.596
can either directly integrate

00:32:23.596 --> 00:32:25.596
into your scene or you can use

00:32:25.596 --> 00:32:27.126
as a placeholder until you land

00:32:27.126 --> 00:32:28.066
your final content.

00:32:28.886 --> 00:32:30.126
This library ranges from simple

00:32:30.126 --> 00:32:32.376
shapes to common objects to even

00:32:32.416 --> 00:32:33.246
large buildings.

00:32:33.796 --> 00:32:36.516
And these aren't static assets

00:32:36.516 --> 00:32:36.916
either.

00:32:37.256 --> 00:32:38.596
Here we have a spiral shape,

00:32:39.336 --> 00:32:40.256
which provides a number of

00:32:40.256 --> 00:32:41.556
parameters that give you a

00:32:41.556 --> 00:32:42.936
flexible range of creativity.

00:32:43.276 --> 00:32:44.526
Here I'm able to take it and

00:32:44.526 --> 00:32:46.176
extrude it and compress it and

00:32:46.656 --> 00:32:48.526
then apply an aluminum material

00:32:48.526 --> 00:32:49.826
to it to really give it the look

00:32:49.826 --> 00:32:51.216
and feel of a metal spring.

00:32:51.806 --> 00:32:54.876
And we provide rich models as

00:32:54.876 --> 00:32:56.126
well that you can integrate your

00:32:56.126 --> 00:32:57.966
own content into directly, such

00:32:57.966 --> 00:32:58.826
as this picture frame.

00:32:59.556 --> 00:33:00.856
Here I'm able to pick a photo

00:33:01.126 --> 00:33:02.606
and then place it within it and

00:33:02.806 --> 00:33:03.956
then pick and choose a different

00:33:03.956 --> 00:33:05.496
frame that matches the style of

00:33:05.536 --> 00:33:06.476
the experience that I'm

00:33:06.476 --> 00:33:06.836
building.

00:33:07.336 --> 00:33:10.446
Reality Composer also gives you

00:33:10.446 --> 00:33:11.876
a "what you see is what you get"

00:33:12.276 --> 00:33:14.166
environment, making it easy for

00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.726
you to lay out and pre-visualize

00:33:15.726 --> 00:33:17.296
your scenes, as you're building

00:33:17.296 --> 00:33:17.416
it.

00:33:18.176 --> 00:33:19.316
Here I'm able to duplicate the

00:33:19.316 --> 00:33:21.246
row of pawns and swap out their

00:33:21.246 --> 00:33:22.616
appearance to build out the

00:33:22.616 --> 00:33:24.056
other side of the chessboard.

00:33:24.616 --> 00:33:28.566
And a big part of

00:33:28.566 --> 00:33:30.026
pre-visualization is actually

00:33:30.026 --> 00:33:31.616
seeing your content in AR so

00:33:31.846 --> 00:33:32.876
that you can ensure that it's

00:33:32.876 --> 00:33:34.896
correctly scaled and fits well

00:33:34.956 --> 00:33:36.386
within that real-world

00:33:36.386 --> 00:33:37.036
environment.

00:33:37.606 --> 00:33:41.066
Now reality composer also allows

00:33:41.066 --> 00:33:42.066
you to add behavior into your

00:33:42.066 --> 00:33:43.696
scene and provide simple

00:33:43.696 --> 00:33:45.026
interactions that help bring

00:33:45.026 --> 00:33:46.486
that AR experience to life.

00:33:46.836 --> 00:33:47.766
So let's walk through a quick

00:33:47.766 --> 00:33:48.286
example.

00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:50.726
Here I've got a chessboard that

00:33:50.846 --> 00:33:52.246
I'd like to make an interaction

00:33:52.326 --> 00:33:54.326
in, where I'd like to make it so

00:33:54.326 --> 00:33:55.956
that when I tap the black rook

00:33:55.956 --> 00:33:57.586
at the top, it will move over

00:33:57.586 --> 00:33:58.796
and put the king into check

00:33:58.796 --> 00:33:58.986
mate.

00:34:00.016 --> 00:34:01.506
So my first step is to open up

00:34:01.546 --> 00:34:04.046
the behavior panel and add a new

00:34:04.046 --> 00:34:04.536
behavior.

00:34:06.056 --> 00:34:07.236
Now there's a number of

00:34:07.276 --> 00:34:08.746
predefined behaviors provided,

00:34:08.956 --> 00:34:10.466
so I'll go ahead and pick tap to

00:34:10.466 --> 00:34:10.726
flip.

00:34:11.946 --> 00:34:12.856
Now, this gives me a tap

00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:14.255
trigger, which will cause a

00:34:14.255 --> 00:34:15.545
sequence of actions to play,

00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:17.226
which currently plays an

00:34:17.226 --> 00:34:19.025
emphasis animation on my rook.

00:34:19.985 --> 00:34:21.176
For my interaction, I'm going to

00:34:21.176 --> 00:34:22.826
modify the motion type to

00:34:22.826 --> 00:34:24.436
instead be a jiggle instead of a

00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:24.735
flip.

00:34:26.216 --> 00:34:28.396
Next, I'll add a move by action

00:34:28.696 --> 00:34:30.856
to move that rook into place and

00:34:30.856 --> 00:34:32.306
I'll adjust my movement just

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:32.735
slightly.

00:34:33.806 --> 00:34:35.196
And now we're good to go and I

00:34:35.196 --> 00:34:36.525
can preview my interaction.

00:34:37.295 --> 00:34:39.235
Now when I tap on my rook, it

00:34:39.235 --> 00:34:40.856
does a little jiggle, and then

00:34:40.856 --> 00:34:42.136
it moves over to put the king

00:34:42.136 --> 00:34:42.696
into checkmate.

00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:48.485
[ Applause ]

00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:50.166
So with all of these features,

00:34:50.196 --> 00:34:51.676
we really wanted it to be easy

00:34:51.676 --> 00:34:52.896
for you to make great looking

00:34:52.896 --> 00:34:54.436
content ready to view and

00:34:54.436 --> 00:34:55.596
experience in AR.

00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:57.136
And all of these features that

00:34:57.136 --> 00:34:58.446
I've shown you here on the iPad

00:34:59.006 --> 00:35:02.266
are also available on macOS and

00:35:02.906 --> 00:35:03.056
iPhone.

00:35:03.656 --> 00:35:04.796
Now although Reality Composer

00:35:04.796 --> 00:35:06.266
runs as a separate application,

00:35:06.686 --> 00:35:08.026
it's tightly integrated within

00:35:08.026 --> 00:35:09.056
Xcode's development and

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:09.726
ecosystem.

00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:11.426
When building your Xcode

00:35:11.426 --> 00:35:13.906
project, the content within your

00:35:13.906 --> 00:35:15.966
project is integrated and

00:35:15.966 --> 00:35:17.696
optimized into your application.

00:35:18.276 --> 00:35:19.566
But there's some magic that

00:35:19.566 --> 00:35:21.186
happens in between building your

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:23.026
Xcode project and producing your

00:35:23.026 --> 00:35:23.676
application.

00:35:24.106 --> 00:35:25.306
And that's code generation.

00:35:26.536 --> 00:35:27.836
As part of this step, the

00:35:27.836 --> 00:35:29.206
content from your project is

00:35:29.206 --> 00:35:31.106
compiled and optimized into a

00:35:31.106 --> 00:35:31.896
Reality File.

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:34.656
And next we introspect that file

00:35:34.916 --> 00:35:36.616
and generate customized code for

00:35:36.616 --> 00:35:37.846
accessing objects that you've

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:39.226
created within your scene.

00:35:40.936 --> 00:35:42.186
Now this code generation step is

00:35:42.186 --> 00:35:43.656
performed automatically behind

00:35:43.656 --> 00:35:45.196
the scenes by Xcode and

00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:47.086
establishes a strongly typed

00:35:47.086 --> 00:35:48.526
access to the content within

00:35:48.526 --> 00:35:49.036
your scene.

00:35:49.686 --> 00:35:50.686
And this has the wonderful

00:35:50.686 --> 00:35:51.886
advantage that if there's any

00:35:51.886 --> 00:35:53.836
mismatches between the naming of

00:35:53.836 --> 00:35:55.286
the objects in your scene, you

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.156
get a compilation error instead

00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:58.316
of a runtime crash.

00:35:59.486 --> 00:36:01.136
Code generation also gives you

00:36:01.136 --> 00:36:03.176
direct access to invoke triggers

00:36:03.606 --> 00:36:04.796
within the behaviors of your

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:06.856
scene and create custom actions

00:36:06.856 --> 00:36:07.576
within your code.

00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:10.456
We feel that with this-- the

00:36:10.456 --> 00:36:11.776
experience of building content

00:36:11.776 --> 00:36:13.356
in Reality Composer and coding

00:36:13.356 --> 00:36:14.706
in Xcode is seamless.

00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:18.176
And that's a quick overview of

00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:19.076
Reality Composer.

00:36:19.366 --> 00:36:20.706
Now there's a ton more I'd love

00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:22.376
to show you, because we've

00:36:22.376 --> 00:36:23.496
really only covered the tip of

00:36:23.496 --> 00:36:24.286
the iceberg today.

00:36:24.876 --> 00:36:25.966
There's many other areas that I

00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:27.656
haven't tackled like networking,

00:36:27.656 --> 00:36:29.566
physics bodies, ray casting,

00:36:29.756 --> 00:36:31.516
gestures and more, so I

00:36:31.516 --> 00:36:32.596
encourage you to come to some of

00:36:32.596 --> 00:36:33.506
our other sessions.

00:36:34.556 --> 00:36:36.066
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m., we have

00:36:36.066 --> 00:36:37.346
the Building Apps with Reality

00:36:37.346 --> 00:36:38.796
Composer session, which is going

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.596
to showcase how to build an AR

00:36:40.596 --> 00:36:42.476
application which is multiplayer

00:36:42.696 --> 00:36:43.526
in RealityKit.

00:36:44.796 --> 00:36:46.556
And Thursday at 11:00 a.m., we

00:36:46.556 --> 00:36:48.136
have the building AR Experiences

00:36:48.136 --> 00:36:49.446
with Reality Composer session,

00:36:49.736 --> 00:36:50.996
which explores how you can

00:36:51.026 --> 00:36:52.776
integrate Reality Composer into

00:36:52.776 --> 00:36:54.466
your AR application workflow.

00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:56.346
And please come join us in the

00:36:56.346 --> 00:36:57.606
labs tomorrow at noon.

00:36:57.756 --> 00:36:58.646
We're happy to answer any

00:36:58.646 --> 00:37:00.026
questions you may have and help

00:37:00.056 --> 00:37:00.756
get you started.

00:37:01.306 --> 00:37:02.316
So thank you for coming.

00:37:02.656 --> 00:37:03.556
And I hope you have a great

00:37:03.556 --> 00:37:03.926
WWDC.
