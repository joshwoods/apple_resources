00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:08.876
>> Hello. Welcome to Creating a

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:10.206
Great Accessible Reading

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:10.836
Experience.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.016
My name is Darren Minifie, and

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.246
I'm an engineering manager on

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.256
the Accessibility Team.

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.456
The hallmark for a great

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:20.036
application is an outstanding

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:20.886
user interface.

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:22.906
This extends to the layout and

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:25.046
styling of text especially for

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:26.706
apps whose primary focus is the

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:28.196
presentation of long form

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:29.106
readable content.

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:31.766
To implement a custom text

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.476
layout you often need to turn to

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:34.836
lower level technologies such as

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:36.156
Core Text and TextKit.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.606
In this session, you will learn

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.396
the APIs and techniques you need

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:41.726
to create an equally great

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:43.106
accessible reading experience

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:43.866
for VoiceOver.

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:48.326
We'll begin by talking about the

00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:49.606
reading content protocol.

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:51.586
You use this protocol to make

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:53.076
your text content accessible.

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.436
Next, we'll talk about automatic

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:57.276
page turning, which VoiceOver

00:00:57.276 --> 00:00:58.796
uses to turn the pages in your

00:00:58.846 --> 00:00:59.476
application.

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.366
Finally, we'll discuss the APIs

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.226
you can use to customize the way

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:05.836
VoiceOver speaks your content.

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.966
In the session, we'll use the

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.076
following sample app to

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:12.386
demonstrate these techniques.

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:15.556
The app is a simple page-based

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:16.996
application where each page

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:19.256
consists of an image, a title, a

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:21.276
subtitle and some detail text.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.846
To make your app accessible, you

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.946
should first audit it with

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:26.586
VoiceOver.

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:29.556
A convenient way to do this is

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.576
to add VoiceOver to your

00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:31.746
accessibility shortcut.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.386
You can do this by launching

00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:36.306
settings, tapping accessibility,

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.366
scrolling down to accessibility

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.856
shortcut and tapping VoiceOver.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:43.746
Now depending on your hardware,

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.216
you can press the home button or

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:46.976
side button 3 times to quickly

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:48.456
enable and disable VoiceOver.

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:51.906
Let's see how VoiceOver

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:53.336
interacts with the sample app.

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:54.976
>> VoiceOver on.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.636
[ Beeping ]

00:01:58.136 --> 00:01:59.436
>> As I drag my finger across

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.956
the screen, VoiceOver plays a

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:02.596
sound effect indicating there is

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:03.766
no content to be found.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.506
Therefore, the first thing we

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:06.866
need to do is make our text

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:07.946
content accessible.

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:11.306
To make your content accessible,

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:12.236
you should use the

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.106
UIAccessibilityReadingContent

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:15.236
Protocol.

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:17.136
This protocol consists of 4 core

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:17.696
methods.

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:20.686
AccessibilityLineNumber(for

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.396
point asks you to return the

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:23.816
line number for a given touch

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:24.326
location.

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:26.606
AccessibilityContent

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:27.516
(forLineNumber and

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:28.516
accessibilityFrame

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.526
(forLineNumber asks for the text

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:32.166
content and rect for a given

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.126
line respectively.

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:34.986
Finally,

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:37.266
accessibilityPageContent asks

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:38.756
you to return the entire pages

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:39.586
worth of content.

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:42.826
Let's see how we would implement

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:42.893
the

00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:44.526
UIAccessibilityReadingContent

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:45.886
Protocol in our sample app.

00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:48.576
Each page in the sample app is

00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:50.006
represented by an instance of

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.016
SessionItemView.

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:54.926
This view has 4 sub views; an

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:57.676
image view, a title label, an

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.476
identifier label and a session

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.226
details view.

00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.976
We additionally declare a layout

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:04.336
enum.

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:05.816
This will help us in our method

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:07.126
implementations that follow.

00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:11.426
The first thing we need to do is

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:12.576
make our page view an

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:13.676
accessibility element.

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:15.356
We do this by setting

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:17.066
isAccessibilityElement to true

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.906
in the page views initializer.

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:23.536
Next, we begin to implement the

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.796
reading content protocol.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:26.456
Our first method is

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:27.836
accessibilityLineNumber(for

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:28.176
point.

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.676
First, we hitTest the page view

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:33.306
using the past in line number.

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:36.106
If the resulting view is one of

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:38.546
our known sub views, we map that

00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:41.086
to the value of our layout enum.

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:43.536
Finally, we return the rawValue

00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:44.846
as this is the representation

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:45.976
VoiceOver understands.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:49.966
Next to implement

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.196
AccessibilityContent

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.346
(forLineNumber, we begin by

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:54.936
instantiating an instance of the

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:55.576
layout enum.

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:57.606
We switch over the possible

00:03:57.606 --> 00:03:59.296
cases and map that to one of our

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.286
known sub views.

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:02.786
Finally, we return accessibility

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:04.406
label, which returns the text

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:05.186
for that sub view.

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:09.406
The implementation of

00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:10.476
accessibilityFrame

00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:12.006
(forLineNumber is very similar.

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:14.716
We begin by creating a new

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:16.466
instance of the layout enum with

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.685
our given raw value.

00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:19.875
We switch over the possible

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.646
cases and map that to one of our

00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:22.716
known sub views.

00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:25.366
Finally, we return accessibility

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.926
frame, which represents the rect

00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:27.886
for a given line.

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:31.936
Finally, to implement

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:34.196
accessibilityPageContent we

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:35.726
gather together the text from

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:37.176
our known sub views and return

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.346
them as a single string.

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.306
Let's see how the app interacts

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:44.556
with VoiceOver with the reading

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:46.306
content protocol implemented.

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:49.016
>> Accessible drag-and-drop.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:50.986
Session 241.

00:04:51.906 --> 00:04:53.356
Drag-and-drop is a powerful API

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:54.556
that allows apps to share and

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:55.376
communicate data.

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.486
>> This time as I drag my finger

00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:59.366
across the screen VoiceOver

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.636
speaks and highlights the

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:01.766
corresponding text.

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.516
Next let's talk about automatic

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:07.286
page turning.

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:09.356
When VoiceOver's read all

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:10.906
command is invoked, it's

00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:12.386
expected that VoiceOver will be

00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:13.836
able to read all of your content

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:14.956
from beginning to end.

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:16.916
This may require VoiceOver to

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.306
turn pages in your app.

00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:20.826
To implement automatic page

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.576
turning you need to adopt 2

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:23.936
accessibility APIs.

00:05:24.606 --> 00:05:26.076
First, you should include the

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.756
causesPageTurn accessibility

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:28.986
trait on your page view.

00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:31.396
Second, you should implement

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:32.696
AccessibilityScroll in

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:33.226
direction.

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:35.286
This gives VoiceOver the ability

00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:36.706
to turn pages in your app.

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:39.316
Let's see how we would implement

00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:40.626
automatic page turning in our

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:42.036
sample app.

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:44.736
First, we need to include the

00:05:44.736 --> 00:05:46.386
causesPageTurn accessibility

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:46.766
trait.

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:48.476
We do this by setting

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:50.036
accessibility trait in the page

00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:50.986
views initializer.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.496
Next, we implement

00:05:54.496 --> 00:05:55.736
accessibilityScroll and

00:05:55.736 --> 00:05:56.276
direction.

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.476
We do this by switching over the

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:00.096
possible cases of the direction

00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:00.616
parameter.

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:03.396
If the direction is previous or

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.136
left, we ask our delegate to

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:06.526
turn to the previous page.

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.906
If that's successful, we notify

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:10.616
VoiceOver with a pageScrolled

00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:11.396
notification.

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:16.196
Similarly, if the value is right

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:18.036
or next, we ask the delegate to

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:19.896
turn to the next page and if

00:06:19.896 --> 00:06:21.336
that's successful, we notify

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:22.746
VoiceOver with a pageScrolled

00:06:22.746 --> 00:06:23.536
notification.

00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:28.846
Let's see how the app interacts

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:30.246
with automatic page turning

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:31.086

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.376
Session 236.

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:56.026
>> Our final topic is

00:06:56.026 --> 00:06:57.166
customizing speech.

00:06:57.796 --> 00:06:59.146
You may want to control the way

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:00.556
VoiceOver speaks your app's

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:01.046
content.

00:07:01.706 --> 00:07:03.266
To do this you can use 2

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:04.616
alternate methods in the reading

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:05.656
content protocol.

00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:08.076
These method versions return

00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:09.666
NSAttributedStrings instead of

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:10.436
simple strings.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.486
By supplying the appropriate

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:14.296
accessibility attributes, you

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:15.876
can control various aspects

00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:17.376
about how VoiceOver speaks your

00:07:17.376 --> 00:07:17.876
content.

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:21.576
For example, you may have a

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:23.006
passage you would like spoken in

00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:24.166
a particular language.

00:07:24.626 --> 00:07:26.176
To do this you can include the

00:07:26.176 --> 00:07:27.886
accessibilitySpeechLanguage

00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:29.096
attribute along with the

00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:30.746
appropriate language identifier.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.146
This causes VoiceOver to use the

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.696
most appropriate voice to speak

00:07:34.696 --> 00:07:35.366
your content.

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:38.336
>> Arc de Triomphe.

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:41.546
>> Furthermore, you may want

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:42.966
fine-grained control over the

00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:44.276
way VoiceOver speaks your

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:44.826
content.

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.616
To do this you can supply the

00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:48.996
IPA representation for your

00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:50.646
passage along with the

00:07:50.646 --> 00:07:53.156
accessibilitySpeechIPANotation

00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:53.706
attribute.

00:07:54.946 --> 00:07:56.786
>> Yosemite National Park.

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:01.296
>> So to create a great reading

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:02.976
experience for VoiceOver, you

00:08:02.976 --> 00:08:04.246
first need to make your text

00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:05.296
content accessible.

00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:07.106
You do this by implementing the

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:09.176
UIAccessibilityReadingContent

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:09.726
protocol.

00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:12.116
Next, you should implement

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:13.466
automatic page turning so

00:08:13.466 --> 00:08:14.736
VoiceOver can read all of the

00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:15.986
content in your app from

00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:18.066
beginning to end.

00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:20.216
Finally, to control the way

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:21.836
VoiceOver speaks your content,

00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:23.606
you should consider using the NS

00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:25.136
attributed strings versions of

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:26.136
the methods in the reading

00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:27.966
content protocol and supply the

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.196
appropriate accessibility

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:29.866
attributes.

00:08:31.576 --> 00:08:32.916
