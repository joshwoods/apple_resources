00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:11.956
>> Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.121
[ Applause ]

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:16.436
As you just saw, privacy is

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.736
something people expect, value,

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.316
and make space for every day.

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:23.336
I'm Mark from Privacy

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:24.736
Engineering Team at Apple, and

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:26.196
with my colleague, Julien, we're

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.926
thrilled to tell you today about

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:29.646
designing for privacy on our

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:31.366
platforms and in your

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.156
applications.

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:36.126
Privacy isn't just about closing

00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:36.606
doors.

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.516
It's also about opening doors to

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:41.086
the trust you build with your

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:41.736
customers.

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.296
Customers have let our devices

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:48.586
into their homes, captured the

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:50.596
memories in their photos,

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:54.486
monitor their health, and

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:56.196
transmit their thoughts and

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.356
emotions, knowing that they are

00:00:58.356 --> 00:00:59.726
in control of their data.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.976
As Tim said last year, we at

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:07.526
Apple can and do provide the

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:09.876
very best to our users while

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.076
treating their most precious

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:12.776
data like the precious cargo

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:13.606
that it is.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.066
And if we can do it, then every

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.206
one of you can, and in today's

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:21.746
talk, we'll help you design for

00:01:21.746 --> 00:01:21.976
privacy.

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:28.406
At Apple, privacy starts with

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:29.526
data minimization.

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:32.756
Examine carefully what data do

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:34.066
you need for the functionality

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.806
of your app, and what data can

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:36.396
you edit out?

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:40.996
Some of the most interesting and

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:42.726
challenging features use

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:45.356
sensitive, personal data, and at

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:47.516
Apple, we build these features

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.126
with on device intelligence, so

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:52.396
your device personalizes itself

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.756
to you, while Apple doesn't

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:55.566
collect this data.

00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.096
When data is shared with Apple,

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:01.326
we ask the customer.

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.626
The customer is always in

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:05.766
control, and they always know

00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:06.906
what's being shared.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:11.706
And security is foundational.

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:13.946
It not only protects people's

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:16.166
data on their devices and on our

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.886
servers but also enforces both

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:21.356
the privacy protections we've

00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:23.236
built and the choices that

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:26.836
people have made.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:27.856
Some companies think that

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.766
privacy is just security, that

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:32.316
you can use or collect data so

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:33.026
long as you protect it.

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:35.956
But that's short sighted, as

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:37.866
security alone isn't adequate in

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:38.366
the long run.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:41.556
You do have a responsibility to

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.416
protect the data that you

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.496
collect, but it's less risky to

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.866
just not collect it in the first

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:46.196
place.

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:50.236
Some other companies define

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.276
privacy as just transparency and

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:52.676
control.

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:55.026
Let users know what you're doing

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:56.616
with their data, and let them

00:02:56.616 --> 00:02:58.216
opt out if they don't like it.

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:01.516
But this is privacy after the

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:04.646
fact, and it forces people to

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:06.676
choose between privacy and

00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:07.286
features.

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.926
And the burden shouldn't be on

00:03:09.926 --> 00:03:12.266
individuals to exercise control

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:13.556
to get privacy.

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:17.176
Because privacy is a fundamental

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:17.756
human right.

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:20.036
It's essential to the

00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:21.666
functioning of good societies,

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:24.536
and it's too important to not

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.486
just work in the technologies

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:27.206
that we use.

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:30.626
That's why at Apple, privacy is

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.376
designed into our futures.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:34.526
It's [inaudible] how they work,

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:36.666
not something added on at the

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:36.956
end.

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:40.306
At Apple, we challenge ourselves

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.026
every day to build great

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:44.226
features with privacy, and we're

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:47.436
confident you can too.

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.296
In the rest of our talk, we'll

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.876
explore privacy and the user

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:52.526
experience.

00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:55.416
Dive into what's new and updated

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:57.566
in frameworks, and then we'll

00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.426
take a step back and show how

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:00.806
you can overcome privacy

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.396
challenges through innovation.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.046
I'm going to talk about four

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.176
user experiences today.

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:12.136
First, Sign In with Apple, which

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:12.956
allows you to connect your

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:14.586
user's experience across

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:16.426
platforms without having to

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:17.606
store or manage user

00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:20.745
credentials, and it's a great

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:22.366
example of data minimization.

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.206
Apple doesn't track how people

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.266
use your application because

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.506
it's none of our business, and

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.146
we've pared down the data that

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.246
people share through Sign In

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:34.036
with Apple to just what's needed

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.316
to sign into your application.

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.786
So, ask yourself if you really

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.106
need the customer's name or

00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:39.876
email address.

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:42.886
If you need a name for billing

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:44.236
or shipping purposes, you can

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:45.506
get it later, for example,

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:46.346
through Apple Pay.

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:49.226
And if you don't ask for any

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.996
additional data, the user has

00:04:50.996 --> 00:04:53.046
just one button to tap, and

00:04:53.046 --> 00:04:53.706
they're signed into your

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:54.206
application.

00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.766
If you do need to contact the

00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:59.316
user, for example, to provide

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:00.536
receipts or for account

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:02.916
recovery, we provide an easy way

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:03.586
for you to do so.

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:07.196
People can be hesitant to share

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.336
their real email address.

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:09.936
We've all seen email lists

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:13.686
stolen or resold and then abused

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:14.416
by spammers.

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:16.526
So people may give you a fake

00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:18.286
email address or one for an

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.396
account they never check.

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:21.996
You could make the user verify

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:23.616
their email at sign-in, but this

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:24.536
takes them out of your

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.556
application, potentially to

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:27.306
[inaudible] their spam folder,

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:28.756
and that's not a great

00:05:28.756 --> 00:05:29.386
experience.

00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:31.796
With sign-in with Apple, you

00:05:31.796 --> 00:05:33.526
will get a verified email

00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:35.526
address associated with the

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:36.386
user's AppleID.

00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:40.036
Customers can choose to hide

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:41.676
their email address, in which

00:05:41.676 --> 00:05:43.056
case you'll get an address

00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:45.106
managed by Apple through which

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:46.756
we relay your emails to the

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.176
customer and vice versa.

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:50.526
And Apple won't retain emails

00:05:50.606 --> 00:05:52.436
after we've delivered them.

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:54.636
For each customer, this managed

00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:56.036
address is different for each

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:58.316
developer, so customers are in

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.116
control of which developers they

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:02.286
want to receive email from, and

00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:03.866
you're in control of who can

00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:05.096
send emails to the managed

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.906
address we provide you, since

00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:08.266
you can whitelist domains or

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:09.836
addresses that we'll accept

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:10.716
incoming mail from.

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:12.946
And because both parties are in

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:14.596
control, we think this is your

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:16.536
best shot at getting your emails

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:17.726
in front of your customer.

00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:22.306
We understand you face

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:23.966
challenges in preventing abuse

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:25.386
and fraud from account farming.

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:27.966
And you may want to ask users to

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:29.336
fill out a CAPTCHA such as this.

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:31.466
But these are cumbersome, and

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.676
they're difficult to localize

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:35.796
and make accessible.

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.216
Other alternatives are invasive

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:39.316
to user's privacy, such as

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.716
trying to reidentify them with

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:41.716
personally identifiable

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:43.496
information or fingerprinting.

00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:46.436
With Sign In with Apple, we can

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:48.956
leverage on-device intelligence

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.466
to provide you with one bit that

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:53.126
indicates a user is likely real.

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:56.016
And this flag is supported on

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:57.626
iOS, and we provide it at

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:58.426
account creation.

00:07:01.436 --> 00:07:03.296
The real user status property of

00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:05.336
ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential

00:07:05.656 --> 00:07:06.776
is how you check for this bit.

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:09.546
And keep in mind that a new user

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:11.596
on a new phone will likely show

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:13.326
up as status unknown, so you

00:07:13.326 --> 00:07:14.676
shouldn't just deny service if

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:16.386
you see this state and provide

00:07:16.386 --> 00:07:17.796
the user and ultimate flow or a

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:19.236
way to appeal this

00:07:19.236 --> 00:07:19.756
determination.

00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:23.516
So that was Sign In with Apple,

00:07:23.666 --> 00:07:25.576
a great privacy friendly single

00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:26.346
sign on solution.

00:07:28.216 --> 00:07:29.356
Now, let's talk about location.

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:32.046
People are protective of where

00:07:32.046 --> 00:07:33.606
they are and where they've been.

00:07:33.746 --> 00:07:38.126
It reveals where we live, places

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:40.116
we frequent, our patterns of

00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:41.466
life, and when those patterns

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:42.056
change.

00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:44.186
Like if you start attending a

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:45.436
different set of afterparties

00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:46.756
this year with a different crowd

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:47.076
of people.

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:49.836
And in iOS 13, we're making

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.836
changes to help users exercise

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.986
smarter control over when

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:55.056
they're sharing their location.

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:58.796
Previously in iOS, there was a

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:00.576
one-time prompt for location

00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:03.646
permissions, and at this point,

00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:04.876
the user hasn't experienced

00:08:04.876 --> 00:08:07.386
location in your app before.

00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:08.936
So they may select don't allow

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.696
and miss out on the value that

00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:11.996
location can provide in your

00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:12.546
application.

00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:14.976
And while many of you have built

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:16.706
experiences to explain your use

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:18.276
of location before asking,

00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:20.206
nothing explains better than

00:08:20.206 --> 00:08:20.916
using your app.

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:23.956
So, in iOS 13 were introducing a

00:08:23.956 --> 00:08:27.686
new option, Allow Once, giving

00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:29.916
users the ability to try out

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.336
location in your application

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:33.176
before committing to a decision.

00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:36.446
If the user selects Allow Once,

00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:38.056
your app will have access to

00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:39.566
location, just as if the user

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:42.126
had selected While in Use up

00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:43.515
until the system no longer

00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:45.116
considers your app in use.

00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:46.766
The next time the user launches

00:08:46.766 --> 00:08:47.786
your app, they'll be asked

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:49.816
again, and if they want to give

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:51.026
you app access without being

00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:52.476
asked, they can grant While in

00:08:52.476 --> 00:08:53.736
Use when they're comfortable

00:08:53.736 --> 00:08:54.196
doing so.

00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:56.666
What about Always?

00:08:57.576 --> 00:08:58.756
The ability to access a user's

00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:00.296
location always is a very

00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:02.246
powerful capability, and you

00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:03.776
just may be surprised if your

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.396
app asks for it right away

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:06.836
before you've had a chance to

00:09:06.836 --> 00:09:08.086
demonstrate your app's value,

00:09:09.046 --> 00:09:10.106
the value of location in your

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:11.816
app's value, or why you need it

00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:12.956
in the background when they're

00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:15.736
currently using your app.

00:09:15.936 --> 00:09:18.326
Location prompts in app will now

00:09:18.366 --> 00:09:21.086
always be for just once or While

00:09:21.086 --> 00:09:21.526
in Use.

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:25.536
If you do request Always, we'll

00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:27.296
show the same prompt and defer

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:28.506
asking for Always.

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:31.686
And if a user selects While in

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:33.786
Use, your delegate object will

00:09:33.786 --> 00:09:35.556
be told you're authorized for

00:09:35.556 --> 00:09:36.006
always.

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:38.566
And iOS will continue to

00:09:38.566 --> 00:09:40.336
generate Always location events

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:41.226
for your app, just as it did

00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:41.646
before.

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:45.046
Before we deliver the first

00:09:45.046 --> 00:09:46.386
Always location event to your

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.666
application, we'll then prompt

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:50.276
the user to upgrade from While

00:09:50.276 --> 00:09:52.896
in Use to Always, and you'll

00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:54.226
only get the location event if

00:09:54.436 --> 00:09:55.666
the user grants us permission.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.836
We'll only ask users while

00:09:58.836 --> 00:09:59.986
they're on the home screen, not

00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:00.706
while they're in another

00:10:00.706 --> 00:10:02.416
application, so this may not

00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:02.976
happen immediately.

00:10:05.736 --> 00:10:06.886
To provide increased

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:08.916
transparency, we'll periodically

00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:10.526
remind the user that your app is

00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:11.706
accessing location in the

00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:12.196
background.

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.176
And shortly after upgrade to iOS

00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:17.196
13, we'll remind the user for

00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:18.826
all existing apps with Always

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:18.976
access.

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:23.586
The good news is, there are no

00:10:23.586 --> 00:10:25.716
capability breaking API changes,

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:27.546
but you should test for the new

00:10:27.546 --> 00:10:29.476
Allow Once and Always behaviors

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:31.106
to ensure that your app handles

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:32.036
these state transitions

00:10:32.036 --> 00:10:32.456
gracefully.

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:35.516
And if you do use Always data,

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:37.046
now is a good time to ensure

00:10:37.046 --> 00:10:38.686
that your use of Always provides

00:10:38.686 --> 00:10:39.696
clear user value.

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:42.076
We think these contextual

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:43.736
prompts will help users make

00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:45.736
informed, smarter choices about

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:46.646
when they're sharing their

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.106
location.

00:10:48.456 --> 00:10:49.736
Come talk to us at our lab if

00:10:49.736 --> 00:10:51.286
you have any questions, check

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:52.566
out the video from What's New in

00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:54.296
Core Location session in the

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:56.026
WWDC app or the Core Location

00:10:56.026 --> 00:11:00.696
lab Friday at 1 p.m. The third

00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:01.886
user experience I'm going to

00:11:01.886 --> 00:11:03.306
talk about is Bluetooth.

00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:05.836
You used to only need user

00:11:05.836 --> 00:11:07.336
consent if you wanted to share

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:08.626
information using

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.986
CoreBluetooth's peripheral

00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:13.716
manager APIs in the background.

00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.256
IOS 13 will now require user

00:11:15.256 --> 00:11:17.046
consent if your application uses

00:11:17.296 --> 00:11:20.136
any CoreBluetooth APIs, and this

00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:21.556
applies to apps linked against

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.966
older SDKs as well.

00:11:24.686 --> 00:11:26.276
You should provide an

00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:27.736
NSBluetoothAlwaysUsage

00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:29.006
Description purpose string in

00:11:29.006 --> 00:11:31.356
your Info.plist to help users

00:11:31.356 --> 00:11:33.336
understand what your app needs

00:11:33.396 --> 00:11:35.146
Bluetooth for and so they can

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:36.976
make an informed choice, and

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:38.946
this will be required for all

00:11:38.946 --> 00:11:41.156
apps linked on or after IOS 13,

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:42.356
or your app will crash.

00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:44.926
Please refer to our talk last

00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:46.216
year for tips on how to write a

00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:49.326
great purpose string.

00:11:49.426 --> 00:11:50.316
Adoption is easy.

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.886
If the user hasn't previously

00:11:52.886 --> 00:11:54.546
granted permission, then when

00:11:54.546 --> 00:11:56.236
your app instantiates a CB

00:11:56.236 --> 00:11:58.006
peripheral or central manager

00:11:58.006 --> 00:12:01.156
object, iOS will ask the user if

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:02.206
they want to allow your app to

00:12:02.206 --> 00:12:03.656
access Bluetooth APIs.

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:06.106
And you can check the new

00:12:06.106 --> 00:12:07.746
authorization property on the

00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:09.076
central and peripheral manager

00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:10.646
objects for your current

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.556
authorization state.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:14.426
For more information, please

00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:15.766
check out what's new in

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:20.436
CoreBluetooth Friday at 3:20.

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:22.016
The last user [inaudible] change

00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:23.606
is on macOS Catalina, where

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:26.226
we're adding user consent for

00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:27.736
more types of functionality and

00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:27.986
data.

00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:31.206
Last year in macOS Mohave, we

00:12:31.206 --> 00:12:32.956
protected these resources on the

00:12:32.956 --> 00:12:34.796
file system and required user

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.016
consent to access them.

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:38.006
This year we're adding

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.766
protection to the Desktop,

00:12:39.856 --> 00:12:41.026
Documents, and Downloads

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.796
folders, iCloud Drive and

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.416
Third-Party Cloud Storage as

00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:46.686
well as Network and Removable

00:12:46.686 --> 00:12:47.186
Volumes.

00:12:47.876 --> 00:12:50.746
In addition, the camera and

00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:52.106
microphone controls introduce

00:12:52.106 --> 00:12:54.446
macOS Mohave or infusing screen

00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:56.206
recording and keyboard input

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:58.466
monitoring in macOS Catalina as

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:00.536
well as user control over

00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:01.936
synthetic input events and

00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:02.676
AppleEvents.

00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:05.416
For more information, check out

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:07.006
advances in macOS security

00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:09.346
session in the WWDC app or their

00:13:09.346 --> 00:13:13.936
lab tomorrow at 2 p.m. Next, I

00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:16.636
have three new frameworks with

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:17.506
new behaviors.

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:21.606
First, I have some exciting news

00:13:21.606 --> 00:13:22.586
for web developers.

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:25.476
We introduced Intelligent

00:13:25.716 --> 00:13:27.606
Tracking Prevention, ITP, two

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:29.626
years ago, to protect against

00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:31.056
cross-site user tracking.

00:13:31.966 --> 00:13:33.886
On by default in Safari, it's

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:35.816
had a big impact, and we're

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.206
thrilled to see other browsers

00:13:37.206 --> 00:13:38.966
adopt similar techniques and

00:13:38.966 --> 00:13:40.326
build consensus against

00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:41.156
cross-site tracking.

00:13:42.966 --> 00:13:44.556
We don't, however, believe that

00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:46.426
a web without free of tracking

00:13:46.796 --> 00:13:48.406
is necessarily a web without

00:13:48.406 --> 00:13:49.266
advertisements.

00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:51.856
And last year we took a first

00:13:51.856 --> 00:13:53.036
step in building privacy

00:13:53.036 --> 00:13:54.676
friendly ad infrastructure with

00:13:54.676 --> 00:13:56.716
installed validation, which

00:13:56.716 --> 00:13:57.966
allows developers to measure

00:13:57.966 --> 00:13:59.896
conversions from advertisements

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:01.016
to app installs.

00:14:02.336 --> 00:14:03.606
This year, we're tackling the

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:04.486
web.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.266
Privacy Preserving Ad Click

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:09.636
Attribution is a new way for

00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:11.016
advertisers and merchants on the

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.806
web to measure the success of

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:14.576
their ad campaigns without

00:14:14.576 --> 00:14:15.966
tracking individual users.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.956
Let's say they sell running

00:14:18.956 --> 00:14:20.136
shoes on SneakerNet.

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.866
I buy ads on search.example, and

00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:26.036
I want to know how effective

00:14:26.036 --> 00:14:27.546
those ads are at driving visits

00:14:27.546 --> 00:14:28.606
and purchases to my site.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:31.606
This used to be done through

00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:33.356
cross-site tracking, which ITP

00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:34.196
now blocks.

00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:38.226
In Privacy Preserving Ad Click

00:14:38.226 --> 00:14:40.436
Attribution, Safari connects

00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:43.946
clicks on ads with conversions

00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:47.666
on the merchant and reports

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:48.936
these attributions to the ad

00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:49.536
provider.

00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:52.266
Let's walk through how this

00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:54.036
happens.

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:56.256
Now when a user clicks on an ad

00:14:56.256 --> 00:14:57.256
on search.example for

00:14:57.256 --> 00:14:59.936
SneakerNet, Safari will remember

00:14:59.936 --> 00:15:01.126
this for seven days.

00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:04.736
And in that seven-day window, if

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:06.026
the user makes a purchase on

00:15:06.026 --> 00:15:08.046
SneakerNet, the merchant or

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:09.936
advertiser can identify this as

00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:11.986
a potential conversion, and

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:13.736
Safari will connect this

00:15:13.806 --> 00:15:15.326
potential conversion with a

00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:17.136
previously stored ad clicks and

00:15:17.686 --> 00:15:19.796
record that conversion did occur

00:15:19.796 --> 00:15:22.456
from search.example to

00:15:24.076 --> 00:15:24.456
SneakerNet.

00:15:24.636 --> 00:15:25.836
Safari will then report this

00:15:25.836 --> 00:15:27.316
conversion as a delayed

00:15:27.316 --> 00:15:28.256
ephemeral post the

00:15:28.256 --> 00:15:29.836
search.example.

00:15:31.296 --> 00:15:32.526
Adoption is easy.

00:15:33.636 --> 00:15:34.636
The ad provider just needs to

00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:36.236
decorate their outgoing link

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:37.806
anchor tags with two new

00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:40.406
attributes, adDestination, the

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.456
site where you expect

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:42.536
conversions to occur.

00:15:43.226 --> 00:15:46.846
Here, SneakerNet.example and the

00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:47.826
adCampaignID.

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:50.346
Search.example might be running

00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:51.846
many concurrent ad campaigns for

00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:54.096
SneakerNet, and the CampaignID

00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:55.056
allows you to measure them

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:55.496
separately.

00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:59.206
We can detect conversions

00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:00.656
without any change on the

00:16:00.656 --> 00:16:02.186
merchant site by leverage

00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:06.016
existing tracking pixels, which

00:16:06.016 --> 00:16:07.306
a search provider can then

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:08.716
redirect the server side to a

00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:11.286
well-known URL that identifies

00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:12.846
the ConversionID as a past

00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:13.266
component.

00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:16.306
Conversions can be anything from

00:16:16.466 --> 00:16:17.506
putting an item in a shopping

00:16:17.506 --> 00:16:19.696
cart, to creating an account, to

00:16:19.696 --> 00:16:21.426
making a purchase, and the

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:23.036
ConversionID allows the merchant

00:16:23.076 --> 00:16:24.466
to distinguish between these

00:16:24.496 --> 00:16:26.416
different Conversion events.

00:16:27.836 --> 00:16:29.786
To preserve the user's privacy,

00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:31.956
Safari limits the Campaign and

00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:33.976
ConversionIDs each to 64

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:34.866
possible values.

00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:36.966
So, each conversion between an

00:16:36.966 --> 00:16:39.016
advertiser and merchant can only

00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:40.786
be linked to 1 of 4000 possible

00:16:40.786 --> 00:16:40.976
values.

00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:45.276
Safari will wait 24 to 48 hours

00:16:45.566 --> 00:16:46.356
before reporting this

00:16:46.356 --> 00:16:48.506
attribution, both to aggregate

00:16:48.506 --> 00:16:49.996
multiple Clicks and Conversions

00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:52.076
and to prevent correlation with

00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:53.826
user activity on either site.

00:16:55.146 --> 00:16:57.036
The Conversion attribution will

00:16:57.036 --> 00:16:58.236
be reported in an ephemeral

00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:00.176
session without any cookies.

00:17:01.076 --> 00:17:02.896
And Clicks and Conversions are

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.286
not recorded in private

00:17:04.346 --> 00:17:04.685
browsing.

00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:09.016
Privacy Preserving Ad Click

00:17:09.016 --> 00:17:11.526
Attribution is available to try

00:17:11.746 --> 00:17:13.526
out in Safari Technology Preview

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:13.786
83.

00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:16.156
It will be on by default in iOS

00:17:16.156 --> 00:17:18.896
13 and macOS Catalina, and we've

00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:20.646
submitted to W3C for

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:21.996
consideration as a web standard.

00:17:21.996 --> 00:17:24.136
And you can see more details at

00:17:24.136 --> 00:17:25.705
webkit.org/blog.

00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:29.866
Next, I'm going to talk about

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.276
the Speech Recognizer framework,

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:33.796
which allows you to transcribe

00:17:33.796 --> 00:17:34.216
audio.

00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:36.876
We've heard many requests for a

00:17:36.876 --> 00:17:38.016
way to perform transcription

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.866
locally, and this is especially

00:17:39.866 --> 00:17:41.156
helpful in regulated

00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:42.306
environments such as healthcare.

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:46.116
In iOS 13, we're introducing

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.976
offline transcription, so you

00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:49.736
can transcribe audio without

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.216
internet connectivity and

00:17:51.216 --> 00:17:52.376
without sending potentially

00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:53.946
sensitive audio off device.

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:57.086
To adopt, you can check

00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:58.726
isAvailableForLocal Recognition

00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:01.686
on Speech Recognizer and specify

00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:03.846
requiresLocalRecognition when

00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:05.336
creating a speech recognition

00:18:05.336 --> 00:18:05.866
request.

00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:10.876
Third, we have new ways for test

00:18:10.876 --> 00:18:12.166
users to provide feedback in

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:12.616
TextFlight.

00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:15.026
We understand as app developers

00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:16.416
it's really important to

00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:18.356
understand exactly where users

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:19.646
are running into issues in your

00:18:19.646 --> 00:18:21.286
app, and we want to help you

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:22.936
learn from your test users while

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:23.926
preserving their privacy.

00:18:25.596 --> 00:18:26.996
So in iOS 13, we're introducing

00:18:26.996 --> 00:18:28.576
the ability for TextFlight users

00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:30.626
to submit screen shots directly

00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:31.976
from the Screenshot UI through

00:18:32.126 --> 00:18:32.756
TextFlight.

00:18:34.006 --> 00:18:35.416
They can also now send feedback

00:18:35.726 --> 00:18:37.686
along with crash reports so you

00:18:37.686 --> 00:18:39.396
can understand exactly what they

00:18:39.396 --> 00:18:40.546
were doing at the time of the

00:18:40.546 --> 00:18:42.636
particular crash.

00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:44.406
Testers are in control of

00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:45.916
sharing data from their device,

00:18:47.016 --> 00:18:48.126
and this is available in

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:51.226
TextFlight 2.3 on iOS 13 and you

00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:52.496
can give feedback in App Store

00:18:52.496 --> 00:18:52.756
Connect.

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.026
For more information, please

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:56.396
check out What's New in App

00:18:56.396 --> 00:19:00.386
Store Connect in the WWDC app.

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:01.446
Now, I'm going to turn it over

00:19:01.446 --> 00:19:02.816
to my colleague, Julien, to talk

00:19:02.816 --> 00:19:04.226
about privacy updates.

00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:08.546
[ Applause ]

00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:09.676
>> Thank you, Mark.

00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:13.756
In this next section, let's talk

00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:15.596
about privacy updates to

00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:16.626
existing APIs.

00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:19.956
We go through a series of five

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:22.086
updates in rapid fashion.

00:19:22.686 --> 00:19:25.916
First, CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo.

00:19:26.886 --> 00:19:29.126
The CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo API

00:19:29.676 --> 00:19:31.936
returns the name and Mac address

00:19:32.236 --> 00:19:34.026
of the Wi-Fi access point a

00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:35.996
device is currently connected

00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:36.206
to.

00:19:37.166 --> 00:19:40.176
This affects privacy as a Wi-Fi

00:19:40.176 --> 00:19:42.616
access point reveals a user's

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:43.006
location.

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:48.056
Starting in iOS 13, CNCopy will

00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:50.856
only work for certain categories

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.726
of apps, apps that declared the

00:19:53.866 --> 00:19:57.196
CNCopy entitlement and apps that

00:19:57.646 --> 00:20:00.006
configured a virtual private

00:20:00.056 --> 00:20:00.436
network.

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:03.536
Or apps that configured a Wi-Fi

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.516
network using the

00:20:04.516 --> 00:20:07.886
NEHotspotConfiguration API or

00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:09.916
apps that obtain location

00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:11.466
permission from the user.

00:20:12.596 --> 00:20:14.016
What this means for you is that

00:20:14.016 --> 00:20:15.876
you may not be able to access

00:20:15.976 --> 00:20:17.266
CNCopy anymore.

00:20:18.506 --> 00:20:20.036
You can find out more details

00:20:20.156 --> 00:20:21.526
about this in the networking

00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:22.726
sessions listed below.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.626
Second, contacts access.

00:20:27.306 --> 00:20:30.376
Starting in iOS 13, apps that

00:20:30.376 --> 00:20:32.216
have been authorized by a user

00:20:32.406 --> 00:20:34.546
to access contacts will no

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:36.706
longer have access to the notes

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:37.916
field of a contact.

00:20:38.856 --> 00:20:40.966
The notes field of a contact

00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:43.316
potentially includes sensitive

00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:45.476
details such as sneaky comments

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:46.376
about your boss.

00:20:47.316 --> 00:20:49.046
Most apps do not need access to

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:49.466
this data.

00:20:50.156 --> 00:20:52.096
If you believe you need access

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.816
to it, please file an

00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:55.216
entitlement request at the

00:20:55.216 --> 00:20:56.306
following URL.

00:20:57.096 --> 00:21:00.086
Third, Custom URL Schemes.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.156
Previously, if your app was

00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:05.556
launched by a Custom URL Scheme,

00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:08.356
you could identify the app that

00:21:08.356 --> 00:21:10.586
launched you via an option of

00:21:10.626 --> 00:21:11.586
open URL.

00:21:12.716 --> 00:21:14.556
This revealed applications

00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:16.256
installed on a user's device.

00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:20.016
Starting in iOS 13, the source

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:22.466
application is only revealed to

00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:24.276
apps from the same developer.

00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:27.446
Fourth, Game Center.

00:21:28.426 --> 00:21:30.336
In order to improve player

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:33.696
privacy, Game Center introduces

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:36.656
two new APIs.

00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:38.606
The teamPlayerID for a

00:21:38.706 --> 00:21:40.626
team-scoped player identifier

00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:42.336
and the gamePlayerID for a

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:44.266
game-scoped player identifier.

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.146
The existing playerID identifier

00:21:47.516 --> 00:21:48.606
is being deprecated.

00:21:49.656 --> 00:21:51.836
This changes which identifier

00:21:52.136 --> 00:21:53.516
you may use in your gaming app.

00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:56.096
For more information, please

00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:57.746
check out the Game Center video

00:21:57.946 --> 00:21:59.726
in the WWDC app.

00:22:00.096 --> 00:22:01.986
And five, contextual

00:22:02.046 --> 00:22:02.956
information.

00:22:04.036 --> 00:22:06.586
IOS doesn't know when your app

00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:08.616
is most helpful to users.

00:22:09.656 --> 00:22:11.646
You can provide contextual

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:13.986
information, entry point into

00:22:13.986 --> 00:22:17.546
your app via two main APIs,

00:22:17.546 --> 00:22:19.966
NSUserActivity, to promote your

00:22:20.186 --> 00:22:23.156
app in Search results, and

00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:25.236
SiriKit INInteraction to promote

00:22:25.236 --> 00:22:26.686
your app on on-device

00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:28.456
intelligent scenarios such as

00:22:28.726 --> 00:22:31.516
Maps Shortcuts and new this year

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.206
in the Share Sheet.

00:22:32.866 --> 00:22:35.356
If you do promote your app, be a

00:22:35.356 --> 00:22:35.916
good sport.

00:22:36.676 --> 00:22:38.336
Delete content that was removed

00:22:38.336 --> 00:22:38.826
from your app.

00:22:39.906 --> 00:22:41.606
You don't want Siri Shortcuts to

00:22:41.606 --> 00:22:43.336
make a suggestion to content

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:44.676
that does not exist anymore.

00:22:45.386 --> 00:22:47.246
Simply call the corresponding

00:22:47.406 --> 00:22:49.516
deletion APIs.

00:22:49.516 --> 00:22:50.616
We just went through a series a

00:22:50.616 --> 00:22:53.146
five privacy updates to existing

00:22:53.146 --> 00:22:53.426
APIs.

00:22:54.236 --> 00:22:56.436
In our next section, we take a

00:22:56.436 --> 00:22:57.836
step back.

00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:00.746
We discuss how a privacy

00:23:00.786 --> 00:23:03.476
challenge can be a chance to

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:04.066
innovate.

00:23:05.036 --> 00:23:07.226
Privacy is fundamental to the

00:23:07.226 --> 00:23:08.766
design of every product.

00:23:09.186 --> 00:23:11.126
At Apple, in the Privacy Team,

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.866
we work with engineers all

00:23:12.866 --> 00:23:15.266
across Apple to build privacy

00:23:15.266 --> 00:23:16.336
into our products.

00:23:17.926 --> 00:23:20.666
Once in a while, we hit a very

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:23.546
hard problem, a feature that we

00:23:23.546 --> 00:23:25.406
really want to ship, but it's

00:23:25.406 --> 00:23:27.276
not obvious how to protect

00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:28.076
privacy.

00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:31.676
So when that happens, we decide

00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:32.836
to challenge ourselves.

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:35.006
We aim to build a great feature

00:23:35.226 --> 00:23:36.756
without giving away user

00:23:36.756 --> 00:23:38.926
information, so we lean on our

00:23:38.926 --> 00:23:41.646
privacy principles to find

00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:43.406
solutions and innovate.

00:23:44.686 --> 00:23:46.786
Today, we want to inspire you to

00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:47.306
do the same.

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:49.686
Let's look at three critical

00:23:49.686 --> 00:23:51.346
areas of the user experience,

00:23:52.016 --> 00:23:54.676
Machine Learning, Find My, and

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:54.896
Home.

00:23:56.026 --> 00:23:57.366
Let's start with Machine

00:23:57.366 --> 00:23:57.616
Learning.

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:00.196
There are many ways to build

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:01.726
Machine Learning applications.

00:24:02.446 --> 00:24:04.656
Usually we need to train a model

00:24:05.096 --> 00:24:06.326
and then evaluate it.

00:24:06.986 --> 00:24:09.006
So the first privacy challenge

00:24:09.246 --> 00:24:11.436
with Machine Learning is how to

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:13.536
train a machine learning model

00:24:14.216 --> 00:24:16.086
but without collecting sensitive

00:24:16.216 --> 00:24:18.886
user data while personalizing

00:24:18.886 --> 00:24:21.396
the model to every user and

00:24:22.076 --> 00:24:24.066
significantly improving the user

00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:24.516
experience.

00:24:25.186 --> 00:24:27.106
And again, it usually starts

00:24:27.176 --> 00:24:29.606
with data, and it's usually a

00:24:29.606 --> 00:24:30.616
lot of data.

00:24:31.946 --> 00:24:33.326
And it can be challenging to

00:24:33.326 --> 00:24:33.866
find data.

00:24:33.866 --> 00:24:35.686
There are multiple options.

00:24:36.456 --> 00:24:38.556
The first option is to collect

00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:39.426
data from users.

00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:42.686
So to protect user privacy, it's

00:24:42.686 --> 00:24:44.796
important to apply best privacy

00:24:44.906 --> 00:24:46.956
practices such as randomizing

00:24:46.956 --> 00:24:48.826
identifiers, rounding or

00:24:48.826 --> 00:24:49.456
sampling.

00:24:50.416 --> 00:24:53.466
But sometimes data is inherently

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.866
sensitive, like the picture of

00:24:55.866 --> 00:24:56.626
user's face.

00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:59.286
A second option is to run a user

00:24:59.286 --> 00:24:59.656
study.

00:25:01.116 --> 00:25:03.826
We invite select users to test

00:25:03.826 --> 00:25:05.606
or feature in private and

00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:06.546
collect their data.

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:09.456
We did this ourselves to train

00:25:09.656 --> 00:25:10.226
Face ID.

00:25:11.306 --> 00:25:13.286
Finally, their external

00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:13.956
datasets.

00:25:14.786 --> 00:25:16.286
Some are publicly available for

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:17.246
research purposes.

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:19.416
Others require careful

00:25:19.446 --> 00:25:21.186
collaboration with other

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.766
companies and raise their own

00:25:23.976 --> 00:25:24.896
privacy challenges.

00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:28.696
Once you have data, you can

00:25:28.696 --> 00:25:29.306
train a model.

00:25:30.316 --> 00:25:32.186
You can, for example, use Create

00:25:32.186 --> 00:25:32.306
ML.

00:25:33.066 --> 00:25:35.416
A train model is great for most

00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:37.926
users, but users are different,

00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:39.976
each with their own needs.

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:43.166
What if you needed to tailor, to

00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:45.546
personalize a model to specific

00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:46.336
users?

00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:49.086
This year, we introduce

00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:51.316
updatable Core ML models.

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:53.876
Send your updatable model to the

00:25:53.876 --> 00:25:54.236
device.

00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:57.316
An updatable model takes in

00:25:57.316 --> 00:25:59.126
training data from the user and

00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:01.296
produces a new personalized

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:01.936
model.

00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.376
We do this ourselves with Face

00:26:04.406 --> 00:26:04.786
ID.

00:26:05.276 --> 00:26:07.436
Face ID automatically adjusts to

00:26:07.436 --> 00:26:08.006
your appearance.

00:26:08.806 --> 00:26:10.906
If you grow a beard or grow

00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:13.146
longer hair, Face ID still

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:13.876
recognizes you.

00:26:14.026 --> 00:26:15.876
And this all happens on the

00:26:15.876 --> 00:26:16.146
device.

00:26:17.746 --> 00:26:19.976
Training uses resources though,

00:26:20.526 --> 00:26:22.656
and it may affect a user

00:26:23.326 --> 00:26:24.056
experience.

00:26:24.206 --> 00:26:25.366
While there's a new Background

00:26:25.366 --> 00:26:27.606
Task API that allows you to

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:29.536
schedule machine learning tasks

00:26:29.886 --> 00:26:32.406
in the background, we recommend

00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:34.746
scheduling a task within a week

00:26:34.746 --> 00:26:35.096
or less.

00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:38.526
If you choose a date too far

00:26:38.526 --> 00:26:40.876
into the future, iOS may not

00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.266
schedule it.

00:26:42.586 --> 00:26:43.706
You can learn more about the

00:26:43.706 --> 00:26:45.276
Background Task API in our

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:45.906
session below.

00:26:46.686 --> 00:26:50.126
But sometimes, we need more than

00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:51.016
one user's data.

00:26:51.896 --> 00:26:54.026
We need data from many different

00:26:54.026 --> 00:26:54.586
users.

00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:57.676
Today, I want to share with you

00:26:58.676 --> 00:27:00.296
a new technique that we are

00:27:00.296 --> 00:27:00.876
developing.

00:27:02.066 --> 00:27:03.726
This is an example of how we

00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:06.386
innovate in privacy for machine

00:27:06.386 --> 00:27:06.626
learning.

00:27:07.656 --> 00:27:09.906
Federated Learning is a new

00:27:09.906 --> 00:27:11.236
approach that is picking up

00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:12.596
steam in the machine learning

00:27:12.596 --> 00:27:13.096
community.

00:27:13.736 --> 00:27:15.806
Today, we're introducing Private

00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:18.136
Federated Learning by combining

00:27:18.316 --> 00:27:19.816
Federated Learning with

00:27:19.816 --> 00:27:21.016
differential privacy.

00:27:21.736 --> 00:27:25.406
The idea is simple, instead of

00:27:25.446 --> 00:27:27.826
collecting user data with

00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:30.066
Private Federated Learning, we

00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:31.986
collect model updates.

00:27:32.666 --> 00:27:35.636
In other words, devices tell the

00:27:35.636 --> 00:27:38.006
server how a machine learning

00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:40.166
model should be updated.

00:27:41.236 --> 00:27:42.786
Let's walk through an example.

00:27:43.726 --> 00:27:46.336
It all starts with the server

00:27:46.436 --> 00:27:48.136
giving devices an original

00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:48.556
model.

00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:50.506
We show it in white here.

00:27:51.326 --> 00:27:53.376
Each device trains the model

00:27:53.446 --> 00:27:55.846
under local data and obtains a

00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:56.326
new model.

00:27:57.436 --> 00:27:58.976
We show it here by changing the

00:27:58.976 --> 00:27:59.266
color.

00:27:59.696 --> 00:28:00.986
They compute the difference

00:28:01.136 --> 00:28:02.996
between this new model and the

00:28:02.996 --> 00:28:04.836
original one and send these

00:28:04.836 --> 00:28:06.846
model updates back to Apple

00:28:06.846 --> 00:28:07.396
servers.

00:28:09.466 --> 00:28:11.076
The server aggregates these

00:28:11.076 --> 00:28:13.046
model updates into a new

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:15.216
enhanced machine learning model

00:28:15.626 --> 00:28:16.506
that we show here with a

00:28:16.506 --> 00:28:17.336
gradient color.

00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:20.826
Note that in this process no

00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:23.276
user data is sent in plain, and

00:28:23.276 --> 00:28:24.856
we have no needs for any user or

00:28:24.856 --> 00:28:26.056
device identifiers.

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:28.976
The server then updates the

00:28:28.976 --> 00:28:30.686
devices back with a new model,

00:28:31.266 --> 00:28:33.386
and this cycle can go back and

00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:35.256
forth between the devices and

00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:35.656
the server.

00:28:36.416 --> 00:28:38.646
From a privacy perspective, we

00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:40.206
need to analyze whether those

00:28:40.206 --> 00:28:42.686
model updates include sensitive

00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:43.176
data.

00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:46.056
It's often considered that model

00:28:46.056 --> 00:28:46.986
updates are fine.

00:28:47.216 --> 00:28:48.566
They're not plain user data.

00:28:49.576 --> 00:28:52.016
But unfortunately, in some

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:54.846
corner cases, a curious server

00:28:55.446 --> 00:28:57.866
could attempt to reconstruct the

00:28:57.866 --> 00:28:59.806
user data from model updates.

00:29:00.526 --> 00:29:02.686
For example, here, if a user

00:29:02.686 --> 00:29:04.766
sent model updates relative to

00:29:04.766 --> 00:29:07.446
this castle, a curious server

00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:09.926
may be able to reconstruct the

00:29:09.986 --> 00:29:11.776
castle image from the model

00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:12.046
update.

00:29:12.736 --> 00:29:15.136
So, to prevent this, we protect

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:18.236
model updates using on device

00:29:18.366 --> 00:29:20.356
and on the server Separated

00:29:20.686 --> 00:29:23.026
Differential Privacy and Central

00:29:23.506 --> 00:29:24.766
Differential Privacy.

00:29:25.886 --> 00:29:28.246
Differential Privacy adds noise

00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:29.546
to the model updates.

00:29:30.186 --> 00:29:32.186
This ensures that a curious

00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:35.086
server cannot reconstruct the

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:35.676
image anymore.

00:29:36.496 --> 00:29:38.946
You can find more details about

00:29:38.976 --> 00:29:40.586
how we use Separated

00:29:40.586 --> 00:29:42.016
Differential Privacy in the

00:29:42.086 --> 00:29:44.796
paper below that we wrote.

00:29:45.066 --> 00:29:47.146
Private Federated Learning can

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:49.156
be used to improve on-device

00:29:49.296 --> 00:29:49.966
intelligence.

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:52.246
This is not a research

00:29:52.246 --> 00:29:52.796
experiment.

00:29:53.536 --> 00:29:54.666
We are starting to use this

00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:56.596
technology in iOS 13 in a

00:29:56.596 --> 00:29:58.706
variety of use cases including

00:29:58.706 --> 00:30:00.646
QuickType keyboard, personalized

00:30:00.646 --> 00:30:02.126
Hey Siri, and more in the

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:02.496
future.

00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:07.266
Once you train a model, you want

00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:07.666
to use it.

00:30:08.346 --> 00:30:10.606
This raises the second privacy

00:30:10.606 --> 00:30:11.986
challenge with machine learning.

00:30:13.276 --> 00:30:15.616
How to evaluate a model without

00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:18.156
collecting user data in a fast

00:30:18.156 --> 00:30:20.166
way and without suffering from

00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:21.406
Internet connection delays.

00:30:21.406 --> 00:30:24.546
The first way that comes to mind

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.576
is to simply send user data to

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:28.166
the server, evaluate the model

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:29.376
there, and get back the

00:30:29.376 --> 00:30:30.046
inference.

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.616
But this means sending more user

00:30:32.616 --> 00:30:33.536
data to the server.

00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:36.236
Instead, we prefer on-device

00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:36.896
intelligence.

00:30:37.406 --> 00:30:38.706
We send a model down to the

00:30:38.706 --> 00:30:39.216
device.

00:30:39.666 --> 00:30:41.286
The device evaluates it locally.

00:30:42.166 --> 00:30:43.586
This has a lot of advantages.

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:45.376
It's less data sent to the

00:30:45.446 --> 00:30:46.016
servers.

00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:47.966
It works even if you don't have

00:30:47.966 --> 00:30:49.696
Internet, and it's fast if you

00:30:49.776 --> 00:30:51.186
use Core ML.

00:30:51.496 --> 00:30:54.546
Core ML is optimized to run fast

00:30:54.826 --> 00:30:56.986
on iOS devices and others.

00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:59.246
It's easy to convert your

00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:01.286
existing model to a Core ML

00:31:01.466 --> 00:31:04.396
model, and this year, we expand

00:31:04.566 --> 00:31:05.316
the number of model

00:31:05.316 --> 00:31:07.046
architectures that are

00:31:07.046 --> 00:31:07.686
supported.

00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:09.886
You can learn more in the Core

00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:13.016
ML session listed below.

00:31:13.366 --> 00:31:15.496
On-device intelligence provides

00:31:15.756 --> 00:31:19.506
strong privacy advantages, and

00:31:19.506 --> 00:31:21.386
we like to communicate those

00:31:21.386 --> 00:31:23.256
advantages to our users in the

00:31:23.376 --> 00:31:25.986
form of privacy assurances.

00:31:26.626 --> 00:31:29.376
A privacy assurance is a simple

00:31:29.446 --> 00:31:31.696
privacy sentence that we share

00:31:31.936 --> 00:31:32.696
with our users.

00:31:33.336 --> 00:31:34.896
This is not a privacy policy

00:31:34.896 --> 00:31:35.556
with legalese.

00:31:36.116 --> 00:31:38.596
For example, with Face ID, we

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:41.726
say, Face ID data never leaves

00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:42.296
the device.

00:31:43.476 --> 00:31:44.816
This is a clear and strong

00:31:44.816 --> 00:31:47.066
statement about our approach to

00:31:47.066 --> 00:31:48.526
privacy with Face ID.

00:31:48.926 --> 00:31:51.696
It's easy for all users to

00:31:52.376 --> 00:31:53.036
understand.

00:31:53.036 --> 00:31:54.916
All right, this was machine

00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:55.246
learning.

00:31:56.396 --> 00:31:59.206
Let's talk about Find My next.

00:31:59.796 --> 00:32:01.396
This year we announced a new

00:32:01.506 --> 00:32:03.426
Find My application that merges

00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:05.806
the Find My Friends and the Find

00:32:05.916 --> 00:32:07.706
My iPhone apps.

00:32:07.796 --> 00:32:09.666
One feature that we were very

00:32:09.666 --> 00:32:11.876
excited about is the offline

00:32:11.876 --> 00:32:12.696
finding feature.

00:32:13.476 --> 00:32:14.936
Here's a challenge that was

00:32:14.936 --> 00:32:16.096
brought to our attention.

00:32:16.696 --> 00:32:19.636
A user forgot their MacBook at

00:32:19.636 --> 00:32:20.476
the public library.

00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:24.176
The user realizes that, launches

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:26.036
the new Find My app and attempts

00:32:26.036 --> 00:32:28.756
to find the MacBook, but it may

00:32:28.756 --> 00:32:30.726
not work because the MacBook is

00:32:30.726 --> 00:32:33.736
not connected to the Internet.

00:32:33.736 --> 00:32:35.186
So the privacy challenge is

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:38.356
support finding devices between

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:41.266
Mac and iPhone or a Watch that

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:43.316
is, even when it's not connected

00:32:43.526 --> 00:32:44.656
to the Internet when it's

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:47.266
offline while protecting the

00:32:47.296 --> 00:32:50.256
privacy of the lost devices but

00:32:50.256 --> 00:32:52.266
also of anyone that would help

00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:54.166
you find those lost devices and

00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.106
making sure that Apple doesn't

00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:58.166
learn anything in the process.

00:32:59.126 --> 00:33:01.036
And, of course, with limited

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:02.066
impact on the battery life.

00:33:02.986 --> 00:33:04.056
This was a long list of

00:33:04.056 --> 00:33:05.936
challenges, and so the idea for

00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:07.336
us was to rely on crowd

00:33:07.336 --> 00:33:07.846
sourcing.

00:33:08.756 --> 00:33:10.846
We wanted to make it easy to

00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:12.826
detect a lost MacBook via

00:33:12.826 --> 00:33:14.746
Bluetooth and report its

00:33:14.746 --> 00:33:16.096
location to Apple servers.

00:33:16.746 --> 00:33:18.706
But we couldn't rely on a static

00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:20.126
identifier broadcast over

00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:20.536
Bluetooth.

00:33:21.226 --> 00:33:23.276
A static identifier could allow

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.856
anyone to track any device at

00:33:25.856 --> 00:33:27.856
any time, and we couldn't do

00:33:28.976 --> 00:33:29.106
that.

00:33:29.336 --> 00:33:32.426
Instead, the MacBook broadcasts

00:33:32.756 --> 00:33:35.146
and ephemeral public encryption

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:35.316
key.

00:33:36.526 --> 00:33:39.106
This key changes over time.

00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:43.036
Any nearby phone can receive

00:33:43.036 --> 00:33:44.646
over Bluetooth this encryption

00:33:44.646 --> 00:33:46.796
key, compute their own location,

00:33:47.056 --> 00:33:48.446
and encrypt it with the

00:33:48.446 --> 00:33:49.126
encryption key.

00:33:50.326 --> 00:33:52.116
Then, this encrypted data can be

00:33:52.116 --> 00:33:53.626
submitted to Apple servers.

00:33:54.476 --> 00:33:56.766
Note here that since location is

00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:59.356
encrypted, Apple cannot see it.

00:33:59.556 --> 00:34:01.266
Also, note that no information

00:34:01.266 --> 00:34:02.506
is provided about the nearby

00:34:02.506 --> 00:34:04.036
phone that helped find the lost

00:34:04.036 --> 00:34:04.506
device.

00:34:05.186 --> 00:34:07.916
Finally, the owner can ask Apple

00:34:07.916 --> 00:34:09.716
later on for the corresponding

00:34:09.716 --> 00:34:11.996
encrypted data, decrypt it to

00:34:11.996 --> 00:34:14.085
obtain the location to its lost

00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:14.716
device.

00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:17.666
With this proposal, we can share

00:34:17.926 --> 00:34:19.806
the following privacy assurance

00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:20.766
with our users.

00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:24.565
Apple does not know the location

00:34:24.565 --> 00:34:26.775
of any offline devices or

00:34:26.775 --> 00:34:27.576
finders.

00:34:28.426 --> 00:34:29.706
This is a big result.

00:34:30.085 --> 00:34:31.706
We found a way to design a

00:34:31.706 --> 00:34:34.186
fantastic feature with industry

00:34:34.295 --> 00:34:35.446
leading privacy.

00:34:36.045 --> 00:34:41.156
Next, let's talk about the Home.

00:34:42.315 --> 00:34:44.616
The Home is a safe place, and

00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:45.976
important place for all of us.

00:34:46.656 --> 00:34:48.416
It's a safe place we go to after

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:50.085
work or after a long day at

00:34:50.085 --> 00:34:52.856
WWDC, and as the popularity of

00:34:52.926 --> 00:34:55.746
Smart homes increases, so does

00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:57.836
new privacy threats emerge.

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.846
Many customers have concerns

00:35:00.996 --> 00:35:02.526
about Smart home accessories,

00:35:02.906 --> 00:35:04.996
and nothing is more sensitive

00:35:05.406 --> 00:35:07.456
than security cameras in the

00:35:07.456 --> 00:35:07.656
home.

00:35:08.786 --> 00:35:10.446
So the privacy challenge here is

00:35:10.706 --> 00:35:12.856
allowing users to view their

00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:15.356
security cameras from anywhere

00:35:16.146 --> 00:35:18.216
while allowing no one else to

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.696
access the video feed, not even

00:35:20.766 --> 00:35:23.416
Apple, and still enabling Smart

00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:25.006
camera experiences.

00:35:26.086 --> 00:35:27.266
So we worked with camera

00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:29.206
providers on two main things.

00:35:29.676 --> 00:35:32.466
First, we rely on on-device

00:35:32.546 --> 00:35:34.366
intelligence to do computer

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:36.636
vision in the home on the home

00:35:36.856 --> 00:35:38.206
resident device.

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:41.596
Be it a HomePod, an Apple TV, or

00:35:41.596 --> 00:35:44.576
an iPad, we detect people and

00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:46.736
objects directly in the home,

00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:48.296
not in the Cloud.

00:35:49.456 --> 00:35:51.596
Second, we store camera

00:35:51.596 --> 00:35:53.256
recordings in an end-to-end

00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:54.046
encrypted manner.

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:57.776
This means only you can see the

00:35:57.816 --> 00:36:00.276
content from your camera, and we

00:36:00.276 --> 00:36:01.626
can make the following privacy

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:02.176
assurance.

00:36:03.076 --> 00:36:05.536
Only you can see the video from

00:36:05.536 --> 00:36:06.236
your camera.

00:36:07.056 --> 00:36:08.306
Short and sweet.

00:36:09.206 --> 00:36:11.016
It's time to wrap up the privacy

00:36:11.016 --> 00:36:11.426
session.

00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:13.766
We talked about three privacy

00:36:13.766 --> 00:36:15.626
challenges and showed you how we

00:36:15.626 --> 00:36:16.176
solved them.

00:36:16.866 --> 00:36:18.886
Throughout this presentation, we

00:36:18.886 --> 00:36:21.166
also talked about API updates

00:36:21.166 --> 00:36:22.456
and new features that we

00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:25.416
designed with privacy.

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:28.146
Every year, every release, with

00:36:28.146 --> 00:36:30.776
every product we challenge

00:36:30.776 --> 00:36:32.786
ourselves to build great

00:36:32.886 --> 00:36:35.216
features without giving away

00:36:35.466 --> 00:36:36.216
user information.

00:36:37.266 --> 00:36:39.326
Because privacy is fundamental

00:36:39.326 --> 00:36:40.996
to the design of every product,

00:36:41.776 --> 00:36:44.296
we share privacy assurances with

00:36:44.296 --> 00:36:44.846
our users.

00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:48.376
Simple sentences about our

00:36:48.376 --> 00:36:50.626
commitment to protect user

00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:51.106
privacy.

00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:54.186
There are three things we want

00:36:54.186 --> 00:36:55.626
you to remember today.

00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:59.316
First, among the first questions

00:36:59.536 --> 00:37:01.056
you should ask yourselves when

00:37:01.056 --> 00:37:02.996
working on a new project is how

00:37:02.996 --> 00:37:05.086
you will protect user data.

00:37:05.546 --> 00:37:08.546
Ask what you should do, not what

00:37:08.546 --> 00:37:11.026
you can do with your app.

00:37:11.386 --> 00:37:13.996
Earn the trust of your users by

00:37:13.996 --> 00:37:16.266
making it easy for them to know

00:37:16.266 --> 00:37:18.126
that their privacy is protected

00:37:18.176 --> 00:37:20.006
in your app.

00:37:20.456 --> 00:37:22.846
Second, if you face a tough

00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:25.106
privacy problem, challenge

00:37:25.106 --> 00:37:26.776
yourself to find a solution.

00:37:28.106 --> 00:37:30.766
Privacy is a chance to innovate.

00:37:31.566 --> 00:37:33.316
Find a way to deliver your

00:37:33.396 --> 00:37:36.106
feature without giving away more

00:37:36.106 --> 00:37:36.666
user data.

00:37:38.176 --> 00:37:40.496
And third, privacy is an

00:37:40.496 --> 00:37:42.896
opportunity to engage with your

00:37:42.896 --> 00:37:43.436
users.

00:37:44.936 --> 00:37:47.206
