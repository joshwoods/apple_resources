00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:16.596
>> Hello and welcome to our

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:18.526
session on What's New in App

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:19.146
Store Connect.

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:21.556
My name is Tommy McGlynn and I'm

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:22.826
an App Store Connect Engineer.

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:26.356
Today our focus is the App

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:26.946
Lifecycle.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:28.906
This is everything from the

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:30.536
moment you first began creating

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:32.555
an app to the moment you make it

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.006
available in the App Store.

00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:37.316
As we look at the lifecycle

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:38.496
today, we'll highlight some

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:39.696
things that are important to

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:42.016
know and we'll look at recent

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.746
improvements to specific phases

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:44.466
of the lifecycle.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.166
And finally we'll look at some

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.356
brand new features that you

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:50.486
haven't seen yet.

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:52.086
So let's begin where it all

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:54.436
starts for every developer and

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:55.576
that's where we design and

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.416
develop apps in Xcode.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.546
Xcode is where you create apps,

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:01.926
and we've just announced that

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:03.496
you can now deliver amazing

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.075
watch apps without needing to

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.366
build an iOS companion app.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:10.796
And these apps will be fully

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:12.366
supported in App Store Connect

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:14.306
from TestFlight through to

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:16.246
through to the App Store and

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:19.896
customers can discover your app

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:21.526
right on their watch, in the new

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:23.266
App Store built specifically for

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:23.976
Apple Watch.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:29.156
Now you've built an app in Xcode

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:30.256
and you're ready to share it

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:30.866
with the world.

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:34.246
The next step is to upload your

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:34.973
app.

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:38.666
A common way to deliver apps

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.756
today is within Xcode or with

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:43.506
Application Loader which is an

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:46.906
app that's installed with Xcode.

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:48.596
Beginning with the beta of Xcode

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:50.926
11, Application Loader will no

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:51.826
longer be included.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.616
Instead, we've created a new

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:56.106
dedicated experience for

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:57.956
delivering apps that does not

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.546
require you to install Xcode.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.146
It's called Transporter.

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:05.166
This is a dedicated Mac App

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:06.976
that's super easy to use and

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:08.166
it's a great way to deliver your

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:08.586
apps.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:12.346
Transporter is also a localized

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:12.576
app.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:14.436
So it's a great experience for

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:16.306
anyone on your team across many

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:16.906
languages.

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:20.166
So let's take a closer look at

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.156
how to use Transporter.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.476
First you sign in with your

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.106
Apple ID.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.016
Then if you belong to multiple

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:29.636
teams, you'll choose one from

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:30.436
the drop-down list.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.246
Now it's time to select the

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:35.536
files that you want to deliver.

00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:38.166
Transporter uses a simple

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.366
drag-and-drop interface.

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:42.306
You just take your IPA that

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:44.186
you've exported from Xcode, drag

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:45.806
it over Transporter and drop.

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:48.656
From there it's a simple click

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:52.846
to begin verifying the package.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:54.116
Transporter will display

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:55.856
warnings and errors that occur

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:57.786
during validation so you can

00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:01.556
find and fix them early.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.766
Once errors have been addressed

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:04.256
you can click to deliver the

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:04.686
package.

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:07.976
Transporter will display

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:10.156
delivery progress and you have

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.076
the option to cancel or restart

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:13.236
deliveries that have not yet

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:13.716
completed.

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:17.546
You also have the option to

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:19.516
verify many packages at the same

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:19.846
time.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.366
Simply drag all of them into

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.146
Transporter and click to begin

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:24.756
validation.

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:27.196
That's transporter for Mac.

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:28.796
It's really easy, and I know it

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:30.066
could be a great tool for your

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:30.746
team.

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:34.746
So once your app is uploaded, we

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.886
do some further validations and

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:39.036
some issues can only be

00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:40.656
diagnosed after we've received

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:41.016
your app.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:43.926
If we do find any issues, you'll

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:45.276
receive an email to let you

00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:48.926
know, and we've recently made

00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:50.036
some enhancements to these

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:50.926
emails.

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:53.346
First we added the version

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:54.526
number prominently in the

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.256
subject line.

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.616
We also added additional context

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.016
to help you quickly understand

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:01.446
the problem.

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.126
And finally we added numeric

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:06.386
codes for each error.

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:08.406
These will help you find more

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.546
details on each error type.

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:14.066
We've also introduced a new way

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:15.386
to view your builds after

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:17.576
they've been uploaded with the

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:19.426
new Build Activity View in App

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.546
Store Connect for iOS, where you

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:24.016
can see all of the recent builds

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:26.126
that you've uploaded along with

00:04:26.126 --> 00:04:27.716
detailed information about each

00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:31.176
build as well as the download

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:32.766
and install sizes for each

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:33.356
device model.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.476
In addition to Build Activity,

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.896
there's a new notification type

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:41.376
that you can enable called Build

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.296
Processing Changes.

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:45.056
This is a great way to be

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.566
notified immediately as your

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:47.736
builds finish processing.

00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:52.786
Now you've delivered your app

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.156
and you're moving from

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.776
development into the testing

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:56.116
phase.

00:04:57.286 --> 00:04:58.466
The next step in the App

00:04:58.466 --> 00:04:59.956
Lifecycle is TestFlight.

00:05:01.036 --> 00:05:02.116
We've built some exciting new

00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:03.836
features for TestFlight and to

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.046
tell you all about it I'd like

00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:05.976
to invite Payam on stage.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:12.636
[ Applause ]

00:05:13.136 --> 00:05:14.276
Hi everyone.

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:16.136
My name Payam Yousefi,

00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:16.916
and I'm an engineer

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.676
on App Store Connect.

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:19.706
I'm really excited to be here

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.136
today to tell you all about

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:23.156
what's new with TestFlight, but

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.296
first let's reflect a little

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:25.906
bit.

00:05:26.956 --> 00:05:29.236
Last year we introduced Public

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:29.636
Links.

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:32.206
This made it so much easier for

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.026
you to invite lots of new people

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:34.966
to test their apps.

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:37.226
All you needed to do is create a

00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:39.606
unique URL, you can share it

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.906
with anyone, anywhere all

00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:42.746
without an email address.

00:05:42.746 --> 00:05:45.996
One of the first adopters of

00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:48.486
Public Links was Snapchat and

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:49.906
they had some great things to

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:50.286
say.

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:52.516
I'd like to read it to you now.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.366
TestFlight Public Links reduce

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:56.646
friction for our testers.

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.716
It increased our tester pool in

00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:00.586
a way that's lightweight and

00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:02.766
easier to maintain while

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:03.896
providing us with more than

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.076
twice the amount of useful

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:06.056
pre-release feedback.

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.036
It's that awesome?

00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:10.566
And we've been working harder to

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:12.336
reduce friction for testers even

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:12.756
more.

00:06:14.056 --> 00:06:16.306
This year we improved the

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:18.386
TestFlight app by localizing it

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:19.786
in dozens of additional

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:20.166
language.

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.636
That means that it's even more

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.596
effortless for testers worldwide

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:27.516
to start testing their apps.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:28.966
And now that you have lots of

00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:30.536
new testers, you're probably

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:33.086
eager to hear from them.

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.296
We know how important it is for

00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:36.636
you to learn about new bugs and

00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.576
crashes as soon as they happen

00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:41.076
during the testing phase, and we

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:42.126
know that sometimes you don't

00:06:42.126 --> 00:06:43.276
always get all the detail you

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:44.746
need from your testers when they

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:45.636
send you issues.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.266
So today I'm really excited to

00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:49.776
announce something completely

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:50.846
new for TestFlight.

00:06:51.356 --> 00:06:52.826
We've printed features that will

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:53.906
improve the beta testing

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:56.146
experience, and we call it

00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:57.976
TestFlight Feedback.

00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:02.556
[ Applause ]

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:04.206
Yeah, these are some great

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:05.856
enhancements that help increase

00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:07.456
the quality and quantity of

00:07:07.456 --> 00:07:08.916
feedback you receive from your

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:09.796
beta testers.

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:12.976
So now when testers first start

00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:14.656
testing your app, they're see a

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:16.486
new onboarding experience that

00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:17.986
helps them get up to speed on

00:07:17.986 --> 00:07:19.396
what to test and how to start

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:20.486
sending you feedback.

00:07:21.486 --> 00:07:23.476
Now there's two new ways to

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.416
start sending feedback.

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:27.276
First, testers can send

00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:29.476
screenshots to you without ever

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:31.126
leaving your app.

00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:34.386
And second, testers are prompted

00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:36.556
any time a crash occurs so they

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:37.796
can quickly send you feedback

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:39.126
about that crash.

00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:42.356
And we'll also go over new

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:43.476
sections in App Store Connect

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:44.826
that let you manage all the

00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:46.186
feedback you collect through

00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:48.836
Test Flight, but first let's

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.576
take a closer look at how

00:07:50.576 --> 00:07:52.306
testers can send you feedback in

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:53.976
a demo on my iPhone.

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.736
So, my team invited me to test a

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:03.996
beta version of their app called

00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:05.086
Forest Explorer.

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:07.126
It's still early in development

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:08.726
and so there's lots for me to

00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:09.706
give feedback on.

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:13.876
Let's start testing it together.

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:15.406
Now when you launch that first

00:08:15.406 --> 00:08:17.186
version of an app, you see this

00:08:17.186 --> 00:08:18.626
new onboarding screen.

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:20.536
It tells you everything you need

00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:22.266
to know to get started and all

00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:23.666
you have to do is enter test

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:25.306
notes on the builds in App Store

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.086
Connect and it will display

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:27.446
here.

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:29.916
So here I can see that my team

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.226
wants me to be on the lookout

00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:32.736
for issues in layout and

00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:33.436
usability.

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:35.666
Sounds good to me so I'll tap

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:36.645
next.

00:08:37.356 --> 00:08:39.186
Here we see steps on how to

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.966
start giving feedback just by

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:42.066
taking a screenshot.

00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:44.006
I'm excited to give it a try.

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:47.496
So let's start testing.

00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:49.096
Here's Forest Explorer.

00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:52.246
So you see my photo feed and

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:54.136
some trails on the feed, and

00:08:54.136 --> 00:08:55.686
right off the bat I can see that

00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:57.786
the Half Dome Trail, it's kind

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.296
of darker in text in comparison

00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:00.186
to the other trails.

00:09:00.186 --> 00:09:01.946
So this is a good opportunity

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:03.056
for me to send some feedback.

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:06.686
I'll take a screenshot, tap on

00:09:06.686 --> 00:09:08.936
the preview, and here when you

00:09:08.936 --> 00:09:11.226
tap done, there's a new Share

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:12.716
Beta Feedback Option.

00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:14.576
This is available to all beta

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:16.106
apps that's feedback enabled.

00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:19.586
Tap on that it opens up a

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:21.066
dialogue for me to enter more

00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:21.906
information.

00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:24.506
Because I'm a Public Link tester

00:09:24.506 --> 00:09:25.756
I have the option to include an

00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:27.446
email address with this piece of

00:09:27.446 --> 00:09:29.696
feedback, but for now I'll just

00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:30.476
add some comments.

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:33.926
The text should be more

00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:37.166
consistent with the other trails

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:40.916
and I'll tap submit and that's

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:40.983
it.

00:09:41.056 --> 00:09:42.636
I just sent some feedback.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.576
[ Applause ]

00:09:47.076 --> 00:09:48.376
Thank you.

00:09:48.466 --> 00:09:49.416
Let's keep looking around.

00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:52.186
On a trail, I see some trails

00:09:52.186 --> 00:09:53.696
that I've saved on this app, and

00:09:53.736 --> 00:09:56.626
I can see that the icons on the

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:57.886
lower left are kind of clipped

00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:58.706
off-screen.

00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:00.966
So this might be a good place

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:01.756
for me to send some more

00:10:01.756 --> 00:10:02.206
feedback.

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:05.116
I'll take a screenshot and while

00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:06.586
I'm at it I'll take a second

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:09.066
screenshot too and that way I

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.556
can crop the first one, but

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:12.996
leave the second one intact for

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:13.386
context.

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:17.346
I'll even mark it up just to

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:18.486
point out where the issue is

00:10:18.486 --> 00:10:21.056
happening, and I'll tap done and

00:10:21.056 --> 00:10:22.066
share beta feedback.

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.966
Again, I can include comments

00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:27.416
about what the issue is, the

00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:29.436
icons are clipped off-screen,

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:32.196
and I'll tap submit.

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.896
And that's it.

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:36.536
I've sent multiple screenshots.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:36.976
Isn't that awesome?

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:41.696
[ Applause ]

00:10:42.196 --> 00:10:42.756
Let's keep testing around.

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:44.246
I'll tap on nearby and see what

00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:46.716
trails are around and let's find

00:10:46.716 --> 00:10:49.456
a Half Dome Trail on the map.

00:10:49.456 --> 00:10:50.786
Okay, Forest Explorer just

00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:52.676
crashed and this is a new

00:10:52.676 --> 00:10:53.626
feature that's a part of

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:54.166
feedback.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.396
Now when your beta apps crash,

00:10:56.746 --> 00:10:58.076
testers are prompted to share

00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.786
feedback about the crash.

00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:01.816
So I know my team will want to

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:03.266
know about this so I'll tap

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.946
share and here I can include

00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:07.546
steps on what caused the crash.

00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:09.996
Tapped on the Half Dome Trail

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:13.926
and the app crashed.

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:18.096
And that's it.

00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:19.026
I've just sent some crash

00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:20.556
feedback to my team and they'll

00:11:20.556 --> 00:11:22.086
know where to start debugging

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:23.356
thanks to the feedback I sent.

00:11:23.396 --> 00:11:25.926
So I think I'm done testing

00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:28.616
Forest Explorer for now, but as

00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:31.116
you can see, I've been able to

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.306
send a bunch of valuable

00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:33.886
feedback in just a few minutes

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:34.946
of testing.

00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:35.866
Isn't that exciting?

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:40.576
[ Applause ]

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:41.956
These are some really great

00:11:41.956 --> 00:11:43.006
features and sending feedback

00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:44.476
through TestFlight has never

00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:46.676
been easier and as a developer,

00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:47.886
you don't have to do any extra

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:50.046
work to get quality feedback

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:50.866
from your testers.

00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:53.756
So finally, let's talk about

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:54.956
managing the feedback in App

00:11:54.956 --> 00:11:55.426
Store Connect.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.126
You'll be able to view feedback

00:11:58.166 --> 00:11:59.496
submissions shortly after you

00:11:59.496 --> 00:12:01.426
receive them and you'll have

00:12:01.426 --> 00:12:03.596
helpful filters where you can

00:12:03.596 --> 00:12:05.346
find feedback that's important

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:06.976
to you.

00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:08.316
Each feedback submission will

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:10.076
include details about the tester

00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:12.626
and their device and each

00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:13.606
feedback will be available to

00:12:13.606 --> 00:12:15.176
download in a zip file.

00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:17.836
And in cases where you want to

00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:19.656
stop receiving feedback, you can

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:20.496
disable it too.

00:12:21.036 --> 00:12:21.976
So let's take a look at these in

00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:22.616
more detail.

00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:25.426
To manage your crash feedback

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:27.186
just select the Crashes tab in

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.486
TestFlight and from here you'll

00:12:29.486 --> 00:12:31.766
view detailed information about

00:12:31.766 --> 00:12:33.116
all the crashes you've received

00:12:33.116 --> 00:12:33.916
from your testers.

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:36.636
You can filter crashes by things

00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:38.486
like App Version, Build Version

00:12:38.486 --> 00:12:40.306
or Device Model to help find

00:12:40.346 --> 00:12:41.606
specific crashes you're looking

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:44.596
for, and each piece of feedback

00:12:44.966 --> 00:12:46.646
contains useful details about

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:48.456
the tester and their device at

00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:49.726
the time of the crash.

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.056
So you'll find things like

00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:53.686
connection type and free disk

00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:55.236
space available or even the

00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:57.296
battery life of the device when

00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:58.336
the app crashed.

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:00.096
And if you need to share

00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.796
feedback with members of your

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:03.076
team outside of App Store

00:13:03.076 --> 00:13:05.466
Connect, you can download a zip

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:07.766
file too and it'll include

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:09.416
everything you see plus the

00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:10.896
crash log when the crash

00:13:10.896 --> 00:13:11.456
happened.

00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:13.686
Now it's even easier for you to

00:13:13.686 --> 00:13:14.926
track down what caused your app

00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:15.586
to crash.

00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:18.576
So what about the screenshots

00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:20.166
that your testers send you?

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:22.436
Those live in the Screenshots

00:13:22.466 --> 00:13:23.476
Tab in TestFlight.

00:13:24.006 --> 00:13:26.346
You'll be able to find a gallery

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:28.926
of screenshots feedback that

00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:30.086
your testers have submitted.

00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:32.746
Just like in crashes you can

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:34.466
filter screenshots by some

00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:35.466
helpful filters.

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:37.526
For example, you may want to

00:13:37.526 --> 00:13:38.826
look for some feedback from

00:13:38.826 --> 00:13:40.436
testers using different devices

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:41.576
than the ones you normally build

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:41.886
with.

00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:45.166
So you can select the device

00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:47.226
like the iPhone SE, for example.

00:13:48.576 --> 00:13:50.066
And now filtered you can

00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:52.096
discover any issues on smaller

00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:52.596
screens.

00:13:52.696 --> 00:13:54.166
So here we see a couple of

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.406
screenshots testers have sent

00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:56.746
about Forest Explorer.

00:13:57.846 --> 00:13:58.966
Let's take a look at one more

00:13:58.966 --> 00:13:59.556
detail.

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:02.466
This tester is reporting a major

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.156
layout issue similar to the one

00:14:04.156 --> 00:14:05.086
we saw earlier.

00:14:07.116 --> 00:14:09.156
Screenshot feedbacks contain the

00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:10.776
same helpful details that you'll

00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:11.926
find in crash feedback.

00:14:13.056 --> 00:14:13.896
So you'll find things like

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:15.946
screen resolution, device model

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:18.026
or iOS version of the device.

00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:20.046
So paired with screenshots

00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:21.486
you'll be able to better

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.056
troubleshoot the testers

00:14:23.116 --> 00:14:23.506
feedback.

00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:26.816
You can also download a zip file

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.586
too and it'll include all the

00:14:28.586 --> 00:14:29.516
screenshots you see in

00:14:29.516 --> 00:14:32.196
TestFlight plus the details that

00:14:32.196 --> 00:14:33.156
are in App Store Connect.

00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:37.636
If at any point you want to stop

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:39.636
collecting feedback, you can

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:41.306
disable it at the tester group

00:14:41.306 --> 00:14:41.756
level.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:43.976
This means that your testers

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:45.396
will no longer see the

00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:47.406
onboarding screen or be able to

00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:49.026
send you feedback from directly

00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:50.606
within your app, but you can

00:14:50.606 --> 00:14:52.146
re-enable this at any time.

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:55.266
So these are some of the ways

00:14:55.266 --> 00:14:57.026
you can manage feedback that you

00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:58.696
receive through TestFlight and

00:14:58.696 --> 00:14:59.296
App Store Connect.

00:15:00.106 --> 00:15:01.526
With all these improvements,

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.546
you'll be able to receive more

00:15:03.546 --> 00:15:05.446
effective feedback at any point

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.506
during the testing phase and

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:08.666
testers can start sending you

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:10.356
feedback today.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:13.106
Anyone running iOS 13 will be

00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:14.416
able to use all of these new

00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:15.546
features in TestFlight.

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:18.686
We're really excited about

00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:21.206
TestFlight feedback, and we want

00:15:21.206 --> 00:15:22.976
to start receiving feedback from

00:15:22.976 --> 00:15:23.516
you too.

00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:26.766
So today we're announcing the

00:15:26.766 --> 00:15:28.476
TestFlight Beta Program.

00:15:29.076 --> 00:15:30.486
This means that you can get

00:15:30.486 --> 00:15:32.106
early versions of TestFlight for

00:15:32.106 --> 00:15:34.256
iOS, test the latest features

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:35.666
and give us feedback.

00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:38.036
You can sign up for the beta on

00:15:38.216 --> 00:15:39.876
a Developer Downloads Page.

00:15:40.696 --> 00:15:41.776
We're excited to receive

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:43.306
feedback and help improve

00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:44.656
TestFlight even more.

00:15:45.116 --> 00:15:46.626
Thank you so much, and I'll give

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:47.676
the stage back to Tommy.

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:54.556
[ Applause ]

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:55.886
Thanks, Payam.

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:57.456
Those are great new ways to

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.116
receive feedback about your beta

00:15:59.116 --> 00:15:59.496
apps.

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:01.756
After you've received feedback

00:16:01.826 --> 00:16:03.306
and you've iterated on your app,

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:05.456
it's time to transition to the

00:16:05.456 --> 00:16:08.056
App Store, but first something

00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:09.956
you'll likely think about is how

00:16:09.956 --> 00:16:10.686
to price your app.

00:16:11.196 --> 00:16:13.646
The App Store enables you to

00:16:13.646 --> 00:16:16.156
generate sales globally to

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:18.556
millions of customers in 155

00:16:18.556 --> 00:16:19.266
territories.

00:16:19.776 --> 00:16:22.076
We ensure that you can do

00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:23.736
business with as many customers

00:16:23.736 --> 00:16:25.876
as possible by consistently

00:16:25.876 --> 00:16:27.256
adding support for new payment

00:16:27.256 --> 00:16:29.716
methods so customers can pay for

00:16:29.716 --> 00:16:31.156
your app in whichever method

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:31.686
they prefer.

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:34.796
And with new support for the

00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:36.696
Korean won, you can now generate

00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:38.706
sales across 45 unique

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:39.316
currencies.

00:16:40.756 --> 00:16:42.446
Although you can generate sales

00:16:42.446 --> 00:16:44.246
across all currencies, your

00:16:44.246 --> 00:16:45.326
business doesn't need to handle

00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:48.326
payment for all them because we

00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:50.106
consolidate all of your proceeds

00:16:50.326 --> 00:16:51.736
into a single payment to your

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:52.306
bank account.

00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:55.106
For those of you who offer

00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:57.746
subscriptions you have 200

00:16:57.746 --> 00:16:58.936
different price tiers to choose

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:02.016
from, and we recently released a

00:17:02.016 --> 00:17:03.436
feature called Subscription

00:17:03.436 --> 00:17:03.986
Offers.

00:17:05.455 --> 00:17:06.915
These allow you to offer a

00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:08.746
discount or free period of

00:17:08.746 --> 00:17:11.996
service for subscriptions and

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:13.636
you decide which subscribers

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:14.846
qualify for the offer.

00:17:15.386 --> 00:17:18.336
This is a great way to retain

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.406
existing subscribers or to win

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:22.935
back previous subscribers.

00:17:28.656 --> 00:17:30.026
There's a lot of great ways to

00:17:30.026 --> 00:17:31.576
utilize subscriptions, but I

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:32.726
won't go into detail here

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:34.106
because we have two sessions on

00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:35.396
this tomorrow, and I encourage

00:17:35.396 --> 00:17:39.206
you to check these out.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:40.546
Now you've nailed down the

00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:42.216
pricing strategy and next

00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:43.236
there's something equally

00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:45.456
important to think about and

00:17:45.456 --> 00:17:46.286
that's how your app is

00:17:46.286 --> 00:17:47.696
represented in the App Store

00:17:47.696 --> 00:17:49.106
Product Page.

00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:51.946
This involves app naming,

00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:54.786
description and keywords which

00:17:54.786 --> 00:17:56.396
make it easier for customers to

00:17:56.396 --> 00:17:59.246
discover your app and when it

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.856
comes to reaching as many people

00:18:00.856 --> 00:18:03.036
as possible, a key aspect is

00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:03.886
localization.

00:18:04.436 --> 00:18:07.306
If we take English as an

00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:09.456
example, only about 5% of the

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:11.486
world speaks English as a first

00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:11.886
language.

00:18:12.576 --> 00:18:13.866
So when you localize your

00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:15.246
product page there's a huge

00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:16.776
opportunity to reach more

00:18:16.776 --> 00:18:17.106
people.

00:18:17.656 --> 00:18:20.746
We focus on supporting a lot of

00:18:20.746 --> 00:18:22.336
languages, and we recently added

00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:23.106
support for more.

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:24.626
To tell you more about these

00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:26.186
languages and how you localize

00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:27.596
your product page, I'd like to

00:18:27.596 --> 00:18:28.486
invite Ethar [phonetic] on

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:28.906
stage.

00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:38.796
Salam everyone.

00:18:38.956 --> 00:18:40.646
My name is Ethar Elsaka [assumed

00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:42.476
spelling], and I'm an engineer

00:18:42.576 --> 00:18:43.546
on App Store Connect.

00:18:44.316 --> 00:18:46.436
Today we will talk about a very

00:18:46.436 --> 00:18:48.066
exciting feature related to your

00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:48.896
apps metadata.

00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:51.686
We believe that localization is

00:18:51.686 --> 00:18:54.586
the key aspect for making your

00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:56.396
apps more accessible to the

00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:57.266
global audience.

00:18:57.876 --> 00:18:59.866
We are always working hard to

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:01.696
introduce new language support

00:19:01.696 --> 00:19:04.976
and just this past year we

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.876
introduced nine new languages

00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:09.826
bringing the total number of

00:19:09.826 --> 00:19:12.276
languages supported by the App

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.976
Store to 37 languages.

00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:19.646
[ Applause ]

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:22.286
Actually let me pause here and

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.106
give you a pop quiz.

00:19:25.216 --> 00:19:27.086
Who knows what does aikhtibar

00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:27.396
[phonetic] mean?

00:19:31.316 --> 00:19:33.586
And what about tatbiq?

00:19:35.636 --> 00:19:37.606
So here is your first Arabic

00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:38.036
lesson.

00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:41.206
Aikhtibar means test and tatbiq

00:19:41.206 --> 00:19:42.826
means app.

00:19:42.826 --> 00:19:44.436
If you wonder why I give you

00:19:44.436 --> 00:19:46.446
this Arabic quiz, this is

00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:48.016
because Arabic is one of the

00:19:48.136 --> 00:19:50.666
right to left languages and

00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:53.076
today I'm very excited to share

00:19:53.406 --> 00:19:55.346
that for the first time in the

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:58.706
App Store with iOS 13 we are

00:19:58.706 --> 00:19:59.966
supporting Arabic and Hebrew.

[ Applause ]

00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:12.026
So now these customers can set

00:20:12.146 --> 00:20:14.266
their iPhone language to Arabic

00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:17.456
or Hebrew and enjoy browsing our

00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:20.316
preferred language.

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:24.496
As you can imagine, this is not

00:20:24.496 --> 00:20:27.036
a small effort and it requires

00:20:27.136 --> 00:20:29.316
a rethink of almost every

00:20:29.316 --> 00:20:30.956
aspect of display and

00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:33.126
interaction, UI layout,

00:20:33.576 --> 00:20:35.936
navigation controls, animation

00:20:36.226 --> 00:20:37.726
and editorial artwork.

00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:42.766
We believe that the presence of

00:20:42.766 --> 00:20:45.416
localized app and editorial

00:20:45.416 --> 00:20:48.106
content will lead to a deeper

00:20:48.106 --> 00:20:50.186
and more integrated experience

00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:53.156
for hundreds of millions of

00:20:53.156 --> 00:20:57.596

So to let these customers enjoy

00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:07.426
our apps in their native

00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:10.726
language, we need to localize

00:21:10.726 --> 00:21:12.286
ours apps in App Store Connect

00:21:13.676 --> 00:21:15.466
and now let me show you how we

00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:16.000
can do that.

00:21:21.616 --> 00:21:24.336
Once I'm at the home page, I

00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:26.156
will click on my apps, which

00:21:26.156 --> 00:21:27.836
contains all the apps under the

00:21:27.836 --> 00:21:30.226
Nature Lab team.

00:21:33.356 --> 00:21:35.916
I choose to localize the first

00:21:35.916 --> 00:21:38.136
Explorer App to make it easier

00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:39.526
for my friends and family in

00:21:39.526 --> 00:21:40.346
Egypt to use it.

00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:43.416
I don't know where because we

00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:44.836
don't have forest in Egypt but

00:21:45.196 --> 00:21:45.976
maybe when they come visit.

that I want to localize and

00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:56.426
since this app has never been

00:21:56.426 --> 00:21:58.276
released it has only one

00:21:58.276 --> 00:21:58.566
version.

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:02.146
Let me add Arabic language from

00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:04.906
the drop-down menu on the right

00:22:06.776 --> 00:22:08.996
and now I'm ready to localize my

00:22:09.736 --> 00:22:09.806
app.

00:22:13.236 --> 00:22:15.256
I will need the promotional text

00:22:15.926 --> 00:22:20.106

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:22.336
in the App Store Connect, I will

00:22:22.336 --> 00:22:23.896
give the first Explorer for the

00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:26.896
Arab people for one year for

00:22:26.896 --> 00:22:27.156
free.

00:22:28.696 --> 00:22:31.256
I also need the description

00:22:32.576 --> 00:22:34.416
which has detailed information

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:36.096
about the Forest Explorer

00:22:36.096 --> 00:22:39.336
functionalities and features.

00:22:39.476 --> 00:22:41.716
I also need to add meaningful

00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:45.726
keywords to make my app more

00:22:45.726 --> 00:22:46.256
discovered.

00:22:46.836 --> 00:22:50.666
I can save for now, but I still

00:22:50.666 --> 00:22:53.976
need to add the screenshots and

00:22:54.286 --> 00:22:58.056
the support URL to be able to

00:22:58.056 --> 00:22:59.466
submit my app for review.

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:02.706
Now let me show you how the

00:23:02.706 --> 00:23:05.696
Forest Explorer will look in the

00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:08.096
App Store.

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:09.886
Here is how the Forest Explorer

00:23:09.886 --> 00:23:11.576
will look in the App Store after

00:23:11.576 --> 00:23:12.266
releasing it.

00:23:12.956 --> 00:23:13.376
Awesome.

00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:20.556
[ Applause ]

00:23:21.056 --> 00:23:23.206
Also I'm super excited that now

00:23:23.946 --> 00:23:26.036
TestFlight is available in

00:23:26.186 --> 00:23:28.256
Arabic and Hebrew, which I

00:23:28.346 --> 00:23:30.156
believe would provide a good

00:23:30.156 --> 00:23:32.606
experience for Arabic and Hebrew

00:23:32.606 --> 00:23:34.746
speaking tester while testing

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:34.976
apps.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:40.386
To summarize, we believe that

00:23:40.866 --> 00:23:43.336
localization is important to

00:23:43.336 --> 00:23:44.936
provide the best possible app

00:23:44.936 --> 00:23:46.506
experience for everyone.

00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:50.026
We have embraced this and now

00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:52.616
App Store supports 39 languages

00:23:52.876 --> 00:23:54.726
including Arabic and Hebrew,

00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:57.926
with right to left support for

00:23:57.926 --> 00:24:00.606
the first time today your app

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:03.506
can reach over 250 million

00:24:03.816 --> 00:24:06.976
potential customers.

00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:09.016
And, finally, don't forget to

00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:11.396
submit your Arabic and Hebrew

00:24:11.396 --> 00:24:13.226
localization in App Store

00:24:13.226 --> 00:24:14.476
Connect today.

00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:16.926
Thank you and let me hand it

00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:17.616
back to Tommy.

00:24:18.516 --> 00:24:23.786
[ Applause ]

00:24:24.286 --> 00:24:25.156
>> Thank you, Ethar.

00:24:26.876 --> 00:24:28.936
Localizing your product page is

00:24:28.936 --> 00:24:30.136
a great way to improve

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:32.416
discoverability and now you can

00:24:32.416 --> 00:24:34.076
do that for more languages than

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:34.686
ever before.

00:24:36.196 --> 00:24:38.366
Now you've built and iterated on

00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:40.076
your app, you've set a pricing

00:24:40.076 --> 00:24:42.066
strategy and you've localized

00:24:42.066 --> 00:24:42.826
your product page.

00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:45.786
The final step is submitting for

00:24:45.786 --> 00:24:46.156
review.

00:24:47.176 --> 00:24:48.716
To make sure that goes as smooth

00:24:48.716 --> 00:24:50.056
as possible we have some

00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:52.086
guidelines to keep in mind.

00:24:53.096 --> 00:24:54.966
The first one, of course, is

00:24:55.086 --> 00:24:56.826
please test your app on a device

00:24:56.826 --> 00:24:58.346
before submitting it.

00:24:59.176 --> 00:25:01.066
Ensure you fill out all app

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.466
information and metadata.

00:25:03.016 --> 00:25:06.086
Keep your contact info up to

00:25:06.086 --> 00:25:08.046
date so we can reach you if

00:25:08.046 --> 00:25:08.896
there are any issues.

00:25:09.436 --> 00:25:12.116
And if your app requires a

00:25:12.116 --> 00:25:13.896
login, well, that's something

00:25:13.896 --> 00:25:15.056
we're going to need in order to

00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:15.796
review your app.

00:25:16.356 --> 00:25:18.166
So, please add credentials for a

00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:18.756
demo account to the review

00:25:18.786 --> 00:25:18.906
notes.

00:25:18.936 --> 00:25:19.746
Also explain any non-obvious

00:25:19.776 --> 00:25:20.556
features and in-app purchases in

00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:20.976
the review notes.

00:25:21.776 --> 00:25:24.846
I also want to share some

00:25:24.946 --> 00:25:26.936
frequent feedback that we give

00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:35.496
developers during app review.

00:25:35.646 --> 00:25:37.496
Provide accurate screenshots

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:40.076
that show your app in use and

00:25:40.076 --> 00:25:42.046
make sure the UI corresponds to

00:25:42.046 --> 00:25:43.826
the correct device type.

00:25:46.616 --> 00:25:48.686
Only ask for login credentials

00:25:48.836 --> 00:25:50.316
when it's necessary to core

00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:50.986
functionality.

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:53.556
Apps cannot require personal

00:25:53.556 --> 00:25:57.826
info in order to function.

00:25:57.896 --> 00:25:59.416
When requesting access to user

00:25:59.416 --> 00:26:00.976
data, you need to provide

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.786
purpose strings that clearly

00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:04.646
describe how your app will use

00:26:05.296 --> 00:26:06.986
the data.

00:26:07.156 --> 00:26:08.406
Finally, if you offer

00:26:08.406 --> 00:26:09.846
subscriptions, make sure they're

00:26:09.846 --> 00:26:11.386
straight forward and very easy

00:26:11.386 --> 00:26:12.046
to understand.

00:26:12.686 --> 00:26:16.006
Now that your app has been

00:26:16.006 --> 00:26:17.926
reviewed you're ready for the

00:26:17.926 --> 00:26:21.136
App Store and after your app has

00:26:21.136 --> 00:26:22.326
spent some time on the store,

00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:24.166
you'll start to receive customer

00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:25.436
ratings and reviews.

00:26:26.006 --> 00:26:29.266
A great way to see and respond

00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:30.696
to reviews is with App Store

00:26:30.696 --> 00:26:32.056
Connect for iOS.

00:26:32.596 --> 00:26:35.056
You can also enable

00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:36.376
notifications for customer

00:26:36.376 --> 00:26:37.976
reviews so you can see

00:26:37.976 --> 00:26:39.046
immediately when your app

00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:40.296
receives a new review.

00:26:40.876 --> 00:26:44.416
It's also important to mention

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:46.346
that App Store Connect for iOS

00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:48.786
is now a localized app with

00:26:48.786 --> 00:26:51.936
support for 14 languages so you

00:26:51.936 --> 00:26:53.646
can see that localization is an

00:26:53.646 --> 00:26:55.336
important area of focus for all

00:26:55.336 --> 00:26:57.026
the tools available to you and

00:26:57.066 --> 00:26:57.986
your team.

00:27:00.576 --> 00:27:02.486
In addition to customer reviews,

00:27:02.486 --> 00:27:04.026
you have another important tool

00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:05.636
that can help you decide where

00:27:05.636 --> 00:27:06.466
to place your development

00:27:06.466 --> 00:27:09.216
efforts and that's analytics.

00:27:09.846 --> 00:27:12.396
With App Analytics you get a

00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:13.956
wealth of information into how

00:27:13.956 --> 00:27:15.966
your app is performing on the

00:27:16.506 --> 00:27:17.786
App Store.

00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:19.576
We recently added support for a

00:27:19.576 --> 00:27:21.636
new platform and that's Mac OS.

00:27:21.636 --> 00:27:24.736
So you can access powerful

00:27:24.736 --> 00:27:26.126
insight into how your app

00:27:26.126 --> 00:27:27.776
performs on the Mac App Store.

00:27:28.356 --> 00:27:32.196
Some of the metrics available

00:27:32.196 --> 00:27:33.386
for Mac will include

00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:35.346
Impressions, which is the number

00:27:35.346 --> 00:27:36.876
of times your app icon has been

00:27:36.876 --> 00:27:37.576
viewed in the store.

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:41.116
Product Page Views is the number

00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:42.266
of times your product page has

00:27:42.266 --> 00:27:43.306
been viewed.

00:27:44.036 --> 00:27:46.076
App Units shows how many times

00:27:46.076 --> 00:27:47.256
your app was downloaded from the

00:27:47.256 --> 00:27:47.566
store.

00:27:49.676 --> 00:27:52.246
And Sales will capture the total

00:27:52.246 --> 00:27:54.426
amount billed through purchases

00:27:54.426 --> 00:27:55.596
and in-app purchases.

00:27:57.836 --> 00:27:59.546
We're also introducing a

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:01.496
completely new metric for iOS

00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:04.086
Apps called App Deletions.

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:06.866
this will allow you to see the

00:28:06.866 --> 00:28:08.356
number of times your app is

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:09.916
uninstalled from customer's

00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:10.426
devices.

00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:14.286
You might use this to correlate

00:28:14.286 --> 00:28:16.636
deletions with an issue in a

00:28:16.636 --> 00:28:19.586
recent version of your app.

00:28:19.856 --> 00:28:21.706
Or another interesting view is

00:28:21.706 --> 00:28:23.886
Deletions by Source Type which

00:28:23.886 --> 00:28:25.526
shows if a given source is

00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:27.136
better able to retain customers

00:28:27.896 --> 00:28:29.856
or what source is resulting in

00:28:29.856 --> 00:28:30.746
the most deletions.

00:28:33.616 --> 00:28:35.036
There's one more exciting

00:28:35.036 --> 00:28:37.206
announcement about Sales Data.

00:28:37.856 --> 00:28:39.776
This is an entirely new time

00:28:39.776 --> 00:28:41.716
range and level of granularity

00:28:41.746 --> 00:28:45.176
for your sales data, the 24-Hour

00:28:45.176 --> 00:28:45.746
Dashboard.

00:28:46.286 --> 00:28:49.416
This gives you an hour by hour

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:51.576
view into the last 24 hours of

00:28:51.576 --> 00:28:52.526
sales performance.

00:28:53.176 --> 00:28:55.176
[ Applause ]

00:28:55.336 --> 00:28:55.736
That's right.

00:28:56.136 --> 00:28:58.136
[ Applause ]

00:28:58.256 --> 00:28:59.766
You no longer have to wait until

00:28:59.766 --> 00:29:01.346
the next business day to view

00:29:01.346 --> 00:29:02.026
your sales data.

00:29:03.346 --> 00:29:04.096
Let's take a look at the new

00:29:04.096 --> 00:29:04.596
dashboard.

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:08.046
Here we're looking at a sales

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.366
overview within Sales and

00:29:09.366 --> 00:29:11.296
Trends, and we see sales data

00:29:11.296 --> 00:29:13.126
for the last 7 days.

00:29:13.736 --> 00:29:15.516
If you filter this view, you can

00:29:15.516 --> 00:29:17.156
narrow it down to a handful of

00:29:17.156 --> 00:29:18.756
specific in-app purchases.

00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:20.876
At the bottom of the list we see

00:29:20.876 --> 00:29:22.526
a new in-app purchase that is

00:29:22.526 --> 00:29:23.276
just released today.

00:29:23.276 --> 00:29:26.336
You see that it doesn't have any

00:29:26.336 --> 00:29:27.156
sales data yet.

00:29:28.726 --> 00:29:29.856
This is one case where you'll

00:29:29.856 --> 00:29:31.226
want to use the 24-Hour

00:29:31.226 --> 00:29:31.746
Dashboard.

00:29:32.286 --> 00:29:34.936
So if you click on the calendar

00:29:34.936 --> 00:29:36.946
picker, you see a new option for

00:29:36.946 --> 00:29:38.036
Last 24 Hours.

00:29:39.086 --> 00:29:39.876
That will take you to the

00:29:39.876 --> 00:29:43.026
24-Hour Graph.

00:29:43.226 --> 00:29:45.006
Now you can see sales data on an

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:46.916
hourly basis and you can track

00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:48.406
the success of your brand new

00:29:48.406 --> 00:29:50.186
in-app purchase as it rolls out

00:29:50.186 --> 00:29:50.916
to customers.

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:53.486
You can see how this is a

00:29:53.486 --> 00:29:55.066
powerful new way to view your

00:29:55.066 --> 00:29:55.726
sales data.

00:29:58.516 --> 00:30:00.056
Within the App Lifecycle that

00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:02.836
brings us back to Xcode where we

00:30:02.836 --> 00:30:03.896
can take everything we've

00:30:03.896 --> 00:30:05.296
learned so far and continue

00:30:05.296 --> 00:30:07.296
creating great apps.

00:30:08.776 --> 00:30:10.766
We have some labs tomorrow at 9

00:30:10.766 --> 00:30:12.876
and 3, where you can come ask us

00:30:12.906 --> 00:30:14.216
questions about anything we've

00:30:14.216 --> 00:30:15.386
talked about.

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:18.296
As always, I can't wait to see
