[ Applause ]

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:14.336
>> Hi, everyone.

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.306
I'm so excited that you're able

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:19.136
to join us today.

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:21.226
I'm Kayur and I'm here with some

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.756
amazing designers, Rubii and

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:24.166
Cas.

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:25.996
And we're so excited to talk to

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:27.716
you today about design and

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:28.366
machine learning.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.686
You see, at Apple, we've been

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:33.326
thinking about design and

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:34.826
machine learning for some time

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:35.036
now.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.886
And when we think about and we

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.896
talk about machine learning, we

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:40.226
talk about all the amazing

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.056
technological advances in speech

00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:43.756
recognition and computer vision.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.896
We talk about deep neural nets.

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:48.306
We talk about custom processing

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:50.016
for on-device machine learning.

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.386
We talk about all these things

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:54.566
because we care about products

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.566
and we know that many of the

00:00:57.606 --> 00:01:00.066
products that we build today and

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.946
many of the products and

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:03.306
experiences that we want to

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:05.296
build in the future would not be

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.076
possible without machine

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:07.386
learning.

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:09.816
Let's take a look at some of the

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:11.366
products.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:12.226
AirPods.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.946
AirPods allow you to summon Siri

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.736
to control your device with your

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:17.056
voice.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.256
You can easily change your music

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:21.106
or answer a call all when your

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.796
hands are busy and when you

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:24.206
can't really look at the screen.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:26.466
This AirPods experience would

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.986
not be possible without machine

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:29.466
learning and it would not be

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.396
possible without Siri.

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:33.106
Machine learning allows us to

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:35.096
create Face ID which provides

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:36.966
fast secure authentication for

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.026
your iOS devices.

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:41.256
And we use machine learning in

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.226
ways that you may not expect,

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:47.376
subtle ways that improve your

00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:48.846
experience with your devices.

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:50.946
We use machine learning to

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.836
invisibly improve your typing

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:53.386
experience.

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.056
We increase or decrease the

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.626
target tap area for keyboard

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:59.256
buttons based on the word you're

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:00.076
most likely to type.

00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:02.586
Machine learning applications

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:03.376
are diverse.

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:05.576
They're not just about voice

00:02:05.576 --> 00:02:07.416
assistance or recommending

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:09.246
content or self-driving cars,

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:11.626
machine learning applications

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.536
are as diverse as any

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:14.576
application of software

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:15.206
engineering.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.016
They can make existing products

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.316
better or enable new products

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:21.046
that enrich the human

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:21.596
experience.

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:24.786
And inside Apple, we've been

00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:26.566
talking about and thinking about

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:28.776
what makes a great machine

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:30.026
learning product for some time

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:30.226
now.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.176
And to go into this in more

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:34.376
detail, let's dive into a single

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:35.626
experience, Photos.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.076
Photos uses machine learning in

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:39.026
a variety of ways.

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:40.766
Machine learning helps people

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.086
create albums, edit photos and

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.396
search for specific memories.

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:48.796
Speaking of memories, recently I

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:49.796
was looking for this memory.

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:51.256
This is Angie.

00:02:51.626 --> 00:02:53.216
She's a friend of the family and

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:54.226
this picture was taken from a

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:55.316
hike a few years ago.

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:58.116
I felt nostalgic and wanted to

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:59.126
share the picture with some

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:00.386
friends who were already there.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.136
Until very recently, finding a

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:04.566
specific picture was painful.

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:06.526
I'd have to sift through

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:08.506
thousands of pictures, try and

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:10.056
remember where I was or when I

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:10.706
took the picture.

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:12.036
I would've given up.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.036
Finding a picture used to be a

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:16.336
barrier to me engaging with my

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:17.696
memories and sharing them with

00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:18.326
my family.

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:22.046
In iOS X, Apple introduced a new

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:23.186
search experience that could

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:25.006
like inside a picture and

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.356
detect, among other things,

00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:26.706
dogs.

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:28.686
And over the years, we've been

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:29.946
making this experience better.

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:32.456
Here's what the experience looks

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:32.766
like now.

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:35.776
I tap on the Search box.

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:37.366
I type in dog.

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.086
And I get a list of pictures

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:39.496
with dogs.

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:41.006
I can then select the picture I

00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:42.296
was looking for and share it.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:43.236
Easy peasy.

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:45.976
Searching for pictures based on

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.016
what's in a picture changes how

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:49.176
we engage with our memories.

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:50.746
It's something we take for

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:51.166
granted.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:52.966
In fact, it's such a great

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.556
experience it's hard to remember

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.976
a time before we had this

00:03:55.976 --> 00:03:56.606
capability.

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:58.096
It's well designed.

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:00.736
And there's a lot of interface

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.656
work that goes into making this

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:03.236
experience.

00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:05.446
Photos suggest categories you

00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:06.776
can search for, it

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.546
auto-completes searches and it

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:09.706
connects search results to

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:12.276
Moments but designing this

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:13.916
experience is more than just

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.836
designing a grid view in the

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:16.456
Search field.

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:18.106
If we just looked at the

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.916
interface, we'd miss the most

00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:21.016
important parts of the search

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.166
experience, the results being

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.146
outputted into categories that

00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:26.006
people can search for.

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:29.316
These aspects of the experience

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:30.276
should be designed.

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:32.216
We get to decide which

00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.076
categories are included and we

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:35.756
decide the level of quality we

00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:38.576
want for each category.

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:40.256
We've realized that to build a

00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:41.116
good machine learning

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:42.886
experience, we have to design

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:44.176
more than just the interface.

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:45.276
What do we mean?

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:47.996
Well, when most people think

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.576
about design, they think about

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:51.206
the interface, how the product

00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:53.236
looks and feels, the flow of the

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:53.846
experience.

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:57.446
With machine learning, we have

00:04:57.516 --> 00:04:59.576
to design how the product works.

00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:01.796
Now we know that many of you in

00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:02.916
the design and developer

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.626
community have some machine

00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:05.456
learning experience.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:06.826
You could create a search

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:08.696
experience from scratch but to

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:10.066
get everyone on the same page,

00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:11.646
let's look at how machine

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:12.946
learning for photo search works.

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:16.536
Deep within the logic of Photos

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.436
is a function that takes a

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:20.346
picture and detects if that

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:21.626
picture contains any of the

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:22.976
categories it can recognize.

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:25.206
In our case, it recognizes that

00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:26.626
this picture of Angie has a dog

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:27.506
in it.

00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:30.006
In traditional programming, we

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:30.986
would have to create the

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.596
function by writing code to tell

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:34.906
the computer what to do.

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.536
Our code would have to work for

00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:39.286
a variety of different breeds,

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:42.566
different scenarios, different

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:44.626
photo resolutions because their

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:46.256
customers are diverse and so are

00:05:46.256 --> 00:05:46.836
their dogs.

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:48.956
And we wouldn't want a search

00:05:48.956 --> 00:05:50.196
for dogs to be littered with

00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:51.336
pictures of other animals.

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:52.796
Our code would have to

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:54.696
differentiate between dogs and

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.576
similar animals, like this hyena

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:58.416
which looks like a dog but you

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.446
should not have as a pet.

00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:03.656
Writing code that generalizes

00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:05.196
the countless variations of dogs

00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:06.776
in photos would be impossible.

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:08.516
And dogs are just one of

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:09.776
thousands of categories that

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:10.766
Photos can recognize.

00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:13.476
There're experiences we want to

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:15.096
create where we can't just tell

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:16.076
the computer what to do.

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:18.306
And for many of these

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:20.256
experiences, we can use machine

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:22.076
learning to teach a computer

00:06:22.076 --> 00:06:22.606
what to do.

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:25.416
We teach by providing examples.

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:26.526
If we wanted to distinguish

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:28.086
pictures of dogs from pictures

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:29.936
that do not contain dogs, we

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:31.296
have to provide pictures with

00:06:31.296 --> 00:06:32.706
dogs and pictures without dogs.

00:06:33.566 --> 00:06:35.786
Machine learning learns a

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.856
function that we can later use

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.186
in our app.

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.366
This function can take this

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:42.966
picture of Angie and understand

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:43.916
that it's a picture of a dog.

00:06:44.796 --> 00:06:46.776
We call this function a model

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:50.296
and a model is what makes the

00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:53.026
Photos Search experience work.

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:56.436
This model can generalize two

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:57.576
pictures that it's never seen

00:06:57.576 --> 00:06:57.886
before.

00:06:58.326 --> 00:06:59.686
It can recognize different dog

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:01.766
species and differentiate dogs

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:03.406
from other animals and objects.

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.226
Models are central to the

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:07.246
machine learning experience.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:09.876
Every product or experience that

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.026
depends on machine learning

00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:11.896
depends on a model.

00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:14.736
Siri has a model that converts

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:15.436
your voice to text.

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.986
And the keyboard has a model

00:07:17.986 --> 00:07:19.686
that infers the key you meant to

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:20.726
type based on the letters you've

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:21.776
already typed and your typing

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:21.976
history.

00:07:27.176 --> 00:07:29.506
To design a great machine

00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:31.776
learning experience, we have to

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:35.226
design both how it works and how

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:35.966
it looks and feels.

00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:38.606
We have to design both the model

00:07:38.606 --> 00:07:39.486
and the interface.

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:41.696
In this talk, we'll cover both.

00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:44.006
Creating a model can be

00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:44.746
complicated.

00:07:44.746 --> 00:07:46.456
You have to make a lot of

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:48.256
decisions about algorithms and

00:07:48.256 --> 00:07:49.406
parameters and frameworks.

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:51.536
And all of these decisions

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:53.736
affect what the model does and,

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:54.696
therefore, the experience.

00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:57.506
Machine learning decisions are

00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.646
all design decisions but not all

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.336
of them are effective places for

00:08:02.336 --> 00:08:03.026
design input.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.836
We choose a few places where we

00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:07.236
think design can have the most

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:08.046
impact.

00:08:09.116 --> 00:08:11.236
We talk about the need to design

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:12.616
what we use to teach the

00:08:12.616 --> 00:08:13.076
computer.

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:14.056
This is the data.

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:17.176
And we also talk about how we

00:08:17.176 --> 00:08:18.936
design what we evaluate and

00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:22.736
these are the metrics.

00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:24.756
Along with the model, we do need

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:25.776
to design the interface.

00:08:26.726 --> 00:08:27.886
We have to design what the model

00:08:27.886 --> 00:08:29.566
outputs and how those model's

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:31.066
outputs are presented to people.

00:08:31.916 --> 00:08:33.336
We also have to design how

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:34.616
people interact with the model

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:36.905
and, if appropriate, provide

00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:38.385
input to improve the model.

00:08:38.946 --> 00:08:40.466
Rubii and Cas will talk about

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:41.000
that later.

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:44.476
So let's start.

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:47.926
Let's talk about the data.

00:08:50.476 --> 00:08:52.366
To recognize dogs in pictures,

00:08:52.706 --> 00:08:54.896
we used machine learning to

00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:56.606
create a model using examples.

00:08:57.926 --> 00:08:59.576
Those examples are called data.

00:09:00.176 --> 00:09:02.596
And to build a good search

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:04.146
experience, you need a lot of

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:04.686
diverse data.

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:06.886
You need photos of the

00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:08.386
categories that you want people

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:09.436
to be able to search for.

00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:11.516
You need to provide plenty of

00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:13.736
pictures of dogs and of other

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:15.636
animals to ensure the search

00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:17.676
experience doesn't show random

00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:18.626
animals when you're searching

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:19.086
for dogs.

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:21.396
And a good search experience

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:23.036
needs to support thousands of

00:09:23.036 --> 00:09:24.556
categories that cover the

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:25.976
objects and events people want

00:09:25.976 --> 00:09:26.486
to search for.

00:09:27.246 --> 00:09:28.186
And for each of those

00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:29.526
categories, you'll need data.

00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:31.226
If you want to support a new

00:09:31.226 --> 00:09:32.566
category, you'll need data.

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:34.166
If you want to improve an

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:35.916
existing category, you will need

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:36.336
data.

00:09:36.956 --> 00:09:39.036
Choosing data is key to

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:40.186
designing the experience.

00:09:41.676 --> 00:09:43.696
Data determines the behavior of

00:09:43.696 --> 00:09:44.286
a model.

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:46.246
It's easily the most important

00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:47.246
decision you'll make when

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:48.056
creating your model.

00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:50.086
And if you don't have data that

00:09:50.596 --> 00:09:52.206
captures an important scenario,

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:54.546
it's unlikely that your model's

00:09:54.546 --> 00:09:55.386
going to work well in that

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:55.956
scenario.

00:09:56.496 --> 00:09:59.336
And since data determines the

00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:01.396
behavior of the model, and since

00:10:01.396 --> 00:10:02.716
the behavior of the model

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.066
determines the experience, data

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:07.546
needs to be designed to reflect

00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:09.276
good values in the best interest

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.106
of your customers.

00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:12.846
To understand this better, let's

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:13.656
look at an example.

00:10:14.806 --> 00:10:15.786
Let's look at Portrait mode.

00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.276
Portrait mode uses machine

00:10:19.276 --> 00:10:21.636
learning to detect faces and

00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:22.896
segment your body from the

00:10:22.896 --> 00:10:23.406
background.

00:10:24.776 --> 00:10:26.846
Historically, face recognition

00:10:26.846 --> 00:10:28.516
hasn't worked well for people of

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:28.886
color.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.486
At Apple, we want to make sure

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:33.406
our experiences are inclusive.

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:35.556
So our design and engineering

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:37.666
teams gather data from across

00:10:37.736 --> 00:10:39.406
different races, different

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.656
cultures, and different

00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:41.196
scenarios.

00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:43.666
We built a dataset that matched

00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:45.776
the experience we wanted to

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:46.646
create.

00:10:47.316 --> 00:10:49.366
We collected data intentionally.

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:51.106
When collecting data, it's

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:52.266
important to ask questions.

00:10:52.836 --> 00:10:54.306
Who is collecting the data?

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:56.056
What data are they collecting?

00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:57.336
And how are they doing it?

00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.886
Data bias can seep into your

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:01.416
dataset in a variety of ways.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.976
And data bias extends beyond

00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:04.336
fairness.

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:07.056
You should strive to be fair and

00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:07.516
inclusive.

00:11:07.836 --> 00:11:08.966
Those are good values.

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:11.576
But you should also see how data

00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:13.276
collection might skew away from

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:14.266
other design intents.

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:16.596
If you're creating a fun or

00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:18.396
enriching experience, you should

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:20.406
sample data for fun, enriching

00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:21.076
experiences.

00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:23.036
If your product is going to be

00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:25.166
used outdoors, you should sample

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:26.006
from scenarios that are

00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:26.656
outdoors.

00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:29.446
It's tempting to disconnect from

00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:31.146
this decision and make decisions

00:11:31.146 --> 00:11:33.566
about data collection that just

00:11:33.566 --> 00:11:35.146
sample the data from your

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:37.126
existing customers and get a

00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:38.816
uniform sample of the world from

00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:41.776
other mechanisms but you can't

00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:43.256
just reflect the world.

00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:45.116
Reflecting the world can

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:46.456
reinforce systemic biases.

00:11:47.336 --> 00:11:48.506
You shouldn't optimize for the

00:11:48.506 --> 00:11:50.076
customers you have.

00:11:50.526 --> 00:11:51.526
You should optimize for the

00:11:51.526 --> 00:11:52.736
customers you want.

00:11:53.696 --> 00:11:55.176
You shouldn't reflect the world

00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:55.646
as it is.

00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:57.756
You should reflect a better

00:11:57.756 --> 00:11:59.336
world, that world that you want

00:11:59.336 --> 00:11:59.636
it to be.

00:12:00.696 --> 00:12:02.806
Collecting data is a way to

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.526
design experiences and great

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:07.306
experiences often change the

00:12:07.306 --> 00:12:07.706
world.

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:09.536
They don't just reflect what

00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:10.426
already exists.

00:12:11.886 --> 00:12:13.166
So how do we put this into

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:14.000
practice?

00:12:15.676 --> 00:12:17.796
We'll start by collecting data

00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:18.506
intentionally.

00:12:19.226 --> 00:12:20.876
Understand the experience you're

00:12:20.876 --> 00:12:22.526
trying to create and think about

00:12:22.526 --> 00:12:23.646
what you'll need to make that

00:12:23.646 --> 00:12:24.496
experience work.

00:12:25.326 --> 00:12:26.426
If specific scenarios are

00:12:26.426 --> 00:12:28.096
important, spend more time and

00:12:28.096 --> 00:12:29.296
ensure you collect data for

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:30.046
those scenarios.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.896
Spending time up front

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:35.976
collecting the right data can

00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:37.836
save time and effort and money

00:12:37.836 --> 00:12:38.166
later.

00:12:38.726 --> 00:12:41.566
Make sure you test for biases.

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:43.516
Analyze your dataset.

00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:45.656
Catalogue your assumptions about

00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:47.106
who will use your product and

00:12:47.106 --> 00:12:48.086
how it will be used.

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:50.126
Think of ways your data might be

00:12:50.126 --> 00:12:51.806
biased towards or against

00:12:51.806 --> 00:12:53.266
certain populations or certain

00:12:53.266 --> 00:12:54.016
experiences.

00:12:54.486 --> 00:12:58.446
Update data as products change.

00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:01.476
Product specifications change

00:13:01.476 --> 00:13:02.446
the more you learn about your

00:13:02.446 --> 00:13:04.566
customers or the market or what

00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:05.896
you want to actually create.

00:13:06.946 --> 00:13:08.106
You need to change your data to

00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:08.616
match.

00:13:09.236 --> 00:13:10.326
You may not need to collect more

00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:10.596
data.

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:12.926
You may get rid of concepts that

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:15.066
are not important but you must

00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:17.476
routinely align your data with

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:18.506
your product goals.

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:22.926
And beware of standard datasets.

00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:25.006
Academic or industry benchmark

00:13:25.006 --> 00:13:27.386
datasets might be a great way to

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:29.266
start to get some knowledge

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:30.266
about how machine learning

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:30.596
works.

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:32.196
It might be a great way to ramp

00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:33.516
up your product development

00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:34.066
process.

00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:35.986
But they're not designed to

00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:37.736
represent real experiences,

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.666
especially your experience.

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:41.596
Before you start using an

00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:43.326
off-the-shelf dataset, think

00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:44.506
about what the data covers and

00:13:44.506 --> 00:13:45.116
doesn't cover.

00:13:45.556 --> 00:13:47.276
Spend time augmenting the data

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:48.666
to match your needs.

00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:52.926
Spending time thinking about

00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:55.916
cataloguing and critically

00:13:56.196 --> 00:13:58.376
collecting data can help you

00:13:58.376 --> 00:13:59.976
align what you want your product

00:13:59.976 --> 00:14:02.156
to be and what machine learning

00:14:02.156 --> 00:14:02.726
can provide.

00:14:03.226 --> 00:14:06.906
So, we just talked about data,

00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:08.376
which is what you use to teach a

00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:08.756
model.

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:11.576
Next, let's talk about how you

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:12.396
evaluate your model.

00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:14.906
This is done through metrics.

00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:18.376
You evaluate your model by

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:18.946
testing it.

00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:20.566
In the Photo Search example,

00:14:21.116 --> 00:14:22.226
you'd give it pictures of

00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:24.206
animals and your model would

00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:25.476
predict what's in the pictures.

00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:27.076
And once it's done, you can

00:14:27.076 --> 00:14:28.536
compare how many times it was

00:14:28.886 --> 00:14:31.006
correct and how many times it

00:14:31.006 --> 00:14:31.786
was incorrect.

00:14:32.406 --> 00:14:34.676
Here, we see that the model gave

00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:36.656
the correct prediction 75% of

00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:37.016
the time.

00:14:37.686 --> 00:14:39.526
This is a metric and a metric

00:14:39.676 --> 00:14:41.846
like this will define how

00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:43.686
successful your model is and,

00:14:43.686 --> 00:14:45.216
therefore, whether it's ready to

00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:46.706
use or whether you have to go

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:47.786
back to the drawing board and

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:48.676
improve it.

00:14:49.146 --> 00:14:51.366
Models can be evaluated in many

00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:51.776
ways.

00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:53.346
You could look at how fast the

00:14:53.346 --> 00:14:54.846
model works or how many

00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:55.936
categories it can support.

00:14:56.316 --> 00:14:57.576
You can balance all of these

00:14:57.576 --> 00:14:59.286
together and find the right set

00:14:59.286 --> 00:15:00.846
of metrics for your problem.

00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:04.096
Designing metrics define how the

00:15:04.096 --> 00:15:05.526
model will work and, therefore,

00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:06.956
how the experience will work but

00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:10.966
ultimately you get to decide.

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:12.886
Metrics encode what you think a

00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:13.836
good experience is.

00:15:14.296 --> 00:15:15.776
They define what you care about

00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:16.816
and what you can ignore.

00:15:17.906 --> 00:15:19.476
If part of the experience is not

00:15:19.476 --> 00:15:21.246
measured, it may be sacrificed

00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:22.436
for something that is.

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:25.326
And as a consequence, your

00:15:25.326 --> 00:15:28.416
metrics reflect your values.

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.436
Let's look at an example.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:32.826
Let's look at Face ID.

00:15:34.256 --> 00:15:36.296
Face ID uses machine learning to

00:15:36.296 --> 00:15:38.376
detect your face to unlock your

00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:38.726
device.

00:15:40.236 --> 00:15:42.136
And behind Face ID are a number

00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:43.126
of design intents.

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:45.026
The most important is Face ID

00:15:45.026 --> 00:15:46.426
needs to be secure.

00:15:46.786 --> 00:15:48.546
Our customers trust us with some

00:15:48.546 --> 00:15:49.676
of their most private data.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.856
There are many metrics that we

00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:53.946
use to track different aspects

00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:54.576
of security.

00:15:55.256 --> 00:15:56.776
One key metric was the chance

00:15:56.806 --> 00:15:58.666
that a random person could find

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.206
your phone, pick it up and

00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:00.746
unlock it.

00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:02.816
We tracked this metric and

00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:05.146
worked hard to reduce this

00:16:05.826 --> 00:16:05.976
chance.

00:16:06.136 --> 00:16:07.856
At launch, we knew that there

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:09.316
was a one-in-a-million chance

00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:10.916
that a random person could

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:12.526
unlock your phone using Face ID.

00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:14.976
And since Face ID was a new

00:16:14.976 --> 00:16:16.526
experience, we needed to

00:16:16.526 --> 00:16:17.886
communicate this to our

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:18.356
customers.

00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:20.586
That way they understood that we

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:21.646
cared about their data and they

00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:23.106
could actually trust Face ID.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.786
But one in a million doesn't

00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:26.746
tell the whole story.

00:16:27.766 --> 00:16:30.066
Each failure is a person, a

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:32.106
scenario, an experience that we

00:16:32.106 --> 00:16:35.286
have to think about and address.

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:36.256
Say you're me.

00:16:36.606 --> 00:16:38.786
I'm your average run-of-the-mill

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:43.296
Apple employee and recently I

00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:46.216
had a run-in with the new

00:16:46.216 --> 00:16:47.056
MacBook Pro.

00:16:47.366 --> 00:16:48.916
Due to a small mishap, I

00:16:49.066 --> 00:16:50.746
accidentally opened up a portal

00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:51.736
to another timeline.

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:55.776
Now I have to routinely fight

00:16:55.776 --> 00:16:57.276
off my mirror universe nemesis.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.566
I obviously don't want him

00:16:59.566 --> 00:17:01.716
accessing secret Apple data, so

00:17:01.716 --> 00:17:03.766
I have to rely on a pass code.

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:06.955
And people like me with similar

00:17:06.955 --> 00:17:08.546
looking family members or evil

00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:10.306
twins need to take the same

00:17:10.306 --> 00:17:10.846
precautions.

00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:14.646
As Apple, we also talked about

00:17:14.756 --> 00:17:15.675
this limitation.

00:17:16.146 --> 00:17:18.596
We dedicated time in a keynote

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.026
because it's important that our

00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:23.046
customers understand and take

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:24.556
steps to secure their data.

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.656
It's important for you to

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:27.886
understand and communicate

00:17:27.886 --> 00:17:30.386
limitations to unpack aggregate

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:31.076
statistics.

00:17:31.566 --> 00:17:34.256
Not all mistakes are equal.

00:17:35.126 --> 00:17:37.266
Mistakes in machine learning are

00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:37.866
inevitable.

00:17:38.296 --> 00:17:40.126
Few models work 100% of the

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:40.536
time.

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.396
When you start, you may not

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.296
understand all the limitations.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:45.756
That's OK.

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.286
It's an iterative process.

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:50.136
But over time, you need to build

00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:51.876
a better understanding of what

00:17:51.926 --> 00:17:53.426
is and is not possible.

00:17:54.446 --> 00:17:56.306
Mistakes don't mean you can't

00:17:56.306 --> 00:17:57.676
create an experience that people

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:57.966
love.

00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:00.066
If you understand mistakes, you

00:18:00.066 --> 00:18:02.406
can account for them either by

00:18:02.526 --> 00:18:04.436
creating new models, improving

00:18:04.436 --> 00:18:06.286
the product or clearly

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:07.386
communicating technical

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:07.976
limitations.

00:18:10.366 --> 00:18:12.196
And remember that metrics are

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:14.696
proxies for what we actually

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:15.196
care about.

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:17.656
Metrics provide numbers, a sense

00:18:17.656 --> 00:18:20.156
of scientific accuracy, and it's

00:18:20.306 --> 00:18:22.386
easy to get caught up in numbers

00:18:22.386 --> 00:18:24.326
and improving them but we

00:18:24.326 --> 00:18:26.096
ultimately care about abstract

00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:26.606
concepts.

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:28.646
These things are hard to measure

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:30.926
like good experiences, happy

00:18:30.926 --> 00:18:32.396
customers and strong brands.

00:18:33.256 --> 00:18:34.836
Let's look at an example.

00:18:35.976 --> 00:18:37.386
To understand metrics as

00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:39.486
proxies, let's talk about the

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:40.876
App Store.

00:18:41.056 --> 00:18:42.556
The App Store uses machine

00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.346
learning to recommend new apps

00:18:44.866 --> 00:18:46.176
based on what you've downloaded.

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.476
And at first approximation, the

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:50.186
amount of time a person spends

00:18:50.186 --> 00:18:51.526
in the app might be a good

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:51.896
measure.

00:18:52.226 --> 00:18:52.426
Right?

00:18:52.426 --> 00:18:54.426
Afterall, the more time you

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:55.526
spend doing something, the more

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:56.036
you like it.

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:59.246
And if the App Store is purely

00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:00.756
driven by metrics and models,

00:19:01.416 --> 00:19:02.566
people would see apps that are

00:19:02.566 --> 00:19:04.016
very similar to the apps they

00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:04.686
currently use.

00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:06.426
I like playing games.

00:19:06.886 --> 00:19:08.786
So my top recommended apps are

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:09.386
all games.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.176
And for a while, I might like

00:19:12.206 --> 00:19:14.006
those recommendations but over

00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:15.686
time, I'd feel boxed in because

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:16.946
I care about more than just

00:19:16.946 --> 00:19:17.306
games.

00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:20.886
People have diverse interests

00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:21.406
and tastes.

00:19:22.146 --> 00:19:23.576
The amount of time I spend in an

00:19:23.576 --> 00:19:25.236
app may not indicate how much I

00:19:25.236 --> 00:19:26.366
value it.

00:19:27.076 --> 00:19:29.156
The App Store makes an editorial

00:19:29.156 --> 00:19:30.516
content with recommendations.

00:19:31.076 --> 00:19:32.416
This allows people to explore a

00:19:32.416 --> 00:19:34.016
diverse set of applications and

00:19:34.016 --> 00:19:35.836
experiences that they may not

00:19:35.836 --> 00:19:37.886
normally see if they just got

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.116
their top recommendations.

00:19:40.126 --> 00:19:42.346
Editorial content is a way to

00:19:42.346 --> 00:19:43.866
address limitations of metrics

00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:44.916
and recommendations.

00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:47.386
But as you deploy your products

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.696
and learn more about customer

00:19:48.696 --> 00:19:50.626
needs, what you care about

00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:51.246
evolves.

00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:54.666
You can evolve your metrics to

00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:55.156
match.

00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:57.376
For example, you can bake

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:59.186
diversity into your metrics.

00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:01.246
You can measure when people

00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:03.406
engage with diverse content and

00:20:03.406 --> 00:20:05.286
actively create models that

00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:06.886
balance the quality and

00:20:06.886 --> 00:20:08.336
diversity of apps that people

00:20:08.336 --> 00:20:08.866
engage in.

00:20:10.056 --> 00:20:11.156
You should ensure that your

00:20:11.156 --> 00:20:12.506
metrics still track what you

00:20:12.506 --> 00:20:15.106
care about: a good experience,

00:20:15.636 --> 00:20:16.896
happy and fulfilled customers

00:20:16.896 --> 00:20:17.736
and strong brands.

00:20:18.606 --> 00:20:19.906
But to do that, you need to

00:20:19.906 --> 00:20:21.346
question metrics to ensure

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:21.856
they're relevant.

00:20:21.856 --> 00:20:25.836
In your day to day, you can put

00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:26.546
this into practice.

00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:29.756
You can try to understand

00:20:29.986 --> 00:20:31.716
mistakes because not all

00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:32.616
mistakes are equal.

00:20:33.256 --> 00:20:34.436
Group failure cases into

00:20:34.436 --> 00:20:35.746
categories and scenarios.

00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:37.566
This will help you understand

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:39.116
how important each scenario is.

00:20:39.776 --> 00:20:41.586
Decide if it's best handled by a

00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:43.636
non-ML approach like improving

00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:45.866
the design or if you actually

00:20:45.866 --> 00:20:46.796
need to build a better model.

00:20:47.366 --> 00:20:49.826
And design for failure

00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:50.396
scenarios.

00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:52.706
When storyboarding or sketching

00:20:52.706 --> 00:20:54.416
out an experience, don't just

00:20:54.476 --> 00:20:55.656
sketch out what happens if

00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:56.446
things go well.

00:20:57.246 --> 00:20:58.356
Sketch out what happens if

00:20:58.356 --> 00:20:59.286
something goes wrong.

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.396
This will help you emphasize

00:21:01.396 --> 00:21:02.306
what your customers might

00:21:02.306 --> 00:21:02.886
experience.

00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:06.886
Spend time evaluating the

00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:07.556
experience.

00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:09.466
The metric will give you an

00:21:09.466 --> 00:21:11.056
objective value for how well

00:21:11.056 --> 00:21:11.926
your model is working.

00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:14.166
Remember, the model is not the

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:14.816
experience.

00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:17.206
The actual experience is the

00:21:17.206 --> 00:21:18.236
experience.

00:21:18.596 --> 00:21:19.946
So try to measure that

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:20.556
experience.

00:21:21.036 --> 00:21:22.096
Run user studies.

00:21:22.436 --> 00:21:23.256
Build demos.

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:25.096
Talk to your customers.

00:21:25.216 --> 00:21:26.096
Read forums.

00:21:27.026 --> 00:21:28.796
If the experience is bad and the

00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:29.906
metric says it's good, your

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:32.046
metric is probably wrong.

00:21:32.606 --> 00:21:34.526
If the experience seems the same

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:35.546
the metric says it's getting

00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:37.726
better, your metric is likely

00:21:37.726 --> 00:21:38.216
wrong.

00:21:38.776 --> 00:21:42.336
And over time, evolve your

00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:42.806
metrics.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:44.636
Question and assess the

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.786
effectiveness of your metrics

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:46.606
constantly.

00:21:47.176 --> 00:21:48.546
The more you rely on something,

00:21:48.606 --> 00:21:51.946
the more you should question it.

00:21:53.456 --> 00:21:55.836
Ultimately, your metrics reflect

00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:56.496
your values.

00:21:57.016 --> 00:21:59.716
And if you want to align your

00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:00.656
metrics with your values, you

00:22:00.656 --> 00:22:01.516
have to think carefully,

00:22:01.626 --> 00:22:03.356
critically and continuously

00:22:03.646 --> 00:22:04.686
about what is and is not

00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:05.026
measured.

00:22:05.536 --> 00:22:08.366
We just talked about metrics

00:22:08.876 --> 00:22:10.066
which is how you understand if

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:11.646
the model is good, how you

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:14.446
evaluate a model.

00:22:14.606 --> 00:22:16.616
Next, let's talk about the

00:22:16.616 --> 00:22:17.226
interface.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.106
Designing metrics in data is key

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:21.006
to designing how your model

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:21.356
behaves.

00:22:22.226 --> 00:22:23.766
But we also have to figure out

00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:25.696
how do we surface the model in

00:22:25.696 --> 00:22:26.236
the interface.

00:22:26.436 --> 00:22:27.876
And to do that, I'll hand it

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:30.096
over to Rubii and Cas to talk

00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:31.696
more about outputs/inputs.

00:22:31.946 --> 00:22:32.696
Thank you so much.

00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:37.500
[ Applause ]

00:22:46.126 --> 00:22:47.836
>> As Kayur has shown, there's a

00:22:47.836 --> 00:22:49.856
lot that goes into creating the

00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:51.286
underlying machine learning

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:52.506
system that powers an

00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:53.136
experience.

00:22:54.036 --> 00:22:55.356
But we also need to design

00:22:55.356 --> 00:22:57.336
interfaces that allow people to

00:22:57.336 --> 00:22:58.636
interact with the experience in

00:22:58.636 --> 00:22:59.756
an intuitive way.

00:23:00.416 --> 00:23:02.926
The interface can translate

00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:04.586
results from a model to outputs

00:23:04.806 --> 00:23:05.676
that people can actually

00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:06.286
interact with.

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:08.436
The feedback we collect from

00:23:08.436 --> 00:23:10.466
these interactions are inputs we

00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:11.916
can use to future improve the

00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:12.506
experience.

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:16.996
We've created a set of patterns

00:23:17.116 --> 00:23:18.126
in the human interface

00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:19.786
guidelines to help you design

00:23:19.786 --> 00:23:21.086
output and inputs.

00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:23.336
Cas and I will go in-depth

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:24.506
through some of them to help you

00:23:24.506 --> 00:23:26.316
understand how they apply to the

00:23:26.316 --> 00:23:27.236
experience you're building.

00:23:27.236 --> 00:23:31.416
First let's talk about outputs.

00:23:31.486 --> 00:23:34.326
Outputs can be more than just

00:23:34.326 --> 00:23:34.856
predictions.

00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:36.706
They're a design medium that can

00:23:36.786 --> 00:23:38.306
augment an experience into

00:23:38.306 --> 00:23:39.506
something that feels more

00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:41.326
contextual and seamlessly

00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:41.776
helpful.

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.406
There are four types of outputs

00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:47.436
we'll discuss.

00:23:47.556 --> 00:23:48.986
Multiple options allow you to

00:23:49.026 --> 00:23:51.196
present a diverse set of outputs

00:23:51.746 --> 00:23:53.686
to people.

00:23:53.806 --> 00:23:55.626
Attributions are explanations

00:23:55.816 --> 00:23:57.356
that help people understand more

00:23:57.356 --> 00:23:58.596
about how your app makes

00:23:58.656 --> 00:23:59.146
decisions.

00:24:01.196 --> 00:24:02.876
Confidence is a measurement of

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:06.556
certainty for an output.

00:24:06.726 --> 00:24:08.426
And limitations occurs when

00:24:08.426 --> 00:24:09.536
there's a mismatch between

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:10.736
people's mental model of a

00:24:10.736 --> 00:24:12.606
feature and what the feature can

00:24:12.656 --> 00:24:13.426
actually do.

00:24:14.006 --> 00:24:16.836
Let's start with multiple

00:24:16.836 --> 00:24:17.256
options.

00:24:17.716 --> 00:24:22.586
As I had mentioned, multiple

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.126
options allow people to choose

00:24:24.286 --> 00:24:25.646
from among the results a feature

00:24:25.646 --> 00:24:26.106
generates.

00:24:27.186 --> 00:24:28.296
What does this actually mean?

00:24:28.826 --> 00:24:31.686
Well it's often tempting to only

00:24:31.686 --> 00:24:33.306
reveal the best option that was

00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:34.546
created by your model.

00:24:34.686 --> 00:24:35.936
That's often not the best

00:24:35.936 --> 00:24:36.546
experience.

00:24:37.356 --> 00:24:38.586
Let me show you an example from

00:24:38.586 --> 00:24:39.126
the real world.

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.786
Last weekend I wanted to take a

00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:43.516
short trip and I asked my

00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:45.306
colleagues what's the best way

00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:47.056
to get between San Francisco and

00:24:47.056 --> 00:24:47.426
Napa.

00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:50.516
Depending on the person and the

00:24:50.516 --> 00:24:52.186
time of day that I asked, the

00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:53.286
answers varied.

00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:55.136
Sometimes they would say take

00:24:55.136 --> 00:24:55.896
the I-80.

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:57.516
Sometimes they would say take

00:24:57.516 --> 00:24:57.976
the 101.

00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:01.076
This is because route prediction

00:25:01.076 --> 00:25:03.186
is a complex task with a lot of

00:25:03.186 --> 00:25:04.366
different variables that might

00:25:04.366 --> 00:25:05.556
constantly be changing.

00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:07.636
There might be traffic or

00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:09.056
construction or even car

00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:10.196
accidents.

00:25:11.936 --> 00:25:13.716
Given all of that information,

00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:15.696
in Maps we try to predict the

00:25:15.696 --> 00:25:17.276
best route possible but

00:25:17.276 --> 00:25:19.236
sometimes a single option is not

00:25:19.236 --> 00:25:19.586
enough.

00:25:21.096 --> 00:25:22.716
We can't know everything that a

00:25:22.716 --> 00:25:24.176
particular person may care

00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:24.456
about.

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:26.996
They may prefer scenic routes or

00:25:26.996 --> 00:25:28.856
routes without tolls or routes

00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:30.566
not along highways.

00:25:32.856 --> 00:25:34.676
Providing a set of meaningfully

00:25:34.676 --> 00:25:36.246
different routes can help people

00:25:36.246 --> 00:25:37.566
navigate the gap between their

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:39.766
preferences and what a model can

00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:40.726
realistically predict.

00:25:41.526 --> 00:25:43.176
Here, Maps gives us three

00:25:43.176 --> 00:25:45.116
distinctly different routes: One

00:25:45.116 --> 00:25:46.486
that goes to the North Bay and

00:25:46.486 --> 00:25:47.916
two that go to the East Bay.

00:25:48.926 --> 00:25:50.056
This can give people a sense of

00:25:50.106 --> 00:25:51.766
control over how to get to their

00:25:51.766 --> 00:25:52.976
final destination.

00:25:56.336 --> 00:25:57.696
Whenever possible, you should

00:25:57.696 --> 00:25:59.556
prefer diverse options that

00:25:59.556 --> 00:26:00.806
encapsulate a meaningful

00:26:00.806 --> 00:26:04.256
selection of choices.

00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:08.246
People might also be using Maps

00:26:08.246 --> 00:26:09.736
while on the go and some of the

00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.056
options might appear very

00:26:11.056 --> 00:26:12.746
similar which makes it difficult

00:26:12.746 --> 00:26:14.086
for people to quickly choose the

00:26:14.086 --> 00:26:14.226
route.

00:26:15.556 --> 00:26:17.276
We can also use attributions to

00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:18.336
help people differentiate

00:26:18.336 --> 00:26:19.916
between the options and make a

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:20.786
choice faster.

00:26:22.816 --> 00:26:24.756
Here, we show you whether a

00:26:24.756 --> 00:26:27.606
route requires a toll, which

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:30.286
highway it goes through and we

00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:31.936
even highlight each path on the

00:26:31.936 --> 00:26:34.196
map making it easier to find

00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:36.376
that perfect scenic waterfront

00:26:37.216 --> 00:26:37.346
drive.

00:26:39.336 --> 00:26:41.136
These small summaries are a

00:26:41.136 --> 00:26:42.666
great tool to help people

00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:44.236
differentiate between a broad

00:26:44.296 --> 00:26:45.776
selection of options at a quick

00:26:45.776 --> 00:26:47.306
glance and easily make a

00:26:47.306 --> 00:26:50.766
selection while on the go.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:53.076
Now I know Maps is an obvious

00:26:53.076 --> 00:26:54.716
example for presenting options

00:26:55.246 --> 00:26:56.656
because it's reacting to very

00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:57.426
explicit input.

00:26:57.426 --> 00:26:59.576
I know where I am, where I want

00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:01.316
to go and I'm expecting a list

00:27:01.316 --> 00:27:02.596
of options that can get me

00:27:03.066 --> 00:27:03.166
there.

00:27:03.736 --> 00:27:05.796
But multiple options can also be

00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:07.106
useful for features that are

00:27:07.106 --> 00:27:08.456
proactively surfacing

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:10.336
suggestions or it might be more

00:27:10.336 --> 00:27:12.246
ambiguous what my current intent

00:27:12.246 --> 00:27:13.886
and context is.

00:27:16.296 --> 00:27:17.376
Let's talk about the watch.

00:27:17.376 --> 00:27:19.476
When I start the day every

00:27:19.476 --> 00:27:21.686
morning, I might want to check

00:27:22.076 --> 00:27:23.756
the weather, see my first

00:27:23.756 --> 00:27:27.686
appointment and see reminders of

00:27:27.686 --> 00:27:29.426
what I need to do that day.

00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:31.536
Siri watch face allows me to

00:27:31.536 --> 00:27:33.736
customize up to 19 different

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.366
data sources that I might want

00:27:35.366 --> 00:27:36.326
to get information from

00:27:36.866 --> 00:27:38.736
including weather, calendar, and

00:27:38.736 --> 00:27:39.186
reminders.

00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:40.936
You can even choose to see

00:27:40.936 --> 00:27:42.086
information from third-party

00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:42.346
apps.

00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:45.046
Now information from 19

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:46.746
different apps is a lot to look

00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:48.066
at on such a small screen.

00:27:49.096 --> 00:27:50.446
That's why Siri chooses to

00:27:50.516 --> 00:27:52.056
surface a smaller selection of

00:27:52.056 --> 00:27:55.036
options based on time, location,

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:56.356
and what I've previously

00:27:56.356 --> 00:27:57.036
interacted with.

00:27:57.546 --> 00:28:01.456
Since my watch knows it's

00:28:01.456 --> 00:28:03.626
morning time, I'm at home, and

00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:05.586
in the past I've always selected

00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:06.986
the option to turn on the lights

00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:07.976
at the certain time.

00:28:08.466 --> 00:28:09.836
It'll surface this as a top

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:11.256
suggestion every morning.

00:28:11.776 --> 00:28:14.406
Siri can understand my usage

00:28:14.406 --> 00:28:16.056
history to help me automate this

00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:18.526
mundane task without having to

00:28:18.526 --> 00:28:20.046
scroll through this long list of

00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:22.146
options when I first wake up.

00:28:22.756 --> 00:28:24.086
This makes getting up in the

00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:25.626
morning so much more effortless

00:28:25.626 --> 00:28:26.706
for someone who's not a morning

00:28:26.706 --> 00:28:28.286
person, like me.

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:33.176
This is important because every

00:28:33.176 --> 00:28:35.196
time someone selects an option,

00:28:35.556 --> 00:28:36.466
they're actually giving you

00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:38.396
valuable implicit feedback that

00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:39.796
you can use to make sure the

00:28:39.796 --> 00:28:41.706
most relevant option is always

00:28:41.706 --> 00:28:44.416
ranked at the top.

00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:45.166
If you learn from their

00:28:45.166 --> 00:28:46.666
selection, you'll be able to

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.576
surface better suggestions over

00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:48.876
time.

00:28:54.786 --> 00:28:55.926
Now remember when we talked

00:28:55.926 --> 00:28:59.266
about Maps and how attributions

00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:00.676
can be used to differentiate

00:29:01.566 --> 00:29:01.686
routes?

00:29:03.276 --> 00:29:04.746
Attributions can actually be

00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:09.376
used for so much more than that.

00:29:09.656 --> 00:29:11.406
Attributions are explanations

00:29:11.576 --> 00:29:13.126
that help people understand more

00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:14.316
about how your app makes

00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:14.816
decisions.

00:29:15.346 --> 00:29:19.036
Within the App Store, we use

00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:20.546
attributions to explain how

00:29:20.546 --> 00:29:22.086
recommendations are created.

00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:24.646
This helps people understand why

00:29:24.646 --> 00:29:25.606
they might be seeing certain

00:29:25.606 --> 00:29:27.596
suggestions and how their data

00:29:27.596 --> 00:29:29.046
is being used.

00:29:30.716 --> 00:29:32.366
But let's say the App Store is

00:29:32.366 --> 00:29:33.776
showing me some recommendations

00:29:33.776 --> 00:29:35.006
because I downloaded a cooking

00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:36.046
app.

00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:37.486
Now I might have downloaded an

00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:39.316
app to cook but that doesn't

00:29:39.316 --> 00:29:40.856
necessarily mean I'm into

00:29:40.856 --> 00:29:41.186
cooking.

00:29:41.676 --> 00:29:44.756
Neither does it mean that I love

00:29:44.886 --> 00:29:46.366
that particular app.

00:29:48.056 --> 00:29:49.526
Therefore, when using

00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:50.726
attributions to explain

00:29:50.726 --> 00:29:52.296
suggestions, you should relate

00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:53.866
to objective facts rather than

00:29:53.866 --> 00:29:54.776
subjective taste.

00:29:55.646 --> 00:29:57.316
Here, we simply state that these

00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:58.546
suggestions are because you've

00:29:58.546 --> 00:29:59.626
downloaded the "New York Times"

00:29:59.626 --> 00:29:59.976
Cooking app.

00:30:04.486 --> 00:30:06.076
We can never have a complete

00:30:06.076 --> 00:30:07.836
picture of someone's taste and

00:30:07.836 --> 00:30:09.526
preferences because they might

00:30:09.526 --> 00:30:11.056
evolve on a daily basis.

00:30:11.896 --> 00:30:13.116
People might also share an

00:30:13.116 --> 00:30:14.416
account with their friends and

00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:16.766
family; therefore, profiling

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:18.646
them makes them feel confused

00:30:18.896 --> 00:30:20.596
and boxed in.

00:30:20.816 --> 00:30:22.076
You should avoid profiling

00:30:22.076 --> 00:30:23.966
people by not using language

00:30:23.966 --> 00:30:26.026
that implies understanding or

00:30:26.026 --> 00:30:27.636
judgment of their emotions and

00:30:27.636 --> 00:30:28.226
preferences.

00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:34.226
We can also use attributions to

00:30:34.226 --> 00:30:35.516
help people understand the

00:30:35.516 --> 00:30:37.206
trustworthiness of a result.

00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:40.026
I'm an astronomy enthusiast and

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.436
I wanted to see which planet was

00:30:41.436 --> 00:30:42.666
visible in the sky tonight.

00:30:43.296 --> 00:30:45.426
So I asked Siri, "When can you

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:46.036
see Jupiter?"

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:50.216
Siri tells me when the event

00:30:50.216 --> 00:30:52.926
will happen but also gives me

00:30:52.926 --> 00:30:54.846
more information from Wolfram

00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:55.506
Alpha.

00:30:56.156 --> 00:30:57.626
This helps me understand that

00:30:57.626 --> 00:30:59.146
it's a reliable prediction

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:00.696
because Wolfram Alpha is a

00:31:00.696 --> 00:31:02.206
well-known knowledge engine.

00:31:03.026 --> 00:31:04.876
This is really important when it

00:31:04.876 --> 00:31:06.366
comes to displaying predictions

00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:08.036
where the trustworthiness of the

00:31:08.036 --> 00:31:10.266
source really matters like

00:31:10.396 --> 00:31:12.106
scientific information or

00:31:12.106 --> 00:31:12.826
election results.

00:31:13.326 --> 00:31:18.426
Cite data sources so people can

00:31:18.426 --> 00:31:20.316
determine how reliable a certain

00:31:20.316 --> 00:31:20.976
prediction might be.

00:31:26.606 --> 00:31:28.866
Now attributions can be used for

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:30.096
more than just explaining

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:31.916
personalization or predictions.

00:31:32.426 --> 00:31:33.316
We can also use it to

00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:34.516
communicate confidence.

00:31:34.516 --> 00:31:38.986
Let's look at the App Store

00:31:38.986 --> 00:31:40.946
again and see how we really try

00:31:40.946 --> 00:31:42.676
to avoid technical jargon here.

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:46.296
For example, we could've said

00:31:46.866 --> 00:31:48.906
these apps are an 85% match for

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:51.086
you but it's really difficult to

00:31:51.086 --> 00:31:53.006
understand what 85% mean.

00:31:53.816 --> 00:31:54.936
That number might also mean

00:31:54.936 --> 00:31:56.016
different things to different

00:31:56.016 --> 00:31:56.366
people.

00:31:56.896 --> 00:32:00.686
That's why we try to use a more

00:32:00.746 --> 00:32:02.826
understandable explanation such

00:32:02.826 --> 00:32:04.966
as recommendations based on apps

00:32:05.266 --> 00:32:06.106
you've downloaded.

00:32:06.626 --> 00:32:11.056
That 85% I mentioned is a

00:32:11.056 --> 00:32:12.816
measurement of confidence or how

00:32:12.916 --> 00:32:14.556
certain the model is that you'll

00:32:14.556 --> 00:32:15.706
like the recommendations.

00:32:16.826 --> 00:32:18.566
Confidence is what you get from

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:20.336
a machine learning model but

00:32:20.336 --> 00:32:21.866
it's important to translate it

00:32:21.946 --> 00:32:22.886
into something more

00:32:22.886 --> 00:32:27.606
understandable for people.

00:32:27.736 --> 00:32:29.626
Sometimes it's OK to directly

00:32:29.626 --> 00:32:30.576
display confidence.

00:32:31.556 --> 00:32:32.596
The Weather app gives you

00:32:32.596 --> 00:32:33.756
information that it's going to

00:32:33.756 --> 00:32:35.686
rain but it also gives you a

00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:37.466
percentage for how likely it's

00:32:37.466 --> 00:32:39.166
going to rain.

00:32:39.386 --> 00:32:41.516
Now you might think what kind of

00:32:41.516 --> 00:32:42.926
a decision should I make based

00:32:42.926 --> 00:32:44.186
on this 30% chance.

00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:46.156
Is it worth bringing my

00:32:46.156 --> 00:32:46.596
umbrella?

00:32:47.726 --> 00:32:48.836
It's unclear.

00:32:49.136 --> 00:32:50.136
But we've been conditioned to

00:32:50.136 --> 00:32:51.686
understand this percentage over

00:32:52.646 --> 00:32:52.756
time.

00:32:55.266 --> 00:32:56.386
And while numbers are

00:32:56.386 --> 00:32:57.996
appropriate for statistical

00:32:57.996 --> 00:32:59.426
predictions such as weather,

00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:01.646
sports results or election

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.616
predictions, it might not work

00:33:03.616 --> 00:33:04.596
in other situations.

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:08.276
This is Hopper.

00:33:09.056 --> 00:33:10.666
It's an app that helps you book

00:33:10.716 --> 00:33:11.346
cheaper flights.

00:33:12.716 --> 00:33:14.246
It uses confidence to tell

00:33:14.246 --> 00:33:15.466
people whether the fare will go

00:33:15.466 --> 00:33:16.636
up or down.

00:33:17.986 --> 00:33:19.416
And we don't expect people to

00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:20.866
grapple with percentages here

00:33:20.996 --> 00:33:22.236
because in this context,

00:33:22.416 --> 00:33:23.876
percentages are difficult to

00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:24.366
interpret.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:28.146
Seeing a 65% chance the price

00:33:28.146 --> 00:33:29.586
will go down is not really

00:33:29.586 --> 00:33:30.216
actionable.

00:33:30.886 --> 00:33:34.626
How is 65% different than 70%?

00:33:35.716 --> 00:33:37.166
The way Hopper presents

00:33:37.166 --> 00:33:38.676
confidence is by giving you

00:33:38.676 --> 00:33:40.746
actual suggestions for actions

00:33:40.746 --> 00:33:42.276
you should take, whether you

00:33:42.276 --> 00:33:44.676
should wait or buy now.

00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:48.666
It also provides additional

00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:50.576
context such as how much money

00:33:50.576 --> 00:33:51.906
you're going to save and the

00:33:51.906 --> 00:33:53.386
optimal time range to book a

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:53.706
flight.

00:33:55.206 --> 00:33:56.716
These additional explanations

00:33:56.716 --> 00:33:58.456
help people make a more informed

00:33:58.546 --> 00:33:59.736
decision.

00:34:02.706 --> 00:34:03.866
When confidence is used

00:34:03.866 --> 00:34:05.416
appropriately, it can make an

00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:07.906
experience feel so much more

00:34:07.906 --> 00:34:08.346
human.

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:11.406
Most of the time you should

00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:13.126
prefer to translate confidence

00:34:13.166 --> 00:34:15.295
into easy-to-understand terms to

00:34:15.295 --> 00:34:16.446
help people make a decision.

00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:22.376
So by this point, you probably

00:34:22.376 --> 00:34:23.956
understand that confidence can

00:34:23.956 --> 00:34:26.096
be a great tool to help people

00:34:26.096 --> 00:34:27.696
estimate how risky a certain

00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:30.516
decision might be but there are

00:34:30.516 --> 00:34:31.766
cases where this doesn't work.

00:34:33.106 --> 00:34:36.065
For example, if I ask you how

00:34:36.065 --> 00:34:37.406
long it would take for me to get

00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:39.056
between here and San Francisco

00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:42.966
and you replied, "I'm 72%

00:34:42.966 --> 00:34:44.585
confident you'll get there at

00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:45.096
1:30."

00:34:46.116 --> 00:34:47.426
That would be pretty confusing.

00:34:47.426 --> 00:34:49.476
How can I be sure what time I'll

00:34:49.476 --> 00:34:53.876
actually get home?

00:34:54.085 --> 00:34:55.446
A better way is to provide a

00:34:55.446 --> 00:34:56.676
range in the prediction.

00:34:57.546 --> 00:34:59.216
With ride sharing, it's often

00:34:59.216 --> 00:35:00.716
difficult to pinpoint an exact

00:35:00.716 --> 00:35:02.746
arrival time since there might

00:35:02.746 --> 00:35:04.246
be traffic or the driver might

00:35:04.246 --> 00:35:05.196
pick up more riders.

00:35:06.876 --> 00:35:08.796
Lyft help people estimate when

00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:09.706
they will arrive at their

00:35:09.706 --> 00:35:11.436
destination before they book a

00:35:11.436 --> 00:35:13.716
ride by providing a range about

00:35:13.716 --> 00:35:15.086
the time the driver will pick

00:35:15.086 --> 00:35:18.066
you up and the time you will

00:35:18.066 --> 00:35:19.086
arrive at the airport.

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:21.686
These ranges help me have a

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.106
realistic expectation of when

00:35:23.106 --> 00:35:23.946
I'll actually get home.

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:30.126
Range can be a great tool to

00:35:30.326 --> 00:35:32.026
help people estimate how risky a

00:35:32.026 --> 00:35:33.796
certain decision might be.

00:35:36.936 --> 00:35:38.866
Now these are all good examples

00:35:38.866 --> 00:35:40.986
of how to display confidence but

00:35:40.986 --> 00:35:42.366
what do you do when there is low

00:35:42.366 --> 00:35:44.166
confidence and the model doesn't

00:35:44.206 --> 00:35:45.476
have enough information to

00:35:45.596 --> 00:35:46.926
actually take an action?

00:35:47.476 --> 00:35:49.946
In a lot of cases, we can

00:35:49.946 --> 00:35:51.826
actually ask people for help.

00:35:53.616 --> 00:35:56.286
For example, the Photos app can

00:35:56.366 --> 00:35:58.036
automatically recognize people

00:35:58.566 --> 00:35:59.716
in order to make searching for

00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:00.736
their pictures easier.

00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:03.696
When Photos has low confidence

00:36:03.696 --> 00:36:05.666
who is in a picture, it will ask

00:36:05.756 --> 00:36:07.296
people to confirm additional

00:36:07.296 --> 00:36:09.466
photos of that person before

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:10.806
automatically labeling them.

00:36:12.196 --> 00:36:13.736
Asking for confirmation is

00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:14.986
important because it'd be

00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:16.526
annoying if I saw pictures that

00:36:16.526 --> 00:36:18.306
were marked as me that weren't

00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:19.416
photos of me at all.

00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:23.616
With every photo I mark as me,

00:36:24.426 --> 00:36:25.586
Photos become better at

00:36:25.586 --> 00:36:27.506
recognizing who I am.

00:36:28.736 --> 00:36:30.176
This is an example of a

00:36:30.176 --> 00:36:31.956
limitation that the facial

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:33.366
recognition in Photos has,

00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:39.326
which also brings me to our last

00:36:39.326 --> 00:36:39.966
output pattern.

00:36:40.546 --> 00:36:43.936
So what actually is a

00:36:43.936 --> 00:36:44.526
limitation?

00:36:45.556 --> 00:36:46.896
A limitation is that when

00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:48.076
there's a mismatch between

00:36:48.076 --> 00:36:49.516
people's mental model of a

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:51.306
feature and what the feature can

00:36:51.306 --> 00:36:52.346
actually do.

00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:55.636
I might expect Photos to always

00:36:55.636 --> 00:36:57.456
know who I am even though it

00:36:57.456 --> 00:36:59.206
can't do that yet because a

00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:00.976
photo might be blurry or taken

00:37:00.976 --> 00:37:04.896
in low light or not in focus.

00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:06.606
Every feature has limitations

00:37:07.126 --> 00:37:09.056
whether by design, capability,

00:37:09.216 --> 00:37:09.976
or circumstance.

00:37:10.556 --> 00:37:12.766
You have to strengthen people's

00:37:12.766 --> 00:37:13.856
trust in your app by

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:15.546
acknowledging its limitations

00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:17.676
and teaching people how to work

00:37:18.326 --> 00:37:21.166
with them.

00:37:21.376 --> 00:37:23.566
Now Memoji is one of my favorite

00:37:23.566 --> 00:37:25.736
features but people might not

00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:27.526
understand that it won't work in

00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:30.436
certain scenarios, whether your

00:37:30.606 --> 00:37:34.916
face is not in view, something

00:37:34.916 --> 00:37:39.026
is covering the camera, or

00:37:39.026 --> 00:37:40.636
you're in a dark room.

00:37:41.216 --> 00:37:42.886
Every time this limitation

00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:45.036
occurs, we instantly show these

00:37:45.036 --> 00:37:46.956
inline coaching tips to help

00:37:46.956 --> 00:37:48.736
people move past the limitation

00:37:48.996 --> 00:37:50.236
and successfully use the

00:37:50.286 --> 00:37:50.666
feature.

00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:54.216
Explaining the limitations when

00:37:54.216 --> 00:37:55.826
they happen help people learn to

00:37:55.826 --> 00:37:57.446
avoid these situations in the

00:37:57.446 --> 00:37:57.896
future.

00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:03.066
People might lose trust in your

00:38:03.066 --> 00:38:04.966
feature if limitations are not

00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:06.026
appropriately addressed.

00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:08.726
You should take care to manage

00:38:08.726 --> 00:38:10.376
people's expectations of what a

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:13.146
feature can actually do and

00:38:13.146 --> 00:38:14.766
guide people to move past

00:38:14.986 --> 00:38:15.666
limitations.

00:38:19.726 --> 00:38:21.036
Another way to help people move

00:38:21.096 --> 00:38:22.866
past limitations is to suggest

00:38:22.966 --> 00:38:25.146
alternative ways to accomplish

00:38:25.786 --> 00:38:26.666
their goals.

00:38:26.856 --> 00:38:28.146
In order to do this right, you

00:38:28.286 --> 00:38:29.936
need to understand the goal well

00:38:29.936 --> 00:38:31.996
enough to suggest alternatives

00:38:31.996 --> 00:38:32.946
that actually make sense.

00:38:34.596 --> 00:38:36.636
For example, if people ask Siri

00:38:36.636 --> 00:38:38.656
to set a timer on a Mac, it

00:38:38.656 --> 00:38:40.426
can't perform the action because

00:38:40.456 --> 00:38:43.286
timers aren't available at

00:38:45.176 --> 00:38:45.346
MacOS.

00:38:45.486 --> 00:38:47.156
Instead of simply replying, "I

00:38:47.156 --> 00:38:48.736
can't do it," which is kind of

00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:50.746
frustrating, Siri suggests

00:38:50.746 --> 00:38:52.076
setting a reminder instead.

00:38:53.336 --> 00:38:54.506
This suggestion actually makes

00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:56.456
sense because Siri understands

00:38:56.726 --> 00:38:58.136
that the goal is to receive an

00:38:58.136 --> 00:39:00.436
alert at a certain time and

00:39:00.436 --> 00:39:02.376
setting a reminder accomplishes

00:39:02.456 --> 00:39:04.136
the same goal as setting a

00:39:04.816 --> 00:39:04.956
timer.

00:39:07.256 --> 00:39:08.996
When possible, suggest

00:39:08.996 --> 00:39:10.266
alternatives that can help

00:39:10.266 --> 00:39:11.586
people accomplish their goals.

00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:16.736
I hope these patterns have given

00:39:16.736 --> 00:39:18.256
you some ideas on different

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:19.966
outputs that you can get from a

00:39:19.966 --> 00:39:20.946
machine learning model.

00:39:21.486 --> 00:39:24.066
But you have to remember that

00:39:24.066 --> 00:39:25.466
outputs are a design medium.

00:39:26.566 --> 00:39:27.926
By understanding the types of

00:39:27.926 --> 00:39:29.676
outputs that are available, you

00:39:29.676 --> 00:39:31.676
can choose outputs that align

00:39:31.676 --> 00:39:32.846
with the experience you want to

00:39:32.846 --> 00:39:34.706
build and not just rely on

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:36.266
standard outputs from the model.

00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:39.306
We should respect people's

00:39:39.306 --> 00:39:41.476
agency and time by choosing

00:39:41.596 --> 00:39:42.906
outputs that are easy to

00:39:42.906 --> 00:39:44.866
understand and effortlessly

00:39:44.866 --> 00:39:45.286
helpful.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.406
As you've seen, there are many

00:39:50.406 --> 00:39:51.756
different ways to translate

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.206
outputs from the model to the

00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:53.676
interface.

00:39:54.366 --> 00:39:57.326
But of course, outputs aren't

00:39:57.326 --> 00:39:57.756
static.

00:39:58.526 --> 00:40:00.386
They're dynamic and constantly

00:40:00.386 --> 00:40:01.646
update based on inputs.

00:40:02.936 --> 00:40:04.136
People interact with the

00:40:04.136 --> 00:40:05.956
experience through inputs and

00:40:05.956 --> 00:40:07.446
now Cas will tell you all about

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:08.656
how to design for inputs.

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:08.896
Thank you.

00:40:09.516 --> 00:40:15.500
[ Applause ]

00:40:19.546 --> 00:40:21.006
>> So Rubii showed a range of

00:40:21.006 --> 00:40:22.556
outputs that people can interact

00:40:22.556 --> 00:40:24.726
with on the interface and these

00:40:24.726 --> 00:40:26.476
interactions serve as inputs

00:40:26.616 --> 00:40:27.796
that we can use to collect

00:40:27.886 --> 00:40:29.576
feedback for information from

00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:31.446
people so we can improve our

00:40:31.446 --> 00:40:32.056
experience.

00:40:33.256 --> 00:40:34.346
These are the four inputs we

00:40:34.346 --> 00:40:34.946
will discuss.

00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:38.136
Calibration helps you get

00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:39.576
essential information for

00:40:39.576 --> 00:40:40.786
someone to engage in your

00:40:40.786 --> 00:40:41.426
experience.

00:40:42.566 --> 00:40:43.706
Calibration allows you to

00:40:43.706 --> 00:40:45.886
collect important information

00:40:46.116 --> 00:40:47.466
from interactions someone has

00:40:47.466 --> 00:40:48.506
with your experience.

00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:51.066
Explicit feedback also allows

00:40:51.066 --> 00:40:52.586
you to collect information but

00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:53.976
this time by asking specific

00:40:53.976 --> 00:40:55.336
questions about the results

00:40:55.336 --> 00:40:55.816
you're showing.

00:40:56.836 --> 00:40:58.246
And corrections allow people to

00:40:58.326 --> 00:40:59.996
fix a mistake a model has made

00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:02.006
by using familiar interfaces.

00:41:02.826 --> 00:41:04.306
So let's start with calibration.

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:07.256
As I just said, calibrations

00:41:07.256 --> 00:41:08.436
allow people to provide

00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:09.906
essential information for them

00:41:09.906 --> 00:41:11.396
to engage in your experience.

00:41:12.126 --> 00:41:13.326
We can use calibration for

00:41:13.326 --> 00:41:14.836
example to collect biometric

00:41:14.836 --> 00:41:16.586
data or data about your

00:41:16.586 --> 00:41:17.146
surroundings.

00:41:17.966 --> 00:41:18.866
Let me give an example.

00:41:19.836 --> 00:41:20.936
Let's look at HomeCourt.

00:41:21.556 --> 00:41:22.896
HomeCourt is an app that helps

00:41:22.896 --> 00:41:24.236
you become a better basketball

00:41:24.296 --> 00:41:24.576
player.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.536
It uses machine learning to

00:41:26.536 --> 00:41:28.016
analyze images from the camera

00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:29.696
and detect for example how

00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:31.526
accurately you take shots at the

00:41:31.526 --> 00:41:31.816
hoop.

00:41:32.716 --> 00:41:34.246
In order to do so, the camera

00:41:34.246 --> 00:41:35.706
needs to be calibrated so it can

00:41:35.706 --> 00:41:37.636
detect you, the hoop and the

00:41:37.636 --> 00:41:37.876
court.

00:41:38.436 --> 00:41:40.446
And HomeCourt has done an

00:41:40.446 --> 00:41:42.046
amazing job at doing this fast

00:41:42.046 --> 00:41:42.736
and intuitively.

00:41:43.516 --> 00:41:44.286
You simply point the

00:41:44.336 --> 00:41:45.936
front-facing camera to the hoop

00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:47.656
and it immediately detects it by

00:41:47.656 --> 00:41:49.006
putting a wide square around it.

00:41:49.696 --> 00:41:50.916
It then asks you to make one

00:41:50.916 --> 00:41:52.136
shot and from then on, you're

00:41:52.136 --> 00:41:53.996
good to go and it will start

00:41:53.996 --> 00:41:55.006
counting your shots.

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:58.206
What's remarkable here is what

00:41:58.206 --> 00:41:59.516
HomeCourt is not asking you to

00:41:59.516 --> 00:41:59.706
do.

00:42:00.396 --> 00:42:01.296
For example, you don't have to

00:42:01.296 --> 00:42:02.646
draw lines around the hoop or

00:42:02.646 --> 00:42:03.046
the court.

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:05.536
It doesn't ask for confirmation

00:42:05.536 --> 00:42:06.706
on whether it got the hoop right

00:42:06.706 --> 00:42:07.086
or wrong.

00:42:07.876 --> 00:42:08.926
And you don't need to take shots

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.506
from multiple angles.

00:42:12.076 --> 00:42:13.816
Calibration also happens in some

00:42:13.816 --> 00:42:15.256
of Apple's products, for example

00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:16.566
when you set up Face ID.

00:42:17.636 --> 00:42:19.406
Face ID uses calibration to only

00:42:19.406 --> 00:42:21.036
collect essential information.

00:42:21.986 --> 00:42:23.406
It asks you to scan your face

00:42:23.406 --> 00:42:24.806
twice and from then on, it is

00:42:24.806 --> 00:42:26.246
set up and it will always keep

00:42:26.246 --> 00:42:27.646
working regardless of whether

00:42:27.646 --> 00:42:28.866
you might start to wear glasses

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.316
or change your hairstyle.

00:42:30.906 --> 00:42:33.196
So when you're using

00:42:33.196 --> 00:42:35.106
calibration, try to be quick and

00:42:35.106 --> 00:42:36.746
effortless and only ask for

00:42:36.746 --> 00:42:39.036
essential information and, when

00:42:39.036 --> 00:42:40.916
possible, try to avoid the need

00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:42.556
for multiple calibrations.

00:42:43.136 --> 00:42:46.456
Once you're setting up Face ID,

00:42:46.596 --> 00:42:47.796
we help you along the way.

00:42:48.226 --> 00:42:49.446
We start with an introduction

00:42:49.446 --> 00:42:50.916
that clearly states why your

00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:52.466
phone needs to scan your face.

00:42:53.106 --> 00:42:54.256
And we do this by explaining

00:42:54.256 --> 00:42:55.856
both how it works and what it

00:42:55.856 --> 00:42:56.966
will allow you to do.

00:42:57.456 --> 00:42:59.746
Throughout the process, we

00:42:59.746 --> 00:43:00.736
always give you a sense of

00:43:00.816 --> 00:43:01.296
progress.

00:43:01.736 --> 00:43:03.036
Here, we fill out the lines

00:43:03.036 --> 00:43:03.766
around your face.

00:43:04.286 --> 00:43:07.906
And if this progress might

00:43:07.906 --> 00:43:09.456
stall, we make sure you never

00:43:09.456 --> 00:43:10.696
get stuck and we provide

00:43:10.696 --> 00:43:11.826
guidance to help you move

00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:12.466
forward.

00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:14.626
Here, we point arrows that point

00:43:14.626 --> 00:43:15.466
in which way to look.

00:43:15.466 --> 00:43:19.126
And at the end, we give the

00:43:19.126 --> 00:43:20.006
notion of success.

00:43:20.396 --> 00:43:21.706
We tell you the work is done and

00:43:21.706 --> 00:43:23.636
the feature can be used now.

00:43:24.336 --> 00:43:26.096
So always provide help by

00:43:26.096 --> 00:43:27.496
introducing, guiding and

00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:29.136
confirming the calibration.

00:43:29.696 --> 00:43:32.696
Of course, Face ID collects a

00:43:32.696 --> 00:43:34.136
lot of sensitive information.

00:43:34.376 --> 00:43:35.796
And so to respect your privacy,

00:43:36.076 --> 00:43:37.546
we give you a way to edit or

00:43:37.546 --> 00:43:39.046
remove this information in

00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:39.456
Settings.

00:43:41.066 --> 00:43:42.776
So when possible, allow people

00:43:42.776 --> 00:43:44.106
to update their information.

00:43:44.686 --> 00:43:48.636
Now as I said before, Face ID

00:43:48.636 --> 00:43:50.406
asks for just one calibration

00:43:50.636 --> 00:43:51.896
and from then on, it will keep

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:53.226
working regardless of whether

00:43:53.226 --> 00:43:54.556
you might start to wear glasses,

00:43:54.906 --> 00:43:56.376
change your hairstyle, maybe

00:43:56.376 --> 00:43:58.156
wear a hat or a scarf sometimes

00:43:58.566 --> 00:44:00.046
or even as your face changes as

00:44:00.046 --> 00:44:00.736
you become older.

00:44:01.656 --> 00:44:02.886
This was a big challenge when we

00:44:02.886 --> 00:44:03.736
designed Face ID.

00:44:04.296 --> 00:44:05.756
It would've been a lot easier to

00:44:05.756 --> 00:44:07.446
occasionally ask to recalibrate

00:44:07.446 --> 00:44:09.396
your face so your iPhone or iPad

00:44:09.486 --> 00:44:10.506
could keep recognizing you.

00:44:11.336 --> 00:44:12.326
But who would like to rescan

00:44:12.326 --> 00:44:13.656
their face each time they change

00:44:13.656 --> 00:44:14.236
their hairstyle?

00:44:15.356 --> 00:44:16.456
So instead of asking for

00:44:16.456 --> 00:44:18.436
multiple calibrations, Face ID

00:44:18.436 --> 00:44:20.196
collects implicit feedback to

00:44:20.196 --> 00:44:21.566
update the information about

00:44:21.566 --> 00:44:23.906
your face each time you use Face

00:44:23.906 --> 00:44:24.046
ID.

00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:26.046
And that brings us to our next

00:44:26.046 --> 00:44:28.536
pattern which is implicit

00:44:29.536 --> 00:44:29.746
feedback.

00:44:30.636 --> 00:44:32.566
Implicit feedback is information

00:44:32.566 --> 00:44:33.346
that arises from the

00:44:33.346 --> 00:44:34.886
interactions people have with

00:44:34.886 --> 00:44:36.906
your app and that information

00:44:36.906 --> 00:44:38.326
can be used to improve the model

00:44:38.636 --> 00:44:39.346
and your feature.

00:44:40.446 --> 00:44:42.006
A very common example of using

00:44:42.006 --> 00:44:43.196
implicit feedback is

00:44:43.266 --> 00:44:44.126
personalization.

00:44:44.886 --> 00:44:46.616
For example, Siri personalizes

00:44:46.736 --> 00:44:48.796
the search experiences on iOS

00:44:49.166 --> 00:44:50.336
based on how you use your

00:44:50.336 --> 00:44:50.836
device.

00:44:51.366 --> 00:44:53.716
When you trigger the Search bar

00:44:53.716 --> 00:44:55.046
on your Home screen, Siri

00:44:55.046 --> 00:44:56.536
presents a range of apps you

00:44:56.536 --> 00:44:57.436
might want to use.

00:44:58.366 --> 00:45:00.206
Which apps appear here depends

00:45:00.206 --> 00:45:01.756
on the implicit feedback you

00:45:01.756 --> 00:45:02.476
give to Siri.

00:45:03.186 --> 00:45:04.096
These might be apps you

00:45:04.096 --> 00:45:05.686
frequently used, maybe ones

00:45:05.686 --> 00:45:07.466
you've just used or ones you use

00:45:07.466 --> 00:45:08.846
typically at this time of day.

00:45:09.826 --> 00:45:11.196
For example in the car, I might

00:45:11.196 --> 00:45:13.086
get Maps so I can get directions

00:45:13.496 --> 00:45:14.896
or music and podcasts so I have

00:45:14.896 --> 00:45:15.816
something to listen to.

00:45:16.786 --> 00:45:18.306
At work, I might get apps that

00:45:18.306 --> 00:45:19.706
help me at a meeting like Notes

00:45:19.706 --> 00:45:21.756
or Reminders and at home, I

00:45:21.756 --> 00:45:22.926
might get Messages to text

00:45:22.926 --> 00:45:25.116
friends or family or suggestions

00:45:25.116 --> 00:45:26.956
to check my activity or news.

00:45:27.446 --> 00:45:30.206
Based on how I use these apps,

00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:32.306
Siri tries to identify my intent

00:45:32.826 --> 00:45:34.286
so it can surface apps to help

00:45:34.286 --> 00:45:35.686
me achieve that intent.

00:45:36.626 --> 00:45:37.626
So when you're using implicit

00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:39.396
feedback, strive to identify

00:45:39.396 --> 00:45:41.116
people's intent by looking at

00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:42.466
how they interact with your

00:45:42.466 --> 00:45:42.856
feature.

00:45:43.386 --> 00:45:47.466
Over time, Siri will get better

00:45:47.466 --> 00:45:49.296
at understanding my intent and,

00:45:49.296 --> 00:45:50.666
apart from just showing apps as

00:45:50.666 --> 00:45:52.106
a suggestion, it might also

00:45:52.106 --> 00:45:53.846
start suggesting shortcuts of

00:45:53.896 --> 00:45:55.356
actions I frequently perform.

00:45:56.436 --> 00:45:57.976
For example in the car, I might

00:45:57.976 --> 00:45:59.176
get directions to places I

00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:01.236
frequently visit or the location

00:46:01.236 --> 00:46:02.086
of my next meeting.

00:46:03.356 --> 00:46:04.856
At work, I might get shortcuts

00:46:04.886 --> 00:46:06.536
to my meeting notes or my work

00:46:06.536 --> 00:46:07.146
reminders.

00:46:07.986 --> 00:46:09.236
And at home, I might get

00:46:09.236 --> 00:46:10.456
shortcuts to turn on the lights

00:46:10.796 --> 00:46:12.256
or message or FaceTime my

00:46:12.256 --> 00:46:13.616
closest friends and family.

00:46:15.076 --> 00:46:16.776
These shortcuts appear after a

00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:17.686
few days or weeks.

00:46:18.206 --> 00:46:19.666
The more specific they are, the

00:46:19.666 --> 00:46:21.256
more certain Siri needs to be

00:46:21.346 --> 00:46:22.176
about my intent.

00:46:23.196 --> 00:46:24.506
As I said, these shortcuts are

00:46:24.506 --> 00:46:26.696
based on implicit feedback, so

00:46:26.696 --> 00:46:27.976
it might take a while for Siri

00:46:27.976 --> 00:46:29.366
to be certain enough about a

00:46:29.366 --> 00:46:31.136
suggestion and that's OK.

00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:33.496
It's better to be patient and

00:46:33.496 --> 00:46:34.896
become certain of a suggestion

00:46:35.406 --> 00:46:36.636
than to be quick and show an

00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:37.616
unhelpful suggestion.

00:46:38.206 --> 00:46:40.566
So bear in mind that implicit

00:46:40.606 --> 00:46:42.946
feedback can be slow but it also

00:46:42.946 --> 00:46:44.666
can be more accurate over time.

00:46:45.266 --> 00:46:48.966
Now these suggestions can appear

00:46:48.966 --> 00:46:50.596
on the Lock screen and it might

00:46:50.646 --> 00:46:51.676
be that they contain some

00:46:51.676 --> 00:46:52.726
sensitive information.

00:46:53.246 --> 00:46:54.956
For example, it might show an

00:46:54.956 --> 00:46:55.996
event you want to keep as a

00:46:55.996 --> 00:46:58.356
surprise or notes you might want

00:46:58.496 --> 00:46:59.426
to keep secret.

00:47:00.096 --> 00:47:02.196
To respect people's privacy, we

00:47:02.196 --> 00:47:03.316
added settings for you to

00:47:03.316 --> 00:47:05.286
control which app and which app

00:47:05.286 --> 00:47:07.306
shortcuts can appear in Search.

00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:11.326
So respect people's privacy and

00:47:11.326 --> 00:47:12.706
give them full control over

00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:13.406
their information.

00:47:13.866 --> 00:47:15.756
Treat it privately and securely.

00:47:16.346 --> 00:47:19.246
So implicit feedback is a great

00:47:19.246 --> 00:47:21.116
tool for personalization but you

00:47:21.116 --> 00:47:22.486
can also use it for some maybe

00:47:22.486 --> 00:47:24.476
less obvious purposes, for

00:47:24.476 --> 00:47:25.586
example simply making a

00:47:25.586 --> 00:47:27.586
direction faster or more

00:47:27.586 --> 00:47:27.976
accurate.

00:47:29.126 --> 00:47:30.386
One good example has been with

00:47:30.386 --> 00:47:31.986
us since the beginning of iOS

00:47:31.986 --> 00:47:32.716
and that's the keyboard.

00:47:33.326 --> 00:47:36.456
Each key on the keyboard has a

00:47:36.456 --> 00:47:38.466
touch area and the keyboard uses

00:47:38.466 --> 00:47:39.996
machine learning to optimize

00:47:39.996 --> 00:47:41.576
these touch areas based on what

00:47:41.576 --> 00:47:41.936
you type.

00:47:43.526 --> 00:47:44.936
Each touch area might become

00:47:44.936 --> 00:47:46.516
bigger or smaller depending on

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:47.996
the word you're typing or the

00:47:47.996 --> 00:47:49.616
way your fingers are positioned

00:47:49.616 --> 00:47:51.976
on the keyboard.

00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:52.986
Now notice that we're not

00:47:53.076 --> 00:47:54.586
visibly making these buttons any

00:47:54.586 --> 00:47:55.466
bigger or smaller.

00:47:55.536 --> 00:47:57.356
The keyboard always appears in

00:47:57.356 --> 00:47:57.966
the same way.

00:47:58.636 --> 00:48:00.046
But over time, the keyboard

00:48:00.046 --> 00:48:01.106
might start to feel more

00:48:01.106 --> 00:48:02.806
accurate and more personalized

00:48:02.966 --> 00:48:03.956
to you.

00:48:04.996 --> 00:48:06.926
So use implicit feedback to make

00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:08.376
your interactions more accurate

00:48:08.706 --> 00:48:09.306
and delightful.

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:15.196
One last example are the Siri

00:48:15.196 --> 00:48:16.556
suggestions in Safari.

00:48:17.256 --> 00:48:18.916
Safari uses machine learning to

00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:20.196
collect links from messages,

00:48:20.416 --> 00:48:22.176
mail, your reading lists, your

00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:23.446
iCloud tabs, and other places.

00:48:24.216 --> 00:48:25.376
And hopefully these suggestions

00:48:25.376 --> 00:48:26.716
are good and they help you

00:48:26.716 --> 00:48:28.106
discover interesting content

00:48:28.106 --> 00:48:29.866
from your friends and family or

00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:31.156
ones you've saved yourself.

00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:33.196
Occasionally, though, you might

00:48:33.196 --> 00:48:34.496
get suggestions you'd rather not

00:48:34.496 --> 00:48:36.536
see, maybe an article you're not

00:48:36.536 --> 00:48:38.016
interested in or a source you

00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:38.846
don't really trust.

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.216
If all of these suggestions turn

00:48:41.216 --> 00:48:42.786
out to be unhelpful, you might

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.646
start losing trust in the

00:48:44.646 --> 00:48:46.906
suggestions or even worse, start

00:48:46.906 --> 00:48:48.406
to lose trust in Safari.

00:48:48.906 --> 00:48:50.206
And that is obviously something

00:48:50.206 --> 00:48:51.146
we would like to avoid.

00:48:52.306 --> 00:48:53.766
Rubii talked about attribution

00:48:53.766 --> 00:48:54.936
that can really help here in

00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:56.226
explaining why we're showing

00:48:56.226 --> 00:48:58.206
these suggestions but we also

00:48:58.206 --> 00:48:59.176
want to make sure you can

00:48:59.176 --> 00:49:01.086
control these suggestions so you

00:49:01.086 --> 00:49:02.016
can get rid of the ones you

00:49:02.016 --> 00:49:03.426
don't want to see and make sure

00:49:03.426 --> 00:49:04.696
they don't appear again.

00:49:05.646 --> 00:49:06.796
And that brings us to our next

00:49:06.796 --> 00:49:08.716
pattern which is explicit

00:49:09.276 --> 00:49:09.466
feedback.

00:49:11.176 --> 00:49:12.976
Explicit feedback allows your

00:49:12.976 --> 00:49:14.646
app to collect information by

00:49:14.646 --> 00:49:16.596
asking specific questions about

00:49:16.596 --> 00:49:17.206
your results.

00:49:17.756 --> 00:49:20.096
In the previous example, it

00:49:20.096 --> 00:49:21.236
would be great if I could get

00:49:21.236 --> 00:49:22.486
feedback on these suggestions

00:49:22.536 --> 00:49:24.276
that I don't want to see and

00:49:24.276 --> 00:49:26.036
that way the model can learn and

00:49:26.036 --> 00:49:27.166
can avoid showing similar

00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:28.696
suggestions in the future.

00:49:30.056 --> 00:49:31.166
So how do I design these

00:49:31.206 --> 00:49:31.976
feedback actions?

00:49:32.556 --> 00:49:35.276
Here are two actions that

00:49:35.356 --> 00:49:36.726
frequently appear when we're

00:49:36.726 --> 00:49:38.186
using explicit feedback: the

00:49:38.186 --> 00:49:39.216
heart and the heart with a

00:49:39.216 --> 00:49:39.736
strikethrough.

00:49:40.486 --> 00:49:41.746
Now seeing these as buttons

00:49:41.746 --> 00:49:42.656
leaves a lot of room for

00:49:42.656 --> 00:49:43.426
interpretation.

00:49:44.126 --> 00:49:45.536
It's unclear what will happen

00:49:45.536 --> 00:49:47.386
when I press one of these even

00:49:47.386 --> 00:49:48.856
if I add labels like Love or

00:49:48.856 --> 00:49:49.336
Dislike.

00:49:50.566 --> 00:49:52.946
Let's say I want to get feedback

00:49:52.946 --> 00:49:54.046
on the third article here.

00:49:54.616 --> 00:49:55.866
I can bring up the Action menu

00:49:55.866 --> 00:49:57.256
and I can see the action Love.

00:49:58.866 --> 00:49:59.806
That leaves a lot of room for

00:49:59.806 --> 00:50:00.516
interpretation.

00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:02.136
Does this mean I have to love

00:50:02.186 --> 00:50:03.306
every article that I like?

00:50:04.706 --> 00:50:06.056
Positive explicit feedback

00:50:06.166 --> 00:50:07.526
implies additional work.

00:50:08.236 --> 00:50:09.416
People might think they have to

00:50:09.416 --> 00:50:10.996
give positive explicit feedback

00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:13.196
to every article they like just

00:50:13.196 --> 00:50:14.736
to get more good suggestions.

00:50:15.626 --> 00:50:17.166
So we actually recommend to

00:50:17.166 --> 00:50:18.536
prioritize negative feedback

00:50:18.806 --> 00:50:19.546
over positive.

00:50:20.346 --> 00:50:21.946
Positive feedback can better be

00:50:21.946 --> 00:50:23.136
inferred through implicit

00:50:23.136 --> 00:50:25.526
signals, for example me reading

00:50:25.526 --> 00:50:27.426
the article, bookmarking it or

00:50:27.426 --> 00:50:28.506
sharing it.

00:50:29.716 --> 00:50:31.606
So instead of showing both Love

00:50:31.606 --> 00:50:33.036
and Dislike, we can actually

00:50:33.036 --> 00:50:34.606
only show Dislike.

00:50:35.516 --> 00:50:36.746
But still, that leaves a lot of

00:50:36.746 --> 00:50:37.666
room for interpretation.

00:50:38.426 --> 00:50:39.816
If I dislike an article, am I

00:50:39.816 --> 00:50:41.286
disliking the article, the

00:50:41.286 --> 00:50:43.396
author, the source, the person

00:50:43.396 --> 00:50:45.016
who sent it to me, or maybe even

00:50:45.016 --> 00:50:46.216
the app in which I received it?

00:50:46.986 --> 00:50:47.826
It's still difficult to

00:50:47.826 --> 00:50:50.426
understand what will happen when

00:50:50.426 --> 00:50:52.366
I tap Dislike.

00:50:52.496 --> 00:50:53.906
Words like "suggest less" or

00:50:53.906 --> 00:50:55.476
"hide the suggestion" make it

00:50:55.506 --> 00:50:57.036
much easier to understand what

00:50:57.036 --> 00:50:58.216
will happen when I tap such a

00:50:58.216 --> 00:50:59.196
button.

00:51:00.196 --> 00:51:01.216
To give people even more

00:51:01.216 --> 00:51:02.676
control, we can allow them to

00:51:02.676 --> 00:51:04.396
select exactly what they like to

00:51:04.396 --> 00:51:06.356
see less, for example less of

00:51:06.356 --> 00:51:08.086
the source, the person who sent

00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:09.726
it to me or the app in which I

00:51:09.726 --> 00:51:10.846
received it.

00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:14.126
So when using explicit feedback,

00:51:14.526 --> 00:51:16.146
clearly describe the option and

00:51:16.146 --> 00:51:17.006
its consequences.

00:51:17.666 --> 00:51:19.246
Use words that describe what

00:51:19.246 --> 00:51:19.716
will happen.

00:51:19.936 --> 00:51:21.456
And when possible, provide

00:51:21.576 --> 00:51:22.716
different options to better

00:51:22.716 --> 00:51:23.926
understand the user's

00:51:23.926 --> 00:51:24.426
preference.

00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:28.446
And of course, when I select one

00:51:28.446 --> 00:51:29.956
of these options, the interface

00:51:29.956 --> 00:51:31.126
should immediately reflect my

00:51:31.126 --> 00:51:33.066
choice and hide the suggestions

00:51:33.236 --> 00:51:34.536
that match my preference.

00:51:37.076 --> 00:51:38.796
So always act immediately and

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:40.496
persistently when the user gives

00:51:40.746 --> 00:51:42.066
explicit feedback.

00:51:43.936 --> 00:51:45.226
So you've seen that explicit

00:51:45.226 --> 00:51:46.636
feedback allows us to correct

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.196
suggestions that might be wrong,

00:51:48.196 --> 00:51:49.646
unwanted or inappropriate.

00:51:50.616 --> 00:51:51.546
But for some machine learning

00:51:51.546 --> 00:51:53.106
features, using explicit

00:51:53.106 --> 00:51:55.216
feedback might not be the right

00:51:55.216 --> 00:51:56.766
choice or might not even be

00:51:56.766 --> 00:51:57.296
possible.

00:51:58.386 --> 00:52:00.346
Here's Angie again, the dog from

00:52:00.346 --> 00:52:00.726
our friends.

00:52:01.006 --> 00:52:02.366
She's often the main topic in

00:52:02.366 --> 00:52:03.276
our group conversation.

00:52:04.716 --> 00:52:05.996
Now the keyboard uses machine

00:52:05.996 --> 00:52:07.876
learning to suggest corrections

00:52:07.876 --> 00:52:08.746
of what I'm typing.

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:10.816
And when I initially type the

00:52:10.816 --> 00:52:12.366
word "Angie," it wanted to

00:52:12.366 --> 00:52:14.036
correct it to the word "angle."

00:52:14.856 --> 00:52:16.266
Now that's obviously wrong but

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:17.796
using explicit feedback here

00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:19.196
seems a little bit off.

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:20.696
Let's say I can bring up a

00:52:20.696 --> 00:52:21.696
contextual menu here.

00:52:22.936 --> 00:52:24.346
This doesn't feel very intuitive

00:52:24.686 --> 00:52:25.896
and it doesn't really allow me

00:52:25.896 --> 00:52:27.386
to say what I actually meant.

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:30.716
Instead, I can simply select the

00:52:30.716 --> 00:52:33.436
words and correct the suggestion

00:52:33.436 --> 00:52:34.516
the keyboard has made by

00:52:34.516 --> 00:52:36.626
retyping it and this time the

00:52:36.626 --> 00:52:38.066
keyboard will not autocorrect

00:52:38.066 --> 00:52:38.166
it.

00:52:38.826 --> 00:52:39.976
The keyboard learned from my

00:52:39.976 --> 00:52:41.706
correction and the next time I

00:52:41.706 --> 00:52:43.636
type in Angie, it knows I'm

00:52:43.636 --> 00:52:45.386
referring to a name and not the

00:52:45.386 --> 00:52:46.176
word "angle."

00:52:47.186 --> 00:52:48.696
This is the most obvious example

00:52:48.906 --> 00:52:50.436
of our last pattern which is

00:52:50.556 --> 00:52:51.106
corrections.

00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:55.596
Corrections allow people to fix

00:52:55.596 --> 00:52:57.316
a mistake a model has made by

00:52:57.316 --> 00:52:58.336
using known tasks.

00:52:58.796 --> 00:52:59.986
And with known tasks, I'll

00:52:59.986 --> 00:53:00.766
explain what that means.

00:53:01.806 --> 00:53:03.106
In the previous example, you've

00:53:03.106 --> 00:53:04.346
seen that we corrected this

00:53:04.676 --> 00:53:08.966
using standard text controls.

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:10.816
There was no new interface that

00:53:10.816 --> 00:53:11.476
we showed here.

00:53:11.946 --> 00:53:13.436
Everybody knows how to do this

00:53:13.506 --> 00:53:14.686
since this is how the keyboard's

00:53:14.906 --> 00:53:15.536
always worked.

00:53:16.736 --> 00:53:17.986
Corrections are, therefore, an

00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:19.536
amazing pattern to optimize your

00:53:19.536 --> 00:53:21.436
results without feeling like

00:53:21.436 --> 00:53:22.076
extra work.

00:53:22.626 --> 00:53:24.916
Let me give another example.

00:53:25.976 --> 00:53:27.526
Photos uses machine learning to

00:53:27.526 --> 00:53:28.556
optimize your pictures.

00:53:29.216 --> 00:53:30.496
It can help find to the right

00:53:30.496 --> 00:53:32.096
rotation or cropping your

00:53:32.096 --> 00:53:32.976
pictures could take.

00:53:34.276 --> 00:53:35.536
The way Photos suggest these

00:53:35.536 --> 00:53:38.406
croppings or rotations is quite

00:53:38.406 --> 00:53:38.746
subtle.

00:53:39.576 --> 00:53:40.806
When you go into Edit mode and

00:53:40.806 --> 00:53:42.056
select Rotation or Cropping

00:53:42.056 --> 00:53:44.456
tool, photos will crop or rotate

00:53:44.456 --> 00:53:45.336
the picture for you.

00:53:46.096 --> 00:53:47.386
Now it doesn't apply the

00:53:47.476 --> 00:53:49.346
rotation or cropping, it simply

00:53:49.346 --> 00:53:50.866
suggests it as a starting point.

00:53:51.936 --> 00:53:53.036
If you like what Photos has

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:54.596
done, you can simply tap Done

00:53:54.976 --> 00:53:56.966
and the rotation or cropping is

00:53:56.966 --> 00:53:57.346
applied.

00:53:57.346 --> 00:53:59.276
But if you'd like to change what

00:53:59.346 --> 00:54:01.066
Photos has suggested, you can

00:54:01.066 --> 00:54:02.566
simply use the slider at the

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:04.256
bottom to rotate or drag the

00:54:04.256 --> 00:54:05.346
corners to crop.

00:54:05.346 --> 00:54:07.386
So these are great examples of

00:54:07.416 --> 00:54:07.886
corrections.

00:54:08.426 --> 00:54:10.046
We show you familiar controls

00:54:10.516 --> 00:54:11.196
and we learn from the

00:54:11.196 --> 00:54:12.356
corrections you make.

00:54:13.046 --> 00:54:15.936
So that concludes the last

00:54:15.936 --> 00:54:16.236
pattern.

00:54:17.276 --> 00:54:18.236
Allow corrections through

00:54:18.236 --> 00:54:18.906
familiar ways.

00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:20.866
This makes it easy and fast for

00:54:20.866 --> 00:54:21.696
somebody to correct.

00:54:22.666 --> 00:54:24.136
Provide immediate value when

00:54:24.136 --> 00:54:25.256
somebody makes a correction.

00:54:25.466 --> 00:54:26.406
As we saw with the text

00:54:26.406 --> 00:54:28.396
correction, the keyboard won't

00:54:28.396 --> 00:54:29.616
autocorrect things that we

00:54:29.616 --> 00:54:29.926
typed.

00:54:30.856 --> 00:54:32.436
And use corrections as implicit

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:32.886
feedback.

00:54:33.276 --> 00:54:34.446
Corrections work great as

00:54:34.446 --> 00:54:36.076
implicit feedback to improve

00:54:36.396 --> 00:54:37.766
your machine learning results.

00:54:38.346 --> 00:54:41.566
So those are all the interface

00:54:41.566 --> 00:54:42.676
patterns we wanted to show you

00:54:42.676 --> 00:54:42.996
today.

00:54:43.766 --> 00:54:45.026
As you can see, many of these

00:54:45.026 --> 00:54:46.536
patterns leverage existing

00:54:46.536 --> 00:54:48.216
interface elements we've had for

00:54:48.216 --> 00:54:48.816
a long time.

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.436
Machine learning, therefore, is

00:54:51.436 --> 00:54:52.916
an elevation of what we've been

00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:53.756
doing all along.

00:54:54.436 --> 00:54:55.236
These patterns are not

00:54:55.236 --> 00:54:56.886
necessarily new but they are

00:54:56.966 --> 00:54:57.976
applied in a new context.

00:54:58.096 --> 00:55:00.536
And whenever we choose our

00:55:00.536 --> 00:55:02.046
patterns, we have to make sure

00:55:02.046 --> 00:55:03.446
we respect people's work.

00:55:04.456 --> 00:55:06.266
Adding additional attribution or

00:55:06.266 --> 00:55:08.246
additional feedback actions asks

00:55:08.246 --> 00:55:09.496
even more information for

00:55:09.496 --> 00:55:11.246
someone to parse and that

00:55:11.246 --> 00:55:12.406
invades their attention and

00:55:12.406 --> 00:55:13.996
might distract them from their

00:55:13.996 --> 00:55:14.786
task at hand.

00:55:15.536 --> 00:55:16.816
So choose your patterns with

00:55:16.866 --> 00:55:18.466
people in mind first.

00:55:18.946 --> 00:55:22.416
So designing a machine learning

00:55:22.416 --> 00:55:23.786
experience is not just

00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:24.946
outputting your results in an

00:55:24.946 --> 00:55:25.446
interface.

00:55:26.376 --> 00:55:27.626
The way we select our data,

00:55:27.806 --> 00:55:29.526
metrics, inputs and outputs

00:55:29.836 --> 00:55:31.546
plays a very important role in

00:55:31.546 --> 00:55:32.746
making these experiences

00:55:32.816 --> 00:55:34.856
understandable, intuitive and

00:55:34.856 --> 00:55:35.256
delightful.

00:55:35.906 --> 00:55:39.716
Now to end our talk, I want to

00:55:39.716 --> 00:55:40.916
go back to something that Kayur

00:55:40.916 --> 00:55:41.786
said in the beginning.

00:55:42.796 --> 00:55:44.156
Apple uses machine learning to

00:55:44.156 --> 00:55:45.906
create products and experiences

00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:47.416
we could never create before,

00:55:47.876 --> 00:55:49.136
products and experiences we

00:55:49.186 --> 00:55:49.956
really care about.

00:55:51.156 --> 00:55:52.236
You've seen examples of how

00:55:52.236 --> 00:55:53.826
machine learning helps us manage

00:55:53.826 --> 00:55:55.986
our attention, on how it allows

00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:56.676
us to give you better

00:55:56.676 --> 00:55:58.656
recommendations, on how it can

00:55:58.656 --> 00:56:00.276
present contextual information

00:56:00.276 --> 00:56:01.896
at the right time, and how we

00:56:01.896 --> 00:56:03.946
can automate mundane tasks so

00:56:04.156 --> 00:56:05.646
you can focus on what matters.

00:56:06.446 --> 00:56:07.716
But machine learning can help us

00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:09.086
achieve much more than that.

00:56:10.356 --> 00:56:11.846
Apple has always used technology

00:56:11.846 --> 00:56:13.886
to empower everyone and machine

00:56:13.886 --> 00:56:15.486
learning only elevates that

00:56:15.486 --> 00:56:16.116
capability.

00:56:16.716 --> 00:56:19.416
It can empower us to be healthy

00:56:19.736 --> 00:56:22.186
by measuring our activity and

00:56:23.016 --> 00:56:25.746
our steps.

00:56:25.936 --> 00:56:27.336
Machine learning allows us to be

00:56:27.336 --> 00:56:29.206
more inclusive by leveraging our

00:56:29.476 --> 00:56:31.426
communication, for example by

00:56:31.426 --> 00:56:32.776
adding voice control to the

00:56:32.776 --> 00:56:34.456
camera so a blind person can see

00:56:34.456 --> 00:56:35.886
what they're holding or it can

00:56:35.886 --> 00:56:37.336
know when their loved ones are

00:56:38.116 --> 00:56:40.216
in frame.

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:41.566
Machine learning helps us to be

00:56:41.566 --> 00:56:43.416
safe by detecting problems with

00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:46.016
our heart by measuring our heart

00:56:46.016 --> 00:56:48.126
beats or an ECG.

00:56:48.346 --> 00:56:49.976
And lastly, it can allow us to

00:56:49.976 --> 00:56:51.656
be creative by seeing the world

00:56:51.656 --> 00:56:53.606
in a whole new way, for example

00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:54.856
by letting a known tool like a

00:56:54.856 --> 00:56:56.946
pencil do magic things on

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:57.286
screen.

00:56:58.896 --> 00:57:00.926
So you can see when we align the

00:57:00.926 --> 00:57:02.836
we create with the values we

00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:04.246
uphold, we can create

00:57:04.246 --> 00:57:05.786
experiences that really elevate

00:57:05.846 --> 00:57:06.766
the best of humanity.

00:57:07.316 --> 00:57:09.186
That's everything we had in

00:57:09.186 --> 00:57:10.516
store for you and we hope we've

00:57:10.566 --> 00:57:11.986
given you plenty of inspiration,

00:57:11.986 --> 00:57:13.576
insight into designing great

00:57:13.576 --> 00:57:14.716
machine learning experiences.

00:57:15.806 --> 00:57:17.086
All the patterns we talked about

00:57:17.086 --> 00:57:18.646
and more are available on the

00:57:18.646 --> 00:57:20.456
Human Interface Guidelines as a

00:57:21.066 --> 00:57:21.196
beta.

00:57:21.876 --> 00:57:23.416
There are still a few more talks

00:57:23.416 --> 00:57:24.556
this afternoon about machine

00:57:24.556 --> 00:57:26.026
learning and all of us will be

00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:28.196
available in the coming hour at

00:57:28.196 --> 00:57:29.546
the User Interface Design Lab to

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:30.706
answer any questions you might

00:57:30.706 --> 00:57:30.946
have.

00:57:31.226 --> 00:57:32.916
So make sure to come by and say

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:33.146
hi.

00:57:33.866 --> 00:57:34.936
Thank you all for attending and

00:57:34.936 --> 00:57:35.966
enjoy the last day of WWDC.

00:57:36.016 --> 00:57:38.000
