[ Music ]

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:12.826
>> Hi, everyone.

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:14.326
My name is Dan.

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:15.636
I'm an engineer on the

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:17.316
Accessibility Team, and I'm

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:18.506
super excited to be talking to

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:20.086
you about Accessibility Custom

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.696
Actions and how they can improve

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.336
the experience for people using

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:24.976
assistive technologies with your

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:25.346
apps.

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:26.646
Let's get started.

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.656
Custom actions are really great

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:30.386
for two things.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:32.826
The first is reducing clutter in

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:33.206
your app.

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:35.436
This is important for everyone

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:37.026
that uses your app, but it's

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:38.256
especially important for people

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:39.796
that use assistive technologies,

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:40.916
and I'll explain why.

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.346
The second is all about

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:44.736
improving the convenience and

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:46.066
speed of more complex

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.906
interactions in your app.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.216
Let's start by talking about

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.426
reducing clutter and to do this

00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:53.196
I'd like to talk about

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:53.786
VoiceOver.

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:55.986
VoiceOver is the built-in screen

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:57.076
reader we ship across many of

00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:58.246
our products for people who are

00:00:58.246 --> 00:00:59.406
blind and low vision.

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:01.746
People that use VoiceOver can

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:02.886
navigate through their apps in a

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:04.936
variety of ways but one way

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.616
that's particularly popular when

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:07.986
navigating through a new app or

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:10.066
interface is by swiping left and

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.606
right to move between the next

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:12.366
and previous item.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.756
I have an app I've been working

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:16.866
on to help me track my favorite

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:17.586
types of peanut butter.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:19.486
If you were going to use this

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:22.066
app without using VoiceOver and

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.326
we wanted to increase the rating

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:24.466
of the second jar of peanut

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.886
butter in this list, how do we

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:27.476
go about doing that?

00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:30.766
Well, you'd probably visually

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.396
scan the list until you found

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:33.336
the jar you were looking for.

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:35.746
You then might focus on that

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:37.276
cell and look for the button

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:38.416
that affords the action you want

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:41.486
to perform and then tap on it.

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:43.396
Now that may seem pretty

00:01:43.396 --> 00:01:46.026
intuitive but that's because the

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:47.426
UI affords that intuition by

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:48.846
logically grouping the buttons

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:51.036
with the cells, which makes the

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:52.806
content easy for us to process

00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:56.016
and digest, but what if instead

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.136
the app was laid out a bit

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:57.666
differently?

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:01.036
Perhaps something like this.

00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:03.996
Notice the buttons are now

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:05.566
underneath the cells, which

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:06.736
means we have a lot more content

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:07.396
to scroll through.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:09.735
Additionally, it's much more

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:11.296
ambiguous as to which buttons

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:12.486
correspond to which cells.

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.276
This could very well be the

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:16.736
experience for someone using

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.026
VoiceOver with your app.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:19.806
Let me show you what I mean.

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:21.776
Let's take a look at what it's

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:23.206
like to use VoiceOver to

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:24.046
navigate through one of the

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:25.806
cells of this app.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.116
>> Patty's, creamy, Noster rated

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:30.926
1 out of 5.

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:33.116
Add to favorites button.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.296
Decrease rating button.

00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:37.596
Increase rating button.

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:40.816
>> After we swipe past the cell

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.696
we focused on three buttons, add

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.546
to favorites, decrease rating

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.776
and increase rating and those

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.166
three buttons exist in every

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.386
single cell in this list.

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.096
So if we were trying to find the

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.106
10th jar, we would have listened

00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:57.726
to those buttons 30 times, which

00:02:57.726 --> 00:02:59.146
can very quickly get repetitive.

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:01.426
Additionally, we have to keep in

00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:02.846
our head what the last jar of

00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:03.926
peanut butter we heard was,

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:06.156
otherwise we don't know what

00:03:06.156 --> 00:03:07.366
content is going to be affected

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:08.546
when we activate one of those

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:09.000
controls.

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.206
So let's take a look at the app

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:13.356
only this time designed a bit

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:13.836
differently.

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:15.556
I've changed the buttons so that

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:16.676
they're no longer accessible to

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:17.246
VoiceOver.

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:19.246
I've added custom actions to the

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:21.006
cells so that when VoiceOver

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:22.536
lands on a cell we can swipe up

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:23.956
or down with one finger to

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:25.496
choose an action and then double

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:26.486
tap to perform it.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:27.626
Let's take a look.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:32.456
>> Patty's, creamy, Noster rated

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:33.626
1 out of 5.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.126
Anna's, chunky, sugar-free,

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:38.096
rated 4 out of 5.

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:40.416
Actions available toggle

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:43.226
favorite, increase rating.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:46.596
>> This time when we swipe past

00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:48.576
the cell we just got to the next

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:50.586
one which made it much easier

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:51.526
for us to go through this

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:52.876
content and find what we are

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:53.446
looking for.

00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:55.996
Once we found it, we could then

00:03:55.996 --> 00:03:57.536
drill in and pick an interaction

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.086
from there, which much more

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.556
closely matches the experience

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:01.786
we talked about earlier of

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:03.626
visually scanning a list.

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:06.446
So custom actions can really

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.656
help us reduce clutter, we

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:10.146
remove the repetitive controls,

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:11.676
and we also reduced the

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:13.266
cognitive load on ourselves

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:14.346
while we were using the app.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:16.685
Because we're explicitly picking

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:18.305
an interaction after finding the

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:19.906
content we want to interact with

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:22.166
it's no longer ambiguous what

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:23.096
those controls do.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.296
All of this simplified the

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:25.866
experience.

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:30.436
Next let's talk about how custom

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.646
actions can improve the

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.126
convenience and speed of more

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:34.496
complex interactions in your app

00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:36.566
and to do this I'd like to talk

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:37.386
about Switch Control.

00:04:37.386 --> 00:04:39.686
This is another feature we ship

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:41.096
for people with limited mobility

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:42.706
and these people can interact

00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:43.996
with their devices using as few

00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:45.316
as one or two inputs.

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:48.096
I've added some additional

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:49.186
functionality into the peanut

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:50.836
butter app so that when we long

00:04:50.836 --> 00:04:52.596
press on a cell an action sheet

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:54.016
comes up with additional options

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:55.896
including the option to send

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.126
information about one of the

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.186
jars of peanut butter to a

00:04:58.186 --> 00:04:58.576
friend.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:00.586
I have two switches paired with

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:00.986
the device.

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:03.336
The orange switch will move

00:05:03.376 --> 00:05:04.566
Switch Control's focus to the

00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:06.646
next item and the white switch

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:07.636
will select that item.

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:09.996
Keep in mind switches can be

00:05:09.996 --> 00:05:11.016
designed for a variety of

00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:11.516
different needs.

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:13.566
So, for example, someone might

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:14.696
have switches mounted to a

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:15.566
wheelchair that they can

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:16.346
activate with their head.

00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:18.656
Let's take a look at what it's

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:20.866
like to Switch Control to send

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:22.076
information about that second

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:23.066
jar of peanut butter to our

00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:23.500
friend.

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.196
So we can use our orange switch

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:28.516
to navigate down to the second

00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.066
cell and then use the white

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:31.116
switch to select it.

00:05:31.906 --> 00:05:32.836
This brings up the Switch

00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:34.336
Control Menu which provides

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:35.656
additional options of ways we

00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:36.726
can interact with the cell.

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:39.056
We can navigate down to the page

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:40.896
control and select it to view

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:41.666
more options.

00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:44.446
From here, we can press select

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:46.106
to drill in and then navigate

00:05:46.106 --> 00:05:46.906
over to gestures.

00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:49.246
Selecting this will give us a

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:50.836
list of all of the gestures we

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:52.276
might have wanted to perform by

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:53.096
touching the display.

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:55.926
From here we can navigate down

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.246
to the second row and press

00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:59.046
select to drill in and then

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.576
navigate over to tap and hold.

00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:03.006
Selecting this will perform our

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:04.496
long press gesture and bring up

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:06.126
our action sheet, which we can

00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:08.126
then navigate through to select

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:08.996
send to a friend.

00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:12.556
We'll perform the tap and we're

00:06:12.556 --> 00:06:13.000
done.

00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:17.356
Now if you think about it, we

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:19.886
did all of that and we never

00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:20.726
touched the display.

00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:23.316
That's pretty cool, right?

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.156
But you also probably noticed

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:27.386
that that interaction normally

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.946
takes us two taps, one long

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:31.646
press and one tap on the action

00:06:31.646 --> 00:06:33.806
sheet and with Switch Control

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:38.186
that took us 18 taps, but custom

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:39.756
actions can significantly reduce

00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:40.256
that number.

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:43.596
So let's take a look again only

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:44.706
this time I've added custom

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:45.826
actions back into the app.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.006
We'll still use the orange

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:49.156
switch to navigate down to the

00:06:49.206 --> 00:06:51.436
second cell only this time when

00:06:51.436 --> 00:06:53.276
we select it right away on the

00:06:53.386 --> 00:06:54.526
first page of the Switch Control

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:56.066
Menu are all of the actions of

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:56.716
we've implemented.

00:06:57.426 --> 00:06:59.306
We can drill in, navigate over

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:01.056
to send to a friend, press

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:03.736
select and we're done.

00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:06.326
We didn't even need to navigate

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:07.396
through the action sheet that

00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:08.386
came up the first time.

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:10.866
We're right where we need to be.

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:13.516
That was a significantly faster

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.066
interaction.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.626
We were able to take those 18

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:18.896
taps and we get all the way down

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.836
to 6 taps, which is 67% fewer

00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:22.806
taps than before.

00:07:23.406 --> 00:07:26.366
So custom actions can provide

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:27.926
huge wins for convenience and

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:28.336
speed.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:30.566
We removed the cumbersome

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:32.036
gestures which significantly

00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:33.036
sped up the interaction.

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:35.286
Additionally, we improved the

00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:36.856
prominence and the convenience

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.466
of those interaction options by

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:39.666
placing them on the first page

00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:40.656
of the Switch Control Menu.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:42.566
We didn't need to navigate

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:44.166
through several submenus and try

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:45.526
out different gestures to figure

00:07:45.526 --> 00:07:46.516
what might be possible.

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:48.526
Instead, everything was much

00:07:48.526 --> 00:07:50.606
more straightforward and direct.

00:07:51.436 --> 00:07:52.746
Now I bet after hearing all

00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:54.266
these awesome advantages of

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:55.946
custom actions you just can't

00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:57.116
wait to use them in your apps

00:07:57.646 --> 00:07:58.896
and luckily it's pretty easy.

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:00.926
You simply override the

00:08:00.996 --> 00:08:02.286
Accessibility Custom Actions

00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:04.406
property on your view and return

00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:06.026
an array of UI accessibility,

00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:07.236
custom action objects.

00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:09.886
Each one takes in a name, a

00:08:09.886 --> 00:08:11.036
target, and a selector.

00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:13.676
Your function simply needs to

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:14.936
return a Boolean as to whether

00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:16.226
or not the action was successful

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:18.466
and take in an UI accessibility

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:19.696
custom action object as a

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:20.136
parameter.

00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:23.316
New this year we have a version

00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:24.626
of the API that takes in an

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:25.936
action handler instead of a

00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:26.756
target and selector.

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:28.576
So if using a block of code

00:08:28.636 --> 00:08:29.606
better fits with the design of

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:30.996
your app, we encourage you to

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:31.656
give this a try.

00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:36.015
[ Applause ]

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:36.866
Yes.

00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:39.226
Additionally, if you're going to

00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:40.716
use a custom action to replace

00:08:40.716 --> 00:08:41.895
something like an accessory

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:43.756
control inside of a cell, you'll

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.776
often want to set is

00:08:44.776 --> 00:08:46.236
accessibility element to false

00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:47.786
on those controls so they're no

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:48.706
longer navigable by the

00:08:48.706 --> 00:08:49.646
assistive technology.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:52.786
And what we talked about our

00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:54.256
VoiceOver and Switch Control in

00:08:54.256 --> 00:08:56.486
our demos today, custom actions

00:08:56.486 --> 00:08:57.786
can be leveraged across many of

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.036
the assistive technologies we

00:08:59.036 --> 00:09:00.956
ship including full keyboard

00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:02.426
access and voice control which

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:03.116
are new this year.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:04.976
I really encourage you to turn

00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:06.526
some of these features on and

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.866
play around with your apps to

00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:09.356
look for ways custom actions can

00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:10.346
improve the experience.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:11.826
Thank you very much.
