00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:03.500
[ Music ]

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.426
>> All right.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:10.826
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:14.496
My name is Jonathan Bennett and

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:16.166
I work with the Connected Media

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:16.966
team at Apple.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.416
And I'm happy to be here today

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:20.706
helping kick off the conference,

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.116
talking with you about AirPlay.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.036
So to start, let's talk about

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.646
what you can do with AirPlay.

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:30.326
You can use AirPlay to

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:32.946
wirelessly send a video to watch

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:35.916
on your TV or listen to music

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:36.626
throughout your home.

00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:41.086
And you can also share pretty

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:44.916
much anything from your iOS or

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:46.556
macOS screen using AirPlay

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.146
Mirroring.

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:49.766
And so for today's talk, we're

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.686
going to focus on video and

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:52.796
we'll go over some of the

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:55.756
enhancements we've made to make

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.106
sure that you can find out about

00:00:58.106 --> 00:01:00.556
all the great TV destinations

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:03.556
and AirPlay experiences on

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:05.866
AirPlay sending devices.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.136
So when it comes to

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:13.166
destinations, Apple TV used to

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.086
be the only way that you could

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:15.836
AirPlay a video to a TV, and

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.336
it's still a great choice for

00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:18.426
many people.

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:20.376
And as you heard earlier this

00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:23.556
year, we've been working with

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.106
some of the largest TV

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:29.106
manufacturers to build AirPlay

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:31.856
support directly into the TVs.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:33.956
This dramatically increases the

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.936
choices people have on where

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:38.396
they can AirPlay their video to,

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:41.126
and it adds a huge number of TVs

00:01:41.586 --> 00:01:44.266
that you can now take advantage

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:44.466
of.

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:49.436
So just look for this label on

00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:50.636
the box and you'll know that it

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:52.776
supports AirPlay Mirroring,

00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:55.156
multi-room music and, of course,

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:55.576
video.

00:01:56.146 --> 00:02:00.836
And this is a high-quality video

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:06.156
experience with both Apple TV

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.156
and AirPlay capable TVs able to

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:11.426
support up to 4K HDR video with

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:12.236
a surround sound.

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:15.976
So those are some of the great

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:17.796
new additions that we've made to

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:17.886
TVs.

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:20.296
And when it comes to AirPlay

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.726
sending devices, I'd like to go

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:23.656
over some of the enhancements

00:02:23.656 --> 00:02:25.206
we've made to iOS to make it

00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:26.456
easier than ever for people to

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:28.276
get the content they love from

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:31.806
your app to the TV.

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:34.426
So first, your video app can now

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:36.486
sort TV destinations to the top

00:02:36.486 --> 00:02:38.266
of the AirPlay list, making it

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:41.166
easier than ever to find the TV

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:42.266
you want to play a video on.

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:45.966
We've also made enhancements and

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.286
enriched the remote controls

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:50.976
available to allow people to

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:53.316
interact with your video quickly

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:53.996
and easily.

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:57.246
And we've also made improvements

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:58.076
to allow people to better

00:02:58.076 --> 00:02:59.816
multitask on their iOS devices

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:02.046
so they can receive a phone call

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:04.556
or check out that cute video

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:05.796
that they just got from an

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:07.786
iMessage while your video

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.066
continues playing on the TV.

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:13.566
And lastly, iOS can now

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:16.076
intelligently suggest to TV to

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.666
AirPlay to using on-device

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:18.006
learning.

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:19.806
So I can just sit back on the

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:21.566
couch, launch your video app,

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:23.436
and just tap on my favorite show

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.256
and have it automatically show

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:25.906
on the TV.

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:30.266
With great new TV destinations

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:31.316
and all of these experience

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:32.786
improvements, now is the time to

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:34.346
make sure that your video apps

00:03:34.386 --> 00:03:35.536
fully support AirPlay.

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:37.896
So I'd like to take the rest of

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:40.486
this talk to go over five key

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.296
areas that you can add this

00:03:43.296 --> 00:03:44.246
great experience.

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.156
First, we'll make sure that you

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:48.376
have high-quality video

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:49.696
available for the TV.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:52.816
Then we'll provide a way for

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.096
people to get that video onto

00:03:54.096 --> 00:03:55.716
the TV using an in-app picker.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:59.676
And once it's on the TV, we'll

00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:00.606
make sure that people can

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:04.536
control it and we'll make sure

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:05.986
that that video keeps on playing

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:08.796
while they use their iOS device

00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:09.476
for other things.

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:13.256
And lastly, if you have an app

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:15.836
that plays primarily long-form

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:18.786
video like movies or TV, there

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:19.805
are some additional steps that

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:20.796
you should take to make sure

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:22.966
that your users benefit from

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:25.356
intelligent AirPlay Suggestions.

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:29.986
So let's start by talking about

00:04:30.256 --> 00:04:31.256
high-quality video.

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:35.466
HTTP Live Streaming is a fast

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:36.666
and adaptive way to stream

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:37.916
high-quality video to any

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:38.506
device.

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:40.926
And you're likely already using

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:43.476
HLS to deliver video to your iOS

00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:43.886
apps.

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:46.256
Now, some of you might be

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:48.286
curating your playlist to focus

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:49.536
on those type of devices.

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:52.096
So, an iPhone screen or an iPad

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:52.576
screen.

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:55.796
But remember at any time, a user

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.656
could take that video and want

00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.036
to send it and AirPlay it to a

00:04:59.036 --> 00:04:59.656
TV.

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:00.696
So it's important that you have

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:02.376
a full range of variants in your

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:04.876
playlist that are appropriate

00:05:05.246 --> 00:05:07.036
for a TV, including variants

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.196
that support 4K, HDR and

00:05:10.196 --> 00:05:10.946
surround sound.

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:14.266
Now, if in your playlist you

00:05:14.266 --> 00:05:15.966
have multiple video codecs that

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:17.626
you use to encode your content,

00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:19.766
be sure to also provide a full

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.276
range of variants for each video

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:21.696
codec.

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:23.506
This makes sure that your video

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:25.386
is fully supported on any device

00:05:25.386 --> 00:05:27.646
it plays back on and it also

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:29.166
makes sure that the player can

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.876
transition smoothly between

00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:33.576
variants using the same video

00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:34.406
codec.

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:37.856
Now, one thing that I find

00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:40.536
myself doing frequently is fast

00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:41.696
forwarding or seeking through

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:42.186
video.

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:46.656
And whether that's to skip a

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:48.676
scary part of a movie with--

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:49.986
that I'm watching with my kids

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.716
or to find that interesting

00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:53.306
topic in the middle of a WWDC

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:57.386
video having fast, rapid, frame

00:05:57.386 --> 00:05:59.716
previews while seeking allows me

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.886
to find what I want quickly and

00:06:01.886 --> 00:06:02.476
confidently.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.896
So you can add the support in

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:06.366
your videos by including an

00:06:06.426 --> 00:06:09.446
I-frame variant to your HLS

00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:11.046
playlist.

00:06:11.606 --> 00:06:13.946
And lastly, if you have

00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:15.426
high-value content that you need

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:16.566
to protect and manage, you're

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:18.196
likely using FairPlay Streaming

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:18.726
to do that.

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:21.106
And FairPlay Streaming is fully

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:22.866
supported whenever and wherever

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:24.626
you AirPlay, that includes

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:25.926
AirPlaying to an Apple TV.

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:28.296
And I'm also happy to say that

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:29.526
FairPlay Streaming is supported

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:31.506
on every smart TV with built-in

00:06:31.506 --> 00:06:32.276
AirPlay support.

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:35.786
Now, there are more details

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.496
about validating your HL streams

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:38.706
for AirPlay than we can cover

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:40.336
here today, so we've made a

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:41.826
separate video associated with

00:06:41.826 --> 00:06:43.196
this session and I encourage you

00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:46.206
to check that out.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.826
So, having high-quality content

00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:50.266
is great but we also want to

00:06:50.266 --> 00:06:51.606
make sure that we have smooth

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:52.296
playback.

00:06:53.376 --> 00:06:56.366
Now, if you have pre, mid or

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:57.846
post-roll content that you need

00:06:57.846 --> 00:07:00.686
to insert into your video, use

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.256
HLS's discontinuity tag to do

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:02.896
that.

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:05.126
This allows the player to remain

00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:06.486
intact and the estimated

00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:07.816
bandwidths to remain intact so

00:07:07.816 --> 00:07:09.086
both your interstitial video

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:10.086
plays in high quality.

00:07:10.486 --> 00:07:11.646
And when it ends and you resume

00:07:11.646 --> 00:07:13.176
the main content, that content

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:15.196
can immediately begin in high

00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:15.736
quality.

00:07:16.356 --> 00:07:19.406
It's, again, important to make

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:20.536
sure that these interstitial

00:07:20.536 --> 00:07:21.656
videos have the same video

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:23.366
formatting as the main content,

00:07:23.846 --> 00:07:25.316
such as the same video codec and

00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:26.556
this allows these transitions to

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:30.026
happen quickly and smoothly.

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:32.146
Now, if you can't use HLS

00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:33.286
discontinuity tag for some

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.766
reason or you have multiple

00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:36.056
pieces of content that you want

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.436
to play serially, we encourage

00:07:38.436 --> 00:07:39.816
you to use AVQueuePlayer when

00:07:39.816 --> 00:07:40.366
AirPlaying.

00:07:43.006 --> 00:07:45.276
And if you can't use

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:47.286
AVQueuePlayer when AirPlaying,

00:07:47.286 --> 00:07:49.166
please use the same AVPlayer

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:51.316
instance and just replace the

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.326
current item with your new

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:52.856
content.

00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:55.286
You don't want to destroy an

00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:56.756
AVPlayer and create a new one

00:07:57.066 --> 00:07:58.976
for every piece of video or swap

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:01.026
between instances, because when

00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:02.536
AirPlaying, the system doesn't

00:08:02.536 --> 00:08:03.966
know that a new piece of video

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:04.916
is going to be arriving.

00:08:05.206 --> 00:08:06.876
And so it might start tearing

00:08:06.876 --> 00:08:07.976
down the engine and you don't

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:09.746
want to introduce this type of

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:10.846
delay just because you're

00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:12.346
transitioning between videos.

00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:17.036
All right, we've got

00:08:17.226 --> 00:08:18.296
high-quality content.

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:20.176
Now, let's give a way for people

00:08:20.176 --> 00:08:21.426
to get that to the TV.

00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:24.056
And you can do that by adding an

00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:25.446
AirPlay picker into your app.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.076
And new in iOS 13, you can

00:08:28.076 --> 00:08:29.586
decide how you want to order

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:30.856
those destinations.

00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:35.366
To add an AirPlay picker, use

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:36.385
AVRoutePickerView.

00:08:36.576 --> 00:08:38.256
It's been available since iOS 11

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:40.836
and it's now available on macOS.

00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:43.566
Now, some of you might be using

00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:45.286
MPVolumeView's route button

00:08:45.286 --> 00:08:47.176
properties to get a picker in

00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:47.476
your app.

00:08:47.926 --> 00:08:50.906
And in iOS 13, the route button

00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:52.546
properties are now deprecated.

00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:55.346
Now, don't worry, you can still

00:08:55.346 --> 00:08:58.266
use MPVolumeView for putting

00:08:58.266 --> 00:08:59.796
volume UI into your app.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:00.736
But when it comes to route

00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:02.766
buttons, use RoutePickerView.

00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:11.976
So let's see how you can add

00:09:11.976 --> 00:09:13.816
that, and it's really simple.

00:09:14.436 --> 00:09:16.566
All I have to do is create a

00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:17.876
AVRoutePickerView and add it to

00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:18.686
my view hierarchy.

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:23.236
And in iOS 13, I can set

00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:25.166
prioritizesVideoDevices to true

00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:28.996
and that will give me a route

00:09:28.996 --> 00:09:31.516
button icon that is focused on

00:09:31.516 --> 00:09:33.176
video with the AirPlay video

00:09:33.176 --> 00:09:36.056
logo, and it also sorts those TV

00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:37.296
destinations to the top making

00:09:37.296 --> 00:09:39.366
it super easy to find that TV I

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:40.756
want to play to.

00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:46.536
So now that I have video playing

00:09:46.536 --> 00:09:48.636
on the TV, let's make sure that

00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:49.836
people have a way to control it

00:09:49.836 --> 00:09:51.036
and this is really important.

00:09:51.036 --> 00:09:52.166
And so we've made sure that

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:53.626
remote controls are more

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:55.426
convenient and capable than ever

00:09:55.616 --> 00:09:56.526
throughout the system.

00:09:57.716 --> 00:09:59.556
For example, I can control my

00:09:59.556 --> 00:10:02.236
video with lock screen controls

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:03.426
and we've added additional

00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:04.346
capabilities when you've

00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:06.876
targeted a TV.

00:10:07.046 --> 00:10:09.186
I can also use Siri and issue

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:10.906
play commands and say, you know,

00:10:10.906 --> 00:10:12.276
play this on my TV.

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:18.816
And it's not just about

00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:20.746
controlling what's on your iOS

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:22.306
device but also the devices

00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:22.886
around you.

00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:24.576
For example, you can pull down

00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:25.846
Control Center and you can

00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:27.296
target HomePods that are playing

00:10:27.296 --> 00:10:29.086
music throughout your home or

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.806
even a tvOS app that is playing

00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:32.136
a video and I can see what's

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:33.606
playing and control it from

00:10:33.606 --> 00:10:34.686
almost any device.

00:10:39.136 --> 00:10:41.216
So, what happens if your app

00:10:41.216 --> 00:10:42.896
doesn't support remote controls?

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:44.216
Well, here I have my app and

00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:45.566
it's AirPlaying to the TV.

00:10:46.006 --> 00:10:48.276
But if I were to lock the

00:10:48.276 --> 00:10:49.826
screen, I wouldn't know that the

00:10:49.826 --> 00:10:51.066
video is playing and, more

00:10:51.066 --> 00:10:52.306
importantly, I would have no way

00:10:52.306 --> 00:10:53.546
to interact with that video.

00:10:55.846 --> 00:10:56.866
So by supporting remote

00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:59.616
controls, you can know what's

00:10:59.616 --> 00:11:02.816
playing, how far along I am in

00:11:02.816 --> 00:11:05.476
that video, a great way to

00:11:05.476 --> 00:11:07.646
interact with it quickly, and

00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:09.336
then there's even a way to get

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.616
back to the app that's currently

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:12.096
playing that video by just

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:14.546
tapping the artwork or the

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:15.316
title.

00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:18.246
So, let's go through how you can

00:11:18.246 --> 00:11:19.416
add these remote controls in

00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:20.836
your app and it starts with

00:11:20.836 --> 00:11:24.076
becoming the Now Playing app.

00:11:24.336 --> 00:11:25.716
You become the Now Playing app

00:11:25.716 --> 00:11:27.306
by doing two things, one is to

00:11:27.306 --> 00:11:28.886
at least support one remote

00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:30.736
control command and the other is

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:32.046
to initiate playback with

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:33.316
immediate configuration.

00:11:34.696 --> 00:11:36.356
And on iOS, that means

00:11:36.356 --> 00:11:38.056
activating your audio session

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:40.066
with a non-mixable category.

00:11:40.246 --> 00:11:41.506
And for most video apps, that's

00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:42.286
going to be the playback

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:42.856
category.

00:11:43.476 --> 00:11:47.006
On macOS and iOS code running on

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.656
macOS, you'll do something

00:11:48.656 --> 00:11:49.896
slightly different.

00:11:49.896 --> 00:11:51.476
You're going to grab the

00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:53.856
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter and

00:11:54.486 --> 00:11:55.606
change the playback state

00:11:55.606 --> 00:11:57.956
whenever you start or end your

00:11:57.956 --> 00:11:59.086
video experience.

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:03.286
When it comes to supporting

00:12:03.286 --> 00:12:04.986
remote controls, if you're using

00:12:04.986 --> 00:12:06.896
AVKit's AVPlayerViewController

00:12:06.896 --> 00:12:08.096
to present your video, it

00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:09.956
handles remote controls for you

00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:11.706
so you're all set.

00:12:13.256 --> 00:12:15.336
If you're using AVFoundation and

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:16.736
a custom UI to present your

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.766
video, you'll need to use

00:12:18.766 --> 00:12:19.846
MPRemoteCommandCenter and

00:12:19.926 --> 00:12:21.756
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter in order

00:12:21.756 --> 00:12:23.146
to get equivalent functionality.

00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:24.906
And so I'd like to spend some

00:12:24.976 --> 00:12:26.296
time going through step by step

00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:27.816
about how you use this media

00:12:27.816 --> 00:12:30.256
player APIs and build out this

00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:31.006
functionality.

00:12:31.616 --> 00:12:34.416
So here I am back at my lonely

00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:37.216
lock screen, and let's just add

00:12:37.216 --> 00:12:39.156
some basic support by supporting

00:12:39.156 --> 00:12:39.896
the play command.

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:43.856
I can do that by creating a

00:12:43.856 --> 00:12:45.396
setup method for supporting

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:46.286
remote controls.

00:12:46.906 --> 00:12:48.166
And we'll be coming back to this

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:49.316
method again and again as we

00:12:49.316 --> 00:12:50.196
continue to build out our

00:12:50.196 --> 00:12:50.816
support.

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:54.256
I first grab the shared instance

00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:55.256
of the remote command center.

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:58.596
And the remote command center

00:12:58.896 --> 00:13:00.456
supports many different types of

00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:01.516
media commands.

00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:03.346
Here, we're supporting the play

00:13:03.346 --> 00:13:03.826
command.

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:05.596
And to that, we'll add a target

00:13:05.596 --> 00:13:07.606
handler to receive that command

00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:08.686
and do something with it.

00:13:09.306 --> 00:13:10.616
So here, we'll start our

00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:10.936
playback.

00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:14.096
And once I've done that, I'll

00:13:14.096 --> 00:13:15.966
return a status on whether that

00:13:15.966 --> 00:13:17.346
command succeeded or failed.

00:13:18.266 --> 00:13:19.966
And this is the basic structure

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:20.976
you're going to use for any

00:13:20.976 --> 00:13:22.276
remote command that you support.

00:13:22.846 --> 00:13:25.936
So to flash out our playback

00:13:25.936 --> 00:13:28.106
command handling, we'll support

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:29.446
the pause command and the

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:31.176
togglePlayPauseCommand by adding

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:32.216
handlers for those.

00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:36.496
So this got me a platter with a

00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:38.926
play/pause button and I at least

00:13:38.926 --> 00:13:40.236
know what app is playing, but

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.916
it'd be really great to know

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:43.236
what video is playing.

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:46.656
And you can do that by providing

00:13:46.656 --> 00:13:47.846
Now Playing info.

00:13:49.026 --> 00:13:50.296
And Now Playing info comes in

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:53.266
two parts, one is the item

00:13:53.266 --> 00:13:54.616
metadata such as the artwork or

00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.896
title and then the playback

00:13:56.896 --> 00:13:58.326
state such as the duration and

00:13:58.326 --> 00:13:59.926
the current elapsed time.

00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:02.056
So in my code, there are two

00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:03.706
major events where I'll want to

00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:04.576
update this information.

00:14:05.196 --> 00:14:07.486
One is when a item changes, so

00:14:07.486 --> 00:14:09.336
going from episode one to

00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:10.936
episode two.

00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:14.016
The other is when I have a

00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:15.736
current item and the playback

00:14:15.736 --> 00:14:17.346
state changes so I-- my rate

00:14:17.346 --> 00:14:20.166
changes or I seek to a new

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:21.256
position in the video.

00:14:21.886 --> 00:14:26.686
So when an item changes, I'm

00:14:26.686 --> 00:14:28.466
going to take a metadata that

00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:30.336
I've packaged up in my app with

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.906
a structure just to pass it

00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:33.776
around through my app, I'm going

00:14:33.776 --> 00:14:34.986
to update that static Now

00:14:34.986 --> 00:14:36.686
Playing info such as the title

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:37.366
and the artwork.

00:14:38.206 --> 00:14:41.436
And if I have it, I'm going to

00:14:41.646 --> 00:14:43.696
update the playback info at this

00:14:43.696 --> 00:14:44.616
time as well.

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:47.056
Now, when a playback state

00:14:47.056 --> 00:14:50.416
change happens, all I need to do

00:14:50.416 --> 00:14:51.846
is update that playback info.

00:14:51.846 --> 00:14:54.496
I don't need to update artwork

00:14:54.496 --> 00:14:56.446
and spend time doing all of

00:14:57.216 --> 00:14:57.326
that.

00:14:57.446 --> 00:14:58.846
So let's see how you can update

00:14:58.846 --> 00:14:59.806
some of this information.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.806
And the first thing I'm going to

00:15:02.806 --> 00:15:04.296
do is grab the Now Playing info

00:15:04.296 --> 00:15:06.496
dictionary from the shared info

00:15:06.496 --> 00:15:06.956
center.

00:15:07.546 --> 00:15:11.036
And to this dictionary, I'm

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.296
going to update my metadata.

00:15:12.296 --> 00:15:13.866
So here, I'm updating title and

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:14.396
artwork.

00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:16.016
And there are many other types

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:17.276
of metadata that are supported

00:15:17.276 --> 00:15:18.576
and that I might support in my

00:15:18.576 --> 00:15:18.826
app.

00:15:19.756 --> 00:15:21.266
Regardless of what I support,

00:15:21.266 --> 00:15:23.426
it's important to update this

00:15:23.426 --> 00:15:25.216
metadata or clear it out, nil it

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:28.206
out if a particular item doesn't

00:15:28.206 --> 00:15:29.826
have that type of property.

00:15:30.636 --> 00:15:32.866
You don't want a mix of old and

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:35.206
new metadata in the dictionary.

00:15:35.766 --> 00:15:38.606
Once I've updated it, though, I

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:39.996
just pass it back to the info

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:41.126
center for presentation.

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:46.816
So, it's really simple to update

00:15:47.106 --> 00:15:48.276
Now Playing information.

00:15:48.446 --> 00:15:49.936
And now, let's see how we update

00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:50.896
the playback info.

00:15:51.956 --> 00:15:53.496
And it's done very similarly.

00:15:53.496 --> 00:15:54.836
I grab the Now Playing

00:15:54.836 --> 00:15:56.466
information, the info

00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:58.366
dictionary, and to that, I'm

00:15:58.366 --> 00:15:59.906
going to update the duration,

00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:01.376
the elapse playback time, and

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:02.076
the playback rate.

00:16:03.256 --> 00:16:05.846
And now, I only need to update

00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:07.106
this on significant change

00:16:07.106 --> 00:16:07.356
events.

00:16:07.356 --> 00:16:08.326
I don't need to update this

00:16:08.326 --> 00:16:10.006
every second to see progress

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:10.886
through the remote UIs.

00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:12.906
As long as I update these three

00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:15.216
items when a rate changes or I

00:16:15.216 --> 00:16:16.776
have a significant jump, then

00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:18.816
the system can infer where you

00:16:18.816 --> 00:16:20.206
are in your video at any given

00:16:20.206 --> 00:16:22.236
moment and update the remote UIs

00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:22.816
accordingly.

00:16:23.406 --> 00:16:25.836
And again, once I've updated

00:16:25.836 --> 00:16:26.916
this, I'll just pass it back to

00:16:26.916 --> 00:16:29.206
the info center to get

00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:30.586
presented.

00:16:31.006 --> 00:16:32.686
So I know what video is playing

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:34.216
and it's really nice to be able

00:16:34.216 --> 00:16:36.506
to navigate through that video.

00:16:37.156 --> 00:16:39.096
So you can add the support for a

00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:41.406
seeking with a playhead scrubber

00:16:42.726 --> 00:16:44.206
or skipping forward and backward

00:16:44.706 --> 00:16:45.386
in your video.

00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:47.666
So let's see how we do this.

00:16:48.976 --> 00:16:50.606
So we're back in our method for

00:16:50.606 --> 00:16:51.786
setting up remote control

00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:52.326
commands.

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:55.046
And I'm going to add support for

00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:56.186
the skip forward command.

00:16:56.816 --> 00:16:58.386
And this is one of the commands

00:16:58.386 --> 00:16:59.206
that supports additional

00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:01.016
configuration, and here, I'm

00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:02.026
setting the preferred skip

00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:03.746
interval to 15 seconds.

00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:07.576
I then add a handler for that

00:17:07.576 --> 00:17:08.046
command.

00:17:09.506 --> 00:17:10.796
And it's important to note here

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:12.646
that I'm using the interval

00:17:12.646 --> 00:17:13.556
that's passed to me through the

00:17:13.556 --> 00:17:14.396
commands event.

00:17:15.195 --> 00:17:16.366
Just because I set a preferred

00:17:16.366 --> 00:17:17.226
interval doesn't mean that's

00:17:17.226 --> 00:17:18.455
going to be used every time.

00:17:18.786 --> 00:17:20.816
For example, I could ask Siri to

00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:23.036
jump forward by 42 seconds.

00:17:23.106 --> 00:17:24.175
And that's the value that's

00:17:24.175 --> 00:17:25.326
going to get passed to me and

00:17:25.326 --> 00:17:26.356
the one that I should honor.

00:17:26.976 --> 00:17:30.446
I'll then round out my support

00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:32.576
by supporting the skip backward

00:17:32.576 --> 00:17:34.576
command and the change playback

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:35.966
position command which is used

00:17:35.966 --> 00:17:36.616
when seeking.

00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:41.266
Now, for some apps and some

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:42.396
types of video, you might need

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:43.586
to temporarily disable

00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:45.636
navigation and you can easily do

00:17:45.636 --> 00:17:47.076
that by setting the isEnabled

00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:48.646
property on the commands that

00:17:48.646 --> 00:17:49.526
you need to disable.

00:17:49.966 --> 00:17:50.856
You don't need to remove the

00:17:50.856 --> 00:17:55.286
target handler and add it back.

00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:58.046
So one thing new this year that

00:17:58.046 --> 00:17:59.406
we've added to remote control

00:17:59.406 --> 00:18:01.866
UIs is the ability to select and

00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:03.496
change audio languages and

00:18:03.496 --> 00:18:04.246
subtitles.

00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:06.456
So if you have video with these

00:18:06.456 --> 00:18:08.326
types of options, you're going

00:18:08.326 --> 00:18:09.316
to want to add this type of

00:18:09.316 --> 00:18:11.866
support for remote controlling.

00:18:12.296 --> 00:18:14.746
This allows people to watch the

00:18:14.746 --> 00:18:19.636
video the way they want and need

00:18:19.636 --> 00:18:20.236
easily.

00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:22.766
So you can add this support by

00:18:22.766 --> 00:18:25.096
providing a list of audible and

00:18:25.096 --> 00:18:28.206
legible language options that

00:18:28.206 --> 00:18:29.406
represent the audio languages

00:18:29.406 --> 00:18:30.196
and subtitles.

00:18:30.746 --> 00:18:32.366
And you can also then identify

00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:33.376
the current selections in each

00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:34.176
of those groups.

00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:35.986
And lastly, you're going to want

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:37.316
to handle changes to those

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.156
selections via the remote UIs.

00:18:39.466 --> 00:18:42.706
So let's see how we provide this

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:43.236
information.

00:18:43.836 --> 00:18:46.396
And it starts by creating a

00:18:46.396 --> 00:18:46.886
mapping.

00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:49.466
So I'm going to load the audible

00:18:49.466 --> 00:18:52.876
and legible language groups from

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.006
my AVAsset.

00:18:54.006 --> 00:18:55.696
And I'm going to create a

00:18:55.696 --> 00:18:57.906
mapping of these by translating

00:18:57.906 --> 00:18:59.406
them into the media player

00:18:59.856 --> 00:19:02.466
objects that represent these

00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:03.186
options.

00:19:03.286 --> 00:19:04.296
And I can use convenience

00:19:04.296 --> 00:19:05.196
functions to do that.

00:19:05.196 --> 00:19:07.406
And I'll maintain this mapping

00:19:07.776 --> 00:19:10.286
in my app so that when I receive

00:19:10.286 --> 00:19:11.466
a language option from a remote

00:19:11.466 --> 00:19:12.476
command, I can eventually

00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:13.636
translate it into the

00:19:13.636 --> 00:19:15.656
AVFoundation object and set it

00:19:15.656 --> 00:19:17.446
on my AVPlayer item to change

00:19:17.446 --> 00:19:18.166
the selection.

00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:22.056
So once I have this mapping, I

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:23.246
can update that info.

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.626
And here, I'm doing that in the

00:19:25.626 --> 00:19:26.886
update method for my playback

00:19:26.886 --> 00:19:28.666
info, where I've already added

00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:31.116
the playback duration and elapse

00:19:31.226 --> 00:19:31.586
time.

00:19:32.536 --> 00:19:34.466
And to that, I'm going to add

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.186
the list of available option

00:19:36.186 --> 00:19:38.876
groups and their current

00:19:38.876 --> 00:19:39.436
selections.

00:19:39.436 --> 00:19:43.026
So now, we have to handle

00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:44.696
changes to those selections.

00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:48.456
And I can do that in my setup

00:19:48.456 --> 00:19:50.466
method for remote controls or

00:19:50.466 --> 00:19:51.626
I'll add support for the

00:19:51.626 --> 00:19:54.016
enableLanguageOptionCommand.

00:19:54.946 --> 00:19:56.626
And this handler is going to

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:58.036
first get the current playback

00:19:58.036 --> 00:19:58.306
item.

00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:01.406
And then use my mapping to take

00:20:01.406 --> 00:20:02.226
the language option that I

00:20:02.226 --> 00:20:05.186
received and translate it to the

00:20:05.186 --> 00:20:06.376
AVFoundation objects.

00:20:08.636 --> 00:20:10.646
I'll then use AVPlayer items,

00:20:11.136 --> 00:20:12.886
select option and group method

00:20:13.696 --> 00:20:16.256
to select the new option on the

00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:16.896
current item.

00:20:17.476 --> 00:20:19.166
And I'll want to update my Now

00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:20.536
Playing info and other internal

00:20:20.536 --> 00:20:22.216
state and handle that playback

00:20:22.216 --> 00:20:22.696
change.

00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:27.126
Now, there are some types of

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:28.356
option groups that could have

00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:29.166
nothing selected.

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:30.426
For example, turning off

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:31.996
subtitles and closed captions.

00:20:32.136 --> 00:20:33.416
And this comes through with the

00:20:33.416 --> 00:20:35.176
disableLanguageOptionCommand.

00:20:35.176 --> 00:20:35.956
So you want to make sure to

00:20:35.956 --> 00:20:37.676
support both the enable and

00:20:37.676 --> 00:20:38.796
disable commands.

00:20:39.646 --> 00:20:41.036
And the handler is very similar,

00:20:41.966 --> 00:20:43.216
first, getting the current item

00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:46.326
and using my mapping to find the

00:20:46.326 --> 00:20:46.716
group.

00:20:47.816 --> 00:20:49.856
But now, I'm going to check if

00:20:49.856 --> 00:20:51.086
that group allows empty

00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:53.016
selection and make sure that it

00:20:53.016 --> 00:20:53.406
can.

00:20:53.976 --> 00:20:57.676
And if it does, I'm going to use

00:20:57.676 --> 00:20:58.786
the same select method but

00:20:58.786 --> 00:21:00.226
passing nil as the option and

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:01.316
this will deselect all the

00:21:01.316 --> 00:21:02.326
options in that group.

00:21:06.346 --> 00:21:07.676
So I've got a full set of remote

00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:09.296
controls that I can support.

00:21:09.456 --> 00:21:10.836
When do I register and

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:11.986
deregister for these?

00:21:12.286 --> 00:21:13.766
For most video apps, you're

00:21:13.766 --> 00:21:15.046
going to register when you have

00:21:15.046 --> 00:21:16.746
content to play and that's when

00:21:16.746 --> 00:21:19.886
a user selects a video in your

00:21:19.886 --> 00:21:20.036
app.

00:21:21.136 --> 00:21:22.726
And you also want to deregister

00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:23.916
when you have nothing to play.

00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:27.116
So, a user exits your video.

00:21:27.756 --> 00:21:29.146
And you'll use that opportunity

00:21:29.146 --> 00:21:30.226
to also clear out the Now

00:21:30.226 --> 00:21:31.506
Playing info dictionary to make

00:21:31.506 --> 00:21:33.086
sure that there's no still data

00:21:33.086 --> 00:21:33.796
hanging around.

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:37.986
Now, I mentioned that it's not

00:21:37.986 --> 00:21:38.986
just about controlling what's

00:21:39.236 --> 00:21:40.476
playing from your device but the

00:21:40.476 --> 00:21:41.536
devices around you.

00:21:42.036 --> 00:21:44.216
So if you have a tvOS app that

00:21:44.216 --> 00:21:46.426
you make, try playing some

00:21:46.626 --> 00:21:49.076
content on Apple TV and pulling

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:50.976
down Control Center on an iPhone

00:21:51.466 --> 00:21:53.146
and target that Apple TV.

00:21:53.566 --> 00:21:56.236
See that you're seeing the video

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:57.456
information that you expect and

00:21:57.456 --> 00:21:58.556
you're able to control it as you

00:21:58.556 --> 00:21:58.976
expect.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.826
The same goes for using Siri to

00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:01.646
control your TV.

00:22:05.336 --> 00:22:07.006
So the examples that I went

00:22:07.006 --> 00:22:08.656
through just now are all part of

00:22:08.656 --> 00:22:09.816
a sample project that we've made

00:22:09.816 --> 00:22:11.156
available associated with this

00:22:11.156 --> 00:22:11.496
session.

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:12.656
And I encourage you to check

00:22:12.696 --> 00:22:13.706
that out.

00:22:16.196 --> 00:22:17.286
All right.

00:22:17.286 --> 00:22:18.626
We got high-quality content that

00:22:18.626 --> 00:22:19.856
we can get on the TV and we can

00:22:19.856 --> 00:22:20.806
control it.

00:22:21.136 --> 00:22:22.376
When it's playing on the TV,

00:22:22.376 --> 00:22:23.516
it's really nice to be able to

00:22:23.516 --> 00:22:25.366
use my phone or my iPad for

00:22:25.366 --> 00:22:26.226
other things.

00:22:27.086 --> 00:22:29.166
And there are two parts to

00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:30.736
supporting a great multitasking

00:22:30.736 --> 00:22:31.386
experience.

00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:33.026
One is to make sure that your

00:22:33.026 --> 00:22:35.256
video keeps on playing while the

00:22:35.256 --> 00:22:36.366
user multitasks.

00:22:36.796 --> 00:22:38.356
And the other is to make sure

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:40.526
that if there's already video

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.396
playing on the TV that your app

00:22:42.396 --> 00:22:43.336
and navigating through its UI

00:22:43.336 --> 00:22:46.086
doesn't accidentally interrupt

00:22:46.186 --> 00:22:47.126
that experience.

00:22:48.796 --> 00:22:51.556
So, when I'm watching a video on

00:22:51.556 --> 00:22:53.876
my phone, my video app is

00:22:53.876 --> 00:22:54.506
usually staying in the

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:56.006
foreground because I need to

00:22:56.006 --> 00:22:57.226
look at it on the screen.

00:22:57.936 --> 00:23:00.896
But when I'm AirPlaying on the

00:23:00.996 --> 00:23:02.746
TV, I'm now free to use my

00:23:02.746 --> 00:23:04.236
iPhone for other things like

00:23:04.236 --> 00:23:06.066
check my messages or mail, or

00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:06.766
social media.

00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:11.506
If I'm using a video app that

00:23:11.506 --> 00:23:13.406
doesn't support background

00:23:14.216 --> 00:23:16.346
media, the video is going to

00:23:16.346 --> 00:23:17.526
stop the moment I leave that

00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:17.806
app.

00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:19.686
And so we want to make sure that

00:23:19.686 --> 00:23:21.516
your video can continue playing.

00:23:22.136 --> 00:23:24.306
And you can do this by

00:23:24.306 --> 00:23:26.166
supporting the audio background

00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:27.836
mode in your app's Info.plist.

00:23:29.376 --> 00:23:30.946
And you'll also configure your

00:23:30.946 --> 00:23:32.456
AVAudioSession for background

00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:32.966
playback.

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.556
For most video apps, that means

00:23:35.556 --> 00:23:36.906
using the playback category.

00:23:37.106 --> 00:23:38.776
And this provides media

00:23:38.926 --> 00:23:41.386
appropriate behaviors in your

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:44.696
app, including playing in the

00:23:46.056 --> 00:23:46.416
background.

00:23:46.416 --> 00:23:47.786
Another thing about the playback

00:23:47.786 --> 00:23:48.786
category devices, it'll

00:23:48.786 --> 00:23:49.866
interrupt the other media.

00:23:49.996 --> 00:23:51.496
So it's really important to make

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:53.286
sure that you only activate your

00:23:53.286 --> 00:23:54.656
audio session when a user

00:23:54.886 --> 00:23:56.596
presses play and begins playback

00:23:56.776 --> 00:23:58.816
on a primary piece of content in

00:23:58.816 --> 00:24:00.676
your app.

00:24:01.046 --> 00:24:02.496
Now, once you go active, you can

00:24:02.496 --> 00:24:04.126
stay active.

00:24:05.116 --> 00:24:06.976
There's no need to deactivate

00:24:06.976 --> 00:24:08.256
your audio session just because

00:24:08.256 --> 00:24:12.826
the user paused the video.

00:24:13.226 --> 00:24:14.696
Now, media interruptions can

00:24:14.696 --> 00:24:16.666
happen at any time.

00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:18.916
And so, it's important to listen

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.346
to those notifications on

00:24:20.346 --> 00:24:21.156
AVAudioSession.

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:23.746
And when an interruption begins,

00:24:23.746 --> 00:24:25.466
you update your UI and internal

00:24:25.466 --> 00:24:26.056
state.

00:24:26.596 --> 00:24:28.426
And when it ends, check the

00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:30.456
notifications payload and make

00:24:30.456 --> 00:24:32.736
sure that you check the

00:24:32.736 --> 00:24:35.566
shouldResume key and honor that

00:24:35.566 --> 00:24:36.086
value.

00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:38.486
So, only automatically resume

00:24:38.486 --> 00:24:40.386
your video if it returns true.

00:24:41.006 --> 00:24:43.776
When you have video already

00:24:43.826 --> 00:24:45.046
playing on the TV, it's

00:24:45.046 --> 00:24:46.986
important to test your app and

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:48.386
launching it, navigating to the

00:24:48.386 --> 00:24:49.976
UI and make sure that there's

00:24:49.976 --> 00:24:51.156
nothing that accidentally

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:52.606
AirPlays that you didn't expect,

00:24:53.086 --> 00:24:54.796
or that it interrupts that

00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:56.146
current video experience.

00:24:57.216 --> 00:24:59.566
And I like to go over a couple

00:24:59.566 --> 00:25:01.106
examples that you might run

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:01.796
into.

00:25:02.436 --> 00:25:04.896
For one, there's sometimes video

00:25:04.896 --> 00:25:05.926
that should never AirPlay.

00:25:06.186 --> 00:25:09.396
So if I have an animation on app

00:25:09.396 --> 00:25:11.406
launch that I achieved using a

00:25:11.406 --> 00:25:14.986
video asset, you don't want that

00:25:14.986 --> 00:25:16.056
interrupting the current

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:16.906
experience.

00:25:17.306 --> 00:25:18.886
The same goes if I have video

00:25:18.886 --> 00:25:20.326
assets I use for other types of

00:25:20.326 --> 00:25:22.236
visual flourish or to promote

00:25:22.236 --> 00:25:24.176
content within my app.

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:25.976
You can make sure that those

00:25:25.976 --> 00:25:26.916
videos don't interrupt the

00:25:26.916 --> 00:25:27.946
current experience and stay

00:25:27.946 --> 00:25:31.386
local on the device by setting

00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:33.456
allowsExternalPlayback to false.

00:25:33.986 --> 00:25:37.276
Your app should only AirPlay a

00:25:37.276 --> 00:25:38.896
video when a user has directly

00:25:38.896 --> 00:25:40.416
interacted with that video.

00:25:41.016 --> 00:25:46.326
And to that end, you should not

00:25:46.786 --> 00:25:48.746
auto-play primary content just

00:25:48.746 --> 00:25:50.156
because your app launched or

00:25:50.156 --> 00:25:51.266
came into the foreground.

00:25:51.866 --> 00:25:54.856
When it comes to media, people

00:25:54.856 --> 00:25:56.376
should always be in control of

00:25:56.376 --> 00:25:57.606
when playback begins.

00:25:58.866 --> 00:25:59.846
And this is really important,

00:25:59.846 --> 00:26:01.006
and I want to go over a couple

00:26:01.006 --> 00:26:02.486
examples of why.

00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:06.136
So here, I am listening to music

00:26:06.136 --> 00:26:08.176
on my iPhone and I have a video

00:26:08.176 --> 00:26:10.126
app that supports on-demand

00:26:10.126 --> 00:26:11.766
video that I can watch but also

00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:13.666
auto-plays a live TV channel

00:26:14.356 --> 00:26:15.226
when the app comes to the

00:26:15.226 --> 00:26:15.856
foreground.

00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:18.566
So if I'm listening to music, I

00:26:18.566 --> 00:26:20.346
launch that app, that music is

00:26:20.346 --> 00:26:21.956
going to stop and I had no

00:26:21.956 --> 00:26:23.426
control over it.

00:26:24.216 --> 00:26:25.566
And I might have launched that

00:26:25.566 --> 00:26:27.136
app for a purpose other than

00:26:27.136 --> 00:26:28.366
watching that live video.

00:26:28.996 --> 00:26:32.076
You want to make sure that

00:26:32.076 --> 00:26:33.686
people can launch your app

00:26:33.686 --> 00:26:36.106
confidently knowing that their

00:26:36.106 --> 00:26:37.286
current experience won't get

00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:37.956
interrupted.

00:26:38.526 --> 00:26:41.046
And I like to call out one more

00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:42.306
important example that is new

00:26:42.306 --> 00:26:42.846
this year.

00:26:45.106 --> 00:26:47.106
For long-form video apps, iOS

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:48.956
can suggest a TV to

00:26:48.956 --> 00:26:52.416
automatically play to when the

00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:53.316
video begins.

00:26:53.816 --> 00:26:55.326
And when this happens, the

00:26:55.326 --> 00:26:56.996
system provides a notification

00:26:56.996 --> 00:26:59.006
telling the user that the video

00:26:59.006 --> 00:27:00.096
will automatically play on the

00:27:00.096 --> 00:27:00.596
TV.

00:27:01.376 --> 00:27:02.726
And people can tap that

00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:04.406
notification or the status bar

00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:05.966
icon to change that suggested

00:27:05.966 --> 00:27:06.746
destination.

00:27:07.326 --> 00:27:10.876
Now, if I have an app that

00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:13.626
auto-plays its content, it's

00:27:13.626 --> 00:27:15.116
possible that that video starts

00:27:15.116 --> 00:27:16.786
playing on the TV before I've

00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:18.256
had a chance to really see and

00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:20.106
interact with that notification.

00:27:21.336 --> 00:27:22.446
By requiring to use the action

00:27:22.446 --> 00:27:24.896
to begin playback, you can

00:27:24.896 --> 00:27:26.726
provide people the power to

00:27:26.726 --> 00:27:28.756
decide both when and where they

00:27:28.756 --> 00:27:30.376
play their video, and that

00:27:30.376 --> 00:27:31.386
creates a great media

00:27:31.386 --> 00:27:32.166
experience.

00:27:32.236 --> 00:27:34.316
And so, to talk with you more

00:27:34.316 --> 00:27:37.116
about long-form video apps and

00:27:37.386 --> 00:27:38.596
their integration with

00:27:38.596 --> 00:27:39.946
intelligent AirPlay Suggestions,

00:27:40.436 --> 00:27:41.496
I'd like to invite up on to the

00:27:41.496 --> 00:27:42.746
stage Marty Pye.

00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:49.606
[ Applause ]

00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:52.496
>> Thank you, Jonathan.

00:27:52.696 --> 00:27:53.446
Hello, everyone.

00:27:53.486 --> 00:27:54.416
My name is Marty Pye.

00:27:54.416 --> 00:27:55.916
I'm an AVKit engineer here at

00:27:55.916 --> 00:27:56.196
Apple.

00:27:56.816 --> 00:27:58.526
And I'm here today to tell you a

00:27:58.526 --> 00:27:59.356
little bit more about the

00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:00.536
advanced routing features we

00:28:00.536 --> 00:28:03.246
built into iOS 13 and how your

00:28:03.246 --> 00:28:04.416
long-form video apps can take

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:05.606
advantage of these features.

00:28:06.386 --> 00:28:08.376
So first, we'll talk about what

00:28:08.376 --> 00:28:10.086
a long-form video app actually

00:28:10.186 --> 00:28:10.296
is.

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:12.666
Then I'll talk a bit more about

00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:14.396
what these specific routing

00:28:14.396 --> 00:28:15.606
behaviors are that we've built

00:28:15.606 --> 00:28:16.476
for long-form video apps.

00:28:17.066 --> 00:28:18.456
And finally, I'll show you how

00:28:18.456 --> 00:28:20.416
to integrate these features into

00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:20.906
your code.

00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:24.746
So what is a long-form video

00:28:25.356 --> 00:28:25.436
app?

00:28:25.436 --> 00:28:27.106
As the name suggests, any app

00:28:27.156 --> 00:28:28.626
that primarily plays long-form

00:28:28.626 --> 00:28:30.306
video content is considered a

00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:31.226
long-form video app.

00:28:31.336 --> 00:28:32.826
This content includes things

00:28:32.826 --> 00:28:35.456
such as movies or the TV type

00:28:35.496 --> 00:28:37.806
content like TV shows, sports,

00:28:37.806 --> 00:28:38.566
et cetera.

00:28:38.936 --> 00:28:41.206
If your app primarily plays

00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:44.036
content from social media or

00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:45.446
other types of short news clips,

00:28:45.666 --> 00:28:47.256
then it would not qualify as

00:28:47.256 --> 00:28:48.036
long-form video.

00:28:48.596 --> 00:28:51.876
We encourage you to assess your

00:28:51.876 --> 00:28:53.456
app holistically to decide in

00:28:53.456 --> 00:28:54.996
which category of movie it

00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:55.466
belongs.

00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:57.916
So once you've decided that your

00:28:57.916 --> 00:28:59.956
app is long-form video, how will

00:28:59.956 --> 00:29:01.136
the AirPlay routing behavior

00:29:01.136 --> 00:29:02.486
differ for such apps?

00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:05.106
Let's take a look at an example.

00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:09.076
If-- Imagine you're watching a

00:29:09.076 --> 00:29:11.006
documentary on banana slugs and

00:29:11.006 --> 00:29:12.666
you're AirPlaying this content

00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:14.346
from your iPhone to an Apple TV.

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:18.096
New in iOS 13, when your friend

00:29:18.096 --> 00:29:20.276
sends you his latest sweet dirt

00:29:20.276 --> 00:29:22.026
biking video, you can go ahead

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:23.456
and watch this short content

00:29:23.456 --> 00:29:25.366
locally on your device without

00:29:25.366 --> 00:29:26.896
interrupting the banana slug

00:29:26.896 --> 00:29:28.466
documentary that's playing on

00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:31.216
the TV.

00:29:31.366 --> 00:29:32.596
Another feature we've built into

00:29:32.596 --> 00:29:35.036
iOS 13 is AirPlay Suggestions.

00:29:35.956 --> 00:29:38.066
If the user goes to play some

00:29:38.066 --> 00:29:39.806
content and the AirPlay routing

00:29:39.806 --> 00:29:42.186
system detects a nearby likely

00:29:42.186 --> 00:29:44.816
AirPlay device, then the system

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:47.266
may prompt the user and suggest

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:48.886
to AirPlay to this device.

00:29:48.886 --> 00:29:50.726
Or, depending on the confidence,

00:29:50.866 --> 00:29:52.016
the system might also

00:29:52.016 --> 00:29:53.756
automatically route playback to

00:29:53.756 --> 00:29:54.436
that device.

00:29:55.816 --> 00:29:57.006
So now that you know about these

00:29:57.006 --> 00:29:58.856
features, how to take advantage

00:29:58.856 --> 00:29:59.976
of them in your app?

00:30:00.846 --> 00:30:01.986
Well, there's two things you

00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:02.526
need to do.

00:30:02.696 --> 00:30:04.206
And the first thing is

00:30:04.256 --> 00:30:05.496
registering your app as a

00:30:05.496 --> 00:30:06.616
long-form video app.

00:30:07.616 --> 00:30:08.596
So how do we do this?

00:30:09.456 --> 00:30:10.566
It's really very simple.

00:30:11.536 --> 00:30:12.876
All you need to do is add the

00:30:12.876 --> 00:30:14.836
AVInitialRouteSharingPolicy key

00:30:14.836 --> 00:30:16.796
to your app's Info.plist and set

00:30:16.796 --> 00:30:17.956
it to a long-form video.

00:30:19.256 --> 00:30:21.046
By setting this on the plist, we

00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:22.496
can ensure that your app behaves

00:30:22.496 --> 00:30:24.146
like every other long-form video

00:30:24.146 --> 00:30:25.846
app on the system before you

00:30:25.846 --> 00:30:27.176
create any of your playback

00:30:27.176 --> 00:30:28.876
objects and the moment it gets

00:30:28.876 --> 00:30:29.366
launched.

00:30:33.056 --> 00:30:34.756
Now, the second thing you need

00:30:34.756 --> 00:30:36.936
to do in order to leverage the

00:30:36.936 --> 00:30:38.656
AirPlay Suggestions is prepare

00:30:38.656 --> 00:30:39.916
the routing system prior to

00:30:39.916 --> 00:30:40.486
playback.

00:30:40.486 --> 00:30:43.016
I'm first going to give you a

00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:44.576
little conceptual overview of

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.326
how that works, and then we'll

00:30:46.326 --> 00:30:48.726
dive into how to achieve it in

00:30:51.476 --> 00:30:51.606
code.

00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:53.416
So in your app, you most likely

00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.666
have some sort of browsing UI

00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:57.016
where users can scroll through

00:30:57.016 --> 00:30:58.266
different pieces of content,

00:30:58.806 --> 00:31:00.246
select the piece of content they

00:31:00.246 --> 00:31:01.646
would like to play, and hit

00:31:01.646 --> 00:31:01.876
Play.

00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.256
Well, it's at this transition

00:31:04.256 --> 00:31:06.316
from browsing to actual playback

00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:07.996
where you should prepare the

00:31:07.996 --> 00:31:09.156
AirPlay routing system.

00:31:09.686 --> 00:31:11.316
And what happens when you

00:31:11.316 --> 00:31:12.436
prepare the routing system?

00:31:13.466 --> 00:31:15.756
Well, it may decide to

00:31:16.106 --> 00:31:17.556
automatically play the content

00:31:17.556 --> 00:31:19.996
locally on the device or route

00:31:19.996 --> 00:31:21.926
it to an external screen, be it

00:31:21.926 --> 00:31:23.876
via a likely nearby AirPlay

00:31:23.876 --> 00:31:25.446
device, or if you have an

00:31:25.446 --> 00:31:28.046
external screen wired into the

00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:29.236
device.

00:31:29.306 --> 00:31:30.646
However, depending on the level

00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:32.256
of confidence, the system may

00:31:32.256 --> 00:31:34.246
also prompt the user asking

00:31:34.246 --> 00:31:36.506
whether they would like to play

00:31:36.506 --> 00:31:38.006
to a nearby AirPlay device.

00:31:38.936 --> 00:31:41.086
And then depending on the user's

00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:42.416
choice, control will then be

00:31:42.416 --> 00:31:43.826
handed back to your app with

00:31:43.826 --> 00:31:45.196
information about where the

00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:47.916
content is going to play.

00:31:48.936 --> 00:31:50.156
So let's take a look at how to

00:31:50.156 --> 00:31:51.026
do this in code.

00:31:52.346 --> 00:31:55.036
When the user decides to hit

00:31:55.036 --> 00:31:56.696
Play, you should call

00:31:56.696 --> 00:31:58.546
prepareRouteSelectionForPlayback

00:31:58.696 --> 00:32:00.016
on the AVAudioSession.

00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:01.866
And this method takes a

00:32:01.866 --> 00:32:02.706
completion handler.

00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:05.286
Now, this completion handler

00:32:05.286 --> 00:32:06.836
will be called right away if the

00:32:06.836 --> 00:32:08.146
AirPlay can-- if the AirPlay

00:32:08.146 --> 00:32:09.596
routing system can make an

00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:10.646
automatic decision.

00:32:11.636 --> 00:32:13.796
However, there may also be a

00:32:13.796 --> 00:32:15.566
prompt shown asking the user

00:32:16.296 --> 00:32:17.286
whether they would like to play

00:32:17.286 --> 00:32:18.756
to this nearby AirPlay device.

00:32:19.436 --> 00:32:20.776
If the user decides they would

00:32:20.776 --> 00:32:22.416
like to play the content

00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:24.756
locally, then your completion

00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:26.296
handler will be called with

00:32:26.296 --> 00:32:27.796
route selection type local.

00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:30.656
Now, you can go ahead and

00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:31.676
present your playback UI.

00:32:31.676 --> 00:32:32.936
For example,

00:32:32.936 --> 00:32:35.226
AVPlayerViewController, or you

00:32:35.226 --> 00:32:36.736
can present your own custom

00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:37.276
playback UI.

00:32:38.836 --> 00:32:40.736
If the user instead decides they

00:32:40.736 --> 00:32:41.696
would like to AirPlay the

00:32:41.696 --> 00:32:43.456
content and they select the

00:32:43.456 --> 00:32:45.106
living room, then your

00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:46.026
completion handler will be

00:32:46.026 --> 00:32:47.656
called with route selection type

00:32:47.656 --> 00:32:48.256
external.

00:32:49.506 --> 00:32:50.786
And here, you have the

00:32:50.786 --> 00:32:52.536
opportunity to present some sort

00:32:52.536 --> 00:32:54.826
of custom remote playback UI

00:32:55.146 --> 00:32:57.596
with controls dedicated to

00:32:57.596 --> 00:32:58.706
controlling something that's

00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:00.216
playing on an external screen.

00:33:00.826 --> 00:33:02.176
Lastly, don't forget to handle

00:33:02.176 --> 00:33:03.566
the case that the user decides

00:33:03.906 --> 00:33:05.386
to cancel playback.

00:33:06.296 --> 00:33:08.246
Now, in order to test your app

00:33:08.246 --> 00:33:09.826
and how it behaves in the

00:33:09.826 --> 00:33:12.316
various different scenarios with

00:33:12.316 --> 00:33:14.116
AirPlay Suggestions, we've built

00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:15.786
some toggles into the developer

00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:16.256
settings.

00:33:17.016 --> 00:33:18.736
If you drill down to settings

00:33:18.736 --> 00:33:20.396
developer, you'll find this new

00:33:20.396 --> 00:33:21.846
entry, AirPlay Suggestions.

00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:25.426
And in here, you have the choice

00:33:25.426 --> 00:33:26.716
of three distinct modes.

00:33:28.236 --> 00:33:30.096
The Default mode is just the

00:33:30.096 --> 00:33:31.376
default system behavior.

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:34.616
You can also select between a

00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:36.926
mode where the system will

00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:38.556
always prompt the user and ask

00:33:39.056 --> 00:33:41.246
whether a content should AirPlay

00:33:41.246 --> 00:33:42.476
to a specific device.

00:33:43.286 --> 00:33:44.716
Or you can force the system into

00:33:44.716 --> 00:33:46.086
a mode where it will always

00:33:46.086 --> 00:33:47.936
automatically route to a

00:33:47.936 --> 00:33:48.756
specific device.

00:33:49.386 --> 00:33:50.946
And you can select which device

00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:53.456
this applies to in the nearby

00:33:53.456 --> 00:33:55.406
list of routes below.

00:33:56.056 --> 00:33:57.716
Once you've forced the system

00:33:57.716 --> 00:33:59.756
into a specific mode, make sure

00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:00.866
that you reset the media

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:01.436
services.

00:34:02.956 --> 00:34:04.166
If you're concerned about

00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:06.026
whether AirPlay Suggestions will

00:34:06.026 --> 00:34:07.806
handle every possible use case

00:34:07.806 --> 00:34:08.906
where your users might want to

00:34:08.906 --> 00:34:11.016
AirPlay, then don't worry.

00:34:11.326 --> 00:34:13.136
At the end of the day, you're

00:34:13.136 --> 00:34:15.085
still fully in control when and

00:34:15.085 --> 00:34:16.786
where things will AirPlay.

00:34:17.406 --> 00:34:20.356
You can always select to change

00:34:20.356 --> 00:34:21.886
which device you're AirPlaying

00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:23.886
to via AVRoutePickerView inside

00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:26.106
of your app via the controls

00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:27.676
inside of AVPlayerViewController

00:34:27.976 --> 00:34:29.386
or via control center.

00:34:31.346 --> 00:34:32.536
These new features just make it

00:34:32.536 --> 00:34:34.835
even easier for your users to

00:34:35.216 --> 00:34:36.795
get your content onto the device

00:34:36.795 --> 00:34:37.556
of their choosing.

00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:39.706
We encourage you to check out

00:34:39.706 --> 00:34:41.755
the associated sample code where

00:34:41.755 --> 00:34:43.456
we demonstrate in a simple test

00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:45.235
app how to integrate the

00:34:45.466 --> 00:34:46.835
behaviors we've described today.

00:34:47.916 --> 00:34:49.036
So what have we learned today?

00:34:49.746 --> 00:34:51.206
We've learned how to integrate

00:34:51.206 --> 00:34:52.396
an AirPlay picker into our app

00:34:52.646 --> 00:34:53.936
via AVRoutePickerView.

00:34:54.906 --> 00:34:57.036
We've learned how to handle and

00:34:57.226 --> 00:34:58.656
register for remote controls

00:34:58.656 --> 00:34:59.526
commands via

00:34:59.526 --> 00:35:01.576
MPRemoteCommandCenter, and how

00:35:01.576 --> 00:35:03.606
to populate system UI with

00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:04.416
relevant Now Playing

00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:05.016
information.

00:35:06.736 --> 00:35:07.706
We've learned how to take

00:35:07.706 --> 00:35:08.576
advantage of AirPlay

00:35:08.576 --> 00:35:10.636
multitasking and how to register

00:35:10.636 --> 00:35:11.936
your app as a long-form video

00:35:12.776 --> 00:35:12.846
app.

00:35:13.796 --> 00:35:15.546
And lastly, we've learned how to

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:17.056
prepare the routing system prior

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:18.556
to playback in order to fully
