[ Applause ]

00:00:11.306 --> 00:00:12.166
My name's Nick Gillett.

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:13.716
I'm an engineer here at Apple on

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:15.246
the Core Data team, and it is my

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:17.046
pleasure to welcome you to Using

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.556
Core Data with CloudKit.

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:20.826
Today, we're here to talk about

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:22.746
a belief that I have that all of

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:24.326
my data should be available to

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:26.036
me on whatever device I have,

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.516
wherever I am in the world.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.796
And to make this a reality, we

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.756
have to make it a lot easier for

00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:34.286
you to add this functionality to

00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:35.346
your applications.

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.346
I'm sure many of you came in

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:39.016
today with an iPhone, and you

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:40.716
may also have a Mac at home.

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:42.826
You may even be toting around a

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:44.506
MacBook or a MacBook Pro in your

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:45.616
backpack while you're here at

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.326
the conference.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:48.906
And the data that we create on

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:50.816
all of these devices is

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.106
naturally trapped.

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:52.976
Right?

00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:54.656
There's no easy way for us to

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:55.956
move it from one device to

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.496
another without some type of

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:58.546
user interaction.

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:01.306
Now, to solve this, we typically

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:03.066
want to turn to cloud storage.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:05.266
Because it offers us the promise

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:06.756
of moving data that's on one

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.556
device seamlessly and

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:10.096
transparently to all of the

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:11.496
other devices we own.

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:13.956
And cloud storage has benefits

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.726
even if we only happen to have a

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:16.836
single device.

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:17.306
Right?

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:18.986
As our applications create data

00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:20.926
on this device, it can be backed

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:22.466
up in the cloud and stored.

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.136
So that when we get a new

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:26.396
device, whether by choice or by

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:28.176
accident -- ask me how I know --

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:30.326
on the way out of the store,

00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.026
that device can be restored to

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:33.626
the one that we always knew and

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:33.976
loved.

00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:36.316
And it may surprise you to learn

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:37.406
that there are some existing

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:39.066
technologies on our platforms

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.056
that can help us with this

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:40.556
problem.

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:43.406
For example, Core Data provides

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:44.936
a robust set of APIs for

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:46.526
managing data locally in your

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:48.766
applications and on disc.

00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.076
And the CloudKit framework

00:01:50.306 --> 00:01:51.666
provides access to one of the

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.246
world's largest distributed

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.026
databases.

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:55.726
Both of these frameworks are

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.186
available on all of our Apple

00:01:57.276 --> 00:01:57.976
platforms.

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.106
And because of that, enable us

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:01.786
to build a wide variety of

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:02.526
applications.

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:04.806
In fact, these frameworks are

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:06.116
actually quite similar.

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.235
They even express themselves

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:09.925
using a common set of patterns

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:10.826
and paradigms.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:13.106
Modeling their APIs in terms of

00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:15.646
objects, models, and stores.

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:18.726
Now, in Core Data, we call these

00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:20.126
objects instances of

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:21.726
NSManagedObject, and they're

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:23.096
what gives our application

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:25.066
access to values that we store

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:25.926
on disc.

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:28.956
CloudKit similarly exposes a

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:31.086
CKRecord, which is a key value

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:32.606
like store for accessing data

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:34.166
that you've stored in the cloud.

00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:37.026
These objects are described by

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:38.466
what we like to call a model.

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:40.736
And in Core Data we call that an

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:42.856
NSManagedObjectModel, which you

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:44.686
can create in code or using the

00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:46.106
model editor in Xcode.

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:49.176
Quite similarly, CloudKit uses a

00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:49.586
Schema.

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:51.696
And the CloudKit schema can be

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:53.096
defined either by CloudKit

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:55.626
dynamically as you use CKRecords

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:56.846
in the development environment

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:59.056
or using the CloudKit dashboard.

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:01.776
Finally, objects are persisted

00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:03.686
to use the Core Data vernacular,

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:05.856
in what we like to call a store.

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.906
In Core Data those are instances

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:09.396
of NSPersistentStore.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.436
But in CloudKit, CKRecord's are

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:15.146
stored in a CKRecordZone or in a

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:16.166
CKDatabase.

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:18.696
And so, as you can see and

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:19.956
indeed as many of you have

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:20.976
pointed out to me over the

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:22.926
years, it would be great if we

00:03:22.926 --> 00:03:24.786
could make it easier to combine

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:26.416
these two conceptually similar

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:27.106
frameworks.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:29.216
And so to show you just how much

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:30.436
easier we've made that this

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:31.586
year, I'd like to take you

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:32.996
through what it's like to create

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:34.526
a brand new application in

00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:34.996
Xcode.

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:37.406
Here you can see, I have Xcode

00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:37.766
open.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.666
And I'm going to create a new

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:42.216
iOS project as a Master Detail

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:42.926
application.

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:44.356
I like Master Detail

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.636
applications because they give

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:47.646
us a great UI to build on top of

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:49.246
when exploring features of Core

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:49.596
Data.

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:51.896
So, I'll select it and click

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:52.326
Next.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:54.636
And then give my application a

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:54.956
name.

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:57.436
In this case, just WWDC Demo.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:03:59.476
And, because we're here to hear

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.246
about Core Data, we'll check the

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:02.546
Core Data checkbox.

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:05.176
New in Xcode 11 is this checkbox

00:04:05.176 --> 00:04:06.346
called Use CloudKit.

00:04:06.826 --> 00:04:08.346
And this tells Xcode that we

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:09.746
want to generate an application

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:11.336
that's designed to use both Core

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:12.646
Data and CloudKit.

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:14.876
So, let's check that, and then

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:16.536
we'll click Next and find our

00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:17.946
application somewhere to live on

00:04:17.946 --> 00:04:18.676
the file system.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.495
After we tap Create, Xcode

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:22.996
generates the application for

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:23.196
us.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.716
And if you've ever built a

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:26.246
CloudKit application before,

00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:27.716
you'll know that there are a

00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:29.266
couple additional things we need

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:30.866
to add to this before it's ready

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:31.986
to build and run.

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:33.546
These come in the form of

00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:35.606
Capabilities, which we add using

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.226
the Signing & Capabilities tab.

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:38.786
We need to add two.

00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:40.796
The first is the iCloud

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:41.516
capability.

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:42.936
So, I'll add that by clicking

00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:43.776
this plus (+) next to

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:46.206
Capability, type iCloud, and hit

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:46.556
Enter.

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:49.706
When I do that, I can hit the

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.436
CloudKit checkbox and you'll see

00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:52.486
that that adds push

00:04:52.486 --> 00:04:54.366
notifications for me as well.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:56.556
Xcode has also automatically

00:04:56.556 --> 00:04:58.036
created an iCloud container

00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.076
identifier for my application to

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:01.056
use.

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:02.396
Next, we want to add a

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:03.926
background mode capability.

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:05.396
And to do that, I'll hit the

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:06.636
plus (+) again, and type

00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:07.726
Background, and hit Enter.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.616
And the reason we do this is to

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:11.276
enable remote notifications,

00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:12.836
which allow our application to

00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:14.756
receive push notifications when

00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:15.506
it's not running.

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:18.086
So, let's run this application

00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:19.826
and see what Xcode has created

00:05:19.826 --> 00:05:20.316
for us.

00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:22.706
Here you can see that we have a

00:05:22.706 --> 00:05:24.636
very simple application with two

00:05:24.636 --> 00:05:25.446
view controllers.

00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:27.096
A table view on the left and a

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:28.356
detail view controller on the

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:28.636
right.

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:30.836
And I can add some data to this

00:05:30.836 --> 00:05:32.296
application using the plus (+)

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:33.346
button in the upper right-hand

00:05:33.346 --> 00:05:33.756
corner.

00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:35.746
By default, Xcode generates a

00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:37.596
very simple Core Data data model

00:05:37.686 --> 00:05:39.096
for us that's just a simple

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:39.766
timestamp.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.276
But, we're here to see what it's

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:43.806
like to add sync functionality.

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.606
And to do that, we need another

00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:46.636
device.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:48.186
So, let's run the application on

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:48.816
our iPhone.

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:50.516
And you can see that we have the

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.576
master view controller and all

00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:54.436
of the data that we added on our

00:05:54.436 --> 00:05:55.446
iPad.

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:57.426
Now let's add some data using

00:05:57.426 --> 00:05:57.856
our phone.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:00.366
And of course, watch that sync

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:01.796
back to the iPad.

00:06:02.306 --> 00:06:04.066
Now, because I have a magic push

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:05.596
notification in this controller,

00:06:05.596 --> 00:06:06.996
I can make this happen whenever

00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:07.496
I want.

00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:09.566
But let's see something that's a

00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:11.106
little bit more realistic.

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:13.156
I'm going to delete all the data

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:14.336
from this application that was

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:16.426
added on my iPhone from the

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:17.016
iPad.

00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:18.206
These top four rows.

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:20.346
And then, I'll do the same thing

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.146
from the iPhone, deleting all

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:23.736
the data that was added from the

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:24.476
iPad.

00:06:25.326 --> 00:06:27.616
Now, previously I used a magic

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:28.596
push notification.

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:29.966
But I'm not going to touch the

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:30.916
controller anymore.

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.756
I'll just let this video play so

00:06:32.756 --> 00:06:34.326
that you can see what it was

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:35.866
like to actually watch these two

00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:37.786
devices converge when I filmed

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:38.846
this.

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:40.796
Right?

00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:43.086
Now, as contrived as that might

00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:44.396
be, it's pretty awesome that in

00:06:44.396 --> 00:06:46.476
a few simple clicks we've built

00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:47.936
an application that syncs end to

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.366
end using both Core Data and

00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:49.896
CloudKit.

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:51.526
And I'd be doing you a

00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:52.666
disservice if somewhere in the

00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:54.236
application delegate I'd hidden

00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:55.806
15,000 lines of code.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:57.956
So, let's see what that looks

00:06:57.956 --> 00:06:58.126
like.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.526
Now, this is a pretty standard

00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:02.716
application delegate.

00:07:02.806 --> 00:07:04.086
In fact, if you've ever built a

00:07:04.086 --> 00:07:05.496
Core Data application before

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:07.326
using Xcode, it'll look very

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:09.246
familiar to you, including this

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:10.726
area where we set up the Core

00:07:10.726 --> 00:07:11.766
Data stack.

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.376
The only thing that's different

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:14.996
about this application is some

00:07:14.996 --> 00:07:16.676
new API in Core Data this year

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:17.426
called

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:19.086
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer,

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:20.786
which is designed to help you

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:22.266
manage Core Data stores that are

00:07:22.266 --> 00:07:24.686
backed by a CloudKit database.

00:07:26.216 --> 00:07:28.236
Now, if you've ever built a Core

00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:29.626
Data application before using

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.556
Xcode you will have seen

00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:33.216
NSPersistentContainer here

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:34.466
instead, which is

00:07:34.616 --> 00:07:36.276
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer's

00:07:36.276 --> 00:07:37.606
superclass.

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:39.636
Because of that, you can add

00:07:39.636 --> 00:07:41.086
CloudKit functionality to your

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.736
existing Core Data applications

00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:44.426
by changing as little as one

00:07:44.426 --> 00:07:45.036
line of code.

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:46.716
What exactly is

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:48.576
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer?

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:51.836
Well, it's an encapsulation of a

00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:53.466
set of really common patterns

00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:54.896
that we saw everyone have to

00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:56.346
build when they wanted to

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:57.966
implement end-to-end sync using

00:07:57.966 --> 00:07:58.496
CloudKit.

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:00.316
And it's designed to save you

00:08:00.316 --> 00:08:02.296
thousands of lines of code.

00:08:03.636 --> 00:08:05.276
It's also a foundation that we

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.676
hope to be able to build on with

00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:08.366
you iteratively in the years to

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:08.656
come.

00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:11.436
And of course, to do that -- get

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:13.236
ready, here it comes -- we need

00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:13.596
your help.

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:16.566
We're going to need feedback

00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:17.206
about how

00:08:17.356 --> 00:08:18.696
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:08:18.696 --> 00:08:20.696
works for you and what features

00:08:20.696 --> 00:08:22.246
it's missing, or whether or not

00:08:22.246 --> 00:08:23.776
its existing features are enough

00:08:23.776 --> 00:08:24.786
to meet the needs of your

00:08:24.786 --> 00:08:25.626
applications.

00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:27.396
So, let's look at a little bit

00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:28.866
-- a few of those features in

00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:29.296
detail.

00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:31.796
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:33.566
provides your application with a

00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:34.385
local replica.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.936
A complete mirror if you will of

00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:38.126
the Core Data -- or the CloudKit

00:08:38.155 --> 00:08:39.486
database that backs it.

00:08:40.265 --> 00:08:42.596
And, it also implements a robust

00:08:42.596 --> 00:08:44.135
scheduling and error recovery

00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:45.076
event loop so that your

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:46.116
application doesn't have to

00:08:46.116 --> 00:08:47.716
worry about any operations.

00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:49.986
Finally, it handles the

00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:51.876
transformation between instances

00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:53.096
of NSManagedObject, that I

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:55.636
mentioned earlier, and CKRecord.

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:58.596
Now, a local replica is

00:08:58.596 --> 00:08:59.676
important for a number of

00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:00.236
reasons.

00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:02.056
But it means that as your

00:09:02.056 --> 00:09:03.676
application works with objects,

00:09:03.866 --> 00:09:05.056
it will be writing them to a

00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:07.426
local store file managed by Core

00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:07.766
Data.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.626
And, it will be reading them

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:11.006
from that file as well.

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:13.216
And this is because of the

00:09:13.256 --> 00:09:14.176
difference between the

00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:15.956
performance profile of the local

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.056
database versus cloud storage.

00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:18.706
Right?

00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:19.646
When we think in terms of

00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:21.116
latency of accessing a local

00:09:21.116 --> 00:09:23.396
file, we can read from a file on

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.796
disc in milliseconds at the

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:25.926
worst case.

00:09:26.126 --> 00:09:27.256
Whereas, over the network, it

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:28.806
might take us seconds or minutes

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:29.786
to fetch the data that our

00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:30.846
application needs.

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:33.066
Likewise, the local store file

00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:34.396
can provide your application

00:09:34.396 --> 00:09:36.146
with much higher bandwidth,

00:09:36.146 --> 00:09:37.756
measured even on our iPhone

00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:39.606
devices in gigabytes per second,

00:09:40.096 --> 00:09:41.396
whereas the cloud is sometimes

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:42.876
limited to megabytes or

00:09:42.876 --> 00:09:44.066
kilobytes per second of

00:09:44.066 --> 00:09:45.116
available bandwidth.

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:47.816
Now, this local replica

00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:49.876
necessarily adds a significant

00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:51.926
amount of complexity, and that's

00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:52.056
why

00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:53.776
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:55.536
implements a robust scheduling

00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:56.826
and error recovery event loop

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:57.336
for you.

00:09:57.796 --> 00:09:59.136
So that as your application

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:00.666
writes data to the local store,

00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:02.736
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:04.046
automatically moves those

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:04.956
objects up to the cloud.

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:08.126
And, when something changes in

00:10:08.126 --> 00:10:08.846
CloudKit,

00:10:08.846 --> 00:10:10.336
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:10:10.336 --> 00:10:11.816
will schedule work on the system

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:14.086
to bring those objects down and

00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:15.136
import them into your local

00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:16.926
database, making them available

00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:17.846
to your application.

00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:20.846
Of course, during this process,

00:10:20.846 --> 00:10:22.546
your objects are necessarily

00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:24.116
transformed from instances of

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:26.426
NSManagedObject into instances

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:27.946
of CKRecord by

00:10:28.056 --> 00:10:29.726
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:32.606
And likewise, when something

00:10:32.606 --> 00:10:34.016
changes in the cloud, those

00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:35.086
CKRecord's will be made

00:10:35.086 --> 00:10:37.106
available to you as instances of

00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:38.636
NSManagedObject in your local

00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:39.296
store file.

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:41.726
And that's what

00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:43.146
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:44.486
brings to your application.

00:10:44.856 --> 00:10:46.406
It's a complete local replica of

00:10:46.406 --> 00:10:47.676
everything in the private

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:49.106
database in CloudKit.

00:10:49.706 --> 00:10:50.706
You should know, though, that we

00:10:50.706 --> 00:10:53.116
do manage a specific custom zone

00:10:53.406 --> 00:10:54.506
for Core Data syncing.

00:10:55.096 --> 00:10:57.566
We implement automatic

00:10:57.566 --> 00:10:58.876
scheduling so that you don't

00:10:58.876 --> 00:11:00.576
have to worry about optimizing

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:02.156
any operations or scheduling

00:11:02.156 --> 00:11:02.886
them in the system.

00:11:03.356 --> 00:11:04.856
And, I think more importantly,

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:05.966
you don't have to worry about

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:07.436
implementing any error recovery

00:11:07.436 --> 00:11:08.866
logic in your application.

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:11.956
Finally, we implement automatic

00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:12.986
serialization from

00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:15.286
NSManagedObject to CKRecord.

00:11:15.626 --> 00:11:17.106
And we use your NSManagedObject

00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:18.576
model to figure out how to do

00:11:18.576 --> 00:11:18.916
this.

00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:22.876
But it'd be obtuse of me to

00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:24.256
stand up here and tell you that

00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:25.176
once you've adopted

00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:26.916
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer,

00:11:26.966 --> 00:11:28.066
you're done, and you have a

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.616
fully functioning application.

00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:31.666
So, I'd like to spend the rest

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:33.026
of the talk thinking about what

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.736
it means for you to build on top

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:34.866
of

00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:36.486
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:38.216
And I think that starts with

00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:39.656
building great applications that

00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:40.886
are powered by Core Data.

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:43.356
Later, we'll also look at how

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:44.906
you can extend the foundation

00:11:44.906 --> 00:11:45.966
that we've built into

00:11:46.056 --> 00:11:48.026
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer to

00:11:48.026 --> 00:11:49.496
customize it to your needs.

00:11:50.746 --> 00:11:52.256
Now, for me, building great

00:11:52.256 --> 00:11:53.616
applications with Core Data

00:11:54.066 --> 00:11:55.746
starts by absorbing a lot of

00:11:55.746 --> 00:11:56.326
knowledge.

00:11:56.846 --> 00:11:58.396
And, to that end, we've written

00:11:58.396 --> 00:12:00.286
a ton of documentation this year

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:00.956
about how

00:12:01.016 --> 00:12:02.496
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:04.476
works and how you can integrate

00:12:04.476 --> 00:12:05.806
it into your applications.

00:12:07.376 --> 00:12:08.526
There are some features of Core

00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:10.276
Data that I feel go really well

00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:10.376
with

00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:12.076
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:13.266
Things like the

00:12:13.376 --> 00:12:14.776
FetchResultsController, which

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.376
helps you build scalable user

00:12:16.376 --> 00:12:17.486
interfaces backed by a

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:18.956
significant amount of data.

00:12:19.796 --> 00:12:21.726
And query generations which help

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.446
you stabilize those user

00:12:23.446 --> 00:12:24.966
interfaces against changes that

00:12:24.966 --> 00:12:25.876
might be happening in the

00:12:25.876 --> 00:12:26.436
background.

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:28.276
Like say from

00:12:28.316 --> 00:12:29.776
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:32.866
And finally, there's history

00:12:32.866 --> 00:12:34.176
tracking, which we introduced a

00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:35.506
few years ago to help you

00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:36.956
understand what's changed in the

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:37.576
database.

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:38.226
And with

00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:39.756
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer,

00:12:39.756 --> 00:12:41.486
you can use it to decide whether

00:12:41.486 --> 00:12:42.816
or not any of those background

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:44.636
updates are relevant to what

00:12:44.636 --> 00:12:46.146
your user's currently doing.

00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:48.216
We'll be covering these and a

00:12:48.216 --> 00:12:49.946
whole lot more in our session on

00:12:49.946 --> 00:12:51.326
Thursday at 3 pm.

00:12:51.966 --> 00:12:53.636
And, to go along with that,

00:12:53.636 --> 00:12:55.216
we're also introducing a new

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:56.776
sample application this year

00:12:57.086 --> 00:12:58.136
that's designed to give you

00:12:58.136 --> 00:12:59.566
something to hold in your hands,

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:00.306
to feel how

00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:01.846
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:13:01.846 --> 00:13:03.816
works along with all these other

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:04.926
features of Core Data.

00:13:05.546 --> 00:13:07.016
It's designed to manage a set of

00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:07.746
posts.

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:09.506
And posts are a theme that we've

00:13:09.506 --> 00:13:10.806
been building on over the last

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:11.896
few years in Core Data.

00:13:12.786 --> 00:13:13.046
Right?

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:14.536
They're a great object for

00:13:14.536 --> 00:13:15.726
helping us understand how

00:13:15.876 --> 00:13:17.206
different pieces of your object

00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:18.716
graph will be affected by

00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:19.306
CloudKit.

00:13:19.836 --> 00:13:21.186
Here you can see that our data

00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:22.166
model is pretty simple.

00:13:22.476 --> 00:13:22.726
Right?

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:24.046
We have a title and some

00:13:24.046 --> 00:13:24.426
content.

00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:26.116
And then, we have a set of tags

00:13:26.116 --> 00:13:27.406
that we can associate to each

00:13:27.446 --> 00:13:28.266
post.

00:13:28.326 --> 00:13:29.606
The application will even let

00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:31.016
you see what it's like to manage

00:13:31.016 --> 00:13:32.156
photos with CloudKit.

00:13:32.506 --> 00:13:34.286
Allowing you to attach files

00:13:34.286 --> 00:13:35.746
from the device's Photo Library

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:39.716
to a post.

00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:42.376
Now, let's talk about what it's

00:13:42.376 --> 00:13:43.586
like to build on top of

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.206
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:47.606
And, as you might expect, this

00:13:47.606 --> 00:13:49.186
is a fairly dense section of the

00:13:49.186 --> 00:13:49.606
talk.

00:13:50.106 --> 00:13:51.236
But you should know that our

00:13:51.236 --> 00:13:52.966
documentation covers in more

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:54.266
detail a lot of things that

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:55.486
we're going to talk about today.

00:13:56.006 --> 00:13:57.776
So, don't worry if some of this

00:13:57.776 --> 00:13:58.676
goes right out the window.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:02.516
There are a number of ways that

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:04.626
we see clients internally extend

00:14:04.786 --> 00:14:06.276
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer,

00:14:06.876 --> 00:14:08.086
beginning with working with

00:14:08.086 --> 00:14:09.096
multiple stores.

00:14:10.006 --> 00:14:11.916
And, we also see that clients

00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:13.306
like to customize the schema

00:14:13.306 --> 00:14:14.206
that they've been using with

00:14:14.206 --> 00:14:15.836
CloudKit, and indeed, the one

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:16.586
that we use with

00:14:16.616 --> 00:14:18.216
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:20.166
This of course, as you may know,

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:21.756
is because CloudKit is available

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:23.446
on a number of different

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:25.436
platforms, not only at Apple but

00:14:25.436 --> 00:14:27.056
also using Web Services or

00:14:27.056 --> 00:14:27.706
JavaScript.

00:14:28.286 --> 00:14:29.466
And so, you should be able to

00:14:29.526 --> 00:14:30.006
work with

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.496
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer's

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.366
objects even if you're not doing

00:14:33.366 --> 00:14:34.736
so on one of our platforms.

00:14:35.686 --> 00:14:37.316
Finally, we'll take a look at

00:14:37.406 --> 00:14:39.146
Data Modeling for collaboration.

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:42.176
Now, there are a number of great

00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:43.606
reasons why we might want to use

00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:44.626
multiple stores in our

00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:45.486
application.

00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:46.856
Especially when working with

00:14:46.856 --> 00:14:48.126
network backed stores.

00:14:48.816 --> 00:14:50.086
Multiple stores can help us

00:14:50.186 --> 00:14:51.676
segregate our data between

00:14:51.676 --> 00:14:53.046
distinct use cases in our

00:14:53.046 --> 00:14:53.636
application.

00:14:54.206 --> 00:14:56.926
And, they can help us provide

00:14:57.086 --> 00:14:58.646
different types of constraints.

00:14:59.536 --> 00:14:59.786
Right?

00:14:59.786 --> 00:15:01.146
So, if we wanted to have one

00:15:01.146 --> 00:15:02.786
store file that manages a very

00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:04.126
specific set of validation

00:15:04.126 --> 00:15:05.786
constraints, maybe to validate

00:15:05.786 --> 00:15:07.476
user input, we can use a

00:15:07.476 --> 00:15:09.266
separate store for that.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:12.316
Multiple stores are also a great

00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:14.426
way to throttle or coalesce data

00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:15.856
that's written very frequently

00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:16.526
on device.

00:15:17.446 --> 00:15:18.586
And this can happen when you're

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:19.426
reading something from the

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:21.066
device that's generated maybe by

00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:22.556
the device itself or by an

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:23.776
algorithm that you have which

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:24.546
creates data.

00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:26.726
If this algorithm generates data

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:28.216
at a very high rate, it can be

00:15:28.216 --> 00:15:29.866
very expensive to constantly

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:31.286
sync all of that data up to

00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:31.796
CloudKit.

00:15:32.406 --> 00:15:34.006
And so, we see clients inject

00:15:34.006 --> 00:15:36.136
another store file into the mix

00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:37.866
and use that to coalesce this

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:39.606
data until its ready to be

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.366
analyzed and then uploaded to

00:15:41.366 --> 00:15:42.186
CloudKit later.

00:15:42.936 --> 00:15:46.316
To show you how this works and

00:15:46.316 --> 00:15:47.566
how Core Data can make this easy

00:15:47.566 --> 00:15:49.186
for you, we're going to leverage

00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:50.316
a feature of

00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:51.786
NSManagedObjectModel called

00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:52.706
Configurations.

00:15:53.366 --> 00:15:55.856
And here you can see we have our

00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:56.656
sample apps,

00:15:56.906 --> 00:15:58.626
NSManagedObjectModel in the

00:15:58.626 --> 00:15:59.886
model editor in Xcode.

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.016
Now, let's say that I want to

00:16:02.016 --> 00:16:04.056
add locations to the post.

00:16:04.156 --> 00:16:04.396
Right?

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:05.836
I want to record the location

00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:06.966
where a post was created

00:16:07.376 --> 00:16:08.476
whenever that happens.

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:10.806
But locations can be generated

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:12.716
at a high rate by the system and

00:16:12.716 --> 00:16:14.616
I don't need them unless a post

00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:16.106
is actually being created at

00:16:16.106 --> 00:16:16.866
that location.

00:16:16.966 --> 00:16:19.036
So, let's separate them from the

00:16:19.036 --> 00:16:20.036
rest of the data model.

00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:22.996
I'll start off by adding a new

00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:24.706
entity by clicking this plus (+)

00:16:24.706 --> 00:16:26.496
in the lower left-hand corner to

00:16:26.496 --> 00:16:28.156
store my location information.

00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:30.176
Now, my location's going to be

00:16:30.176 --> 00:16:30.796
pretty simple.

00:16:30.796 --> 00:16:31.796
It's just going to include a

00:16:31.796 --> 00:16:34.036
latitude and longitude that are

00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.416
both doubles that are exposed to

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:36.476
me by the Core Location

00:16:36.476 --> 00:16:36.946
framework.

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:38.546
Of course, yours may include

00:16:38.546 --> 00:16:39.986
other things like altitude or

00:16:39.986 --> 00:16:41.000
accuracy.

00:16:45.126 --> 00:16:46.336
Now we want to segregate these

00:16:46.336 --> 00:16:47.836
locations from the rest of our

00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:48.166
data.

00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:50.006
And to do that I'll create a new

00:16:50.006 --> 00:16:52.326
configuration, again, by hitting

00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:53.526
this plus (+) button, but this

00:16:53.526 --> 00:16:55.496
time holding down my click to

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:56.886
expose a menu that allows me to

00:16:56.886 --> 00:16:58.036
add a configuration.

00:16:58.916 --> 00:17:00.106
I'll call this configuration

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.946
Cloud and add all four of the

00:17:01.946 --> 00:17:03.196
entities that I actually want to

00:17:03.196 --> 00:17:05.165
sync to it.

00:17:06.036 --> 00:17:07.376
Here you can see that now the

00:17:07.376 --> 00:17:09.396
Cloud configuration has just the

00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:10.566
entities that I want to be

00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:11.445
synced with CloudKit.

00:17:12.076 --> 00:17:13.526
Let's create a new one called

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:14.915
Local that will store our

00:17:14.915 --> 00:17:15.886
location objects.

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:23.925
And, in just a few lines of

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:25.205
code, we can put this to work

00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:27.406
for us, empowering Core Data to

00:17:27.406 --> 00:17:28.986
tell our stores automatically

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:30.056
what types of objects they

00:17:30.056 --> 00:17:30.526
stored.

00:17:30.526 --> 00:17:32.506
At the top you can see we create

00:17:32.506 --> 00:17:33.186
an instance of

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:34.686
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer,

00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:36.506
and then, we leverage something

00:17:36.506 --> 00:17:36.796
called

00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:38.396
NSPersistentStoreDescription,

00:17:38.896 --> 00:17:39.566
which tells

00:17:39.566 --> 00:17:41.126
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:42.506
about the types of stores that

00:17:42.506 --> 00:17:43.196
it's managing.

00:17:43.946 --> 00:17:45.036
We create an instance of

00:17:45.036 --> 00:17:46.526
NSPersistentStoreDescription

00:17:46.936 --> 00:17:48.296
that points at the file called

00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:49.936
local.sqlite to hold our

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:51.056
location information.

00:17:51.526 --> 00:17:52.866
And, we assign it the

00:17:52.866 --> 00:17:54.486
configuration of local that we

00:17:54.486 --> 00:17:55.286
just created.

00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:57.856
Then we set up our cloud store.

00:17:58.366 --> 00:18:00.346
Similarly, we create an instance

00:18:00.386 --> 00:18:01.946
of NSPersistentStoreDescription

00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:03.706
and we point it to a different

00:18:03.706 --> 00:18:05.416
file; cloud.sqlite.

00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:06.706
Then we give it the

00:18:06.706 --> 00:18:08.786
configuration Cloud, which tells

00:18:08.786 --> 00:18:10.306
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:18:10.306 --> 00:18:12.766
that only the entities like

00:18:12.766 --> 00:18:14.596
post, and tags, and attachments,

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:16.256
and image data should be stored

00:18:16.256 --> 00:18:16.906
in the store.

00:18:17.936 --> 00:18:19.996
Finally, we assign it an

00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:21.356
instance of NSPersistent

00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:23.706
CloudKitContainerOptions, which

00:18:23.706 --> 00:18:24.086
tells

00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:25.776
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:27.916
what iCloud container identifier

00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:29.596
this store should be synced

00:18:29.596 --> 00:18:29.776
with.

00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:32.336
Last but not least, we assign

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:33.736
these two store descriptions to

00:18:33.736 --> 00:18:35.256
the PersistentStoreDescription's

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:36.366
property of

00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:37.866
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:39.196
And with

00:18:39.306 --> 00:18:40.806
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer we

00:18:40.806 --> 00:18:42.246
can take this even further.

00:18:42.946 --> 00:18:44.766
We already have local store and

00:18:44.766 --> 00:18:45.396
a cloud store.

00:18:45.396 --> 00:18:47.066
But what if we want to share

00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:48.666
some data in CloudKit across

00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:50.156
multiple applications we happen

00:18:50.156 --> 00:18:50.676
to work on?

00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:51.516
Well,

00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:53.006
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.196
supports that as well.

00:18:54.856 --> 00:18:56.356
In fact, because you're using

00:18:56.356 --> 00:18:57.876
Core Data, your application will

00:18:57.946 --> 00:18:59.636
easily be able to handle all the

00:18:59.636 --> 00:19:01.156
data from these stores at the

00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:01.876
same time.

00:19:02.456 --> 00:19:04.216
And, Core Data will

00:19:04.216 --> 00:19:05.556
automatically help you write

00:19:05.796 --> 00:19:07.186
data that you insert into the

00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:08.216
correct store file

00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:09.196
automatically.

00:19:10.476 --> 00:19:11.846
We can do this by just adding

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:12.896
three lines of code.

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:13.586
Right?

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:15.056
We create a new StoreDescription

00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:16.266
that points to our shared store

00:19:16.266 --> 00:19:17.636
file and give it a new

00:19:17.636 --> 00:19:18.856
configuration that we might

00:19:18.856 --> 00:19:20.046
create called shared.

00:19:20.736 --> 00:19:22.466
Finally, we assign it a new

00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:23.846
instance of NSPersistent

00:19:23.846 --> 00:19:25.546
CloudKitContainer Options that

00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:27.406
identifies the container we want

00:19:27.406 --> 00:19:28.956
our shared data to be stored in;

00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:29.826
in this case,

00:19:29.826 --> 00:19:32.696
iCloud.com.wwdc.shared.

00:19:33.366 --> 00:19:34.626
And of course, last but not

00:19:34.626 --> 00:19:36.776
least, we assign it to

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:38.116
PersistentStoreDescriptions.

00:19:38.486 --> 00:19:40.246
Now let's talk about the schema.

00:19:41.036 --> 00:19:43.586
And, I want to cover a few

00:19:43.686 --> 00:19:44.956
points about the schema that I

00:19:44.956 --> 00:19:45.886
think are sort of the

00:19:45.886 --> 00:19:46.436
highlights.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.476
The most important things that

00:19:47.476 --> 00:19:48.486
you need to know when you're

00:19:48.566 --> 00:19:49.686
looking at the records that we

00:19:49.686 --> 00:19:50.576
create in CloudKit.

00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:52.816
I'll start off by talking about

00:19:52.816 --> 00:19:54.736
how we manage record types and

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.416
how we manage entities, which

00:19:56.416 --> 00:19:57.526
are what you create in your

00:19:57.526 --> 00:19:58.776
NSManagedObjectModel.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:01.126
Then, we'll look at how we

00:20:01.126 --> 00:20:02.616
implement a feature called Asset

00:20:02.616 --> 00:20:04.546
Externalization, which allows

00:20:04.546 --> 00:20:05.826
you to seamlessly store

00:20:05.826 --> 00:20:07.566
arbitrarily large values in

00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:08.626
CloudKit using

00:20:08.656 --> 00:20:09.936
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.

00:20:10.436 --> 00:20:12.846
Finally, we'll talk about how we

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.916
manage relationships and how

00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:16.166
that might be different from the

00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:17.566
CloudKit experience you're used

00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:17.766
to.

00:20:18.726 --> 00:20:20.976
To do that, we're going to use

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:22.526
the ManageObjectModel for our

00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:23.596
sample application.

00:20:23.966 --> 00:20:25.106
And I'm going to start off by

00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:26.816
focusing on the post entity.

00:20:27.356 --> 00:20:28.546
You can see that it has two

00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:30.746
attributes; a title string and a

00:20:30.746 --> 00:20:31.486
content string.

00:20:31.946 --> 00:20:33.066
And it also has two

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.326
relationships to the attachment

00:20:35.326 --> 00:20:36.386
and tag entities.

00:20:37.386 --> 00:20:39.206
Core Data generates an actual

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:40.906
class for you to use in code as

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.586
a subclass of NSManagedObject

00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:43.596
that looks like this.

00:20:44.216 --> 00:20:45.736
And you can see that all of the

00:20:45.736 --> 00:20:47.406
attributes and relationships are

00:20:47.406 --> 00:20:49.756
represented on that class.

00:20:49.756 --> 00:20:51.636
Now, this is the record that we

00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:53.266
will generate in CloudKit that

00:20:53.266 --> 00:20:55.146
goes along with this post.

00:20:55.936 --> 00:20:57.156
And these are some example

00:20:57.156 --> 00:20:58.326
values that I've used to

00:20:58.756 --> 00:21:00.396
populate this record and make it

00:21:00.396 --> 00:21:02.496
what we call fully materialized.

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.836
Now, there are some things that

00:21:04.836 --> 00:21:05.786
I want to highlight to you

00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:06.236
first.

00:21:06.716 --> 00:21:07.466
The record ID.

00:21:07.996 --> 00:21:09.956
Core Data owns the record ID for

00:21:09.956 --> 00:21:11.286
all of the objects that it

00:21:11.286 --> 00:21:12.436
creates in CloudKit.

00:21:12.866 --> 00:21:14.356
And, for each one, we will

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.836
generate a simple UUID to use as

00:21:16.836 --> 00:21:17.776
its record name.

00:21:18.336 --> 00:21:19.806
When the Record Name is combined

00:21:19.806 --> 00:21:21.816
with a zone identifier you get a

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:22.806
CKRecord ID.

00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:26.126
At the bottom, you'll see how

00:21:26.126 --> 00:21:27.446
Core Data manages type

00:21:27.446 --> 00:21:28.156
information.

00:21:28.826 --> 00:21:30.556
And, there are two interesting

00:21:30.556 --> 00:21:31.126
things here.

00:21:31.656 --> 00:21:33.516
The first is, what the heck are

00:21:33.516 --> 00:21:34.866
all these CD under bars?

00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:37.276
This is Core Data's way of

00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:38.776
segregating the things that it

00:21:38.776 --> 00:21:41.296
manages to be separate from ones

00:21:41.296 --> 00:21:42.706
that either CloudKit implements

00:21:42.706 --> 00:21:44.386
for you -- you wouldn't believe

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:46.166
how many people add modify date

00:21:46.166 --> 00:21:47.236
to their CKRecord.

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:49.386
Or, ones that you might add

00:21:49.386 --> 00:21:49.906
yourself.

00:21:50.056 --> 00:21:51.906
And so, we prefix everything;

00:21:51.906 --> 00:21:53.576
the record type and all of our

00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:55.466
field names with CD under bar.

00:21:56.386 --> 00:21:58.666
But, in the CD entityName field,

00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:01.096
we keep the real entity name of

00:22:01.096 --> 00:22:03.786
the object that this record goes

00:22:03.786 --> 00:22:03.966
with.

00:22:04.896 --> 00:22:06.206
And we do this so that we can

00:22:06.206 --> 00:22:07.386
implement a feature called

00:22:07.386 --> 00:22:09.346
entityInheritance, wherein you

00:22:09.346 --> 00:22:11.406
could have subclasses of a post,

00:22:11.406 --> 00:22:11.936
let's say.

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:15.056
Perhaps an image post, or a

00:22:15.056 --> 00:22:15.946
video post.

00:22:16.556 --> 00:22:18.186
The actual entities will always

00:22:18.186 --> 00:22:19.826
be identified by the CD under

00:22:19.826 --> 00:22:21.156
bar entityName field.

00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:23.296
And we do this so that you can

00:22:23.296 --> 00:22:26.156
implement CK queries that get at

00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:28.156
all of the entity hierarchies

00:22:28.156 --> 00:22:30.126
you're interested in by querying

00:22:30.126 --> 00:22:31.196
a single record type.

00:22:32.456 --> 00:22:33.486
Now let's look at how we

00:22:33.486 --> 00:22:35.016
implement these two strings.

00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:36.576
Because these are variable

00:22:36.576 --> 00:22:38.166
length fields and our

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:39.666
translation of them to CloudKit

00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:41.696
has some interesting quirks.

00:22:43.336 --> 00:22:44.516
You'll see that we've inflated

00:22:44.516 --> 00:22:46.246
them to four total fields.

00:22:46.586 --> 00:22:48.306
And the reason for this, is that

00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:49.946
this is how we implement asset

00:22:49.946 --> 00:22:51.006
externalization.

00:22:51.716 --> 00:22:52.816
Here you can see that we have

00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:54.506
both a CD under bar content

00:22:54.576 --> 00:22:56.796
field and a CD under bar content

00:22:56.796 --> 00:22:58.326
under bar CKAsset.

00:22:58.806 --> 00:23:00.416
This allows us to store strings

00:23:00.456 --> 00:23:02.106
that are arbitrarily large.

00:23:02.466 --> 00:23:04.666
Anywhere from simple kilobytes

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.146
all the way up to hundreds of

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:08.006
megabytes or even gigabytes in

00:23:08.006 --> 00:23:08.356
length.

00:23:09.626 --> 00:23:11.036
And when I said that this record

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:11.976
is what we call fully

00:23:11.976 --> 00:23:13.446
materialized, what I mean is

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:15.516
that you won't ever actually see

00:23:15.516 --> 00:23:16.716
all four of these fields at the

00:23:16.746 --> 00:23:17.586
same time.

00:23:18.206 --> 00:23:19.286
If the strings are all very

00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:20.676
short, then you'll just see CD

00:23:20.676 --> 00:23:22.406
under bar content and CD under

00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:23.686
bar title in the record.

00:23:24.216 --> 00:23:25.456
But, if one of them grows to be

00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:27.656
very large, approximately larger

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:30.446
than 750 kilobytes, or if the

00:23:30.446 --> 00:23:32.316
total size of the record exceeds

00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:34.296
CloudKit's maximum 1 megabyte

00:23:34.296 --> 00:23:36.706
limit, you'll begin to see asset

00:23:36.706 --> 00:23:38.686
fields, or in this case, CD

00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:40.106
under bar content under bar

00:23:40.246 --> 00:23:42.276
CKAsset in the record instead.

00:23:43.016 --> 00:23:44.326
If you're consuming our records

00:23:44.326 --> 00:23:45.546
on your own, then you'll need to

00:23:45.576 --> 00:23:47.316
check both places to see whether

00:23:47.316 --> 00:23:48.946
or not a value has been set for

00:23:48.946 --> 00:23:50.000
a specific attribute.

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:55.356
Now let's take a look at the

00:23:55.356 --> 00:23:57.016
relationships on a post.

00:23:57.546 --> 00:23:58.576
You can see here that they're

00:23:58.576 --> 00:24:00.796
both instances of NSSet in the

00:24:00.796 --> 00:24:02.356
object that Core Data generates

00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:03.626
for you to use in your code.

00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:05.976
And this is because a post has

00:24:06.086 --> 00:24:07.536
to-- what we call too many

00:24:07.536 --> 00:24:08.456
relationships.

00:24:08.936 --> 00:24:10.226
That means that a post can be

00:24:10.226 --> 00:24:12.406
assigned too many attachments or

00:24:12.616 --> 00:24:14.366
it can have many tags associated

00:24:14.366 --> 00:24:14.946
with it.

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:16.846
The attachments relationship is

00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:17.686
what we like to call a

00:24:17.686 --> 00:24:19.126
Many-To-One, because an

00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:20.656
attachment can only be assigned

00:24:20.656 --> 00:24:21.646
to one post.

00:24:23.266 --> 00:24:24.686
When we generate code for this,

00:24:24.686 --> 00:24:26.016
you'll see that there's an NSSet

00:24:26.016 --> 00:24:27.876
on the post, but there's only a

00:24:27.876 --> 00:24:30.346
single post object declared on

00:24:30.566 --> 00:24:32.406
the attachment ManageObject.

00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:35.126
And this is the record they will

00:24:35.156 --> 00:24:36.876
generate for an attachment.

00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:39.316
You can see that it has a UUID,

00:24:39.316 --> 00:24:40.526
an entity name, and a record

00:24:40.526 --> 00:24:42.576
type just like a post does, but

00:24:42.576 --> 00:24:43.886
you'll also see an additional

00:24:43.886 --> 00:24:46.196
field called CD under bar post.

00:24:46.576 --> 00:24:47.546
This is how we store the

00:24:47.546 --> 00:24:49.576
relationship for a Two-One

00:24:49.576 --> 00:24:50.316
relationship.

00:24:51.046 --> 00:24:53.446
The UUID of the related record

00:24:53.446 --> 00:24:55.076
in CloudKit will always be

00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:56.916
stored on the object it's linked

00:24:56.916 --> 00:24:57.236
to.

00:24:57.806 --> 00:24:59.696
And, you might be wondering why

00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:00.726
we don't do this with

00:25:00.726 --> 00:25:02.006
CKReference instead.

00:25:02.006 --> 00:25:04.076
And that's because CKReference

00:25:04.076 --> 00:25:05.536
has some limitations that we

00:25:05.536 --> 00:25:07.116
don't think work well for Core

00:25:07.116 --> 00:25:07.906
Data clients.

00:25:08.386 --> 00:25:11.036
Namely that it's limited to 750

00:25:11.036 --> 00:25:11.996
total objects.

00:25:12.376 --> 00:25:13.686
But by storing a relationship

00:25:13.756 --> 00:25:15.426
this way, you can hold as many

00:25:15.426 --> 00:25:16.496
will fit in your CloudKit

00:25:16.496 --> 00:25:17.006
container.

00:25:17.626 --> 00:25:20.166
Now let's look at a Many-To-Many

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:20.866
relationship.

00:25:21.156 --> 00:25:22.336
In this case, the one between a

00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:23.736
post and its tags.

00:25:24.976 --> 00:25:26.226
You can see that there are two

00:25:26.306 --> 00:25:29.146
NSSet's on this object and this

00:25:29.146 --> 00:25:31.326
is because both objects can be

00:25:31.326 --> 00:25:33.156
related to many of the other

00:25:33.156 --> 00:25:33.436
type.

00:25:33.436 --> 00:25:35.586
But when we generate the records

00:25:35.586 --> 00:25:37.186
for these objects, there aren't

00:25:37.186 --> 00:25:39.116
any fields that we materialized

00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:40.426
to hold this relationship.

00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:43.556
Instead, Core Data materializes

00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:44.976
a custom join record.

00:25:45.406 --> 00:25:46.626
Now, if you're familiar with

00:25:46.656 --> 00:25:48.566
relational databases, you'll

00:25:48.566 --> 00:25:49.866
recognize this concept.

00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:51.816
It's basically an extrapolation

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:53.876
of a row in a join table.

00:25:54.466 --> 00:25:57.276
And it's called a CDMR or Core

00:25:57.276 --> 00:25:58.466
Data Mirrored Relationship.

00:25:59.176 --> 00:26:01.426
A CDMR contains a set of twoples

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:02.736
that are designed to describe

00:26:02.736 --> 00:26:04.166
the two objects that are linked,

00:26:04.566 --> 00:26:06.106
beginning with the entity names

00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:07.306
of the two objects that are

00:26:07.306 --> 00:26:09.446
linked, and their record names.

00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:11.856
Now, as I said before, this is

00:26:11.856 --> 00:26:13.216
not the record ID.

00:26:13.596 --> 00:26:15.156
This is the record name that you

00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:16.576
have to combine with a zone

00:26:16.576 --> 00:26:18.436
identifier to get the identity

00:26:18.436 --> 00:26:20.716
of the records that have been

00:26:20.716 --> 00:26:22.536
linked by the CDMR.

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:25.536
Finally, we also encapsulate the

00:26:25.536 --> 00:26:27.306
exact relationships that were

00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:28.546
used to make this link.

00:26:30.996 --> 00:26:32.496
So why am I spending so much

00:26:32.536 --> 00:26:33.396
time talking about

00:26:33.396 --> 00:26:34.126
relationships?

00:26:35.486 --> 00:26:38.326
Well, they have a huge impact on

00:26:38.416 --> 00:26:39.846
how we model our data for

00:26:39.846 --> 00:26:40.676
collaboration.

00:26:41.346 --> 00:26:42.926
And I need to be very clear

00:26:42.926 --> 00:26:45.586
here, collaboration is not

00:26:45.586 --> 00:26:46.676
conflict resolution.

00:26:47.296 --> 00:26:49.006
Conflict resolution is

00:26:49.006 --> 00:26:50.586
implemented automatically by

00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:52.246
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:53.956
using a last writer wins merge

00:26:53.956 --> 00:26:54.486
policy.

00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.546
And the reason we do this, is

00:26:56.546 --> 00:26:57.796
that the job of conflict

00:26:57.796 --> 00:27:00.036
resolution is to keep the object

00:27:00.086 --> 00:27:01.726
graph and the data in CloudKit

00:27:02.086 --> 00:27:03.546
consistent with how you've

00:27:03.546 --> 00:27:04.466
modeled your data.

00:27:05.286 --> 00:27:07.806
But, over the years we've heard

00:27:07.806 --> 00:27:08.716
that this can be a little

00:27:08.716 --> 00:27:09.396
frustrating.

00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:12.686
So, let's take a look at how you

00:27:12.686 --> 00:27:13.966
can implement better merge

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.726
behavior and align that merge

00:27:15.766 --> 00:27:17.136
behavior with your specific

00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:19.296
customer use cases using

00:27:19.296 --> 00:27:20.846
relationships.

00:27:22.436 --> 00:27:24.176
To do that, we're going to use

00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:25.616
our post application again.

00:27:26.016 --> 00:27:27.456
And I'm going to create a post,

00:27:27.906 --> 00:27:29.066
but I'm not going to assign it

00:27:29.066 --> 00:27:29.826
any content.

00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:32.516
I'll let it sync over to another

00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:34.726
device let's say, and then I'll

00:27:34.726 --> 00:27:36.406
make some edits on each device

00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:37.436
at the same time.

00:27:38.016 --> 00:27:39.316
Now, this is what we would

00:27:39.316 --> 00:27:40.816
traditionally term to be a

00:27:40.816 --> 00:27:41.406
conflict.

00:27:41.936 --> 00:27:44.116
But, actually, this is a great

00:27:44.116 --> 00:27:45.446
example of two devices

00:27:45.446 --> 00:27:47.156
attempting to collaborate on a

00:27:47.156 --> 00:27:47.676
value.

00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:48.866
Now,

00:27:48.936 --> 00:27:50.606
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:52.196
seeing that something has

00:27:52.196 --> 00:27:53.686
changed in CloudKit while it was

00:27:53.686 --> 00:27:55.796
away, will resolve this to

00:27:55.796 --> 00:27:57.656
preserve one of the two values.

00:27:57.656 --> 00:27:57.856
Right?

00:27:57.956 --> 00:27:59.326
Using a last writer wins merge

00:27:59.326 --> 00:27:59.876
policy.

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:01.276
Which means that we'll either

00:28:01.276 --> 00:28:03.376
get collaboration is great or

00:28:03.826 --> 00:28:04.806
everyone should do it.

00:28:05.156 --> 00:28:05.956
And it's true.

00:28:07.446 --> 00:28:09.056
Of course, you might be thinking

00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:10.586
that -- well, this is kind of

00:28:10.586 --> 00:28:10.896
dumb.

00:28:11.436 --> 00:28:12.566
Why don't you just concatenate

00:28:12.596 --> 00:28:13.776
the two strings together, Core

00:28:13.776 --> 00:28:14.056
Data?

00:28:14.696 --> 00:28:15.576
And we could.

00:28:16.026 --> 00:28:17.346
Except that if you took our

00:28:17.346 --> 00:28:18.906
advice over the years and

00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:20.506
implemented incremental saving

00:28:20.856 --> 00:28:21.806
you might end up with something

00:28:21.806 --> 00:28:23.966
like this, which is not what

00:28:23.966 --> 00:28:25.016
anyone expects.

00:28:25.556 --> 00:28:26.796
And it's not even English.

00:28:28.446 --> 00:28:30.206
So, how can we do better?

00:28:30.206 --> 00:28:30.496
Right?

00:28:30.536 --> 00:28:31.966
Clearly this is a problem that's

00:28:31.966 --> 00:28:33.426
very important to us and it's

00:28:33.426 --> 00:28:35.056
very dear to our customers.

00:28:35.806 --> 00:28:37.716
Well, let's look at our post

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:38.866
entity and see if there's some

00:28:38.866 --> 00:28:40.356
changes we can make that would

00:28:40.356 --> 00:28:41.046
make this better.

00:28:41.716 --> 00:28:44.936
The first thing to do is to stop

00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:46.536
creating collisions on flat

00:28:46.536 --> 00:28:47.126
values.

00:28:47.676 --> 00:28:49.986
Content is simply a flat string

00:28:50.026 --> 00:28:51.156
and there's nothing that we can

00:28:51.156 --> 00:28:52.806
infer about the merge behavior

00:28:52.806 --> 00:28:54.096
that you want for that string,

00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:55.236
simply from looking at it.

00:28:56.356 --> 00:28:58.716
But, if we break it up as a

00:28:58.716 --> 00:29:01.406
relationship, multiple devices

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.636
can contribute contributions to

00:29:03.636 --> 00:29:05.096
the content field all by

00:29:05.096 --> 00:29:05.816
themselves.

00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:07.846
And because of the way we store

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:10.096
Two-One relationships, many

00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:11.416
devices can contribute these

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.246
objects at the same time without

00:29:13.246 --> 00:29:14.946
creating a collision on the post

00:29:14.946 --> 00:29:15.836
object itself.

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:18.566
So, here I've broken it up as a

00:29:18.566 --> 00:29:20.776
very simple post content entity

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:22.366
with a simple string.

00:29:23.556 --> 00:29:25.756
Now, because of how we store

00:29:25.756 --> 00:29:27.536
Two-One relationships, these

00:29:27.536 --> 00:29:29.456
will be combined by devices on

00:29:29.456 --> 00:29:29.986
their own.

00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:30.366
Right?

00:29:30.366 --> 00:29:31.796
We need to traverse them in

00:29:31.796 --> 00:29:33.066
order to assemble the final

00:29:33.066 --> 00:29:33.546
value.

00:29:34.056 --> 00:29:35.726
And we call this eventual

00:29:35.726 --> 00:29:36.506
consistency.

00:29:36.926 --> 00:29:38.896
As both devices contribute post

00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:40.026
content objects, they'll

00:29:40.026 --> 00:29:41.186
download the post content

00:29:41.186 --> 00:29:42.736
objects from the other device

00:29:42.736 --> 00:29:45.026
and concatenate them or merge

00:29:45.026 --> 00:29:46.516
them, or whatever topology you

00:29:46.516 --> 00:29:48.326
want to apply to this problem to

00:29:48.326 --> 00:29:49.606
assemble the final value.

00:29:50.926 --> 00:29:52.786
But we want that to be the same

00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:54.766
across all devices and a

00:29:54.836 --> 00:29:56.136
difference in download order

00:29:56.136 --> 00:29:57.526
could create a different final

00:29:57.526 --> 00:29:57.966
value.

00:29:58.476 --> 00:30:00.536
So, we can order them say with

00:30:00.536 --> 00:30:02.216
something as trivial as a date.

00:30:02.806 --> 00:30:04.306
In this way, the devices can

00:30:04.306 --> 00:30:05.876
order the post content objects

00:30:05.876 --> 00:30:07.466
before they do a concatenation

00:30:07.466 --> 00:30:08.966
using a simple sort descriptor

00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:10.716
in Core Data, giving them a

00:30:10.716 --> 00:30:12.186
consistent ordering and merge

00:30:12.186 --> 00:30:14.336
behavior across all devices.

00:30:15.216 --> 00:30:17.106
But, I'm a bit of a distributed

00:30:17.106 --> 00:30:20.166
systems nerd and time is evil.

00:30:21.296 --> 00:30:22.826
In fact, a devices notion of

00:30:22.826 --> 00:30:24.276
time might not even line up if

00:30:24.276 --> 00:30:24.976
they're in your house together.

00:30:26.716 --> 00:30:28.716
So, we can take this a step

00:30:28.716 --> 00:30:30.256
further and implement a full

00:30:30.256 --> 00:30:32.306
causal tree by leveraging a

00:30:32.306 --> 00:30:33.546
relationship to a parent

00:30:33.546 --> 00:30:35.446
contribution and giving the

00:30:35.446 --> 00:30:37.226
entity some information about

00:30:37.226 --> 00:30:38.476
the device that's making the

00:30:38.476 --> 00:30:39.626
actual contribution.

00:30:40.326 --> 00:30:42.006
In this way, we've implemented a

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:43.326
rough sketch of something called

00:30:43.326 --> 00:30:44.956
the conflict-free replicated

00:30:44.956 --> 00:30:45.526
data type.

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:47.626
And this is an awesome emerging

00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:49.376
field of computer science that

00:30:49.376 --> 00:30:51.246
allows us to deploy algorithms

00:30:51.526 --> 00:30:52.866
to create consistent merge

00:30:52.866 --> 00:30:54.426
behavior across different

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:55.806
user-user scenarios.

00:30:56.316 --> 00:31:00.006
And that has been Using Core

00:31:00.006 --> 00:31:02.216
Data with CloudKit.

00:31:02.216 --> 00:31:03.206
It's been my pleasure to show

00:31:03.206 --> 00:31:03.386
you

00:31:03.516 --> 00:31:05.046
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:31:05.116 --> 00:31:06.846
and how you can easily implement

00:31:06.846 --> 00:31:07.886
sync functionality in your

00:31:07.886 --> 00:31:08.886
applications with it.

00:31:09.726 --> 00:31:10.876
We've also got some great new

00:31:10.876 --> 00:31:12.316
sample code and documentation

00:31:12.386 --> 00:31:13.546
for you this year that I hope

00:31:13.636 --> 00:31:15.046
gives you a great experience

00:31:15.046 --> 00:31:16.466
with all of these new APIs.

00:31:17.076 --> 00:31:19.516
And finally, I can't wait to see

00:31:19.516 --> 00:31:20.396
what you build with

00:31:20.396 --> 00:31:21.946
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

00:31:22.266 --> 00:31:24.476
and how you extend it.

00:31:24.626 --> 00:31:26.356
We'll be in a ton of labs this

00:31:26.356 --> 00:31:26.556
year.

00:31:27.356 --> 00:31:28.366
Every day this week.

00:31:28.546 --> 00:31:30.026
And as you know, we have a talk

00:31:30.026 --> 00:31:31.846
on 3 o'clock that covers a lot

00:31:31.846 --> 00:31:33.316
more features in Core Data in

00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:33.846
Thursday.

00:31:35.196 --> 00:31:36.246
Thanks a lot, and I hope you

00:31:36.246 --> 00:31:37.976
have an awesome WWDC.

00:31:38.516 --> 00:31:42.500
