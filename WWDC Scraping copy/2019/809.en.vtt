>> Hello.

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:14.536
[ Applause ]

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:16.706
It's great to be back on stage

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.586
at WWDC.

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.096
I'm really happy to talk to you

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:24.046
guys about designing iPad apps

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:24.466
for Mac.

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:27.426
Now, many of you here today have

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:29.506
created awesome apps for iPad

00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:31.326
already, apps that help people

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:32.906
be more productive, more

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:35.126
creative, apps that entertain,

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:36.976
that educate, that help people

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:39.146
connect and communicate with

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:39.606
each other.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.306
We want to make it easy for you

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:44.416
to bring those great experiences

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:45.146
to Mac.

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:48.056
With keyboard and mouse or

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:50.406
trackpad input, people can work

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:51.926
with greater precision and

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:52.436
speed.

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:54.786
Flexible windows allow for

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.256
efficient and fluid multitasking

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:57.886
workflows.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.836
And larger display sizes allow

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:02.906
your app to present more

00:01:03.086 --> 00:01:05.376
information and actions at once.

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:09.216
Of course, some iPad apps just

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:10.886
won't make sense on Mac.

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.676
Some used cases like navigation

00:01:13.856 --> 00:01:15.626
or augmented reality aren't

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:16.836
suitable for a stationary

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:17.356
computer.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.976
And apps that rely on iPad

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:21.326
hardware features like the

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:23.616
gyroscope or rear-facing camera

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:25.496
won't really make sense on Mac

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:26.036
either.

00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:29.206
But, for the rest of you, coming

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.216
to Mac is a great way to offer

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.396
the people who use your app with

00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:35.546
a more efficient and immersive

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:36.316
experience.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.276
The first step in bringing your

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:42.966
iPad app to Mac is to start with

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.356
a solid foundation.

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.776
Your iPad app should support

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.166
features like multitasking and

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.726
drag and drop as well as Auto

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:53.076
Layout.

00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:56.216
As we all know, Mac windows can

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.836
be arbitrarily resized.

00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:00.676
By fully supporting Auto Layout

00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:03.716
in your iPad app, your interface

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:05.866
will be resizable on Mac.

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:10.626
Similarly, if your app supports

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:12.556
drag and drop, you're one step

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:14.046
closer to having a great Mac

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:14.256
app.

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:16.916
We expect just about everything

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:19.056
on Mac to be draggable and

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:19.456
droppable.

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:22.246
Now yesterday, we introduced the

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:23.906
ability for iPad apps to have

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.186
multiple windows, like drag and

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:27.856
drop, opening documents into

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.316
their own windows is something

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.616
that we all expect on Mac.

00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:33.216
If your app supports this

00:02:33.216 --> 00:02:34.816
feature, you'll automatically

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:36.386
get multiple windows support on

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:38.646
Mac as well, which brings me to

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:39.206
the next topic.

00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:41.126
What do you get for free?

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:42.726
Free is good, right?

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:45.276
To make the task of coming to

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:48.366
Mac easier, many iOS interfaces

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:49.596
and interactions will

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:51.526
automatically be adjusted to

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:53.066
macOS equivalents.

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:56.256
iOS split views will be drawn as

00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:57.166
split views on Mac,

00:02:58.046 --> 00:02:59.416
system-provided UIs like the

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:01.736
file browser and activity view

00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:03.806
will be remapped to platform

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:04.976
appropriate equivalents.

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.926
Edit menus and iOS contextual

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:09.866
menus will automatically be

00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:11.796
presented as contextual menus on

00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:12.466
Mac.

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:14.896
Copy and paste, rich text

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:17.316
editing, and key focus all come

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:18.406
for free as well.

00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:22.586
Now in all of these cases, the

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:25.996
mapping between iOS and macOS is

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:27.456
relatively straightforward.

00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:30.996
However, there are some key

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:34.606
differences between macOS and

00:03:34.606 --> 00:03:34.706
iOS.

00:03:34.706 --> 00:03:35.996
Designing an app that feels

00:03:35.996 --> 00:03:37.856
appropriate for each platform

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:39.876
involves understanding and

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:41.676
accounting for those differences

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:43.546
in your app.

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:46.226
The biggest and most critical

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.476
difference is that iOS was

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.836
designed for touch, whereas mac

00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:53.096
was designed for keyboard and

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:54.546
mouse input.

00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:57.226
Designing for touch involves

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:58.816
offering touch targets that are

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:00.916
larger and easier to access,

00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:02.736
especially when you're walking

00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:04.026
or moving around.

00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:07.366
On Mac, using a trackpad or

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:09.316
mouse provides physical

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:11.606
stability and greater control.

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:13.986
And because pointers are small,

00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:15.716
people can target and manipulate

00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:17.505
interface objects with greater

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:18.096
precision.

00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:21.166
Smaller controls also allow Mac

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:23.736
UIs to have greater information

00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:25.246
density or greater control

00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:25.666
density.

00:04:26.956 --> 00:04:28.446
All iOS devices support

00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:30.036
Multi-Touch gestures like pan,

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:31.686
rotate, and pinch.

00:04:32.386 --> 00:04:34.056
Some Mac setups don't have

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:35.096
Multi-Touch input.

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.276
So, if there's any interactions

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.526
in your app or any actions that

00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:41.326
rely on gestural input to be

00:04:41.326 --> 00:04:43.086
performed, you have to find

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:44.546
alternatives for the Mac.

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:47.936
When an iPhone is held with one

00:04:47.936 --> 00:04:49.646
hand in portrait orientation,

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:51.616
placing controls in the middle

00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:52.766
or the bottom of the screen

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.766
might make them easier to reach.

00:04:55.246 --> 00:04:57.586
So -- and the same is true for

00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:59.356
iPad in landscape orientation.

00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:00.506
People tend to grip on the

00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:03.016
sides, so placing controls on

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:04.716
the left or right side may make

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:05.786
them easier to reach there.

00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:09.196
Obviously, on Mac, people do not

00:05:09.196 --> 00:05:10.626
hold or displace when they use

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:10.936
them.

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:13.706
Placing controls along the

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:15.416
bottom, the left or the right

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.826
edges provides no ergonomic

00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:19.096
benefit whatsoever.

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:22.666
Every area of the screen is just

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:25.206
as easy to reach as every other

00:05:25.206 --> 00:05:25.476
area.

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:28.156
And, speaking of displays,

00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.086
you'll need to consider how your

00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:32.466
Apple look on 1x non-Retina

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:33.226
displays.

00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:35.486
Special care must be given to

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:37.376
assure that glyphs in text look

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:38.826
crisp and legible.

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:43.046
Look, I know, we all basically

00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:44.656
understand that touch devices

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:46.496
are different from desktop

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:47.206
computers.

00:05:48.216 --> 00:05:49.536
But what's less obvious is how

00:05:49.536 --> 00:05:51.106
interaction models and design

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:53.266
patterns vary between iOS and

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:54.086
macOS.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:57.346
These differences are the key to

00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:59.196
successfully translating your

00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:01.576
iPad app's design to macOS.

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:05.756
So, with that in mind, let's get

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:07.496
into the details about how to

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:08.766
design iPad apps for Mac.

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:11.326
As you can see, we have a lot to

00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:11.706
cover.

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:13.686
You really may want to take some

00:06:13.686 --> 00:06:14.086
notes.

00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:16.406
OK. Let's keep going.

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:19.026
Nothing is more critical to an

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:20.696
app's design than how it's

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:21.446
architected.

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:24.076
A logical and intuitive app

00:06:24.076 --> 00:06:25.916
structure helps people to find

00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:27.706
what they're looking for and it

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:29.616
streamlines navigation.

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:32.446
iOS apps tend to be structured

00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:34.106
in one of three ways.

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:36.616
Some apps use tabs for

00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:38.306
organizing information into a

00:06:38.306 --> 00:06:40.086
small number of top-level

00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:40.576
sections.

00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:44.126
Some present a top-level list of

00:06:44.126 --> 00:06:45.566
sections in a table view.

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:48.736
And some document-focused apps

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:50.486
use -- they use a file/folder

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.266
metaphor, might have a document

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:53.676
browser UI at the top level.

00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:55.996
The chances are that your app

00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:58.216
matches one of these three

00:06:58.216 --> 00:06:58.876
archetypes.

00:06:59.826 --> 00:07:01.886
The simple path is to find the

00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:04.276
closest macOS equivalent and

00:07:04.276 --> 00:07:05.076
just use that.

00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:07.936
For tabbed apps, you could use a

00:07:07.936 --> 00:07:09.516
segmented control in the

00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:10.046
toolbar.

00:07:10.906 --> 00:07:12.956
If your top-level navigation is

00:07:12.956 --> 00:07:14.606
a master list, you can do

00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:16.816
nothing and it'll show up as is

00:07:16.946 --> 00:07:19.226
on Mac, same thing with a

00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:20.246
document browser UI.

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:23.976
A direct translation of your app

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:26.116
structure from iOS to macOS

00:07:26.576 --> 00:07:27.666
might be the right way to go.

00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:30.406
It provides one key benefit.

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:33.326
It'll make the Mac version of

00:07:33.326 --> 00:07:35.406
your app instantly familiar to

00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:36.726
the people who are familiar with

00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:38.006
your iOS app already.

00:07:39.506 --> 00:07:41.186
On the other hand, you might be

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:42.556
missing out on an important

00:07:42.556 --> 00:07:44.336
opportunity to streamline

00:07:44.336 --> 00:07:45.066
navigation.

00:07:46.436 --> 00:07:49.266
On Mac, sidebars are a powerful

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:50.326
navigation tool.

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:52.756
They easily accommodate a large

00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:54.666
number of options that can be

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.806
grouped and labeled to help

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.136
provide additional context and

00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.736
make them easier to scan.

00:08:01.586 --> 00:08:03.026
So, if you currently have a

00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:04.916
tabbed app, you could present

00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:06.136
those tabs in a segmented

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:08.866
control or you could put them

00:08:08.896 --> 00:08:09.756
into a sidebar.

00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:12.526
Now, this obviously does not

00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:13.516
look great.

00:08:13.736 --> 00:08:15.246
It's not a very effective use of

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:16.076
screen space.

00:08:16.686 --> 00:08:18.736
But if those four tabs have

00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:21.006
subsections, you can display

00:08:21.006 --> 00:08:22.616
those subsections in line.

00:08:23.446 --> 00:08:25.356
This greatly flattens an app's

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.346
hierarchy and allows people to

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.366
move directly between

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:30.136
subsections.

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:32.126
It can even allow people to

00:08:32.126 --> 00:08:34.306
customize these items to their

00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:34.726
needs.

00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:37.696
As we saw before, if your app

00:08:37.696 --> 00:08:39.936
has top-level list or table view

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.126
for navigating between sections,

00:08:42.736 --> 00:08:44.126
that translates directly.

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:45.986
Split views are the way to get a

00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:46.996
sidebar on Mac.

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:49.176
You just enable the translucent

00:08:49.176 --> 00:08:50.446
background and you're good to

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:50.666
go.

00:08:51.846 --> 00:08:53.876
And lastly, if your iOS app

00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:55.406
shows a document browser at the

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:57.386
top level, you can use a sidebar

00:08:57.386 --> 00:08:59.766
for providing persistent access

00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:02.066
to folders or for displaying

00:09:02.286 --> 00:09:03.336
saved searches.

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:06.276
If you use a sidebar, there are

00:09:06.276 --> 00:09:07.566
two things to keep in mind.

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:10.946
First, sidebars are providing

00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:12.656
access to locations within your

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:15.366
app or collections of documents.

00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:17.666
They're not really meant for

00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:19.146
showing the documents or other

00:09:19.146 --> 00:09:20.996
kinds of content directly.

00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:24.106
Second, the sidebar plays an

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:26.136
important role in helping people

00:09:26.136 --> 00:09:27.926
understand which window or app

00:09:28.256 --> 00:09:29.646
has key focus.

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.616
Glyphs, selection highlights and

00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:34.036
the sidebar background itself

00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:35.726
are stylized to appear

00:09:35.726 --> 00:09:37.456
translucent when the current

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:38.676
window is active.

00:09:39.416 --> 00:09:40.856
This effect goes away when the

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:42.286
window becomes inactive.

00:09:43.076 --> 00:09:44.806
Knowing which window is going to

00:09:44.806 --> 00:09:46.816
respond to keyboard input is

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:47.896
super important.

00:09:48.816 --> 00:09:50.716
To support this effect, use a

00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:51.896
translucent background.

00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:53.826
Don't fill the sidebar in with a

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.886
solid color or an image or

00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:57.346
pattern or anything like that.

00:09:58.036 --> 00:09:59.806
For selection highlights, use

00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:01.266
the system selection color

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:02.856
rather than a custom color or

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:04.286
like an app tint color.

00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:07.146
And in general, you should use

00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:08.466
template images that have a

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:10.666
vibrancy effect applied rather

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:12.646
than full color images unless

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:13.416
it's necessary.

00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:17.386
OK. Next, let's talk about

00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:17.906
toolbars.

00:10:18.806 --> 00:10:20.256
Toolbars are commonplace on the

00:10:20.256 --> 00:10:20.556
Mac.

00:10:20.556 --> 00:10:22.546
And chances are, you'll want to

00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:24.066
use one for your app.

00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:26.296
Placing controls into a toolbar

00:10:26.556 --> 00:10:28.026
makes them more discoverable.

00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:29.896
And it leads to a more stable

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:31.086
user experience.

00:10:31.946 --> 00:10:33.726
Toolbars create a top-down

00:10:33.756 --> 00:10:35.246
information flow which is the

00:10:35.246 --> 00:10:36.736
norm for Mac apps.

00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:39.796
If your iPad app has any actions

00:10:39.796 --> 00:10:41.036
that are located along the

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:44.446
bottom edge of the screen, doing

00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:46.126
the same thing in a Mac window

00:10:46.126 --> 00:10:47.476
can be very problematic.

00:10:48.176 --> 00:10:49.686
Mac windows are draggable.

00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:51.806
The bottom edge of Mac windows

00:10:51.806 --> 00:10:54.846
might be dragged out of you, or

00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:55.626
below the dock.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.056
Clearly this leads to some

00:10:58.196 --> 00:10:59.336
usability issues.

00:11:00.536 --> 00:11:01.926
When putting actions into the

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:03.806
toolbar, keep in mind that a

00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:05.696
toolbar's contents don't change

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:07.786
based on what area of an app

00:11:07.986 --> 00:11:08.996
someone is in.

00:11:09.626 --> 00:11:10.886
If they can't be used in a

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:12.976
certain area of the app, they'll

00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:13.826
be disabled.

00:11:14.976 --> 00:11:16.666
But toolbar action should only

00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:18.586
really get disabled if nothing

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:20.096
is selected for them to act

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:20.566
upon.

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:23.266
So, if actions are only relevant

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.186
in specific areas of your app,

00:11:25.656 --> 00:11:27.236
they probably should not be in

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:27.766
the toolbar.

00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:30.626
That said, you can provide

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:32.806
contextually relevant actions in

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:33.766
an action menu.

00:11:34.286 --> 00:11:35.826
Action menus can dynamically

00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:37.656
change based on the current view

00:11:37.926 --> 00:11:38.816
or selection.

00:11:39.706 --> 00:11:41.086
For example, with a file

00:11:41.086 --> 00:11:42.796
selected in a Finder window, the

00:11:43.066 --> 00:11:44.766
action menu includes actions

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:45.996
that can be performed on the

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:46.516
file.

00:11:46.556 --> 00:11:48.806
And with nothing selected, the

00:11:48.806 --> 00:11:50.526
action menu contains commands

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:52.196
that can be performed on the

00:11:52.196 --> 00:11:53.726
current folder that we're

00:11:53.726 --> 00:11:54.176
viewing.

00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:57.236
Now, action menus are not meant

00:11:57.236 --> 00:11:58.076
to be a catchall.

00:11:58.396 --> 00:12:00.146
So be selective about what you

00:12:00.146 --> 00:12:01.076
put into them.

00:12:02.126 --> 00:12:04.286
OK. Next, let's talk about

00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:04.706
layout.

00:12:05.706 --> 00:12:07.446
Mac windows are much, much,

00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:09.416
much, much larger than iPads.

00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:11.476
You'll have much more space to

00:12:11.476 --> 00:12:13.336
play with, especially in full

00:12:13.336 --> 00:12:13.866
screen.

00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:16.106
But taking advantage of all of

00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:17.986
that space requires a layout

00:12:17.986 --> 00:12:20.176
that's optimized for iPad.

00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:23.056
Now, some iPad layouts are just

00:12:23.216 --> 00:12:25.116
blown-up iPhone interfaces,

00:12:25.656 --> 00:12:27.986
which looks really bad on an

00:12:27.986 --> 00:12:28.606
iPad.

00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:31.626
And it looks even worse on a Mac

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.476
especially in full screen.

00:12:34.606 --> 00:12:36.646
Optimizing your layouts for iPad

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:38.856
and Mac requires special

00:12:38.856 --> 00:12:39.826
consideration.

00:12:40.736 --> 00:12:42.576
For both devices, readable

00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:44.476
content margins keep text lines

00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:46.296
from getting too long so that

00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:47.616
they remain readable.

00:12:48.586 --> 00:12:50.196
Breaking content into multiple

00:12:50.196 --> 00:12:51.886
columns can be a great way to

00:12:51.886 --> 00:12:54.766
maximize information density and

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.216
using split views or

00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:58.306
master-detail views is a great

00:12:58.306 --> 00:13:00.826
way to utilize a wider display.

00:13:01.916 --> 00:13:03.156
Split views streamline

00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:05.566
navigation by simultaneously

00:13:05.566 --> 00:13:07.556
displaying a list of objects and

00:13:07.556 --> 00:13:09.546
details about that object which

00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:11.516
reduces the need to navigate

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:13.416
into and back out of an app

00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:13.976
hierarchy.

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:16.756
If you have a Split View in your

00:13:16.756 --> 00:13:18.776
app, it'll work great on Mac

00:13:18.876 --> 00:13:20.086
without modification.

00:13:21.126 --> 00:13:22.546
Now, this may sound a little bit

00:13:22.546 --> 00:13:24.526
strange but making your layout

00:13:24.526 --> 00:13:26.886
work great on a Mac is probably

00:13:26.886 --> 00:13:28.706
the best way to identify and

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:30.926
address layout issues for Mac --

00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:32.116
for iPad.

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:36.526
OK. Moving on to type.

00:13:37.936 --> 00:13:40.676
On macOS, the baseline font size

00:13:40.676 --> 00:13:41.516
is 13 points.

00:13:42.116 --> 00:13:44.916
Most controls and labels use

00:13:44.986 --> 00:13:45.766
that font size.

00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:48.956
On iOS, the baseline font size

00:13:48.956 --> 00:13:49.906
is 17 points.

00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:53.466
Showing an iOS app with 17-point

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:55.096
type on a Mac would look totally

00:13:55.096 --> 00:13:55.746
out of place.

00:13:56.246 --> 00:13:57.796
Text would be way too large.

00:13:58.486 --> 00:14:00.786
So, to maintain consistency

00:14:01.096 --> 00:14:03.546
between Mac apps, the system

00:14:03.546 --> 00:14:06.196
will scale content areas down by

00:14:06.196 --> 00:14:07.586
77 percent.

00:14:08.456 --> 00:14:09.556
Seventy-seven percent, of

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:10.796
course, as we all know, I don't

00:14:10.796 --> 00:14:12.266
even know if I'm pointing this

00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.006
out, is 13 divided by 17.

00:14:15.126 --> 00:14:17.166
Everything in the main interface

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.856
will be scaled uniformly.

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:20.796
This approach means that you

00:14:20.896 --> 00:14:23.676
don't have to redesign or recode

00:14:23.756 --> 00:14:26.116
every screen for macOS.

00:14:27.206 --> 00:14:29.416
But it does introduce a bit of

00:14:29.456 --> 00:14:31.686
complexity on the design side.

00:14:32.236 --> 00:14:34.076
When creating mock-ups of your

00:14:34.076 --> 00:14:36.116
iPad app, you'll want to

00:14:36.116 --> 00:14:38.586
recreate that 77 percent scale.

00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:41.066
So in Photoshop, for example,

00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:42.666
you can put your entire content

00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:44.616
area into a smart object and

00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:46.536
scale it down to 77 percent.

00:14:46.536 --> 00:14:48.696
And you can do similar things in

00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:50.966
Sketch, XD and other design

00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:51.356
tools.

00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:54.966
On macOS, apps tend to only use

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:56.916
a few different font sizes.

00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:01.116
On iOS, text styles very much

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:01.996
more dramatically.

00:15:02.626 --> 00:15:04.516
Text styles, the typographic

00:15:04.516 --> 00:15:06.796
system for iOS and they offer a

00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:08.896
wide range of size options.

00:15:09.906 --> 00:15:11.846
Using some of the smallest size

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:13.856
like footnote, caption one,

00:15:13.856 --> 00:15:15.726
caption two, can make text

00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:17.296
that's difficult to read on Mac.

00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:20.056
Even the Mac size mini is often

00:15:20.056 --> 00:15:20.606
too small.

00:15:21.706 --> 00:15:23.396
So, just -- you may find that

00:15:23.396 --> 00:15:24.466
you need to bump up text a

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:26.086
little bit to keep it legible on

00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:26.216
Mac.

00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:29.426
And, one final note about type,

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:31.616
macOS doesn't support dynamic

00:15:31.616 --> 00:15:31.856
type.

00:15:32.396 --> 00:15:34.356
We'll always use the large size

00:15:34.356 --> 00:15:36.166
setting, it's just scaled down

00:15:36.386 --> 00:15:37.296
77 percent.

00:15:38.436 --> 00:15:41.236
OK. Now with iOS, every app has

00:15:41.236 --> 00:15:43.146
it in color which is used to

00:15:43.146 --> 00:15:44.446
show when elements are

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:45.966
interactive or to highlight

00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:46.846
selected items.

00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:49.116
Some apps go further by

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.436
colorizing content area or bar

00:15:51.436 --> 00:15:52.056
backgrounds.

00:15:52.896 --> 00:15:54.636
On Mac, things are a little bit

00:15:54.676 --> 00:15:55.146
different.

00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:57.716
It's common for people to have

00:15:57.716 --> 00:16:00.146
lots of open windows with lots

00:16:00.146 --> 00:16:02.016
of content in those windows and

00:16:02.016 --> 00:16:03.486
lots of files and folders on

00:16:03.486 --> 00:16:04.146
their desktop.

00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:07.346
If macOS used color like iOS

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.486
apps, the user experience would

00:16:09.486 --> 00:16:11.076
be really fragmented and

00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:11.666
overwhelming.

00:16:12.786 --> 00:16:14.706
Mac interfaces should be more

00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:15.226
neutral.

00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:16.826
They shouldn't compete with a

00:16:16.826 --> 00:16:18.286
content that they present to

00:16:18.286 --> 00:16:18.546
people.

00:16:19.636 --> 00:16:20.756
What people are -- that's what

00:16:20.756 --> 00:16:22.556
people are really interested in.

00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:25.856
At the same time, translucency

00:16:25.856 --> 00:16:27.826
integrates your app into the Mac

00:16:27.826 --> 00:16:28.556
ecosystem.

00:16:29.146 --> 00:16:30.606
We all like to customize our

00:16:30.606 --> 00:16:32.026
desktop pictures and

00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:34.456
translucency lets those desktops

00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:36.856
influence how apps look and it

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:38.966
brings them altogether into one

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:40.466
cohesive experience.

00:16:41.586 --> 00:16:43.676
Similarly, on Mac, highlight

00:16:43.676 --> 00:16:44.896
colors are a personal

00:16:44.896 --> 00:16:45.616
preference.

00:16:46.146 --> 00:16:47.566
If your app uses a different

00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:49.336
color to highlight selected

00:16:49.336 --> 00:16:51.926
items, it'll feel really out of

00:16:52.026 --> 00:16:53.726
place and it'll be downright

00:16:53.726 --> 00:16:55.306
confusing for the people who use

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:56.306
your app.

00:16:57.186 --> 00:16:59.096
It's worth pointing out actually

00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:00.966
that iOS is becoming a little

00:17:00.966 --> 00:17:03.476
bit more like macOS with respect

00:17:03.746 --> 00:17:04.136
to color.

00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:07.396
With multitasking, apps are seen

00:17:07.396 --> 00:17:09.346
alongside each other far more

00:17:09.346 --> 00:17:09.866
often.

00:17:10.346 --> 00:17:11.826
A consistent visual look

00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:14.076
provides a unified user

00:17:14.076 --> 00:17:14.766
experience.

00:17:15.516 --> 00:17:17.586
With Dark Mode, people expect

00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:19.566
more control over how apps will

00:17:19.566 --> 00:17:20.876
look on their device.

00:17:21.626 --> 00:17:23.016
Apps that don't respond to their

00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:24.536
personal preference will feel

00:17:24.616 --> 00:17:25.266
out of place.

00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:28.606
And, tint colors play a smaller

00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:29.426
part as well.

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:32.216
Steppers and segmented controls

00:17:32.216 --> 00:17:34.796
that used to be tinted are now

00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:36.956
neutral with iOS 13.

00:17:38.116 --> 00:17:40.326
OK. And one last comment about

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:40.716
color.

00:17:41.516 --> 00:17:43.396
As some of you may have heard

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.776
already, the system colors on

00:17:45.776 --> 00:17:47.046
iOS have been completely

00:17:47.046 --> 00:17:47.666
overhauled.

00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:50.346
If you use these colors for your

00:17:50.346 --> 00:17:52.586
iOS app, they'll get remapped to

00:17:52.586 --> 00:17:55.266
macOS equivalents for both light

00:17:55.266 --> 00:17:56.126
and dark modes.

00:17:57.236 --> 00:17:59.886
OK. Moving on to gestures.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:02.256
UIKit gestures will

00:18:02.256 --> 00:18:04.686
automatically remap to trackpad

00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:05.676
or mouse events.

00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:08.726
Single tap will be the same as a

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:09.736
mouse-down event.

00:18:11.316 --> 00:18:13.466
Long press will be mouse down

00:18:13.706 --> 00:18:14.286
and hold.

00:18:14.906 --> 00:18:18.416
Pan will be the same as a mouse

00:18:18.416 --> 00:18:18.766
drag.

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:20.946
And the swipe gesture will be

00:18:21.056 --> 00:18:23.056
remapped to a drag in the proper

00:18:23.056 --> 00:18:23.586
direction.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.596
On trackpads, pinching and

00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:28.336
rotating will work but they'll

00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:29.806
behave a little bit differently.

00:18:30.856 --> 00:18:32.926
On the iPad, pinch and rotate

00:18:32.926 --> 00:18:34.696
use the middle point between

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:37.056
touches to target objects or

00:18:37.056 --> 00:18:39.276
center the rotation and scale

00:18:39.276 --> 00:18:39.956
operation.

00:18:40.826 --> 00:18:42.986
On Mac, the cursor's location

00:18:42.986 --> 00:18:46.576
will be used for these purposes.

00:18:46.676 --> 00:18:48.456
Screen edge swipes won't be

00:18:48.456 --> 00:18:50.176
remapped for obvious reasons.

00:18:50.866 --> 00:18:53.456
And depending on how you've used

00:18:53.456 --> 00:18:55.246
gestures, you may have some work

00:18:55.316 --> 00:18:55.626
to do.

00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:57.606
Some gestures just won't

00:18:57.606 --> 00:18:58.836
translate very well to Mac.

00:18:59.786 --> 00:19:01.386
For example, pulling a scroll

00:19:01.386 --> 00:19:03.136
view to refresh its contents

00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:05.196
doesn't translate that well on

00:19:05.196 --> 00:19:05.416
the Mac.

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:07.446
For any actions that are

00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:09.186
triggered by gestural input,

00:19:09.706 --> 00:19:10.546
you'll want to find an

00:19:10.546 --> 00:19:12.466
alternative way to perform that

00:19:12.466 --> 00:19:12.926
action.

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:14.836
You can use many bar menus,

00:19:14.836 --> 00:19:16.596
contextual menus or buttons in

00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:18.556
the toolbar or all of the above.

00:19:19.716 --> 00:19:21.756
And one last note on Mac, you'll

00:19:21.756 --> 00:19:23.496
be able to receive mouse hover

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:23.946
events.

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:26.216
You can use this to display

00:19:26.216 --> 00:19:27.676
additional information about

00:19:27.676 --> 00:19:29.256
whatever the pointer is over.

00:19:30.296 --> 00:19:31.876
So for example, pressing the

00:19:31.876 --> 00:19:34.936
stock chart in the Stocks app on

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:36.746
iOS reveals the price of a

00:19:36.746 --> 00:19:38.036
specific point in time.

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:40.656
On macOS, rolling over the stock

00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:42.046
chart reveals the same

00:19:42.046 --> 00:19:42.726
information.

00:19:42.726 --> 00:19:44.456
You should definitely take

00:19:44.456 --> 00:19:45.816
advantage of hover states.

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:47.616
There're a powerful way for

00:19:47.616 --> 00:19:49.076
people to get information

00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:50.446
without needing to change their

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:51.056
selection.

00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:53.466
You'll also be able to create

00:19:53.466 --> 00:19:56.286
touch bars for your iPad apps on

00:19:56.286 --> 00:19:56.446
Mac.

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:58.796
Touch bars are a great way for

00:19:58.796 --> 00:20:00.376
displaying contextually relevant

00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:01.926
information and you can show

00:20:01.926 --> 00:20:03.376
different touch bars based on

00:20:03.376 --> 00:20:04.676
what area the app people are in

00:20:04.676 --> 00:20:05.696
or even what's selected.

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:07.676
Most touch bar components and

00:20:07.676 --> 00:20:09.156
controls are available for you

00:20:09.156 --> 00:20:09.816
to use.

00:20:10.586 --> 00:20:12.276
Now, touch bars deserve an

00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:13.486
entire talk of their own.

00:20:13.486 --> 00:20:14.936
It's way too much to get into

00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:15.196
here.

00:20:15.746 --> 00:20:16.936
But you can learn more about

00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:19.166
touch bars in the macOS HIG.

00:20:20.116 --> 00:20:22.276
OK. Next up, app icons.

00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:24.986
Mac app icons are the face of

00:20:24.986 --> 00:20:25.546
your app.

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:27.966
They help differentiate your app

00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:30.516
from dozens or hundreds of other

00:20:30.516 --> 00:20:31.716
apps that people may have

00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:32.246
installed.

00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:34.246
And they show up all over the

00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:35.766
place, in the dock, app

00:20:35.766 --> 00:20:37.666
switcher, Launchpad, application

00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:39.016
folder and more.

00:20:40.356 --> 00:20:42.956
By default, your iOS app icon

00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:45.436
will show up more or less as is,

00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:47.926
a square image that's masked by

00:20:47.926 --> 00:20:49.256
a continuous curve shape.

00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:51.696
A subtle drop shadow will be

00:20:51.696 --> 00:20:53.936
applied so that it fits in a bit

00:20:53.936 --> 00:20:56.956
better with the other Mac app

00:20:56.956 --> 00:20:57.456
icons.

00:20:58.396 --> 00:21:01.506
You can choose to stop here, or

00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:03.116
you can go the extra mile.

00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:05.016
And I encourage you to do so.

00:21:05.816 --> 00:21:07.906
Because of Mac app icon so much

00:21:07.906 --> 00:21:09.836
more visible, it really pays to

00:21:09.836 --> 00:21:11.426
have a great icon.

00:21:12.446 --> 00:21:14.256
Mac icons have different design

00:21:14.256 --> 00:21:16.336
characteristics than iOS icons.

00:21:17.056 --> 00:21:19.026
They're not simply squares with

00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:20.156
rounded off corners.

00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:22.866
Mac app icons have unique

00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:25.116
silhouettes to stand apart from

00:21:25.116 --> 00:21:26.256
other app icons.

00:21:27.046 --> 00:21:28.806
At smaller sizes, those

00:21:28.806 --> 00:21:30.716
silhouettes can help keep icons

00:21:30.796 --> 00:21:33.096
easily distinguishable from each

00:21:33.096 --> 00:21:33.406
other.

00:21:34.216 --> 00:21:37.106
And, speaking of size, on a 1x

00:21:37.106 --> 00:21:39.266
display, app icons in the Finder

00:21:39.266 --> 00:21:42.116
are only 16 pixels tall by wide.

00:21:42.896 --> 00:21:44.586
At this size, every pixel

00:21:44.586 --> 00:21:45.106
counts.

00:21:45.646 --> 00:21:47.696
So it's a good idea to create

00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:49.506
pixel hinted icons at the

00:21:49.506 --> 00:21:51.296
smallest app icon sizes.

00:21:52.866 --> 00:21:54.776
Mac app icons are, of course,

00:21:55.156 --> 00:21:56.866
crafted to accurately depict

00:21:57.306 --> 00:21:59.046
physical real-world objects.

00:21:59.616 --> 00:22:01.676
Many icons are rendered in 3D

00:22:01.676 --> 00:22:03.256
software so they have realistic

00:22:03.256 --> 00:22:04.856
lighting and material effects.

00:22:05.786 --> 00:22:07.106
We have lots of information for

00:22:07.106 --> 00:22:08.726
you to reference about camera

00:22:08.726 --> 00:22:10.776
perspective and light source in

00:22:10.776 --> 00:22:12.326
the HIG if you choose to go this

00:22:12.326 --> 00:22:12.446
route.

00:22:12.446 --> 00:22:14.006
All right.

00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:15.216
We're almost there.

00:22:15.576 --> 00:22:16.176
I know it's a lot.

00:22:16.926 --> 00:22:18.366
Second to last is contextual

00:22:18.366 --> 00:22:18.796
menus.

00:22:19.286 --> 00:22:21.216
Contextual menus are the unsung

00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:23.706
heroes of Mac app interfaces.

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:25.656
They let people know what

00:22:25.656 --> 00:22:27.376
actions can be performed on an

00:22:27.376 --> 00:22:29.516
object and they bring actions

00:22:29.686 --> 00:22:31.116
right to the pointer which

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:32.576
completely removes mouse

00:22:32.576 --> 00:22:32.946
trouble.

00:22:34.216 --> 00:22:36.516
On Mac, people basically expect

00:22:36.566 --> 00:22:38.476
contextual menus everywhere.

00:22:39.006 --> 00:22:40.656
So, it logically follows that

00:22:40.656 --> 00:22:42.396
you should add contextual menus

00:22:42.456 --> 00:22:43.226
to everything.

00:22:43.926 --> 00:22:45.246
Any object in your app should

00:22:45.246 --> 00:22:46.776
have an associated contextual

00:22:46.776 --> 00:22:48.536
menu that contains the most

00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:50.136
commonly performed actions.

00:22:51.256 --> 00:22:53.366
If you've added contextual menus

00:22:53.366 --> 00:22:54.896
for your iOS app, they'll

00:22:54.896 --> 00:22:56.596
automatically be brought to

00:22:56.596 --> 00:22:58.106
macOS contextual menus.

00:22:58.656 --> 00:22:59.946
And the same is true for edit

00:22:59.996 --> 00:23:00.316
menus.

00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:02.376
Whether you're designing

00:23:02.376 --> 00:23:04.386
contextual menus from macOS or

00:23:04.386 --> 00:23:06.796
iOS, the same basic rules apply.

00:23:07.496 --> 00:23:09.156
Here are six quick tips to keep

00:23:09.156 --> 00:23:09.526
in mind.

00:23:10.176 --> 00:23:12.176
First, avoid overwhelming people

00:23:12.176 --> 00:23:13.246
with too many options.

00:23:13.856 --> 00:23:15.176
Too many options makes it harder

00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:16.076
for people to find what they're

00:23:16.076 --> 00:23:18.086
looking for and it leads to

00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:19.616
menus that take a long time to

00:23:19.616 --> 00:23:20.026
scan.

00:23:20.806 --> 00:23:22.556
Focus on the most contextually

00:23:22.556 --> 00:23:23.996
-- most relevant functionality

00:23:23.996 --> 00:23:24.436
only.

00:23:25.286 --> 00:23:26.676
Next, be succinct.

00:23:27.316 --> 00:23:29.306
One-word labels are typically

00:23:29.426 --> 00:23:29.966
sufficient.

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:32.396
When writing labels, convey

00:23:32.396 --> 00:23:34.556
action, use verbs or verb

00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:36.636
phrases that suggest what the

00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:38.086
results of the action will be

00:23:38.146 --> 00:23:39.036
when it's performed.

00:23:39.926 --> 00:23:41.596
Also, the order of commands is

00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:42.566
very meaningful.

00:23:43.206 --> 00:23:44.566
Put the most important stuff at

00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:46.356
the top and then group related

00:23:46.356 --> 00:23:47.206
items together.

00:23:47.716 --> 00:23:49.536
Going one step further, use

00:23:49.536 --> 00:23:50.826
separators to make the

00:23:50.826 --> 00:23:52.526
relationships between commands

00:23:52.636 --> 00:23:53.356
explicit.

00:23:54.446 --> 00:23:56.246
Grouping commands together can

00:23:56.246 --> 00:23:58.296
be very meaningful and it helps

00:23:58.296 --> 00:24:00.286
people skip past entire sets of

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:02.026
commands when they conceive from

00:24:02.026 --> 00:24:03.606
the first one or two that it's

00:24:03.606 --> 00:24:04.556
not going to be relevant to

00:24:04.556 --> 00:24:05.296
their current needs.

00:24:06.466 --> 00:24:08.446
And lastly, use submenus to

00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:10.746
control menu length and hide

00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:12.476
away actions that aren't

00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:13.006
relevant.

00:24:13.846 --> 00:24:15.766
Submenus are a classic example

00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:17.046
of progressive disclosure.

00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:19.896
They simplify decision making by

00:24:19.896 --> 00:24:21.326
reducing complexity.

00:24:22.556 --> 00:24:24.896
OK. Now the last major

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:26.616
consideration that I'd like to

00:24:26.616 --> 00:24:28.696
discuss today are menu bars.

00:24:29.986 --> 00:24:31.956
Every app has a menu bar.

00:24:32.876 --> 00:24:34.696
Menu bars are core to the Mac

00:24:34.696 --> 00:24:36.996
experience, go back all the way

00:24:36.996 --> 00:24:37.986
to 1984.

00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:41.136
Menu bars were key to what made

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:43.216
computers easy to use.

00:24:44.296 --> 00:24:45.866
Designing your app's menu bar

00:24:46.166 --> 00:24:48.046
begins with this super fun

00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:48.806
exercise.

00:24:49.866 --> 00:24:51.216
You write down all of the

00:24:51.216 --> 00:24:52.576
actions that a person can

00:24:52.576 --> 00:24:54.866
perform in your app and I do

00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:56.736
mean all of them and then you

00:24:56.736 --> 00:24:58.496
take note of what object or

00:24:58.496 --> 00:25:00.366
objects those actions affect.

00:25:01.446 --> 00:25:03.036
Not only is this exercise

00:25:03.216 --> 00:25:06.106
excruciatingly fun, but it's

00:25:06.246 --> 00:25:07.666
also necessary.

00:25:08.816 --> 00:25:10.246
Every action that someone can

00:25:10.246 --> 00:25:12.126
perform in your app should be

00:25:12.126 --> 00:25:13.576
available from the menu bar.

00:25:14.206 --> 00:25:15.526
This makes them easier to

00:25:15.566 --> 00:25:17.926
discover and lets people assign

00:25:17.926 --> 00:25:19.236
keyboard shortcuts to them.

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:21.346
It also makes them more

00:25:21.346 --> 00:25:22.516
accessible to people who are

00:25:22.516 --> 00:25:25.306
using full keyboard access.

00:25:25.346 --> 00:25:26.736
Once you've cataloged all of

00:25:26.736 --> 00:25:28.286
those actions, you'll need to

00:25:28.286 --> 00:25:29.516
find a place for them to go.

00:25:30.256 --> 00:25:32.556
macOS includes a standard set of

00:25:32.556 --> 00:25:35.366
menu items -- menu options like

00:25:35.776 --> 00:25:37.486
the app menu for commands that

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.666
work -- operate on the app, file

00:25:39.666 --> 00:25:40.876
menu for commands that operate

00:25:40.876 --> 00:25:42.706
on files, edit menu for commands

00:25:42.706 --> 00:25:44.016
that operate on the content or

00:25:44.016 --> 00:25:45.716
objects within those files,

00:25:46.396 --> 00:25:47.946
format menu for formatting text,

00:25:48.686 --> 00:25:50.376
view menu for customizing the

00:25:50.376 --> 00:25:52.496
appearance of a window, window

00:25:52.496 --> 00:25:54.336
menu for commands that operate

00:25:54.336 --> 00:25:55.066
on windows.

00:25:55.836 --> 00:25:57.896
And help menus are for getting

00:25:57.896 --> 00:25:59.576
help and finding commands in

00:25:59.576 --> 00:26:00.306
those other menus.

00:26:01.466 --> 00:26:03.486
Now, for many of your apps,

00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:05.386
these standard menus are going

00:26:05.386 --> 00:26:06.646
to be all that you actually

00:26:06.646 --> 00:26:06.996
need.

00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:09.936
However, it's often necessary to

00:26:09.936 --> 00:26:12.006
provide additional custom menus.

00:26:12.816 --> 00:26:14.386
If you have a couple of key

00:26:14.386 --> 00:26:17.486
object types in your app, with

00:26:17.486 --> 00:26:19.636
object specific actions, you

00:26:19.636 --> 00:26:20.736
should consider adding a

00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:22.676
top-level menu or two for them.

00:26:23.576 --> 00:26:25.076
So, for example, in the mail

00:26:25.286 --> 00:26:27.166
app, there are two main object

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:30.386
types, mailboxes and messages.

00:26:31.326 --> 00:26:32.556
There are a number of actions

00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:33.986
that can be performed on those

00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:35.456
objects and none of those

00:26:35.456 --> 00:26:36.986
actions can be performed on the

00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:38.046
other type of object.

00:26:38.746 --> 00:26:40.526
So it makes sense to have one

00:26:40.526 --> 00:26:42.776
menu button for each of those

00:26:42.776 --> 00:26:43.386
objects.

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:46.586
At other times, it's helpful to

00:26:46.586 --> 00:26:48.156
organize actions by a larger

00:26:48.156 --> 00:26:49.376
workflow that they serve.

00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:51.946
In keynote, there are a variety

00:26:51.946 --> 00:26:52.966
of different object types that

00:26:52.966 --> 00:26:54.846
can be added to a slide and

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:56.106
there's a whole set of actions

00:26:56.106 --> 00:26:57.756
for aligning and distributing,

00:26:58.006 --> 00:26:59.416
locking them, grouping them,

00:26:59.416 --> 00:27:00.936
moving them forward or backward.

00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:02.986
And because all of those actions

00:27:02.986 --> 00:27:05.246
affect all of those objects in a

00:27:05.246 --> 00:27:07.046
similar way, it makes sense to

00:27:07.046 --> 00:27:09.026
put them into a single menu

00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:10.366
based on the workflow they

00:27:10.366 --> 00:27:10.726
serve.

00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:13.336
And once you've determined what

00:27:13.376 --> 00:27:15.106
custom menus to include in the

00:27:15.106 --> 00:27:16.996
menu bar, you'll need to create

00:27:16.996 --> 00:27:18.046
the menus themselves.

00:27:18.956 --> 00:27:20.386
All of the tips that I just

00:27:20.386 --> 00:27:21.666
shared with you for contextual

00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:24.096
menus apply here with one

00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:25.156
important addition.

00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:27.646
The structure of menu bar menus

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:28.436
is stable.

00:27:28.986 --> 00:27:30.956
Commands aren't added or removed

00:27:30.956 --> 00:27:32.716
after an app has been launched.

00:27:33.426 --> 00:27:35.276
Like toolbar actions, they

00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:36.816
disable when they can't be

00:27:36.816 --> 00:27:37.456
performed.

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.236
A stable menu system helps

00:27:40.236 --> 00:27:42.106
people to learn where commands

00:27:42.186 --> 00:27:44.056
are, even if those commands

00:27:44.176 --> 00:27:45.656
aren't currently available.

00:27:46.516 --> 00:27:48.136
And, when someone sees a

00:27:48.136 --> 00:27:49.766
disabled command, they learn

00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:51.296
that the action that it performs

00:27:52.126 --> 00:27:54.116
is not currently possible, which

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.326
is actually really useful

00:27:55.326 --> 00:27:55.826
information.

00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:59.156
And, one more thing about menu

00:27:59.156 --> 00:27:59.566
bars.

00:28:00.226 --> 00:28:02.206
Assign keyboard shortcuts for

00:28:02.206 --> 00:28:03.706
the most common commands.

00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:06.016
Heavy keyboard users will thank

00:28:06.016 --> 00:28:08.816
you on both Mac and iPad.

00:28:09.386 --> 00:28:11.036
Your keyboard shortcuts will

00:28:11.036 --> 00:28:11.946
work on both.

00:28:12.956 --> 00:28:14.446
When picking keyboard shortcuts,

00:28:14.836 --> 00:28:16.466
always follow precedent.

00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:18.436
You could find a long list of

00:28:18.436 --> 00:28:19.966
standard keyboard shortcuts in

00:28:19.966 --> 00:28:21.836
the macOS HIG on the keyboard

00:28:21.836 --> 00:28:22.286
page.

00:28:23.336 --> 00:28:25.116
Look, we all appreciate it when

00:28:25.116 --> 00:28:26.106
we come to an app that we've

00:28:26.106 --> 00:28:28.086
never used, use a keyboard

00:28:28.086 --> 00:28:29.566
shortcut that we already know

00:28:29.826 --> 00:28:32.316
and get the intended result that

00:28:32.316 --> 00:28:33.176
we expected.

00:28:33.736 --> 00:28:34.976
Am I right or am I right?

00:28:35.516 --> 00:28:39.326
[ Applause ]

00:28:39.826 --> 00:28:40.466
I think I'm right.

00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:44.346
So you have to do the work to

00:28:44.436 --> 00:28:45.606
make that happen.

00:28:45.606 --> 00:28:47.296
So, that was a lot about menu

00:28:47.296 --> 00:28:48.826
bars but I wanted to focus on

00:28:48.826 --> 00:28:49.976
them because they're core to the

00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:52.346
macOS experience and require

00:28:52.446 --> 00:28:53.526
real consideration.

00:28:54.496 --> 00:28:58.336
OK. Now, getting your iPad app

00:28:58.426 --> 00:29:00.096
running on a Mac should be

00:29:00.136 --> 00:29:01.096
pretty easy.

00:29:01.836 --> 00:29:03.626
But that's just the first step.

00:29:04.376 --> 00:29:06.366
Mac offers you an opportunity to

00:29:06.366 --> 00:29:09.136
increase the power, utility and

00:29:09.186 --> 00:29:11.226
efficiency of your app but

00:29:11.286 --> 00:29:12.766
realizing that opportunity

00:29:13.036 --> 00:29:14.536
involves some thoughtful design

00:29:14.536 --> 00:29:16.406
choices and a bit of effort.

00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:19.156
Now, I know we've covered a lot

00:29:19.156 --> 00:29:19.836
of ground today.

00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:21.376
For those of you who weren't

00:29:21.376 --> 00:29:23.076
taking notes, shame on you.

00:29:23.816 --> 00:29:26.016
But, don't worry, I'm just

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:28.006
kidding, don't feel bad, we have

00:29:28.006 --> 00:29:29.786
a dedicated page for you in the

00:29:29.786 --> 00:29:31.186
Human Interface Guidelines.

00:29:31.676 --> 00:29:33.746
It includes lots of useful tips

00:29:33.746 --> 00:29:35.056
and information about everything

00:29:35.056 --> 00:29:36.926
I covered today and much more.

00:29:37.816 --> 00:29:38.886
And I highly recommend

00:29:38.886 --> 00:29:40.076
downloading the macOS Apple

00:29:40.566 --> 00:29:41.686
Design Resources.

00:29:42.156 --> 00:29:43.506
They're available for Sketch,

00:29:43.766 --> 00:29:45.806
Adobe Photoshop and Adobe XD.

00:29:45.936 --> 00:29:48.426
You can find all of that at

00:29:48.426 --> 00:29:51.116
developer.apple.com/design.

00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:54.036
And you should also check out

00:29:54.136 --> 00:29:55.956
these great sessions about

00:29:55.956 --> 00:29:57.806
taking your iPad app to the next

00:29:57.806 --> 00:30:01.046
level and font management, all

00:30:01.136 --> 00:30:02.386
sorts of good stuff about font

00:30:02.466 --> 00:30:03.046
management.

00:30:04.086 --> 00:30:05.686
Thank you so much for your time.

00:30:05.686 --> 00:30:06.966
I'm really looking forward to

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:07.826
what you create.
