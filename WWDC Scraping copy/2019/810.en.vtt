00:15:45.506 --> 00:15:47.636
Utility is about adding audio

00:15:47.636 --> 00:15:49.286
and haptic feedback only when

00:15:49.286 --> 00:15:51.536
you can provide clear value and

00:15:51.626 --> 00:15:54.276
benefit to your app experience.

Use moderation.

Don't add sound and haptics just

00:15:57.706 --> 00:15:58.366
because you can.

00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:02.326
Let's look at a simple ARKit app

00:16:02.386 --> 00:16:03.626
that we made to illustrate this

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:03.946
point.

00:16:04.456 --> 00:16:07.536
In this app, we place a virtual

00:16:07.536 --> 00:16:09.806
timer in the environment, and

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:12.106
the interaction is dependent on

00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:13.336
the distance to that virtual

00:16:13.336 --> 00:16:13.666
timer.

00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:15.776

So, in this app, we purposely

00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:34.236
designed audio-haptic feedback

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:36.256
to complement the AR interaction

00:16:36.586 --> 00:16:39.176
and the most significant part of

00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:40.046
the user experience.

00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:41.736
Meaning moving closer to the

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.606
timer, or moving away from the

00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:46.226
timer, modulate the audio-haptic

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:49.476
The three senses are coherent

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:50.136
and unified.

00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:52.456
We refrain from adding other

00:17:04.766 --> 00:17:06.455
So, start by identifying

00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:07.776
possible locations in your app

00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:09.965
for audio-haptic feedback, and

00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:12.496
then focus only on the elements

00:17:13.016 --> 00:17:13.976
where it can enhance the

00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:15.205
experience, or communicate

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:16.056
something important.

00:17:17.306 --> 00:17:18.935
And then, are you tempted to add

00:17:18.935 --> 00:17:19.266

00:17:19.646 --> 00:17:20.576
Well, maybe don't.

00:17:20.576 --> 00:17:23.465
It will overwhelm people, and it

00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:25.316
will diminish the value of

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:32.196

00:18:12.616 --> 00:18:15.276
First, a small recap about the

00:18:17.876 --> 00:18:20.266
We have two building blocks that

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:20.946
you can work with.

00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:22.796
The first one is called

00:18:22.796 --> 00:18:24.776
transient, and is a sharp,

00:18:25.286 --> 00:18:28.846
compact haptic experience that

00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:30.456
you can feel, like a tap or a

00:18:30.456 --> 00:18:30.836
strike.

00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:32.926
The second one is a continuous

00:18:35.026 --> 00:18:35.606
over time.

00:18:35.696 --> 00:18:37.286
You can specify the duration.

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:38.986
How long it should last.

00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:42.566
For transient, there are two

00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:44.336
design dimensions that is

00:18:44.336 --> 00:18:45.556

00:18:46.466 --> 00:18:48.786
We have haptic intensity, and we

00:18:48.786 --> 00:18:50.536
have haptic sharpness, to create

00:18:50.536 --> 00:18:52.986
something more round or soft at

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:53.886
the lower value.

00:18:54.356 --> 00:18:55.576
And, something more precise,

00:18:57.786 --> 00:18:58.306
upper bound.

00:18:59.186 --> 00:19:01.486
Intensity changes the amplitude

00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:13.366
So we can notice the little

00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:14.616
difference between the left and

00:23:14.616 --> 00:23:16.876
the right on the audio, but if

00:23:16.876 --> 00:23:18.976
we continue to follow our

00:23:18.976 --> 00:23:21.306
harmony principle, with the

00:23:21.306 --> 00:23:22.396
haptics we end up with the

00:23:22.456 --> 00:23:24.276
identical pattern between the

00:23:24.276 --> 00:23:25.606
left and the right experience.

00:23:26.956 --> 00:23:29.826
In this case, we want to add

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:32.096

00:23:32.326 --> 00:23:33.386
from the double strikes.

00:23:33.876 --> 00:23:35.666
And then, we have true contrast

between left and right.
