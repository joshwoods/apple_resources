[ Music ]

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:09.036
>> Hello, and welcome to our

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:11.006
session about Modernizing Your

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:11.496
Audio App.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:14.246
My name is Peter Vasil, and I'm

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.886
a software engineer in the Core

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:16.486
Audio Team.

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:19.296
Let's start with audio units.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:22.276
Support for

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:23.856
Carbon-Component-Based Audio

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.736
Units will be removed in a

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:27.166
future macOS release.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.926
We encourage hosts to use the

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.826
AudioComponent API for audio

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:32.866
unit discovery.

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:36.936
With the next OS release,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.676
AudioHardwarePlugIn-based

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:41.326
plugins are disabled by default.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.556
We recommend using the

00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:45.766
AudioServerPlugin API instead.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.676
For now, disabled plugins can be

00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:50.346
re-enabled in the Audio MIDI

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:53.406
Setup utility, but support will

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:54.766
be removed completely in a

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.226
future macOS release.

00:00:56.716 --> 00:01:00.236
With the next OS release, we

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.256
will introduce some

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:02.136
deprecations.

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:05.126
AUGraph, Inter-App Audio, and

00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:07.076
OpenAL will be deprecated.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.326
We encourage developers to

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:11.746
switch over to AVAudioEngine, as

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:13.586
replacement for AUGraph and

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:14.376
OpenAL.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.566
For Inter-App Audio, please use

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.646
Audio Unit Extensions instead.

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.996
The 3D Mixer parameters have

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:24.426
been unified across all

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:25.206
platforms.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:27.946
For details, please refer to the

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:30.166
AudioUnitParameters header file

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.216
for a list of new and deprecated

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:33.006
parameters.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.786
For more information, please

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:37.426
visit the developer website.

00:01:39.306 --> 00:01:40.696
Thank you for your attention.
