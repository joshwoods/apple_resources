This is good.

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:52.666
(Music playing)

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.533
(Applause)

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.566
>> TIM COOK: Wow.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.566
Thank you.

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:24.099
Thank you.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:26.066
Good morning.

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.533
And welcome to WWDC 2019.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:31.733
(Applause)

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.900
It is so great to be here
with you today in San Jose.

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:39.366
We are so inspired by the
millions of incredible

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.433
Apple Developers
around the world.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.133
Your dreams and your
passion and dedication to

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.133
fulfill those dreams comes
across so clearly in the

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:53.433
apps that you create, apps
that enrich the lives of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.900
millions of people
around the world.

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.666
You make the world a
better place and that is

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.400
why we are here
this morning.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.599
So, welcome to WWDC.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.199
(Applause)

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:14.800
WWDC is more vibrant than
ever with attendees from

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:19.533
more countries and more
first-time attendees than ever.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.133
In fact, for most of you
in the audience this

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:27.733
morning, this is your
first WWDC, so, welcome.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.000
(Applause)

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.800
Apple makes - Apple makes
the best products in the

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:37.833
world, products that
integrate world class

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.900
hardware with world class
software and a growing

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:44.266
collection of world class
services to deliver

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:47.699
experiences unlike
anyone else out there.

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:52.433
In March, we held an event
to talk about our services

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.966
and introduce you to some
brand-new Apple services.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:04:01.166
We launched Apple News+
which offers a beautifully

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:05.199
designed experience for
more than 300 popular

00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:09.233
magazines, digital
publications and newspapers.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.766
There is no service out
there quite like this.

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:14.166
I love it.

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:17.899
And if you haven't tried
it, I encourage you to do so.

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:19.500
(Applause)

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:23.000
We also announced Apple
Arcade, the world's first

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:26.733
game subscription service
for mobile desktop and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.800
living room featuring over
100 new games from some of

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:35.100
the most innovative game
developers in the world.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:38.066
Apple Arcade will be
available later this year.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:41.933
And we introduced Apple
Card which will completely

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.399
reinvent the credit
card experience.

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:47.000
Apple Card will be
available this summer.

00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:51.800
And we announced Apple TV+
which is a new home for

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:54.766
the world's most
creative storytellers.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:58.500
Now, while the service
doesn't launch until fall,

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:00.366
we thought it would be
really fun this morning to

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.500
share with you a sneak
peek of just one of our

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:06.733
upcoming show from Ron
Moore, the executive

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.733
producer behind Battle
Star Galactica and Star Trek.

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:14.866
With his new series, Ron
wanted to take us on a

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:18.800
journey in which the
space race was a little

00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:21.300
different than you
might remember it.

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:23.533
And it has never ended.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.866
So, let's take a first
look at For All Mankind.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.100
(Applause)

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.433
(Music playing)

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.333
>> MALE SPEAKER: I believe
that this nation should

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.833
commit itself to landing
a man on the moon and

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:41.066
returning him
safely to the earth.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:44.633
>> MALE SPEAKER: After
thousands of years gazing

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.800
up in the heavens and
dreaming of this day, a

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:51.366
man is about to set
foot on the moon.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:53.899
>> MALE SPEAKER: Across
the world, people wait

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:55.199
with bated breath.

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:57.199
>> MALE SPEAKER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:57.266 --> 00:05:59.033
this is a live signal.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.266
There he is.

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:05.066
The shock across the
nation at this event

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.966
is just indescribable.

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:17.899
The Soviet cosmonaut has
become the first to set

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:19.899
foot on the moon.

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:27.699
>> MALE SPEAKER: I thought
it was about being first.

00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:29.633
It turns out the stakes
are much bigger than that.

00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:32.600
>> MALE SPEAKER:
Get back to work.

00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:35.666
>> MALE SPEAKER: We are
still in this thing.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.566
>> MALE SPEAKER: Change
of plans, gentlemen.

00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:39.600
There is water
on the moon.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:46.233
This race will be ours
to fight for and to win.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.199
And we are not
stopping there.

00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:48.833
Moon Lab.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:49.933
>> MALE SPEAKER: We need
to accelerate the base.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.366
>> MALE SPEAKER:
You are going to be

00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:52.899
an astronaut candidate?

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:54.800
>> FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I'm
going to be an astronaut.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.533
>> MALE SPEAKER: We will
go to Mars, Saturn, the

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.699
stars, the galaxy.

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:01.833
>> MALE SPEAKER:
Drifting right.

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:02.466
Watch it.

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:05.266
>> MALE SPEAKER: Eagle,
this is Houston.

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:05.966
Do you copy?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.966
>> MALE SPEAKER: This is
not the end of the race.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.966
We must keep our
eyes to the future.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.133
>> Three, two -

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:31.399
(Applause)

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:33.266
>> TIM COOK:
Wasn't that great?

00:07:36.466 --> 00:07:40.000
I've gotten an early look
at the entire season and I

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:42.333
loved it, and I think
you are going to too.

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:44.633
We can't wait to show you
this series and our other

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.866
original shows
coming up this fall.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:53.066
Now, Apple TV+ will be
available on the Apple TV

00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:56.066
app which is across all
of your screens including

00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:58.500
your Smart TVs.

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:01.166
And, of course, the best
way to enjoy this content

00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:05.100
is with AppleTV 4K which
offers an immersive

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:08.000
cinematic experience
delivering the highest

00:08:08.066 --> 00:08:10.966
picture quality of any
streaming device out there.

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:18.133
Apple TV is powered by tvOS,
and tvOS is just one of the

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:21.000
software platforms that we
are here to talk about today.

00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:23.366
So, let's get going.

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:25.433
(Applause)

00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:31.766
I'm excited to share with
you this morning how we

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:34.966
are going to make tvOS
even more entertaining

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:37.232
and more personal.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.466
We completely redesigned
the Home screen, making

00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:43.399
Apple TV come to life from
the moment that you turn

00:08:43.466 --> 00:08:46.566
it on with full screen
previews of the best TV

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:49.533
shows and newly
released movies.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.966
Apple TV is designed to be
used for the whole family,

00:08:58.033 --> 00:09:01.600
but we wanted to make
it even more personal.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:05.066
Today, the Up Next list
has a mix of shows for

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:08.700
everyone in the home, but
when you sit down to watch

00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:12.600
TV, you want to see the
shows that you love.

00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:16.500
So, we are introducing
multiuser support for tvOS.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.600
(Applause)

00:09:22.266 --> 00:09:25.200
Now, everyone in the home
gets their own Up Next

00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:28.266
list plus personalized
recommendations for new

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.933
shows and movies to enjoy.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.899
Now, and it's easy to
switch between family

00:09:33.966 --> 00:09:36.500
members using the all
new Control Center.

00:09:36.566 --> 00:09:38.666
It works just like you
would expect it to.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:47.899
TvOS also delivers Apple
Music with over 50 million

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:51.066
songs and curated music
video play lists.

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:54.233
And now, with multiuser
support, everyone in the

00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:58.266
home gets their own
personalized music experience.

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.133
You are going to be able
to see lyrics to your

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.166
favorite songs in
sync with the music.

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:08.133
This is really cool.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:10.799
(Applause)

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:16.966
This is the best music
experience on television.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.700
Now, Apple Arcade is also
going to look amazing on

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:23.333
the AppleTV 4K this fall.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.966
Playing great games like
Ocean Horn 2, of course,

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:30.100
is even better with great
game controllers so we are

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:33.933
extending support to two
of the best and most

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.333
popular game
controllers available.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.399
Xbox 1S.

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:38.600
(Applause)

00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:40.866
Yes.

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:42.766
And PlayStation
DualShock 4.

00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:44.633
(Applause)

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Yeah.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:54.866
I think there is a few
PlayStation fans out there.

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:59.166
Finally, let's talk about
our beautiful screensavers.

00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:01.566
We have already captured
some of the most stunning

00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:05.266
locations around the globe
and even some from outer

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:06.833
space through our
collaboration with the

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.799
International
Space Station.

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:13.933
This year, we are
going under the sea.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.966
Oh, it's awesome.

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:16.633
(Applause)

00:11:17.766 --> 00:11:20.399
We've partnered with BBC
Natural History unit to

00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:24.399
shoot beautiful 4K HDR
footage, taking you to

00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:27.633
places that few people
have ever experienced before.

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:31.433
So, that's the new tvOS.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.933
More personal and more
entertaining than ever.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.166
(Applause)

00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:44.633
Now, let's talk
about Apple Watch.

00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:46.666
(Applause)

00:11:48.933 --> 00:11:51.433
Yeah.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.200
Apple Watch is the number
one watch in the world.

00:11:54.266 --> 00:11:56.633
It keeps you connected to
the people and information

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.333
you care about just by
raising your wrist.

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.100
It tracks your workouts
and motivates you to stay

00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:04.233
active throughout the day.

00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:06.033
And with new breakthrough
features like fall

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.833
detection, heart
notifications and ACG, the

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:11.700
Apple Watch has truly
become an intelligent

00:12:11.766 --> 00:12:13.433
guardian for your health.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.366
For so many of us, the
Apple Watch has become an

00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:21.799
essential part of
our daily life.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:25.566
Today, we are going to
take another leap forward

00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:28.233
with the watchOS to bring
new experiences to Apple

00:12:28.299 --> 00:12:32.333
Watch while enhancing the
ones that you already love.

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:34.366
To tell you all about it,
I would like to invite

00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:35.966
Kevin Lynch to the stage.

00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:36.633
Kevin.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.600
(Applause)

00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:40.333
>> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Tim.

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:45.100
Good morning.

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.966
So excited to be here.

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.100
We're thrilled at how
Watch is making such a

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:51.233
difference in so
many people's lives.

00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:53.633
This is driving us to make
Watch even more powerful

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.366
and more personal for you.

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.600
Let's start with
Watch faces.

00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:00.533
Now, these are something
you interact with most

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.433
every day and we have more
Watch faces this year

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.533
since the very
first Apple Watch.

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:07.766
(Applause)

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.299
From simply beautiful to
richly detailed, let's

00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:16.200
take a look at
a few of these.

00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:18.466
First, we have the
gradient face which is

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.766
smoothly animating
with the time.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.566
Then we have this large
Numerals face showing the

00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:27.500
current hour in multiple
languages and the very

00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:30.200
modern digital face
showing you a great look

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:33.466
in multiple colors and
then the California dial,

00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:35.266
classic design
for a Watch face.

00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:37.766
Now, many of these
faces you can add more

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:40.233
information to, such as
adding rich complications

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:42.033
here right on the
California dial.

00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:45.433
Then we have
the solar face.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.066
This visualizes the sun's
24-hour path around the

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:51.000
dial and you can see it
changing during the day or

00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:53.433
as you rotate
the Digital Crown.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.766
These are just beautiful.

00:13:55.633 --> 00:13:57.133
(Applause)

00:14:01.266 --> 00:14:02.799
Now, across all of the
Watch faces, we are

00:14:02.866 --> 00:14:05.333
introducing taptic chimes.

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:07.633
And when enabled, on the
hour, you will feel a

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.133
silent taptic on your
wrist and if sound is on,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.666
you will hear an audible
chime like this.

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:19.200
Yes, that's a bird song.

00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:21.333
It's actually a robin
captured at Apple Park.

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.600
I mean, it was
recorded in Apple Park.

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:25.100
(Laughter)

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.100
The robins are okay.

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:30.200
(Applause)

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:35.166
Now, let's talk
about apps.

00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:38.033
Now, these are designed
for quick interactions on Watch.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.266
First, we are bringing
more Apple apps to Watch.

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.633
The new Audiobooks app to let you listen to Apple Books and

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.233
Voice Memos so you can
easily record your thoughts.

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:49.466
(Applause)

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.666
And calculator.

00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:56.633
(Applause)

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:02.033
And check this out; it
also includes the ability

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.100
to do tip calculations,
including the ability to

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:06.766
split the bill
with friends.

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:09.466
(Applause)

00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:16.033
Now, we are also giving
developers great new tools

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.933
and APIs to build great
apps for Apple Watch.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.100
And we are now making it
possible to create apps

00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:23.466
that run independently
on the Watch, no longer

00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:25.399
requiring a
companion iPhone app.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.100
(Applause)

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.799
And now you can get
extended time to access

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.266
sensor data and complete
sessions like physical

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.266
sensor data and complete
sessions like physical

00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:40.133
therapy with Kya or
brushing your teeth with

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.866
Colgate or
meditating with Calm.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.666
And watchOS 6 now enables
the streaming audio API so

00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:51.366
you can go with just
your Watch and you can

00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:51.366
you can go with just
your Watch and you can

00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:53.966
stream great content
like Podcasts, music,

00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:55.433
live sports games.

00:15:55.899 --> 00:15:58.566
So, with new developer
tools and a new native UI

00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:00.600
framework coming this
year, we are enabling a

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:03.933
whole new generation
of apps for Watch.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.366
Now, to make it easier
for you to discover these apps,

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:10.133
we are excited to bring
the App Store to Apple Watch.

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:13.233
(Applause)

00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:19.100
You can browse apps
curated by our editorial

00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:22.166
team or find favorite apps
like Head Space or Carrot

00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:24.866
Weather or Streaks,
the Nike Run Club.

00:16:24.933 --> 00:16:28.266
You can search the full
App Store using dictation

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:31.133
or scribble or
just asking Siri.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.433
And you can view product
pages to see information

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.000
like the app description,
reviews, screenshots.

00:16:37.066 --> 00:16:39.366
And finally, you can
purchase and install an

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.100
app directly
on your Watch.

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:45.000
(Applause)

00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:49.366
So, discovering and using
apps at Apple Watch is

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:51.566
going to be better than
ever with the App Store

00:16:51.633 --> 00:16:53.299
and these really
great developer tools.

00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:55.666
Now, we are also adding
new health and fitness

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:58.266
capabilities and to tell
you about some of these, I

00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:00.733
would like to invite to
the stage Dr. Sumbul Desai,

00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:02.733
our VP of Health, to the stage.

00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:03.500
Sumbul?

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.500
(Applause)

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.598
>> SUMBUL DESAI:
Thanks, Kevin.

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:15.233
Apple Watch is an amazing
health and fitness

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:17.532
partner, and in watchOS 6
we are adding even more

00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:20.433
features to empower you to
better manage your health

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.433
starting with activity.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.299
Being physically active is
one of the most important

00:17:25.366 --> 00:17:26.933
things you can do
for your health.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.599
If it were a prescription,
it would actually be one

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.833
of the most prescribed
medicines in the world.

00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:35.033
The Activity app on Apple
Watch already motivates

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:36.466
you to stay active.

00:17:36.533 --> 00:17:38.599
It also lets you know
how active you are every

00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:41.633
single day, but knowing
how active you are over

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.400
the long-term is
just as important.

00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:46.666
It gives you a sense of
your overall fitness.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:51.200
So, in watchOS 6 we are
introducing Activity Trends.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.666
(Applause)

00:17:56.433 --> 00:17:58.599
For nine key metrics it
will compare your progress

00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:02.433
over the last 90 days
with the last 365.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.066
If the trends show that
you are maintaining or

00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:07.366
improving, you will see
an arrow pointing up, and

00:18:07.433 --> 00:18:09.799
that's great; keep doing
what you are doing.

00:18:09.866 --> 00:18:12.066
But if you are trending
downward, we will give you

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.299
simple coaching to
get you back on track.

00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:16.433
You will see trends for
familiar metrics like

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.633
move, exercise, and stand,
but you will also see

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.066
trends for some new
metrics like your workout

00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.099
walking pace, flights of
stairs climbed or even

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:26.666
your cardio fitness level.

00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:29.966
Activity Trends will
provide you with a more

00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:33.033
complete picture of what
you can do to stay active

00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:35.700
and even more importantly,
give you the motivation

00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:38.433
you need for
long-term success.

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:41.333
(Applause)

00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:46.799
Now, let's talk about
your hearing health.

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:48.933
Your hearing is
a precious asset.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.666
Think about the sounds
that surround you every

00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:53.333
day, hearing a friend's
laughter, listening to

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.799
your favorite song.

00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:57.666
Protecting your hearing is
critical to living your

00:18:57.733 --> 00:19:00.099
everyday life and
maintaining your

00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.666
independence as you age.

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.933
Since hearing loss is
often so gradual, it's

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.900
important to know when the
sounds around you are loud

00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:08.966
enough to impact
your hearing.

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:11.000
Like when you are in the
middle of a construction

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:13.799
zone, at a sporting event
or playing your music

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:15.966
really loud to drown
out your singing voice.

00:19:16.033 --> 00:19:17.633
I do that all of the time.

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.866
The new Noise app uses
the microphone to detect

00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:23.566
decibel levels and can
notify you if it's reached

00:19:23.633 --> 00:19:26.033
a level that could impact
your hearing over time.

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:28.400
Because the Watch is always
on your wrist, it's in a

00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:31.099
great position to monitor
your environmental noise.

00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:34.200
If you tap the Noise app,
you will get more detail

00:19:34.266 --> 00:19:36.666
and you can use the
complication to check with

00:19:36.733 --> 00:19:38.200
just the raise of a wrist.

00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:41.533
It's an easy way to
protect your hearing health.

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:44.400
And, of course, this
feature was designed with

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:46.433
privacy in mind.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.633
It only periodically
samples and does not

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.900
record or save any audio.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.833
(Applause)

00:19:58.233 --> 00:20:01.000
We think the Noise app
is really going to make

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:02.700
a big impact.

00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:04.433
Now, there is one more
new feature in health and

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.733
fitness and all of the
women out there, pay close

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:09.466
attention because
this one is for you.

00:20:09.533 --> 00:20:10.599
Cycle Tracking.

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:13.166
(Applause)

00:20:16.366 --> 00:20:18.266
Knowing more about your
menstrual cycle gives you

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:20.566
a window into your health,
from simply ensuring that

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.333
you are prepared, to
understanding your

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.133
personal patterns
and regularities.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.933
As a physician, I know
that understanding what's

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.666
normal for you is critical
in making informed

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:32.266
clinical decisions
and can really enrich

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:34.066
conversations
with your doctor.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:38.233
So, in watchOS 6, the
Cycle Tracking app gives

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:40.766
you a simple, discreet
ways to visualize your

00:20:40.833 --> 00:20:45.400
cycle right on your wrist
and it's really easy to use.

00:20:45.466 --> 00:20:48.166
You can log key aspects of
your period and fertility,

00:20:48.233 --> 00:20:51.166
including symptoms, and
you can be notified when

00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:52.666
it's about to begin.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:55.066
You can also choose to
receive a fertile window

00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:57.633
prediction so you
are better informed.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.066
This feature is available
on Apple Watch and because

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.533
we wanted to make this
available to hundreds of

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:05.333
millions of women around
the world, Cycle Tracking

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.333
is also available without a Watch in the Health app and iOS.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.966
(Applause)

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.066
Yes, for everybody to use.

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:16.000
(Applause)

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.066
You can use it on your
iPhone to do all of those

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.500
same functions that
can be done on Watch.

00:21:22.566 --> 00:21:25.233
We are so excited to
bring more focus to this

00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:28.066
incredibly important
aspect of women's health.

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:29.466
Now, back to Kevin.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:31.666
(Applause)

00:21:32.766 --> 00:21:33.666
>> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Sumbul.

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.633
So, the Health app is the
best way to see all of

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.966
your health data in
one place, and we have

00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:44.866
redesigned it to be
even more personal and

00:21:44.933 --> 00:21:46.066
meaningful to you.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.500
In the new summary view,
you can see health

00:21:48.566 --> 00:21:50.433
related notifications.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.333
You'll see your favorites,
the information you care

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.133
about most, as well as
automatically generated

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.566
highlights so you can see
your health data over time.

00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:00.233
For example, if you are
more active than you

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:02.099
usually are, how
consistently you may have

00:22:02.166 --> 00:22:04.500
been mindful this week,
or how your heart rate

00:22:04.566 --> 00:22:06.366
recovered after
a recent workout.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.500
Health is using machine
learning on your iPhone to

00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:11.066
determine which
highlights might be most

00:22:11.133 --> 00:22:12.799
interesting to you.

00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:14.533
So, the new Health app is
going to bring you even

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:16.766
more powerful
perspective on your health.

00:22:17.566 --> 00:22:19.900
Now, all of this health
data is securely stored in

00:22:19.966 --> 00:22:23.066
your iPhone or encrypted
in iCloud, and since there

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:24.599
is nothing more private
than your health

00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:26.966
information, you
control your data.

00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:28.866
You can decide if you want
to share particular health

00:22:28.933 --> 00:22:30.700
data with selected apps,
if you would like to share

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.000
anything at all.

00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:34.766
Those are some of the
great new features coming

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:36.000
to watchOS 6.

00:22:36.066 --> 00:22:38.166
To give you a look at some
of this running live,

00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:40.200
please welcome to the
stage, watchOS program

00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:41.866
lead, Haley Allen.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.700
(Applause)

00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:51.366
>> HALEY ALLEN:
Thanks so much, Kevin.

00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:53.766
I have been loving watchOS
6 and I'm super excited to

00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:55.866
have the opportunity to
show it to you today.

00:22:55.933 --> 00:22:57.900
Let's start with a few
of my favorite faces.

00:22:58.366 --> 00:23:00.966
This is the new modular
compact face and now I can

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:03.133
have a large info graph
complication alongside

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.700
a beautiful dial.

00:23:04.766 --> 00:23:06.366
And there is even room in
the corner for a couple of

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:08.666
my favorite rich
complications like these

00:23:08.733 --> 00:23:10.633
two new ones,
wind and rain.

00:23:11.033 --> 00:23:13.500
Let's tap customize and
check out some of the options.

00:23:16.266 --> 00:23:18.666
This is the new Noise
complication which tells

00:23:18.733 --> 00:23:20.400
me how loud it is in here.

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:21.733
It's pretty quiet.

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:23.333
Let's make some noise
and see how this works.

00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.266
(Applause)

00:23:28.433 --> 00:23:29.299
Amazing.

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:30.000
Thank you.

00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:30.666
That's great.

00:23:31.333 --> 00:23:33.000
The next face I want to
show you is one of our

00:23:33.066 --> 00:23:35.099
most popular faces and
this year we have made it

00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:38.333
even cooler because you
can customize it to our

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.666
all new monochrome style.

00:23:40.733 --> 00:23:42.766
I love the simplicity
of this two-tone look.

00:23:43.766 --> 00:23:46.400
In the middle here is the
Audiobooks complication and

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:48.799
I can just tap on it and
resume right where I left off.

00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:51.633
And the Now Playing controls
on watchOS 6 are great,

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.500
showing me exactly
what I need to see for that app.

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.666
In Audiobooks, I can tap
here at the bottom and

00:23:56.733 --> 00:23:58.866
find that chapter I want
to listen to again.

00:23:58.933 --> 00:24:02.366
It's never been easier to
listen to great books on the go.

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:06.000
The last face I want to
show you is the gradient face.

00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:08.233
Kevin showed you how
beautiful it looks full

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:12.066
screen and I can also
customize it to add all of

00:24:12.133 --> 00:24:13.799
my favorite rich
complications.

00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:16.033
I'm constantly
multitasking.

00:24:16.099 --> 00:24:18.533
With a busy job and a son
at home sometimes I only

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:20.866
have a moment to
capture a quick thought.

00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:23.033
Let me tap on the Voice
Memos complication in the

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:24.933
bottom right corner
and do that now.

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.400
Remind Marcus that just
because you are almost seven

00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:33.500
does not mean you get to, quote, "Veto your bedtime."

00:24:35.833 --> 00:24:36.900
Okay.

00:24:36.966 --> 00:24:39.033
Now, I'm super excited to
give you the first look at

00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:40.599
the all new App Store.

00:24:43.133 --> 00:24:45.799
With curated collections
and apps, it's super easy

00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:49.066
to discover and download
great apps for the Watch.

00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:50.866
Let's check out Chineasy.

00:24:50.933 --> 00:24:55.099
I can just tap here to see
ratings and screenshots.

00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:58.666
And I can download it
directly from my Watch.

00:24:58.733 --> 00:25:00.200
It's super convenient.

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.766
Let me show you an app I
have already downloaded,

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.366
the MLB app.

00:25:04.433 --> 00:25:07.000
With the new audio
streaming APIs in watchOS 6,

00:25:07.066 --> 00:25:10.133
I can listen in to any
live game no matter where I am.

00:25:10.733 --> 00:25:12.566
Now, they aren't actually
playing right now, but let

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.400
>> MALE SPEAKER: Two,
one, pitch coming.

00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:20.200
A swing and high
drive to right field.

00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:22.266
Going back to the
track, it's got a shot.

00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:23.133
Right at the wall.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.133
It is gone.

00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:26.133
>> HALEY ALLEN: Yes,
isn't that cool?

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.099
Come on.

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:28.366
(Applause)

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.266
All right.

00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:32.966
Thanks so much.

00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:35.466
Those are just a few
highlights in watchOS 6.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:36.533
I think you are
going to love it.

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:37.599
Back to you, Kevin.

00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:39.700
(Applause)

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.733
>> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Haley.

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:46.166
That was really cool.

00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:48.500
Now, there is so much
more to watchOS 6, like

00:25:48.566 --> 00:25:51.299
recognizing songs with
Shazam built right in and

00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:53.666
automatic software updates
right on your Watch.

00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:57.200
Now, lastly, we know how
personalized you like to

00:25:57.266 --> 00:25:59.299
make Watch from the Watch
faces to the physical

00:25:59.366 --> 00:26:01.933
bands, and we are
introducing today some new

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.566
summer colors and an all-new Pride edition Watch band.

00:26:06.466 --> 00:26:08.333
(Applause)

00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:14.466
It matches perfectly with
the new pride Watch face

00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:15.900
on your Watch.

00:26:16.233 --> 00:26:18.433
So, watchOS 6 is another
large step forward for

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.966
Watch and it is really an
honor for the team to be

00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:23.099
crafting something so
personal to all of you.

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:24.299
Thank you and back to Tim.

00:26:24.966 --> 00:26:26.266
(Applause)

00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:32.466
>> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Kevin.

00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:34.900
All of these great new
features will make the Apple

00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:39.866
Watch an even more indispensable part of your daily life.

00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:43.366
Now, let's talk about iOS,
the world's most powerful

00:26:43.433 --> 00:26:44.599
mobile Operating System.

00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:46.266
(Applause)

00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:51.933
Last year, we delivered
iOS 12 which is full of

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.666
amazing features from
dynamic new AR experiences

00:26:55.733 --> 00:27:00.633
and Memoji to screen time
and faster performance,

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.366
and once again, iOS has
the highest customer

00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:07.066
satisfaction in the
industry with an

00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:09.666
incredible 97%.

00:27:09.733 --> 00:27:11.366
This is unbelievable.

00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:12.900
(Applause)

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:17.666
And as always, our
adoption rate is industry

00:27:17.733 --> 00:27:19.500
leading as well.

00:27:19.566 --> 00:27:24.366
85% of iOS customers are
on the latest release.

00:27:24.433 --> 00:27:27.833
And in fact, iOS 12 has
been installed on more

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.500
systems than any
version of iOS ever.

00:27:32.566 --> 00:27:35.433
Now, that's in stark
contrast to the latest

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.000
offering from those other
guys which was released

00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:45.833
before iOS 12; they
only have 10% adoption.

00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:49.533
(Applause)

00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:58.000
Now, this high adoption
rate is a huge benefit for

00:27:58.066 --> 00:28:01.599
both users and developers.

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:04.966
Now, to tell you about the
next major release of iOS,

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:07.566
I'd like to hand
it over to Craig.

00:28:07.633 --> 00:28:08.533
Craig.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.566
(Applause)

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.333
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: Hello.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.866
Thank you.

00:28:15.933 --> 00:28:19.633
Thank you.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.200
Okay.

00:28:24.266 --> 00:28:26.799
I'd like to talk -
all right, we've got a lot

00:28:26.866 --> 00:28:27.966
to talk about
this morning.

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:33.766
I'd like to talk about our
next big release of iOS.

00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:36.366
Now, when it came to
naming this release, our

00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:38.833
crack marketing team
really surprised us this

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.166
year by demonstrating
their ability to count

00:28:42.233 --> 00:28:44.833
well into the
double digits.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.766
Yes, it's iOS 13.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.766
(Applause)

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:55.566
Now, iOS 13 is a huge
release packed with lots

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:59.166
of capabilities, but we
know that nothing is more

00:28:59.233 --> 00:29:02.866
important to our iPhone
users than performance.

00:29:02.933 --> 00:29:05.400
So, this year, we worked
top to bottom in the

00:29:05.466 --> 00:29:08.599
system, making everything
faster that you do the most.

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:15.166
Things like unlocking with
Face ID, now 30% faster.

00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:17.433
(Applause)

00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:19.533
Now, this one is cool.

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:21.700
We have changed the way
that we are packaging apps

00:29:21.766 --> 00:29:24.400
on the App Store, and when
this rolls out in the fall

00:29:24.466 --> 00:29:27.566
with iOS 13, you will see
that your downloads are

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:30.700
now 50% smaller.

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:33.866
And updates, 60% smaller.

00:29:33.933 --> 00:29:35.700
But what's - yes.

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:37.466
(Applause)

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.266
But what's really
incredible is the effect

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.833
it has on app
launch speed.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.866
It's up to twice
as fast in iOS 13.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.333
(Applause)

00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:58.333
Now, we were able to do
this in a release packed

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.566
with new features and
there is one that I think

00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:02.733
is going to really
resonate with some of you

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.133
here and I would like to
introduce it to you now.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.233
Let's take a look.

00:30:09.233 --> 00:30:13.933
(Music playing)

00:30:54.299 --> 00:30:55.599
(Applause)

00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:56.866
That's right.

00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:04.166
We are bringing
Dark Mode to iOS.

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:06.533
(Applause)

00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:08.966
I'd love to show
it to you live now.

00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:10.366
(Cheer)

00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:11.233
All right.

00:31:11.566 --> 00:31:12.533
(Laughter)

00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:15.466
Okay.

00:31:15.533 --> 00:31:19.033
Let's take our first
live look at iOS.

00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:21.266
Now, here it is in
its traditional light

00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:24.533
appearance with this
gorgeous new wallpaper,

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:27.833
but now let's begin our
descent into darkness.

00:31:28.099 --> 00:31:28.733
(Laughter)

00:31:29.366 --> 00:31:30.099
Look at that.

00:31:30.166 --> 00:31:32.066
The gorgeous dark
wallpaper and

00:31:32.133 --> 00:31:34.066
notifications look great.

00:31:34.133 --> 00:31:36.233
Let's take a look
at our Widgets.

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:37.566
They look just awesome.

00:31:38.933 --> 00:31:40.500
Let's take a look
at some apps.

00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:42.200
We will start with News.

00:31:42.266 --> 00:31:45.633
Check it out with a
gorgeous dark appearance,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.633
so nice.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.299
And your calendar, your
daily events have never

00:31:50.366 --> 00:31:54.000
looked so awesome with
this really beautiful palette.

00:31:54.566 --> 00:31:56.166
And Notes.

00:31:56.233 --> 00:32:01.366
Look at this refined
texture, it's really fantastic.

00:32:02.033 --> 00:32:04.000
Let's take a trip
into Messages.

00:32:04.066 --> 00:32:08.166
You see how your images,
your emoji, they all look

00:32:08.233 --> 00:32:10.466
just fantastic.

00:32:10.533 --> 00:32:12.366
And, of course, the
keyboard, with an extra

00:32:12.433 --> 00:32:15.766
refined new dark
appearance and some new

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:20.033
tricks because now when
you type, you can swipe.

00:32:20.233 --> 00:32:22.433
(Applause)

00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:26.566
Just like that.

00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:27.900
It's really great.

00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:32.366
Let's take a
look at Photos.

00:32:32.433 --> 00:32:35.266
Of course, it looks
fantastic in Dark Mode.

00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:38.400
Now, this is our Dark
Mode Project Team at the

00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:39.633
project kickoff.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.299
You see it was happy times.

00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:47.766
They did slowly begin
their descent into darkness.

00:32:49.266 --> 00:32:51.666
We take the details
very seriously.

00:32:52.666 --> 00:32:54.099
Let's take a look at
our new share sheet.

00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.599
It looks awesome in Dark
Mode, but you notice in

00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:59.733
the middle sharing
suggestions intelligently

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:01.833
based on who you share
with and who appears

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.833
in the photos.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.966
You can share
with just a tap.

00:33:06.033 --> 00:33:07.566
It's so fast and easy.

00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:10.666
And finally, music.

00:33:10.733 --> 00:33:13.366
Your music looks
great in Dark Mode.

00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:16.900
It can go through some
of my recent play back.

00:33:16.966 --> 00:33:18.966
Of course, start playing
some music here.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.333
And now for the first time
ever, time synced lyrics.

00:33:25.933 --> 00:33:30.233
(Applause)

00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:40.866
And that is a quick look
at what's new with Dark

00:33:40.933 --> 00:33:43.633
Mode in iOS 13.

00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:45.633
(Applause)

00:33:49.433 --> 00:33:51.766
So, great performance,
intelligent sharing, the

00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:55.333
new quick path keyboard
and Dark Mode.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.400
But, of course, there
is much more to iOS 13,

00:33:58.466 --> 00:34:00.866
starting with apps.

00:34:01.366 --> 00:34:03.799
Let's start with Safari,
Mail, and Notes.

00:34:03.866 --> 00:34:06.666
Now, Safari has new
options to quickly change

00:34:06.733 --> 00:34:10.065
text sizing and has per
website preferences.

00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:14.000
Mail gets desktop class
text formatting controls,

00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:16.433
including support
for rich fonts.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.500
And Notes gets this
beautiful new gallery

00:34:19.565 --> 00:34:22.833
view, support for shared
folders, and much more.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.599
But where we really went
deep is with Reminders.

00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:28.933
We have completely
reinvented the app,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.300
rewriting it from the
ground up to make it more

00:34:31.366 --> 00:34:34.433
intelligent, intuitive and
powerful and easier than

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.000
ever to create Reminders.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.433
So, for instance, just
type what you want and

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.866
Reminders will understand
when and where to notify you.

00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:45.533
Or you can use the new
quick type bar; just tap

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:48.300
and enter things like
location or even

00:34:48.366 --> 00:34:50.800
attachments like photos.

00:34:50.866 --> 00:34:54.132
With tasks, you can now
associate to-dos with a

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.933
top-level reminder.

00:34:56.833 --> 00:34:59.066
Now, smart lists, they
help you keep track of

00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:02.233
your most important items
and, if you tag a person

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.766
in a reminder, well, next
time you are in a Messages

00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:06.733
conversation, you will
automatically get a

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.300
notification letting them
know that now is time to talk.

00:35:10.366 --> 00:35:11.800
It's really handy.

00:35:11.966 --> 00:35:14.166
Next, Maps.

00:35:14.233 --> 00:35:16.900
Maps is with you
everywhere you are from

00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:21.300
work, home, or even on
the go with CarPlay.

00:35:21.366 --> 00:35:24.033
And our team continues its
obsession with building

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:26.433
the best possible map.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.766
Now, we have outfitted
literally hundreds of

00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:32.533
planes and cars with
custom sensors and lidar

00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:35.966
and driven over four
million miles to rebuild

00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:39.433
our map from the ground
up, and the results

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500
are really impressive.

00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:46.099
Here is our old map and
here is the new map.

00:35:46.633 --> 00:35:48.500
(Applause)

00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:54.966
It's just great.

00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:58.133
Now, we expect to roll out
this map across the entire

00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:00.866
US by the end of this year
and select other

00:36:00.933 --> 00:36:02.433
countries next year.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.400
But we didn't stop there.

00:36:03.466 --> 00:36:05.900
There is much more to
Maps, and to give you a

00:36:05.966 --> 00:36:08.099
quick look at what's new,
I would like to invite

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.466
Meg Frost, our Director of
Product Design to the

00:36:11.533 --> 00:36:12.599
stage for a quick demo.

00:36:12.666 --> 00:36:13.133
Meg.

00:36:13.933 --> 00:36:16.533
>> MEG FROST: All right.

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:19.099
All right.

00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:22.166
Thank you.

00:36:22.233 --> 00:36:26.233
I'm so happy to show you
what's new in Apple Maps.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.133
All right.

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:29.566
First, let's take a
look at that new map.

00:36:29.633 --> 00:36:33.033
As Craig said, we have
been driving and flying

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:37.366
all across the United States, collecting land and aerial

00:36:37.433 --> 00:36:41.966
data to add significant
new detail to the map.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.833
So, now roads and beaches,
parks and buildings look great.

00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:51.500
We have also added a
couple of very useful new

00:36:51.566 --> 00:36:55.099
features to our recently
designed launch screen

00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:58.199
like favorites, where I
can add the places I go

00:36:58.266 --> 00:37:01.533
every day for quick
and easy access.

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:04.199
Now, I can just
tap and go.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.699
And with collections, this
is where I can organize

00:37:09.766 --> 00:37:12.966
all of my favorites
or I can make lists of

00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:16.433
favorites to share with
friends, or I can finally

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.033
organize that
next big trip.

00:37:20.033 --> 00:37:23.266
Let's check out my
SF spots collection.

00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:26.233
Now, I have been
checking out Chinatown.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.300
You will notice in the
upper right-hand corner,

00:37:29.366 --> 00:37:31.599
there is a new
binoculars button.

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:37.033
When I tap that, I get
a brand-new look around window.

00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:39.900
Yes, this is the right
place to drop in, so I'm

00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:42.366
going to go full screen.

00:37:42.433 --> 00:37:46.800
With look around,
I get a gorgeous, high

00:37:46.866 --> 00:37:49.666
definition 3D view.

00:37:49.733 --> 00:37:52.400
It's an awesome
way to explore.

00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:54.033
(Applause)

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.199
But this is my
favorite part.

00:38:01.266 --> 00:38:04.199
Turn your phone
and hold on tight.

00:38:06.366 --> 00:38:08.300
Smoothly move
down the street.

00:38:08.366 --> 00:38:09.400
(Applause)

00:38:09.466 --> 00:38:12.000
Yep, I bet you haven't
seen it look like that before.

00:38:15.966 --> 00:38:19.199
I can tap on labels to
learn more about new places.

00:38:19.766 --> 00:38:23.033
Yes, I think I will check
this one out later.

00:38:23.099 --> 00:38:26.766
And those are just a few
of the new features that

00:38:26.833 --> 00:38:29.199
we will be bringing
to Apple Maps.

00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:31.099
Thanks, and back
to you, Craig.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.066
(Applause)

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.266
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Meg.

00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:40.633
Now, we think Maps users
are really going to love

00:38:40.699 --> 00:38:43.599
favorites, collections and
look around, but there is

00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:47.199
much more to Maps, like
junction view for China,

00:38:47.266 --> 00:38:49.433
or the ability when you
are en route to share an

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.466
up to date ETA with
friends and family with

00:38:52.533 --> 00:38:53.599
just a tap.

00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:56.666
But what's most important
is that Maps has been

00:38:56.733 --> 00:38:59.800
designed to be
private and secure.

00:38:59.866 --> 00:39:02.966
We always protect your
identity and activity, and

00:39:03.033 --> 00:39:05.666
there is no need to flip
a switch to ask Maps to

00:39:05.733 --> 00:39:09.099
start respecting your
privacy because at Apple,

00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:12.366
we believe privacy is a
fundamental human right

00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:15.866
and we engineer it
into everything we do.

00:39:16.666 --> 00:39:18.766
This year, we are
doing even more.

00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:22.900
I want to focus on three big areas starting with location.

00:39:22.966 --> 00:39:25.900
Sharing your location with
a third-party app can

00:39:25.966 --> 00:39:28.433
really enable some useful
experiences, but we don't

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.133
expect to have that
privilege used to track us,

00:39:32.199 --> 00:39:36.000
and so this year we are building in even more protections.

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:38.566
Now, for the first time,
you can share your

00:39:38.633 --> 00:39:42.066
location to an app just
once, and then require it

00:39:42.133 --> 00:39:43.633
to ask you again next
time it wants it.

00:39:43.833 --> 00:39:44.599
(Applause)

00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:53.500
And if you do choose to
grant an app the ability

00:39:53.566 --> 00:39:55.366
to continually monitor
your location in the

00:39:55.433 --> 00:39:58.166
background, we will give
you reports so you will

00:39:58.233 --> 00:40:00.466
know what they are up to.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.766
Now, some apps try to work
around these protections

00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:06.533
by scanning for Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi signals to infer

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:08.133
your location.

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:11.133
Well, we are shutting the
door on that abuse as well.

00:40:11.633 --> 00:40:12.933
(Applause)

00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:21.133
Next, I want to
turn to log in.

00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:23.666
We have all seen buttons
like this, asking us to

00:40:23.733 --> 00:40:26.500
use a social account
log in to get a more

00:40:26.566 --> 00:40:29.166
personalized experience
with an app.

00:40:29.233 --> 00:40:32.400
Now, this can be
convenient, but it also

00:40:32.466 --> 00:40:35.266
can come at the cost
of your privacy.

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.300
Your personal information
sometimes gets shared

00:40:37.366 --> 00:40:40.099
behind the scenes and
these log ins can be used

00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:42.033
to track you.

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:46.000
We wanted to solve this
and many developers do too.

00:40:46.066 --> 00:40:48.066
So, now we have
the solution.

00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:49.866
It's called sign
in with Apple.

00:40:50.066 --> 00:40:52.000
(Applause)

00:41:00.366 --> 00:41:03.266
Sign in with Apple is the
fast, easy way to sign in

00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:05.666
without all of
the tracking.

00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:08.966
Its simple API allows the
developer to put a sign in

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.033
with Apple button
in their app.

00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:13.666
You just tap it and you
are authenticated with

00:41:13.733 --> 00:41:17.400
Face ID on your device,
logged in with a new

00:41:17.466 --> 00:41:21.199
account without revealing
any new personal information.

00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:24.166
(Applause)

00:41:27.866 --> 00:41:31.133
Now, some apps may want
your name, and maybe even

00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:33.266
an email to send you
information when you are

00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:34.766
outside the app.

00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:38.199
Now, we do allow them to
request this information,

00:41:38.266 --> 00:41:42.666
but check this out; you
can choose to share your

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:46.933
actual email address or
you can choose to hide it,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.233
and when you do, we will
create a unique random

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.000
address that forwards
to your real address.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.333
(Applause)

00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:10.433
Yeah.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.500
A lot of love for
random addresses here.

00:42:12.566 --> 00:42:15.166
And that's good news
because we give each app a

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:16.833
unique random address.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.666
This means you can disable
any one of them at any

00:42:19.733 --> 00:42:22.366
time when you are tired
of hearing from that app.

00:42:22.433 --> 00:42:24.033
It's really great.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400
(Applause)

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:34.333
So, of course, this entire
experience is meant to

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.733
help you have control
over your data.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.833
Now, this is available
across all of our

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.433
platforms, and
also on the Web.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.166
Now, next I want
to turn to HomeKit.

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:49.366
You know, our homes are
such personal places,

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:52.766
places where we deserve
to feel safe and secure.

00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:55.433
So, HomeKit has been
designed from the outset

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.800
to protect the privacy and
security in your use of

00:42:58.866 --> 00:43:00.099
home accessories.

00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:03.199
And no accessory is more
personal than security

00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:07.766
cameras that film in
and around your home.

00:43:08.166 --> 00:43:11.833
Now, unfortunately, most
home cameras today send

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.766
people's video up to
the Cloud, so it can be

00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:16.800
analyzed to tell the
difference between maybe a

00:43:16.866 --> 00:43:19.900
leaf blowing in the wind
and someone at your door,

00:43:19.966 --> 00:43:23.333
but unfortunately, this
risks your privacy.

00:43:23.766 --> 00:43:28.766
We have a new way; it's
called HomeKit Secure Video.

00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:30.433
Now, yes.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.233
HomeKit Secure Video, in
that case the video is

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.733
analyzed in your home
on your resident iPad,

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.033
HomePod or Apple TV and
then it is encrypted and

00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:45.366
securely sent to iCloud
where no one, not even

00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:47.033
Apple, can see it.

00:43:47.633 --> 00:43:49.133
(Applause)

00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:54.966
Now, of course, you will
be alerted if there is any

00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:57.900
activity, and you will be
able to review the recordings.

00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:01.333
Now, storage for ten days
of clips will be included

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.833
in your existing iCloud
accounts and it won't

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.300
count against
your storage.

00:44:06.866 --> 00:44:07.766
Yeah.

00:44:07.833 --> 00:44:11.000
Netatmo, Logitech and Eufy
will be among the first to

00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:14.266
provide these cameras
with more to come.

00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:18.433
Now, in addition to
cameras, HomeKit supports

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.900
a wide variety of
other accessories.

00:44:19.966 --> 00:44:22.833
But many accessories don't just connect via HomeKit; they also

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.666
connect via the Internet
and through your router.

00:44:27.033 --> 00:44:31.400
Unfortunately, this can
leave them open to attack

00:44:31.466 --> 00:44:34.199
and we want to make sure
that this can't happen.

00:44:34.266 --> 00:44:38.099
And so, we are bringing
HomeKit to routers.

00:44:38.633 --> 00:44:40.333
Now, with HomeKit at
the router, we will

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.733
automatically firewall off
each of your accessories

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.099
so even if one were to be
compromised, it wouldn't

00:44:46.166 --> 00:44:48.199
be able to access
your other devices or

00:44:48.266 --> 00:44:51.366
compromise your
personal information.

00:44:51.433 --> 00:44:53.300
The first HomeKit enabled
routers will be coming

00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:57.300
from Linksys, Eero and
Internet service providers

00:44:57.366 --> 00:44:59.566
like Charter Spectrum.

00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:01.666
(Applause)

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.866
Next up, Messages.

00:45:07.933 --> 00:45:10.966
Now, we have all received
messages like this, like

00:45:11.033 --> 00:45:12.733
who is this guy?

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.699
Well, wouldn't it be
better if you could see

00:45:14.766 --> 00:45:19.333
something like this,
or maybe even this?

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.966
Well, now you can because
with iOS 13, you and the

00:45:24.033 --> 00:45:26.099
people you message with
will be able to share your

00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:30.000
name and your photo, and
even use Memoji or Animoji

00:45:30.066 --> 00:45:32.133
to create a photo
of yourself.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.033
Now, this information
is only shared when you

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:37.433
message with someone, so
you are completely in

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.233
control of who sees
your name and picture.

00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:42.866
Now, since we are all
going to be creating a lot

00:45:42.933 --> 00:45:45.400
more Memoji, we wanted to
make them even better at

00:45:45.466 --> 00:45:48.199
reflecting our own
personal style, so we've

00:45:48.266 --> 00:45:51.233
added a huge amount of
new options for makeup,

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.400
accessories and
so much more.

00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:56.166
I would like to have some
experts give you a quick look.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.099
>> DESI PERKINS: Hi guys.

00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:02.166
I'm Desi Perkins.

00:46:02.466 --> 00:46:04.466
>> PATRICK STARR: And
I'm Patrick Starr.

Today, we're going to show
you how to make a cute,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.833
flirty Memoji look.

00:46:13.033 --> 00:46:14.066
>> DESI PERKINS: Using
all the new makeup and

00:46:14.133 --> 00:46:15.933
accessories in iOS 13.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.300
>> PATRICK STARR:
Starting with eye shadow.

00:46:18.666 --> 00:46:20.466
>> DESI PERKINS: This is my favorite eye shadow right now.

00:46:20.533 --> 00:46:22.933
It's called Apple Fuchsia
Number Six and it comes in

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.433
this really cute
little toolbar.

00:46:24.633 --> 00:46:25.066
>> PATRICK STARR:
Close your eyes.

00:46:25.133 --> 00:46:25.699
Let me see.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.599
>> DESI PERKINS: Lipstick.

00:46:27.666 --> 00:46:28.199
>> PATRICK STARR: Pink.

00:46:28.266 --> 00:46:28.699
>> DESI PERKINS: Red.

00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:29.233
>> PATRICK STARR: Purple.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:29.800
>> DESI PERKINS: Violet.

00:46:29.866 --> 00:46:30.400
>> PATRICK STARR: Blue.

00:46:30.466 --> 00:46:31.466
>> DESI PERKINS: Oh, ash?

00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:32.866
>> PATRICK STARR: Desi,
you have to go Dark Mode.

00:46:32.933 --> 00:46:34.099
Darker, darker.

00:46:35.566 --> 00:46:36.099
>> DESI PERKINS:
Piercings.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.933
>> PATRICK STARR: Nose
ring, brow ring, earring,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
lip ring, tongue ring.

00:46:41.366 --> 00:46:43.166
>> DESI PERKINS: You can
customize your teeth and hair?

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:46.166
Oh, braces, gap
tooth, missing tooth.

00:46:46.433 --> 00:46:47.233
>> PATRICK STARR:
A mini grill.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.833
>> DESI PERKINS: Earrings,
do you think this will be cool?

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.366
I'm allergic to
fake jewelry.

00:46:52.733 --> 00:46:54.400
>> PATRICK STARR:
Okay, moving on, hair.

00:46:54.466 --> 00:46:55.733
How about this?

00:46:56.199 --> 00:46:57.500
>> DESI PERKINS: We have
to screenshot these.

00:46:59.866 --> 00:47:00.933
What else?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.566
Hats.

00:47:01.833 --> 00:47:02.400
>> PATRICK STARR: Hats.

00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:06.766
>> DESI PERKINS:
And glasses.

00:47:06.866 --> 00:47:09.199
>> PATRICK STARR: Cute,
cute, cute, cute, cute, cute.

00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:10.433
What do we have here?

00:47:11.566 --> 00:47:12.500
>> DESI PERKINS:
Last but not least -

00:47:12.866 --> 00:47:15.000
>> DESI PERKINS AND
PATRICK STARR: AirPods.

00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:16.166
>> PATRICK STARR:
Everyone, these are our

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:17.266
finished looks.

00:47:17.533 --> 00:47:18.566
>> DESI PERKINS: Thanks,
Pat, for joining me.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.300
>> PATRICK STARR:
Oh, of course.

00:47:19.366 --> 00:47:20.533
Thanks for joining me.

00:47:20.599 --> 00:47:21.966
Don't forget to like and subscribe. Thanks.

00:47:22.033 --> 00:47:23.733
>> DESI PERKINS: And Craig,
I have a few tips for you.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.000
Let's connect
after the show.

00:47:27.133 --> 00:47:29.099
(Applause)

00:47:34.533 --> 00:47:36.333
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So, I
think that's given us all

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.533
a great deal
to think about.

00:47:37.733 --> 00:47:38.599
(Laughter)

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.466
Now, we are all going
to have a lot of fun

00:47:41.533 --> 00:47:43.933
personalizing our own
Memoji and so we wanted to

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.733
give you even more
ways to use them.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.933
So, we are introducing
something new.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.233
It's called
Memoji stickers.

00:47:51.466 --> 00:47:53.333
(Applause)

00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:57.533
Now, instead of expressing
yourself like this with

00:47:57.599 --> 00:48:00.166
emoji in your
conversations, you can now

00:48:00.233 --> 00:48:03.533
do it like this.

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:05.733
We automatically create a
sticker pack for you for

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.599
each of your Memoji.

00:48:07.666 --> 00:48:09.400
Now, of course, you can
use them in Messages but

00:48:09.466 --> 00:48:12.199
we have also incorporated
them right alongside emoji

00:48:12.266 --> 00:48:14.933
in the system keyboard so
you can use them in apps

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.300
like Mail or your favorite
other apps like WeChat.

00:48:19.699 --> 00:48:22.033
And we have made these
usable not just in more

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:26.433
apps but also on more
devices because while

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.966
actually animating a
Memoji puppet with your

00:48:29.033 --> 00:48:31.300
face requires a device
with a True Depth Camera

00:48:31.366 --> 00:48:34.366
System, Memoji stickers
and support for the Memoji

00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:38.000
editor is now supported
for all devices with an A9

00:48:38.066 --> 00:48:40.000
chip or later.

00:48:40.066 --> 00:48:41.266
Next.

00:48:41.699 --> 00:48:43.166
(Applause)

00:48:46.633 --> 00:48:48.733
Next, I want to turn to
Camera and Photos where we

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.833
have given you great new
ways to capture, edit, and

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.033
experience your photos.

00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:57.033
Now, I'm going to start
with Portrait Lighting

00:48:57.099 --> 00:49:00.699
where we put the power of
the studio right in your pocket.

00:49:00.766 --> 00:49:04.033
In iOS 13, we are
taking Portrait Lighting to

00:49:04.099 --> 00:49:05.433
a new level.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.400
And it starts with a
brand-new effect we call

00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:08.833
high key mono.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.533
It looks just amazing.

00:49:11.033 --> 00:49:13.333
Now, we are also extending
Portrait Lighting so you

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.866
can adjust the intensity
of the Lighting Effect

00:49:15.933 --> 00:49:18.066
just like you could in a
lighting studio by moving

00:49:18.133 --> 00:49:21.266
the lights closer or
farther away from your subject.

00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:23.866
So, when you increase the
intensity of the light,

00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:26.533
it's like virtually
moving the light closer.

00:49:26.599 --> 00:49:29.199
This has the effect
of smoothing skin,

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.699
brightening eyes and
facial features.

00:49:31.766 --> 00:49:36.066
Or you can pull it back
for a subtle, more refined look.

00:49:36.133 --> 00:49:39.666
And we adapt this effect
uniquely to each style of

00:49:39.733 --> 00:49:40.933
Portrait Lighting.

00:49:41.699 --> 00:49:44.133
Next, I want to
turn to photo editing.

00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:45.966
We have a brand-new
experience so that you

00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:48.066
control every
element of your photo.

00:49:48.133 --> 00:49:51.533
You can see at a glance
all of your settings, and

00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:55.433
with just a tap and a drag,
you can make adjustments.

00:49:56.133 --> 00:49:59.766
It applies across all of
our existing effects and

00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:03.233
many more that
are new to iOS 13.

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.433
But we are - yes.

00:50:04.733 --> 00:50:06.633
(Applause)

00:50:09.433 --> 00:50:11.333
But what's really cool is
we are bringing all of

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.533
this to video for
the first time.

00:50:14.766 --> 00:50:17.266
(Applause)

00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:25.366
Now - so now, for the first time, you can rotate a video.

00:50:26.133 --> 00:50:26.666
How about it?

00:50:26.933 --> 00:50:28.699
(Applause)

00:50:31.099 --> 00:50:32.300
But, of course, much more.

00:50:32.366 --> 00:50:35.866
You can apply filters and
all of these effects.

00:50:35.933 --> 00:50:37.400
It's just awesome.

00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:39.900
But, you know, our biggest
change this year is in the

00:50:39.966 --> 00:50:43.133
way you can browse and
experience your photos.

00:50:43.199 --> 00:50:45.566
You know, we all have
so many photos in our

00:50:45.633 --> 00:50:48.000
library, so much great
stuff in there, but it's

00:50:48.066 --> 00:50:51.866
all often weighed down by
pictures of receipts and

00:50:51.933 --> 00:50:54.599
white boards and
screenshots.

00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:57.300
So, now we are using
advanced machine learning

00:50:57.366 --> 00:51:00.033
to remove duplicates and
clutter and let you focus

00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:01.300
on your best shots.

00:51:02.199 --> 00:51:04.066
And we are taking these
photos and we are

00:51:04.133 --> 00:51:06.933
intelligently organizing
them to create a sort of

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.133
diary of your life.

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.633
Using this, you will be
amazed at how you discover

00:51:11.699 --> 00:51:14.733
the moments in your life
that matter to you the most.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.533
Now, we do all of this
inside a brand-new Photos tab.

00:51:18.599 --> 00:51:20.900
And so, to show it to you,
I would like to bring up

00:51:20.966 --> 00:51:24.366
the leader of our photos
app team, Justin Titi, to

00:51:24.433 --> 00:51:25.566
give you a live demo.

00:51:25.633 --> 00:51:26.133
Justin?

00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:31.866
>> JUSTIN TITI:
Thanks, Craig.

00:51:31.933 --> 00:51:33.766
I'm so excited to show you
guys the new Photos app.

00:51:33.833 --> 00:51:35.300
Let's get started.

00:51:35.733 --> 00:51:37.300
So, here we are
in all photos.

00:51:37.366 --> 00:51:40.199
It's got a new home right
here in the Photos tab.

00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:42.000
We have also given you
more control over how you

00:51:42.066 --> 00:51:43.900
can view all
of your photos.

00:51:43.966 --> 00:51:46.333
You can simply pinch to
zoom out and see a bunch

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.366
of photos or you can zoom
in and see more detail.

00:51:49.433 --> 00:51:50.933
It is really
fast and fluid.

00:51:51.866 --> 00:51:53.900
Now, as you can see, I
take a ton of photos of my

00:51:53.966 --> 00:51:56.566
kids trying to capture
that perfect moment.

00:51:56.633 --> 00:52:00.233
Oftentimes my best shots
get lost in the sea of images.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.166
That's what days is for.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.300
I just tap down
here at the bottom.

00:52:05.366 --> 00:52:07.666
You can see days is
absolutely beautiful.

00:52:07.733 --> 00:52:09.900
The clutter of the
similar photos is gone.

00:52:09.966 --> 00:52:11.766
I can just scroll
and enjoy now.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.866
So, Photos uses
intelligence to create

00:52:15.933 --> 00:52:18.000
these stunning
layouts of my photos.

00:52:18.066 --> 00:52:20.466
Every day looks great.

00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:25.266
And you can see videos
like this time lapse play

00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:27.199
automatically for me,
really bringing my library

00:52:27.266 --> 00:52:30.199
back to life.

00:52:30.266 --> 00:52:33.199
As do live photos help me
relive those really fun moments.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.566
And a simple trip to the
farmer's market makes me

00:52:38.633 --> 00:52:40.699
feel like a
professional photographer.

00:52:42.666 --> 00:52:46.066
So, days is simply the
best way to browse your photos.

00:52:46.133 --> 00:52:47.733
So, let's check
out months.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.800
I just tap and even moving between views is beautiful.

00:52:51.866 --> 00:52:54.766
So, months organizes the
most meaningful events in

00:52:54.833 --> 00:52:56.066
my library by month.

00:52:56.133 --> 00:52:59.566
So here is a trip I took
to Tahoe, my kids' last

00:52:59.633 --> 00:53:04.166
day of school, and
my wife's birthday.

00:53:04.366 --> 00:53:05.699
Now, this is a video we
all take but we usually

00:53:05.766 --> 00:53:08.266
forget to enjoy and now
it's playing for me right here.

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:15.733
Really fun concert, and,
of course, WWDC from last year;

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.366
these labs were a blast.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.800
So, that's months.

00:53:18.866 --> 00:53:21.133
It makes it really easy to
browse the greatest hits

00:53:21.199 --> 00:53:23.233
of your library
in one view.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.766
So, let's head
over to years.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.800
So, years gives me a high-level overview of my library.

00:53:28.966 --> 00:53:31.166
What makes years really
special is that it's

00:53:31.233 --> 00:53:33.666
dynamic based
on my context.

00:53:33.733 --> 00:53:36.866
So today is WWDC and
photos knows I go to WWDC

00:53:36.933 --> 00:53:39.866
every year, so now it's
showing me all of my WWDCs

00:53:39.933 --> 00:53:42.900
from the past.

00:53:42.966 --> 00:53:43.733
Go try it out.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.733
It's awesome.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.133
(Applause)

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.199
I can go all the way back
- I can go all of the way

00:53:51.266 --> 00:53:53.733
back to my first
WWDC in 2011.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.500
I was so excited to
be at that keynote.

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:58.233
Now, years can
do so much more.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.300
What if today was my
daughter's birthday?

00:54:00.366 --> 00:54:01.633
Let me show you what
that would look like.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.566
So, years is totally
transformed now and it's

00:54:06.633 --> 00:54:08.300
all about my daughter.

00:54:08.366 --> 00:54:11.900
As a proud dad, this
brings me so much joy.

00:54:11.966 --> 00:54:14.900
She's grown up so fast.

00:54:14.966 --> 00:54:20.599
Her first bike, these fun
times when every meal was

00:54:20.666 --> 00:54:26.500
a mess, and this
is her first smile.

00:54:26.566 --> 00:54:28.366
And this video just brings
that moment right back to

00:54:28.433 --> 00:54:29.966
life for me.

00:54:30.933 --> 00:54:34.500
I can just tap and I can
relive that whole great day.

00:54:35.633 --> 00:54:36.933
So that's the
new Photos app.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.233
We think you are really
going to love it.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.533
Back to you, Craig.

00:54:39.733 --> 00:54:41.266
(Applause)

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.766
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Justin.

00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:49.033
We are so excited to
have you try this out.

00:54:49.099 --> 00:54:51.966
When you experience it
with your own photos, it's

00:54:52.033 --> 00:54:54.133
a very meaningful experience.

00:54:54.199 --> 00:54:56.233
So, that's Camera and
Photos, and as you can

00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.733
see, there is so much to
experience in iOS 13.

00:55:00.933 --> 00:55:04.066
And now, while much of our
interaction with iPhone is

00:55:04.133 --> 00:55:06.666
through touch, we
also experience iOS in so

00:55:06.733 --> 00:55:08.800
many other ways.

00:55:08.866 --> 00:55:12.300
We use iOS when we are on
the go with our AirPods,

00:55:12.366 --> 00:55:14.533
when we gather around to
listen to our favorite

00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:18.000
music on HomePod.

00:55:18.066 --> 00:55:20.033
And when we are on the
road with CarPlay.

00:55:20.599 --> 00:55:22.766
And, of course, tying
together all of these

00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:25.733
experiences is Siri.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.533
So, to take you through
what's new with AirPods,

00:55:28.599 --> 00:55:31.533
HomePod, CarPlay, and
Siri, I would like to

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:34.633
invite to the stage Stacey
Lysik, our Senior Director

00:55:34.699 --> 00:55:37.599
of OS Program Management
to the program and to the stage.

00:55:37.666 --> 00:55:38.800
Stacey.

00:55:38.966 --> 00:55:41.233
(Applause)

00:55:46.366 --> 00:55:47.666
>> STACEY LYSIK:
Thanks, Craig.

00:55:47.733 --> 00:55:49.966
Let's get started with
AirPods where we have a

00:55:50.033 --> 00:55:53.300
couple of great new
features coming to iOS 13.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.533
First, when you are
wearing AirPods, Siri will

00:55:56.599 --> 00:55:58.833
now be able to read your
incoming messages to you

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.666
as soon as they arrive and
you can instantly respond.

00:56:02.733 --> 00:56:05.366
Let's take a quick peek
and see how it works.

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:13.066
>> SIRI: Amy said, "Can
you meet for coffee at 9:00 am?"

00:56:13.133 --> 00:56:14.133
>> MALE SPEAKER: Tell
her I'll be there.

00:56:15.366 --> 00:56:16.266
>> SIRI: It's sent.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.566
(Applause)

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.133
>> STACEY LYSIK: Just like
that, Siri helps you stay

00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:27.199
in the moment, whether
the incoming notification

00:56:27.266 --> 00:56:29.933
comes from the Messages
app or any third-party

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.466
messaging app
using SiriKit.

00:56:32.766 --> 00:56:35.533
(Applause)

00:56:38.333 --> 00:56:42.133
Another great new feature
is audio sharing.

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:45.433
We have all had a time
where we wanted to share a

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.800
movie or a song
with a friend.

00:56:47.866 --> 00:56:50.099
Now, you can,
with just a tap.

00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:53.033
(Applause)

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:02.800
Like everything AirPods,
the experience is magical.

00:57:02.866 --> 00:57:05.466
And when you get home,
there is no better way to

00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:08.233
keep the music going than
with HomePod and its

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.033
incredible sound quality.

00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:13.633
To make that transition
seamless, we are bringing

00:57:13.699 --> 00:57:15.800
Handoff to HomePod.

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:18.666
(Applause)

00:57:21.433 --> 00:57:23.133
Now, when you walk through
the door, just bring your

00:57:23.199 --> 00:57:25.533
iPhone close to your
HomePod to instantly hand

00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:29.099
off your music, a Podcast
or even a phone call.

00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:31.066
And you can just take it
with you when you leave

00:57:31.133 --> 00:57:32.633
the exact same way.

00:57:33.666 --> 00:57:36.400
(Applause)

00:57:39.033 --> 00:57:41.433
Today, we are
introducing Live Radio.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.066
So, you can ask Siri
to play stations from

00:57:44.133 --> 00:57:47.800
iHeartRadio, Tune
In, and Radio.com.

00:57:47.866 --> 00:57:52.566
In fact, we have over
100,000 radio stations

00:57:52.633 --> 00:57:54.800
from all around the world.

00:57:55.033 --> 00:57:56.400
(Applause)

00:58:01.766 --> 00:58:05.900
Now, HomePod can learn
to recognize who in your

00:58:05.966 --> 00:58:09.500
family is talking and
personalize the response.

00:58:10.199 --> 00:58:12.900
(Applause)

00:58:15.099 --> 00:58:17.266
Of course, this is great
with Apple Music so now

00:58:17.333 --> 00:58:19.099
when you ask Siri to play
you some music, it is

00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:21.433
based on your taste and
your play history and not

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.866
anyone else's, and the
personalization extends

00:58:24.933 --> 00:58:28.300
way beyond music to
Messages, Reminders, Notes

00:58:28.366 --> 00:58:29.966
and more.

00:58:30.033 --> 00:58:32.033
So that's HomePod.

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:36.466
Next, let's shift
gears to CarPlay.

00:58:36.533 --> 00:58:38.599
CarPlay leads the
industry in adoption with

00:58:38.666 --> 00:58:42.199
availability more than 90%
of cars sold here in the

00:58:42.266 --> 00:58:45.833
US and 75% of cars
sold globally.

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.433
This year, we have our
biggest update to CarPlay

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.033
since the beginning.

00:58:51.099 --> 00:58:54.333
It all starts with the
CarPlay dashboard where

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.933
you can now have your
music next to your maps

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.666
and you still have
room for Siri smart

00:58:58.733 --> 00:59:01.933
suggestions, like a garage
door opener when you get

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.466
close to home or a view of
your next calendar event.

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.433
You can see your whole day
in the new Calendar app.

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.366
Music has been redesigned
so your album art is front

00:59:12.433 --> 00:59:14.566
and center and beautiful.

00:59:14.633 --> 00:59:17.266
Siri stays out of the way
so you don't lose sight of

00:59:17.333 --> 00:59:19.033
what's on the display.

00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:22.000
Siri has always been great
for getting directions or

00:59:22.066 --> 00:59:24.833
asking for some music and
it now works with third

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:28.433
party apps like
Pandora and Waze.

00:59:28.699 --> 00:59:33.066
(Applause)

00:59:35.233 --> 00:59:39.099
As you saw, Siri is with
you across so much of what

00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:42.333
we do on iOS, and last
year Siri became even more

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.300
powerful with the
introduction of Siri Shortcuts.

00:59:46.633 --> 00:59:49.566
Shortcuts enable you to
use your apps through Siri

00:59:49.633 --> 00:59:52.833
and in the Shortcuts app,
you can create your own

00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.699
personalized
multi-step Shortcut.

00:59:55.766 --> 00:59:59.400
Now, on iOS 13, the app is
built right in and it is

00:59:59.466 --> 01:00:01.500
more powerful than ever.

01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:04.033
It is now the one place
you access all of your

01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:06.933
Shortcuts, including ones
you have added to Siri,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.866
and we make it easier to
get started with your

01:00:08.933 --> 01:00:12.266
first multistep shortcut
using a new feature called

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:15.333
suggested automations
which take your habits and

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.466
personalize it to a
template like heading home

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.233
or going to the gym.

01:00:22.566 --> 01:00:27.533
Integral across all of these experiences is how Siri sounds.

01:00:27.599 --> 01:00:30.366
When we first started with
Siri's voice, we used

01:00:30.433 --> 01:00:33.733
short clips of audio from
actor recordings, but

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.866
sometimes when we put them
together, it didn't always

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.433
sound as natural as
we wanted it to be.

01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:43.533
So, this year we have
taken a huge step forward

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:46.066
using cutting edge Machine
Learning called Neural

01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:49.533
Text to Speech where for
the first time ever, the

01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:53.133
voice you hear is entirely
generated by software.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:56.666
As a result, it's more
- it has more natural

01:00:56.733 --> 01:00:58.900
cadence and
better emphasis.

01:00:58.966 --> 01:01:01.133
It's most noticeable when
Siri is speaking longer or

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.933
more complex sentences.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.900
Let's have a listen
together starting with iOS 12.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.666
>> SIRI: Absolute zero is
the lowest limit of the

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:13.400
thermodynamic temperature
scale, a state at which

01:01:13.466 --> 01:01:15.599
the enthalpy and entropy
of a cooled ideal gas

01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:18.366
reach their minimum
value taken as zero.

01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:20.166
>> STACEY LYSIK: All right.

01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:21.766
So, that's okay.

01:01:21.833 --> 01:01:26.366
But now let's try iOS
13 with Neural Text to Speech.

01:01:28.866 --> 01:01:30.766
>> SIRI: Absolute zero is
the lowest limit of the

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:33.166
thermodynamic temperature
scale, a state at which

01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:35.666
the enthalpy and entropy
of a cooled ideal gas

01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:38.633
reach their minimum
value taken as zero.

01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:40.766
>> STACEY LYSIK:
Way better.

01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:42.633
Way better.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.233
(Applause)

01:01:47.966 --> 01:01:51.333
So, that's Siri along with AirPods, HomePod and CarPlay.

01:01:51.633 --> 01:01:52.133
Thank you.

01:01:52.199 --> 01:01:53.166
Back to you, Craig.

01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:00.866
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Stacey.

01:02:00.933 --> 01:02:05.833
So, that's our next big
release of iOS, iOS 13,

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.266
and there is so much we
didn't have time to talk

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:12.066
about, like the ability
to deal with call spam by

01:02:12.133 --> 01:02:15.033
sending unknown callers
directly to voice mail.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.000
Yes.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.199
(Applause)

01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:20.000
Or low data mode or for
our enterprise customers,

01:02:20.066 --> 01:02:22.666
the ability to single sign
on to enterprise accounts

01:02:22.733 --> 01:02:25.366
and have separate iCloud
accounts for your personal

01:02:25.433 --> 01:02:26.933
and work lives.

01:02:27.133 --> 01:02:28.666
(Applause)

01:02:32.733 --> 01:02:34.500
So, you may notice there
has been one thing missing

01:02:34.566 --> 01:02:38.400
from the iOS 13 story
and that's iPad.

01:02:38.466 --> 01:02:39.666
Yes.

01:02:39.866 --> 01:02:41.433
(Applause)

01:02:42.233 --> 01:02:44.366
Now, from the beginning,
iPad has been built on the

01:02:44.433 --> 01:02:47.566
technical foundations of
iOS, so, of course, it

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:50.366
gets all of these great
new features that we are

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.800
bringing to iPhone.

01:02:51.966 --> 01:02:54.900
But over the years, iPad
has also evolved into

01:02:54.966 --> 01:02:56.833
something unique.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.266
You know, with its giant
canvas and powerful

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:02.633
features like slide over
and split view, drag and

01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:06.033
drop and Apple Pencil,
iPad delivers an

01:03:06.099 --> 01:03:08.099
experience that
is truly distinct.

01:03:08.966 --> 01:03:12.199
We have some big changes
coming to iPad this year

01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:15.966
and the time has come to
recognize the platform in

01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:17.599
a special way.

01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:19.133
Let's take a look.

01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:27.099
(Music)

01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:50.800
(Applause)

01:03:52.133 --> 01:03:55.566
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
That's right.

01:03:55.633 --> 01:03:58.599
We are calling it iPad OS
and I would like to give

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.266
you a first look.

01:04:05.766 --> 01:04:08.833
So, let's take a
look at iPad OS.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.366
Swipe home and the first
thing you notice is this

01:04:11.433 --> 01:04:13.466
tighter grid of icons,
letting you have more

01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:16.633
tools at your disposal
right on your Home screen.

01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:19.766
But what I think is super
cool is watch what happens

01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:21.699
when I swipe over.

01:04:21.766 --> 01:04:25.533
I can now pin my Widgets
right on my Home screen.

01:04:25.966 --> 01:04:27.366
(Applause)

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:30.199
It's gorgeous.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.933
You get a lot of
information at a glance.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:33.566
Let's turn to
multitasking.

01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.766
Let's start
with slide over.

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:38.400
Launch into Safari and
let's just slide over from

01:04:38.466 --> 01:04:40.266
the right-hand
side of the screen.

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:42.133
You can see I have
messages there right now.

01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:44.500
Now, I can, of course,
change the app I have

01:04:44.566 --> 01:04:45.566
in slide over.

01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:49.233
I can just pick up
Reminders and drag it on over.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.166
Now, I have Reminders in
slide over so next time I

01:04:52.233 --> 01:04:54.933
slide out, of course,
there is Reminders.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.099
But what if I want to get
back to the last app?

01:04:57.166 --> 01:04:59.066
Could we make
that super easy?

01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:00.300
The answer is yes.

01:05:00.466 --> 01:05:02.699
I can just drag from the
bottom and they fan out

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:04.000
just like that.

01:05:04.366 --> 01:05:05.333
(Applause)

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.566
With just a tap,
I can switch apps.

01:05:08.633 --> 01:05:11.233
I can even just slide
along the bottom to move

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.166
quickly between my
apps in slide over.

01:05:14.233 --> 01:05:15.366
It's really great.

01:05:17.266 --> 01:05:20.400
Now, next, I would like
to talk about Split View

01:05:20.466 --> 01:05:23.300
because now we are
bringing multiwindow

01:05:23.366 --> 01:05:26.366
capabilities to
apps on iPad.

01:05:26.433 --> 01:05:29.133
For instance, I have a
single note right here in

01:05:29.199 --> 01:05:31.033
Notes, but what with I
want to have two notes

01:05:31.099 --> 01:05:32.800
side by side?

01:05:32.866 --> 01:05:34.300
Well, now I can.

01:05:34.366 --> 01:05:39.833
I can tap, drag, and now
I have a split with two notes.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.300
(Applause)

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.500
Now, I can use this across
spaces as well, so here I

01:05:48.566 --> 01:05:50.266
have two notes, but here
I have a Pages document.

01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:51.800
What if I have some notes
I want to use while

01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:53.533
working on my
Pages document?

01:05:53.599 --> 01:05:56.266
Well, I am just going to
slide on over, pick up

01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:59.566
another note, and I can
just move back to my Pages

01:05:59.633 --> 01:06:02.933
space and drop
it over there.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.800
Now, I have Pages
right next to Notes.

01:06:06.033 --> 01:06:08.766
Now that I have notes in
all of these different spaces,

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:10.800
well, you can guess
how I can find them, right?

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:13.966
I just bring up the dock,
tap on Notes, and we have

01:06:14.033 --> 01:06:17.066
app exposé now on iPad.

01:06:17.133 --> 01:06:22.099
Here are all of my Notes
spaces in one place.

01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:25.266
Now, this just doesn't
work for system apps.

01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:27.866
It also works for third
party apps as well.

01:06:27.933 --> 01:06:31.000
So, in addition to Notes
here and Pages, I can have

01:06:31.066 --> 01:06:34.533
two Microsoft Word
documents side by side.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:36.433
I mean, that's
enterprising right there.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.866
(Laughter)

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:40.733
And it works great for
some of the work flows in

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.066
apps like Mail.

01:06:42.133 --> 01:06:44.066
So, for instance, let's
say I want to reply to

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:47.533
this message from Phil.

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:50.099
Well, I can just of course
start typing to Phil and

01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:52.900
then I realize, you know,
I would actually like to draw

01:06:52.966 --> 01:06:55.900
on some of my other contents
of my inbox for this reply.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.800
I can drag that compose
window off to the side

01:06:58.866 --> 01:07:03.233
into Split View, even
create a split so I can

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.033
see all of my messages.

01:07:05.099 --> 01:07:07.333
I can tap through
these other messages.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.633
If I find an image I want
to put to my message to

01:07:09.699 --> 01:07:13.566
Phil, just tap, drag it
out just like that, and

01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:15.300
check this out; if there
is a link I want to

01:07:15.366 --> 01:07:17.099
preview, just
tap and hold.

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.533
I get a preview
of that web page.

01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:20.300
That looks
perfect for Phil.

01:07:20.366 --> 01:07:23.033
Just drop it right in
here just like that.

01:07:23.099 --> 01:07:26.500
Better composing through
multitasking on iPad.

01:07:26.566 --> 01:07:29.566
And that's a quick look at
the new Home screen and

01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:32.166
new Multitasking in iPad OS.

01:07:32.766 --> 01:07:34.000
(Applause)

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.900
But there is a lot more.

01:07:39.966 --> 01:07:42.199
Let's start with Files.

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:45.099
Now, browsing in Files,
of course, you have

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:48.000
icon view, list view.

01:07:48.066 --> 01:07:50.966
Well, how about
column view?

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:54.733
Great for digging through
deep file hierarchies.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.900
You get a great file
preview right here and

01:07:57.966 --> 01:08:01.300
quick actions for things
like rotating documents -

01:08:01.366 --> 01:08:05.599
images, making PDFs, and
great rich metadata right

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.633
at the bottom.

01:08:06.933 --> 01:08:09.566
Now, we are also improving the way that you can share files.

01:08:09.633 --> 01:08:13.533
For instance, in iCloud Drive, we now support folder sharing.

01:08:14.199 --> 01:08:16.066
(Applause)

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.033
And get this; we also have
built in support for SMB

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.233
file sharing so you can
share from your work PC,

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.666
home PC, right
in the files.

01:08:31.198 --> 01:08:34.233
Now, there is one more.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.698
That's right, you can now
plug in a thumb drive.

01:08:36.966 --> 01:08:38.500
(Applause)

01:08:42.666 --> 01:08:46.198
So, thumb drives, external
disk drives and SD cards,

01:08:46.265 --> 01:08:49.399
all show up right in the
Files app, but now this

01:08:49.466 --> 01:08:50.832
one is really great too.

01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:52.966
Sometimes when you are
working with a camera, you

01:08:53.033 --> 01:08:54.933
would like to import
directly into an app like

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.433
Light Room and
now you can.

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:58.600
(Applause)

01:09:01.966 --> 01:09:03.899
Of course, there
is much, much more.

01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:07.166
It's a huge year for Files
this year, and it's also a

01:09:07.233 --> 01:09:09.765
huge year for Safari.

01:09:10.366 --> 01:09:13.133
You know, Safari is just
the perfect device for

01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:14.666
browsing the Internet.

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:16.666
It's like holding the web
in your hands and this

01:09:16.733 --> 01:09:19.332
year we are making Safari
more capable than ever.

01:09:20.033 --> 01:09:22.198
When you look at the Web
today, it's often split

01:09:22.265 --> 01:09:24.166
into kind of two
big categories.

01:09:24.233 --> 01:09:27.433
On the one hand, you have
the mobile Web designed

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.265
for the small screen
and mobile devices, and

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.332
desktop sites that are
designed for large screens

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.765
like on your Mac.

01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:37.300
And often, websites will
serve up the wrong thing

01:09:37.366 --> 01:09:39.066
for the iPad.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:42.265
Well, no more because we
are bringing desktop class

01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:45.698
browsing to
Safari on iPad.

01:09:45.966 --> 01:09:47.698
(Applause)

01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:53.033
Now, with this, Safari
does all of the heavy

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.933
lifting, so instead of the
mobile site, you will see

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.766
the desktop site but it
will be sized perfectly

01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:59.466
for the iPad display
and have automatically

01:09:59.533 --> 01:10:02.000
optimized for touch input.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:07.166
Now, this also works great
for apps like Google Docs,

01:10:07.233 --> 01:10:09.100
Square Space
and Word Press.

01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:11.933
They all work great in
Safari now and the desktop

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.633
class experience
doesn't stop there.

01:10:14.699 --> 01:10:17.166
We are also bringing
a download manager to Safari.

01:10:17.766 --> 01:10:19.266
(Applause)

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:25.633
Thirty new keyboard
shortcuts and much, much more.

01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:29.166
Next, I want to
talk about fonts.

01:10:29.233 --> 01:10:31.033
Now, we all know that
fonts bring out the

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.100
personality of a project,
and this year we are

01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:38.699
giving you a new way to
use custom fonts inside of

01:10:38.766 --> 01:10:41.466
your favorite apps.

01:10:42.366 --> 01:10:43.733
You will be able to
download them right from

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.033
the App Store.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.500
We are working with all
of the major providers of fonts.

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.600
Next, we are taking a
big leap forward in text

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:57.466
editing, making it even faster with the power of Multi Touch.

01:10:57.533 --> 01:10:59.866
So, navigating long
documents, you can now

01:10:59.933 --> 01:11:02.966
grab the scroll indicator
and jump anywhere in the

01:11:03.033 --> 01:11:04.566
document instantly.

01:11:04.733 --> 01:11:06.899
(Applause)

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.300
Now, moving the cursor
is easier than ever.

01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:14.866
Just pick it up, and drag
it where you want it to go.

01:11:15.466 --> 01:11:18.699
And selecting text, just
put your finger down and

01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:21.633
drag out a selection.

01:11:21.699 --> 01:11:24.000
There is no need to double
tap and no magnifying

01:11:24.066 --> 01:11:26.300
glass getting in your way.

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:27.566
And yeah.

01:11:27.633 --> 01:11:30.500
And when you have a
selection, check this out,

01:11:30.566 --> 01:11:34.066
you want to copy or cut,
just a three-finger pinch

01:11:34.133 --> 01:11:37.833
to copy, and a
three-finger spread to

01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:39.800
plop it right down.

01:11:39.866 --> 01:11:42.000
This works across
all sorts of apps.

01:11:42.433 --> 01:11:43.600
(Applause)

01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.933
And if you make a mistake,
don't worry, just a

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.233
three-finger
swipe to undo.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.866
No more shaking that iPad.

01:11:53.233 --> 01:11:54.733
(Applause)

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.133
Finally, I would like to
talk about Apple Pencil.

01:12:00.199 --> 01:12:02.933
Apple Pencil has quickly
become an indispensable

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.066
tool for so
many iPad users.

01:12:05.133 --> 01:12:07.699
It's just perfect for
marking up documents,

01:12:07.766 --> 01:12:10.366
taking notes or
doing illustration.

01:12:10.633 --> 01:12:12.899
A critical part of
that experience is the

01:12:12.966 --> 01:12:15.666
incredible low latency
of Apple Pencil.

01:12:15.733 --> 01:12:17.533
You know, our goal
was to have it just be

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.633
indistinguishable for
making marks on a physical

01:12:19.699 --> 01:12:21.199
piece of paper.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.266
Now, Apple Pencil already
leads the industry with a

01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:27.699
record low twenty
millisecond latency, but

01:12:27.766 --> 01:12:30.266
we have been optimizing
and advancing our

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:33.066
prediction algorithms and
today we are bringing that

01:12:33.133 --> 01:12:37.199
latency down to
9 milliseconds.

01:12:37.266 --> 01:12:38.233
It's incredible.

01:12:38.533 --> 01:12:40.266
(Applause)

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:45.133
Now, of course, an
important part of your

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:47.966
experience using your
Pencil is a great tool

01:12:48.033 --> 01:12:52.199
palette and a great set of
tools, and so now in iPad OS,

01:12:52.266 --> 01:12:54.966
we have redesigned it
and we are providing a

01:12:55.033 --> 01:12:58.766
PencilKit developer API so
third-party apps can have

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.033
the same great experience.

01:13:02.166 --> 01:13:05.033
We have also made it a lot
easier to markup anything

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.333
on any app.

01:13:06.399 --> 01:13:08.300
You can just drag your
pencil up from the corner

01:13:08.366 --> 01:13:10.766
of the screen and just
like that you are you

01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:12.000
are in markup.

01:13:12.066 --> 01:13:14.500
You can markup a
screenshot or even an

01:13:14.566 --> 01:13:16.433
entire document.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.266
This works just great
throughout the system.

01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:22.699
Now, to show you Pencil in
action, I would like to

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:25.433
invite up Toby Paterson,
our Senior Director in

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.933
charge of the iPad system
experience, to give you a demo.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:29.666
Toby.

01:13:29.833 --> 01:13:33.133
(Applause)

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.566
>> TOBY PATERSON:
Thanks, Craig.

01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:37.500
Okay.

01:13:37.566 --> 01:13:39.033
Well, let's jump into
Notes here and take a look

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.166
at the new text
editing gestures.

01:13:41.633 --> 01:13:44.333
It begins with a tap to
place the cursor up there

01:13:44.399 --> 01:13:46.866
at the top of the screen,
and then to move the

01:13:46.933 --> 01:13:50.966
cursor, we will just grab
it with your finger, oops

01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:53.133
- grab it with your
finger, put it exactly

01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:54.500
where you want it.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.800
Now, for typing, there is
the standard keyboard, of

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:59.233
course, but watch what
happens when I pinch on it

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.033
with two fingers.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.399
It shrinks down to a new
compact layout and this is

01:14:04.466 --> 01:14:06.866
really great for typing
with one finger or your

01:14:06.933 --> 01:14:09.100
thumb while you're
holding your iPad.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.000
(Applause)

01:14:10.199 --> 01:14:10.800
I know.

01:14:10.866 --> 01:14:11.566
I do this a lot.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.866
And you can use
quick path here.

01:14:13.933 --> 01:14:16.800
Oops.

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:18.466
Just like that.

01:14:18.533 --> 01:14:20.133
Now, to select text, just
hold your finger on a

01:14:20.199 --> 01:14:26.766
word, sorry.

01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:28.100
Hold your finger on a word
and just drag it out like

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:31.899
that and our new gestures
make text editing a breeze.

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.399
It's a three-finger pinch,
once to copy or twice in a

01:14:35.466 --> 01:14:38.666
row to cut, and then a
three finger drop gesture

01:14:38.733 --> 01:14:40.800
to paste it into
place like that.

01:14:41.533 --> 01:14:41.966
Now to -

01:14:42.199 --> 01:14:43.466
(Applause)

01:14:43.633 --> 01:14:44.699
It's really easy.

01:14:44.766 --> 01:14:48.100
Now, to undo your
gestures, or to undo your

01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:49.666
changes, I want to
reassure you, you can

01:14:49.733 --> 01:14:52.133
still shake your iPad if
you want, but I do find

01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:55.533
the three-finger swipe
to the left a little bit easier.

01:14:55.933 --> 01:14:57.366
I also want to note that
these gestures are not

01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:59.399
limited to text
editing only.

01:14:59.466 --> 01:15:01.933
They will work in any
application that supports

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.366
copy/paste, undo and redo.

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:05.766
Okay.

01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:08.333
Let's switch now and
talk about the pencil.

01:15:08.399 --> 01:15:10.733
So, you can see here at
the tool palette with its

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.399
beautiful new design, the
new tools, and now you can

01:15:13.466 --> 01:15:15.899
drag it around the
screen like this.

01:15:15.966 --> 01:15:18.666
You can pin it to any
edge of the screen, you

01:15:18.733 --> 01:15:21.366
minimize it down in the
bottom like that, and then

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:24.399
with a tap or a drag,
open it back up again.

01:15:25.633 --> 01:15:27.800
Now, of course, Notes has
been tailor made to work

01:15:27.866 --> 01:15:29.633
really well with the
Pencil, but you can

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:32.366
actually use this to
markup any application on

01:15:32.433 --> 01:15:34.033
the - on your iPad.

01:15:34.466 --> 01:15:36.199
Let's switch over to
Safari here and I will

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:37.966
show you how this works.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.833
So, Craig has put me
in charge of the next

01:15:39.899 --> 01:15:42.666
software offsite and I
want to share an idea with him.

01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:44.133
So, check this out.

01:15:44.466 --> 01:15:46.500
Watch as I drag from the
corner of the iPad with my

01:15:46.566 --> 01:15:48.866
Pencil like this.

01:15:48.933 --> 01:15:51.300
It takes you right into
markup where you can see a

01:15:51.366 --> 01:15:54.566
screenshot of exactly
what you were looking at.

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:56.833
But many apps can now
support a new full-page

01:15:56.899 --> 01:16:00.066
capture mode which you select with this button at the top.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.866
Here you can see the
entire document that you

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:04.500
were looking at.

01:16:04.566 --> 01:16:06.600
You can scroll through it
or use the side bar on the

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:09.800
right to quickly navigate
and as you would expect,

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:14.533
you can mark it up with
your pencil just like this.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.399
I will bet we've got a few
Rush fans in the crowd

01:16:17.466 --> 01:16:17.699
here today, I think.

01:16:17.766 --> 01:16:18.500
(Applause)

01:16:18.566 --> 01:16:19.866
Yes.

01:16:19.933 --> 01:16:22.466
I think Craig would make
a great Alex Lifeson.

01:16:22.933 --> 01:16:24.866
Now, when you're done,
just bring up the share

01:16:24.933 --> 01:16:27.533
sheet and you can send it
off right from here and

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.533
that's how you can easily
markup anything on your iPad.

01:16:30.966 --> 01:16:32.133
Back to you now, Craig.

01:16:32.199 --> 01:16:33.199
Thank you.

01:16:33.633 --> 01:16:35.133
(Applause)

01:16:37.733 --> 01:16:38.833
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Toby.

01:16:38.899 --> 01:16:40.699
Those are some great
improvements to Apple

01:16:40.766 --> 01:16:44.166
Pencil and so much
more for iPad OS.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.600
There are a ton of great
new features that take

01:16:46.666 --> 01:16:49.399
iPad OS to the next level.

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:52.033
Well, that's what
I have for you now.

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.199
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.

01:16:53.266 --> 01:16:54.133
Thank you so much.

01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:57.000
(Applause)

01:16:59.399 --> 01:17:02.333
>> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Craig.

01:17:02.399 --> 01:17:05.333
These are just blow
away huge releases.

01:17:05.399 --> 01:17:08.800
iPad OS built on the
foundation of iOS takes

01:17:08.866 --> 01:17:12.733
the distinctive experience
of iPad even further.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:18.000
In a powerful new version
of iOS, iOS 13, we can't

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.166
wait for all of you to
get your hands on these

01:17:20.233 --> 01:17:23.266
great new releases.

01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:26.633
Now, let's turn
to the Mac.

01:17:26.966 --> 01:17:29.199
(Applause)

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:34.899
We love the Mac and
our customers do too.

01:17:34.966 --> 01:17:37.966
In fact, the Mac is the
number one in customer

01:17:38.033 --> 01:17:40.500
satisfaction by far
in the industry.

01:17:41.399 --> 01:17:44.066
People use their Macs to
create amazing things,

01:17:44.133 --> 01:17:46.966
simply and powerfully.

01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:50.300
We have the strongest Mac
lineup we have ever had,

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:52.533
from the new MacBook Air
all the way up to the

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.066
power house iMac Pro.

01:17:55.133 --> 01:17:59.033
And for Mac users looking
to really push the limits

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.300
of performance, there
is one more spot in our

01:18:03.366 --> 01:18:07.166
lineup that the team has been working really hard to fill.

01:18:07.399 --> 01:18:08.366
(Applause)

01:18:09.366 --> 01:18:12.266
Yes.

01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:16.000
To create a product that
will take Mac further than

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:19.800
it's ever gone before
and I am so excited and

01:18:19.866 --> 01:18:22.733
thrilled to show
it to you now.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.266
(Applause)

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:36.133
(Music)

01:19:09.433 --> 01:19:11.899
(Applause)

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:35.566
>> TIM COOK: This is the new MacPro and it's incredible.

01:19:35.766 --> 01:19:37.699
(Applause)

01:19:39.366 --> 01:19:43.533
It has a truly gorgeous
design and remarkable

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.300
performance to match.

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:50.333
It is the most powerful
Mac we have ever created.

01:19:50.399 --> 01:19:52.933
And to tell you all about
it, I would like to invite

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.733
John Ternus to the stage.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.233
John.

01:19:56.433 --> 01:19:58.133
(Applause)

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.866
>> JOHN TERNUS:
Thank you, Tim.

01:20:02.933 --> 01:20:07.266
I am so excited to be able to tell you about this new MacPro.

01:20:07.333 --> 01:20:08.899
Now, in designing this
product, we wanted to

01:20:08.966 --> 01:20:11.266
build an architecture that
could meet the incredible

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:14.033
diversity of pro needs,
a system that offers

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.699
virtually unlimited
possibilities for customization.

01:20:17.766 --> 01:20:20.033
And key to this is a
simple and elegant

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.633
solution for accessing
the internal components.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.933
Now, inside you will find
a stainless steel frame

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.833
that forms a strong
internal structure for the

01:20:27.899 --> 01:20:30.833
entire system and it
provides a foundation for

01:20:30.899 --> 01:20:33.733
modularity and
flexibility.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.399
The frame also
incorporates stainless

01:20:35.466 --> 01:20:36.466
steel handles.

01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:38.199
They feel great in your
hand and they make it easy

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.500
to move the system around.

01:20:39.733 --> 01:20:42.466
All of the internal
modules mount to this

01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:46.033
frame which means users
have 360-degree access to

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.199
easily configure
components and every sub

01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:51.833
system has been optimized
for performance.

01:20:52.733 --> 01:20:55.233
So, let's start
with the processor.

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:57.333
Now, we have designed
this new MacPro for our

01:20:57.399 --> 01:20:59.233
customers who need
the ultimate in CPU

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.133
performance for tasks like
production rendering or

01:21:02.199 --> 01:21:04.266
playing back hundreds of
virtual instruments or

01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:07.500
simulating an iOS app on
multiple devices at once.

01:21:07.566 --> 01:21:10.466
So, we are using a
brand-new Intel Xeon

01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:14.366
Processor and it has up
to twenty-eight cores.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.533
(Applause)

01:21:21.233 --> 01:21:23.266
And to get every last
ounce of performance out

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:26.566
of this processor, we are
giving it over 300 watts

01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:29.899
of power and a massive heat
sink for cooling so this means

01:21:29.966 --> 01:21:33.033
it can run fully
unconstrained all of the time.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.300
Now, we also have an
extremely high-performance

01:21:36.366 --> 01:21:37.433
memory architecture.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.899
Six channels of super fast
ECC memory in 12 DIMM

01:21:40.966 --> 01:21:45.600
slots enable an incredible
1.5 terabytes of system memory.

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.366
(Applause)

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.433
Now, let's talk
about expansion.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.033
Many of our pro customers
need to add things like

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.933
fiber channel or audio
DPSs or SDI video to their

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.600
systems, so we are
bringing PCI expansion

01:22:02.666 --> 01:22:04.800
back to the Mac
in a big way.

01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:06.300
(Applause)

01:22:08.566 --> 01:22:12.666
Because this new MacPro
has eight internal PCI slots.

01:22:14.399 --> 01:22:19.266
There are four double wide
slots and three single

01:22:19.333 --> 01:22:21.066
wide slots, and there is
one additional half-length

01:22:21.133 --> 01:22:23.500
slot that we populate
with an I/O card.

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.566
Now, this I/O card has two
Thunderbolt 3 ports, two

01:22:26.633 --> 01:22:29.600
USB-A ports and an audio
jack and there are also

01:22:29.666 --> 01:22:32.333
two more Thunderbolt 3
ports conveniently located

01:22:32.399 --> 01:22:33.699
on the top of the system.

01:22:33.899 --> 01:22:37.233
And finally, the MacPro
has two built-in 10

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.033
gigabit ethernet ports.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.666
So, one of the most
critical areas of

01:22:42.733 --> 01:22:44.833
expansion is graphics.

01:22:44.899 --> 01:22:47.566
Graphics performance is so
important for tasks like

01:22:47.633 --> 01:22:51.600
animating 3D film assets
or compositing 8K scenes

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:54.733
or building complex 3D
environments, but we

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.833
wanted to go beyond the
typical graphics card

01:22:56.899 --> 01:22:59.766
design so we've invented
something completely new.

01:23:00.533 --> 01:23:03.000
Now, it starts with an
industry standard PCI

01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:05.199
connector, so the slot
maintains compatibility

01:23:05.266 --> 01:23:06.866
with standard cards.

01:23:06.933 --> 01:23:09.433
We have added a second
connector that allows us

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.133
to integrate Thunderbolt
throughout the entire system

01:23:12.199 --> 01:23:14.633
and provide a tremendous
amount of extra power.

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:18.233
In fact, at 500 watts,
this module has the same

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:22.066
power capacity as the entire previous generation MacPro.

01:23:22.133 --> 01:23:25.199
And instead of adding its
own dedicated fan, we have

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.766
a huge heat sink that's
quietly cooled by the

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:29.333
MacPro thermal system.

01:23:30.033 --> 01:23:33.133
We call this the MacPro
expansion module or MPX

01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:35.600
for short, and using this
architecture we are going

01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:38.966
to offer multiple graphics
options, starting with the

01:23:39.033 --> 01:23:42.100
Radeon Pro 580X, a great
all-around graphics card.

01:23:42.733 --> 01:23:45.300
For a big upgrade in
graphics performance, the

01:23:45.366 --> 01:23:48.899
MacPro can be configured
with AMD's Radeon Pro Vega II.

01:23:48.966 --> 01:23:52.266
Vega II delivers 14
teraflops of graphics

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:55.166
compute and 32 gigabytes
of memory with an insane

01:23:55.233 --> 01:23:58.233
1 terabyte per second
of memory bandwidth.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.266
But we didn't stop there
because with the increased

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:02.966
head room of the MPX
module, we can actually

01:24:03.033 --> 01:24:06.966
use two Vega II GPUs for
double the teraflops,

01:24:07.033 --> 01:24:10.866
double the memory and
double the memory bandwidth.

01:24:10.933 --> 01:24:13.233
This is quite simply
the world's most

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.933
powerful graphics card.

01:24:22.366 --> 01:24:25.600
Now, these two GPUs are
connected by the Infinity

01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:27.233
Fabric Link which allows
data transfer between them

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.033
at five times faster
than the PCI BUS.

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.033
This is a really big
deal for apps that are

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.533
optimized to take
advantage of multiple GPUs.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.266
And if all of this wasn't
crazy enough, the MacPro

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:40.033
can be configured with
two of these modules.

01:24:40.399 --> 01:24:42.166
(Applause)

01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:46.100
Enabling up to 56
teraflops and 128

01:24:46.166 --> 01:24:48.000
gigabytes of high
bandwidth memory.

01:24:48.066 --> 01:24:50.100
This is an unbelievable
amount of graphics compute

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:51.600
in a single workstation.

01:24:52.766 --> 01:24:55.466
Now, we have also done
something really special

01:24:55.533 --> 01:24:56.366
for video editing.

01:24:56.433 --> 01:24:58.300
One of the challenges in
working with high quality

01:24:58.366 --> 01:25:00.533
cameras is the need to
convert the native files

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.966
into proxies for
easier editing.

01:25:03.033 --> 01:25:05.966
This is a time consuming
and error prone process.

01:25:06.466 --> 01:25:08.266
Being able to work
directly with the native

01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:09.966
formats would be a game
changer in these high end

01:25:10.033 --> 01:25:13.366
work flows so we have
built a brand-new card

01:25:13.433 --> 01:25:15.833
that we call Afterburner
and it turns your MacPro

01:25:15.899 --> 01:25:18.266
into a monster of a
video editing machine.

01:25:19.166 --> 01:25:21.600
Afterburner is a hardware
accelerator card that is

01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:23.933
built with an FPGA which
is a programmable ASIC and

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.833
this ASIC is capable of
processing 6 billion

01:25:27.899 --> 01:25:29.100
pixels per second.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.466
(Applause)

01:25:35.133 --> 01:25:36.933
So, with this custom
solution, we have achieved

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.833
an unprecedented level of
performance for the ProRes

01:25:39.899 --> 01:25:42.366
and ProRes RAW codecs.

01:25:42.433 --> 01:25:44.800
The most powerful
workstations in the world

01:25:44.866 --> 01:25:47.133
today struggle to play
back just one stream of 8K

01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:49.066
video, but with
Afterburner, the new

01:25:49.133 --> 01:25:51.966
MacPro can play back an
incredible three streams

01:25:52.033 --> 01:25:53.766
of 8K Pro Res RAW.

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:56.233
(Applause)

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.633
Or 12 streams of 4K.

01:26:02.233 --> 01:26:04.566
This is ground breaking
performance and it means

01:26:04.633 --> 01:26:07.433
we can finally say goodbye
to proxy workflows.

01:26:08.199 --> 01:26:10.366
Now, of course, all of
this compute requires a

01:26:10.433 --> 01:26:12.666
massive amount of power,
and so we have given every

01:26:12.733 --> 01:26:16.500
MacPro a 1.4 kilowatt
power supply.

01:26:18.866 --> 01:26:20.566
Of course, all of
that power requires a

01:26:20.633 --> 01:26:22.699
tremendously capable
cooling system.

01:26:22.766 --> 01:26:26.000
So, the MacPro has three
enormous fans and one

01:26:26.066 --> 01:26:29.199
blower that together can
generate up to 300 cubic

01:26:29.266 --> 01:26:32.199
feet per minute of air
flow and it's very quiet.

01:26:32.266 --> 01:26:34.133
In fact, when it's under
your desk in typical load

01:26:34.199 --> 01:26:36.133
conditions, it's as
quiet as an iMac Pro.

01:26:37.566 --> 01:26:39.500
To seal the thermal
system, the beautiful

01:26:39.566 --> 01:26:43.100
aluminum housing slides over the frame and latches into place.

01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:45.566
And its unique
three-dimensional vents

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:47.333
are actually machined on
both the internal and

01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:48.800
external surfaces.

01:26:48.866 --> 01:26:51.233
The resulting lightweight
lattice pattern maximizes

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.399
air flow while creating an
extremely rigid structure.

01:26:54.966 --> 01:26:58.233
And finally, optional
wheels make it easy to

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.399
move the MacPro
around your studio.

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:02.100
(Applause)

01:27:08.233 --> 01:27:10.699
As you can see, utility
and function define the

01:27:10.766 --> 01:27:13.399
design of the new MacPro,
and while the specs we

01:27:13.466 --> 01:27:15.266
have been talking about
are impressive, we have

01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:17.266
really been focused on
delivering real world

01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:19.566
performance where
it matters most.

01:27:19.633 --> 01:27:21.533
To do that, we have been
working closely with a

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.366
number of pro
app developers.

01:27:24.033 --> 01:27:26.433
This includes Adobe, Auto
Desk, Serif and Blackmagic

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:30.199
who are all announcing support for the new MacPro today.

01:27:30.266 --> 01:27:32.500
In fact, Blackmagic is
seeing some amazing

01:27:32.566 --> 01:27:33.933
performance gains.

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.833
With the Afterburner card
doing the heavy lifting of

01:27:35.899 --> 01:27:38.933
decoding video, they can
tap into the CPU and GPUs

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.766
to add effects and
coloring in real time on

01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:43.733
native 8K content.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.766
This is a work flow that
has never been possible

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.033
before the new MacPro.

01:27:47.933 --> 01:27:50.933
Side FX, Red, Epic
and Avid are also

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.466
announcing support today.

01:27:52.699 --> 01:27:54.899
(Applause)

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.699
Avid is taking advantage
of the incredible

01:27:57.766 --> 01:28:00.133
expansion capabilities of
the MacPro to do something

01:28:00.199 --> 01:28:02.800
never before possible in
a single work station.

01:28:03.833 --> 01:28:06.500
They are enabling support
for up to six HDX cards.

01:28:06.566 --> 01:28:08.966
This yields more I/O,
increased voices and two

01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:12.100
times the DSP processing than any other system can achieve.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.100
3D app developers like
Unity, Pixar, Foundry and

01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:19.566
Maxon are also
announcing support.

01:28:19.633 --> 01:28:23.233
Maxon is seeing 20% faster
GPU render performance in

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.266
Cinema 4D than on a
Windows work station maxed

01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:28.699
out with three of the
latest Nvidia Quadro cards.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.533
We are really excited to
announce that Maxon is

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.033
bringing their Redshift
render engine to the Mac

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.699
optimized for Metal.

01:28:37.266 --> 01:28:38.000
And finally -

01:28:38.266 --> 01:28:39.000
(Applause)

01:28:39.066 --> 01:28:40.100
There you go.

01:28:40.166 --> 01:28:42.399
The folks at Otoy are
already hard at work

01:28:42.466 --> 01:28:44.833
building a version of
Octane that is really

01:28:44.899 --> 01:28:47.199
going to shine with the
incredible GPU performance

01:28:47.266 --> 01:28:48.766
of the new MacPro.

01:28:49.933 --> 01:28:53.000
We are thrilled by the
excitement and commitment

01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:54.666
we are seeing from all of
these great developers.

01:28:54.733 --> 01:28:56.399
And, of course, our own
internal app teams are

01:28:56.466 --> 01:28:58.399
really excited about
the MacPro as well.

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.633
So, now, I would like to
bring up David Earl from

01:29:00.699 --> 01:29:02.866
our Pro X marketing team
to give you a firsthand

01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:04.766
look at some of the
amazing things you can do

01:29:04.833 --> 01:29:07.500
in Logic and Final
Cut on the new MacPro.

01:29:07.566 --> 01:29:08.533
David?

01:29:08.699 --> 01:29:09.466
(Applause)

01:29:13.566 --> 01:29:15.066
>> DAVID EARL:
Thanks, John.

01:29:15.133 --> 01:29:18.833
I am thrilled to show you
Logic Pro 10 running on

01:29:18.899 --> 01:29:19.633
the new MacPro.

01:29:19.699 --> 01:29:21.133
To get started, we are
going to open up this

01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:22.966
music score from a
documentary we are working

01:29:23.033 --> 01:29:24.266
on that was shot in Kenya.

01:29:24.733 --> 01:29:26.766
What you see here is a
Logic project and every

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:29.466
row is a track and every
track represents an

01:29:29.533 --> 01:29:31.733
individual musical
instrument performance.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.666
So, let's have a listen.

01:29:34.933 --> 01:29:36.100
(Music)

01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.100
Okay.

01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:45.133
So, we wanted to have some
fun and see just how far

01:29:45.199 --> 01:29:47.266
we could push this
powerful new Mac.

01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:49.166
What you are looking
at here is a brand-new

01:29:49.233 --> 01:29:51.300
version of Logic and the
theme of this release is

01:29:51.366 --> 01:29:53.600
all about performance.

01:29:53.666 --> 01:29:55.166
So, to show performance
I'm going to use these

01:29:55.233 --> 01:29:57.466
incredibly realistic
sampler instrument libraries.

01:29:57.533 --> 01:29:59.833
I use the libraries so
that it sounds exactly

01:29:59.899 --> 01:30:02.000
like a real orchestra
when I create my parts.

01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:04.033
So, let's add a 50
piece percussion ensemble

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.600
to the score.

01:30:07.899 --> 01:30:12.166
And you know what, how about
a 100-piece orchestra?

01:30:12.233 --> 01:30:14.800
And how about another full
orchestra just because,

01:30:14.866 --> 01:30:16.500
you know, we can.

01:30:21.033 --> 01:30:24.133
Now, many composers have
to actually add a second

01:30:24.199 --> 01:30:26.433
and third computer to be
able to run these massive

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.000
orchestral libraries, but
the new MacPro with CPU

01:30:29.066 --> 01:30:32.466
power and RAM can do this
all in a single unit.

01:30:33.433 --> 01:30:34.566
So, of course, I'm going
to need a lot more to

01:30:34.633 --> 01:30:36.433
push this MacPro.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.300
So, let's add a
ton more tracks.

01:30:39.366 --> 01:30:41.066
So, we have never seen
this before in Logic.

01:30:41.133 --> 01:30:46.166
I have got 300, 400, 500,
we can now have a thousand

01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:48.066
audio tracks and a
thousand software

01:30:48.133 --> 01:30:49.133
instruments in Logic.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.733
(Applause)

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:57.000
That's four times the
amount that we had in our

01:30:57.066 --> 01:30:59.633
previous version of Logic,
and, of course, with all

01:30:59.699 --> 01:31:02.066
of this going on we
have to check the CPU.

01:31:02.133 --> 01:31:05.266
Opening the performance
meter, that is 56 threads

01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:08.566
across 28 cores with more
tracks and plug-ins than

01:31:08.633 --> 01:31:10.899
we have ever seen
before in Logic.

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.066
The MacPro still
has power to spare.

01:31:13.133 --> 01:31:14.600
It's a monster
for running Logic.

01:31:15.933 --> 01:31:16.866
Okay.

01:31:16.933 --> 01:31:21.899
Now, let's take this music
score over to Final Cut.

01:31:21.966 --> 01:31:25.466
It's the Soundtrack for
this beautiful documentary

01:31:25.533 --> 01:31:27.899
that was all shot
and edited in HDR.

01:31:27.966 --> 01:31:29.633
It follows Ami Vitale.

01:31:29.699 --> 01:31:31.600
She is a world-renowned
photo journalist on a

01:31:31.666 --> 01:31:33.100
recent assignment to Kenya.

01:31:35.833 --> 01:31:38.399
Now, what we see here, we
have never seen before in a Mac.

01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:42.500
This is 8K ProRes RAW
playing back at full resolution.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.933
Now, what makes 8K so
amazing is that there are

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.133
over 33 million pixels in
every frame which means it

01:31:48.199 --> 01:31:50.600
looks great on a huge
display like this, but it

01:31:50.666 --> 01:31:52.733
includes enough resolution
that we can crop in and

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.199
reframe for 4K projects
and, you know, we can add

01:31:56.266 --> 01:31:59.899
8K effects in real-time
like this animated title,

01:31:59.966 --> 01:32:02.333
and I think I'm going
to go in and add some

01:32:02.399 --> 01:32:06.000
advanced color correction
and lens flare without stopping.

01:32:06.066 --> 01:32:07.699
I don't have to wait
for it to render.

01:32:09.333 --> 01:32:11.633
Now, so far we have been
watching a single stream

01:32:11.699 --> 01:32:15.033
of 8K ProRes RAW but this
computer has Afterburner

01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.600
installed which means we
can push it even further

01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:21.699
and we can have our single
stream of 8K ProRes RAW,

01:32:21.766 --> 01:32:26.800
add another stream of 8K
and how about a third

01:32:26.866 --> 01:32:29.866
stream 8K ProRes RAW
running simultaneously.

01:32:29.933 --> 01:32:32.300
That's 100 million pixels.

01:32:32.366 --> 01:32:34.366
This has never been seen.

01:32:35.033 --> 01:32:36.199
(Applause)

01:32:38.533 --> 01:32:40.733
Never been seen before on
any video editing software

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.466
on any computer.

01:32:42.533 --> 01:32:45.233
The MacPro is an 8K power
house and absolutely by

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.333
far the most powerful Mac
that's ever been created

01:32:48.399 --> 01:32:50.266
for professional film
makers and musicians.

01:32:50.333 --> 01:32:51.033
Thank you.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.133
Back to you, John.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.133
(Applause)

01:32:58.566 --> 01:32:59.966
>> JOHN TERNUS:
Thank you, David.

01:33:00.033 --> 01:33:01.466
That performance is nuts.

01:33:01.533 --> 01:33:03.366
So that is the new MacPro.

01:33:03.433 --> 01:33:05.566
It is the most
configurable, most

01:33:05.633 --> 01:33:09.833
expandable and by far the most powerful Mac we have ever made.

01:33:10.466 --> 01:33:12.300
But, of course, an
extraordinary computer

01:33:12.366 --> 01:33:15.566
deserves an extraordinary
display, and to tell you

01:33:15.633 --> 01:33:17.500
more about that, I would
like to bring out Colleen

01:33:17.566 --> 01:33:19.600
Novielli from the Mac
Product Marketing Team.

01:33:19.666 --> 01:33:20.500
Colleen?

01:33:20.666 --> 01:33:22.166
(Applause)

01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:26.300
>> COLLEEN NOVIELLI:
Thank you, John.

01:33:26.366 --> 01:33:28.500
Good morning.

01:33:28.566 --> 01:33:31.733
Displays are incredibly
important to our pro

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.566
customers because they
play a vital role in

01:33:34.633 --> 01:33:36.833
creating their
life's best work.

01:33:36.899 --> 01:33:40.366
Yet today, if you look at
their wish list, there is

01:33:40.433 --> 01:33:42.866
no single display that
gives them every feature

01:33:42.933 --> 01:33:47.266
they have asked for, and this one feature, High Dynamic Range

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:50.933
or HDR, it's increasingly requested because it's yet

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.199
to be delivered with
pro level precision.

01:33:53.699 --> 01:33:55.100
So, what is HDR?

01:33:55.166 --> 01:33:58.533
HDR is a way to bring
content to life by better

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.199
reflecting what the eye
can see in the real world.

01:34:01.266 --> 01:34:03.800
The eye sees the brightest
specular highlights,

01:34:03.866 --> 01:34:06.699
really dark blacks,
vibrant, rich color and

01:34:06.766 --> 01:34:08.133
all of the details
in between.

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:12.199
Today, more and more
devices can play HDR

01:34:12.266 --> 01:34:14.833
content so more and more
pros who create that

01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:17.733
content, they need
a great HDR display.

01:34:19.133 --> 01:34:21.566
There is one
class of displays.

01:34:21.633 --> 01:34:24.033
It's commonly called
reference monitors and

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.433
these do deliver true HDR
along with these features,

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:31.000
but they are still missing
these features and they

01:34:31.066 --> 01:34:32.966
are incredibly expensive.

01:34:33.033 --> 01:34:35.266
This one is $43,000.

01:34:35.333 --> 01:34:38.266
So, our goal,
it was simple.

01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:41.100
Make a display that
expertly delivers every

01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:43.000
feature that pros
have asked for.

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.033
Like the MacPro, the
design is stunning and

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:50.100
every element is
built for pros.

01:34:50.166 --> 01:34:52.500
And it's the most
incredible panel we

01:34:52.566 --> 01:34:54.366
have ever made.

01:34:54.433 --> 01:34:57.600
It's a 32-inch LCD display
with over 20 million

01:34:57.666 --> 01:35:02.066
pixels, and with 218
pixels per inch, it's a

01:35:02.133 --> 01:35:04.000
6K retina display.

01:35:04.233 --> 01:35:06.100
(Applause)

01:35:10.399 --> 01:35:13.233
It's the largest retina
display we have ever made.

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:16.933
It's over 40% larger than
the iMac 5K display,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.699
giving pros even more room for their tools and their content.

01:35:20.833 --> 01:35:25.399
It has P3 and true 10-bit color and reference modes built in.

01:35:25.466 --> 01:35:29.066
All expertly calibrated
at the factory.

01:35:29.133 --> 01:35:32.000
And we keep that color
accurate at a super wide

01:35:32.066 --> 01:35:35.066
viewing angle by using a
cutting-edge polarizer.

01:35:35.133 --> 01:35:37.466
For contrast, that's
twenty-five times better

01:35:37.533 --> 01:35:39.366
than a typical
LCD display.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.866
(Applause)

01:35:42.199 --> 01:35:43.100
It's awesome.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.666
Now, the cover glass has our industry leading antireflective

01:35:47.733 --> 01:35:50.466
coating, but for challenging lighting conditions,

01:35:50.533 --> 01:35:53.266
we have created an
innovative matte option.

01:35:54.433 --> 01:35:56.533
So, most matte displays,
they add a coating to the

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.600
glass and this coating, it
scatters the light, but it also

01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:03.866
adds unwanted haze and sparkle and it lowers the contrast.

01:36:03.933 --> 01:36:09.566
So instead, we precisely
etch the glass itself for

01:36:09.633 --> 01:36:11.666
a nano texture surface and
this means enhanced image

01:36:11.733 --> 01:36:14.166
quality and contrast along
with low reflectivity.

01:36:15.866 --> 01:36:20.566
Next, we have delivered HDR at a level never seen before.

01:36:20.633 --> 01:36:23.633
Now, for great HDR
images, you need extreme

01:36:23.699 --> 01:36:26.666
brightness right next to
extreme contrast or deep

01:36:26.733 --> 01:36:30.166
blacks, and this is
incredibly hard to achieve.

01:36:30.233 --> 01:36:32.399
So, we have designed a
back-lighting system like

01:36:32.466 --> 01:36:33.899
none other in the world.

01:36:35.399 --> 01:36:37.366
First, a large array
of blue LEDs generates

01:36:37.433 --> 01:36:39.866
extreme brightness.

01:36:39.933 --> 01:36:42.600
We calibrate every single
LED on every single

01:36:42.666 --> 01:36:45.566
display at the factory and
then this feeds a massive

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:50.966
algorithm and then this
modulates each LED based

01:36:51.033 --> 01:36:53.333
on the content rapidly.

01:36:53.399 --> 01:36:58.866
Then we use custom lenses
and reflectors to actually

01:36:58.933 --> 01:36:59.800
shape and precisely
control the light.

01:37:00.199 --> 01:37:02.266
Now, a typical thermal
system would make this

01:37:02.333 --> 01:37:05.800
impossible to achieve for
more than a few minutes.

01:37:05.866 --> 01:37:07.800
So, we did
something amazing.

01:37:07.866 --> 01:37:10.466
We designed the rear
lattice pattern to act as

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:13.066
a heat sink and this
doubles the surface area,

01:37:13.133 --> 01:37:16.300
quietly extracting
heat from each LED.

01:37:16.366 --> 01:37:19.266
The results are
incredible.

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:22.899
This display can maintain
1,000 nits of full screen

01:37:22.966 --> 01:37:24.899
brightness indefinitely.

01:37:25.366 --> 01:37:26.633
(Applause)

01:37:29.666 --> 01:37:32.199
Forever.

01:37:32.266 --> 01:37:34.666
And 1,600 nits peak.

01:37:34.733 --> 01:37:36.899
And this is going to allow
our pros to do things they

01:37:36.966 --> 01:37:38.899
have been dreaming about.

01:37:38.966 --> 01:37:42.833
So, for example, video
editors can now work with

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:46.133
their HDR content exactly
as it's intended and

01:37:46.199 --> 01:37:49.166
photographers can now edit
an amazing HDR image like

01:37:49.233 --> 01:37:51.699
this for hours.

01:37:51.766 --> 01:37:53.966
And that is not all.

01:37:54.033 --> 01:37:56.766
Those images are going to
have gorgeous, incredibly

01:37:56.833 --> 01:38:01.766
nuanced contrast, an
incredible one million to

01:38:01.833 --> 01:38:03.699
one contrast ratio.

01:38:04.333 --> 01:38:05.466
(Applause)

01:38:09.033 --> 01:38:12.133
The images this display
produces are truly stunning.

01:38:14.166 --> 01:38:17.500
With these capabilities,
we have taken this way

01:38:17.566 --> 01:38:19.199
beyond High Dynamic Range.

01:38:19.266 --> 01:38:23.633
This is extreme dynamic
range or XDR, and so we

01:38:23.699 --> 01:38:27.100
call this display
the Pro Display XDR.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.533
(Applause)

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.399
So now, we have delivered every feature on the pro wish list,

01:38:38.466 --> 01:38:40.133
but there is more.

01:38:40.199 --> 01:38:43.633
Thunderbolt 3 will provide
seamless one cable connectivity.

01:38:43.699 --> 01:38:45.833
So, with a 15-inch MacBook
Pro, you can have a

01:38:45.899 --> 01:38:50.000
stunning two display
desktop setup or with the

01:38:50.066 --> 01:38:52.333
new MacPro, you can
connect an incredible six

01:38:52.399 --> 01:38:58.266
displays with 6K
resolution, 120 million pixels.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.333
Yes.

01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:01.266
(Applause)

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.566
Woo.

01:39:04.166 --> 01:39:04.966
Yeah.

01:39:05.033 --> 01:39:06.233
Woo.

01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:07.966
That's right.

01:39:10.233 --> 01:39:12.600
Now, there is one more
feature that does not get

01:39:12.666 --> 01:39:15.100
much attention on other
displays and that's the

01:39:15.166 --> 01:39:18.733
stand which is as pro
as the display itself.

01:39:19.966 --> 01:39:22.800
First, it has an amazing
counter balancing arm that

01:39:22.866 --> 01:39:25.866
makes the display feel
virtually weightless.

01:39:25.933 --> 01:39:27.966
It provides tilt and
height adjustment and it

01:39:28.033 --> 01:39:31.133
maintains the display's
angle as it's raised or

01:39:31.199 --> 01:39:36.366
it's lowered and it has
rotation for Portrait Mode.

01:39:37.166 --> 01:39:37.566
Yes.

01:39:38.133 --> 01:39:39.833
(Applause)

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.500
And this is perfect
for retouching photos,

01:39:45.566 --> 01:39:48.399
designing a web page
or writing code.

01:39:48.466 --> 01:39:49.699
Yeah.

01:39:52.866 --> 01:39:55.166
And it's removable.

01:39:55.233 --> 01:39:57.466
It quickly detaches from
the display to pack it up

01:39:57.533 --> 01:39:59.199
and take it on location.

01:40:00.133 --> 01:40:02.533
And finally, for pros
with unique mounting

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.066
requirements, we have
designed a base amount

01:40:05.133 --> 01:40:07.666
adapter that attaches
in a matter of seconds.

01:40:09.333 --> 01:40:11.566
So, that's the new
Pro Display XDR.

01:40:11.633 --> 01:40:14.433
It's the only display in
the industry that delivers

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:18.166
every feature on a pro's
wish list and more.

01:40:18.233 --> 01:40:21.600
And now, all pros can use
the same display across

01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:25.566
the work flow and have
the same incredible XDR

01:40:25.633 --> 01:40:29.066
viewing experience with
all of the features they

01:40:29.133 --> 01:40:32.766
need to create their
life's best work, making

01:40:32.833 --> 01:40:36.000
this the world's
best Pro Display.

01:40:36.266 --> 01:40:37.266
And now back to you, John.

01:40:38.133 --> 01:40:39.500
(Applause)

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:48.866
>> JOHN TERNUS:
Thanks, Colleen.

01:40:48.933 --> 01:40:51.800
So that's the new MacPro
and Pro Display XDR.

01:40:51.866 --> 01:40:53.633
Groundbreaking in every
way, they deliver

01:40:53.699 --> 01:40:55.333
performance and
capabilities that will

01:40:55.399 --> 01:40:57.199
forever change
pro workflows.

01:40:58.066 --> 01:40:59.933
Now, the new MacPro is
going to start with an

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.500
eight core Xeon processor,
32 gigabytes of memory,

01:41:03.566 --> 01:41:07.533
Radeon Pro 580X and
a 256 gigabyte SSD.

01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.133
If you look at other
systems configured with

01:41:10.199 --> 01:41:13.699
comparable components, you will see they cost around $8,000.

01:41:13.766 --> 01:41:17.166
The new MacPro will
start at $5,999.

01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:19.300
(Applause)

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.800
And it's going to be
available this fall.

01:41:25.866 --> 01:41:27.866
Now, we know a lot of
customers who use the

01:41:27.933 --> 01:41:30.133
MacPro really want to be
able to rack mount them in

01:41:30.199 --> 01:41:31.833
edit bays and
machine rooms.

01:41:31.899 --> 01:41:33.833
So, to support this, we
are also going to have a

01:41:33.899 --> 01:41:36.133
version optimized
for rack deployment.

01:41:36.433 --> 01:41:38.899
(Applause)

01:41:42.733 --> 01:41:45.100
As for the Pro Display
XDR, well, the reference

01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:47.333
monitors that we talked
about can cost tens of

01:41:47.399 --> 01:41:50.133
thousands of dollars and still not match the feature set.

01:41:50.199 --> 01:41:53.633
The Pro Display XDR will be $4,999 for the display itself.

01:41:58.133 --> 01:42:01.600
And the nano texture
version will be $5,999.

01:42:01.666 --> 01:42:04.600
The VESA mount
adapter will be $199 and

01:42:04.666 --> 01:42:06.866
the pro stand, $999.

01:42:07.066 --> 01:42:10.466
And like the MacPro, they will all be available in the fall.

01:42:10.533 --> 01:42:14.399
So that is the new MacPro
and Pro Display XDR.

01:42:14.466 --> 01:42:15.866
Now, back to Tim.

01:42:20.933 --> 01:42:23.333
>> TIM COOK: Thank you.

01:42:23.399 --> 01:42:25.366
Thank you, John, and
thank you Colleen.

01:42:25.433 --> 01:42:29.066
We can't wait to get the
new MacPro and the Pro

01:42:29.133 --> 01:42:32.199
Display XDR into the hands
of our pro users and see

01:42:32.266 --> 01:42:34.166
all the great things they
are going to create with them.

01:42:35.333 --> 01:42:39.366
Now, powering the Mac
experience is macOS, the

01:42:39.433 --> 01:42:42.433
world's most advanced
desktop Operating System.

01:42:42.633 --> 01:42:44.633
(Applause)

01:42:47.233 --> 01:42:49.533
The latest release of
macOS is Mojave with

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.166
system-wide Dark Mode and
new features for both

01:42:52.233 --> 01:42:55.500
finder and desktop that
were inspired by pro users

01:42:55.566 --> 01:42:57.933
but designed for everyone.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.766
It's been a huge hit
with Mac customers.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.533
The next release of macOS
brings more exciting new

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.433
features to the Mac, and
to tell you all about it,

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.366
I'd like to invite Craig
back to the stage.

01:43:10.433 --> 01:43:11.266
Craig.

01:43:11.466 --> 01:43:13.333
(Applause)

01:43:17.699 --> 01:43:19.233
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: Great to be back with all of you again.

01:43:20.033 --> 01:43:22.366
So, for our next major
release of macOS, we are

01:43:22.433 --> 01:43:25.133
moving out of the desert
into the beautiful waters

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:28.399
off the California coast,
a place for sailing,

01:43:28.466 --> 01:43:30.933
diving and so much more.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.600
It's macOS Catalina.

01:43:33.766 --> 01:43:35.933
(Applause)

01:43:38.133 --> 01:43:40.566
Now, Catalina includes
cool new features, some

01:43:40.633 --> 01:43:43.399
really fresh new apps and
some powerful technology

01:43:43.466 --> 01:43:45.199
for Developers.

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.100
Let's take a look.

01:43:47.166 --> 01:43:49.466
We begin with iTunes.

01:43:49.533 --> 01:43:53.500
Now, iTunes started
completely focused, rip,

01:43:53.566 --> 01:43:56.500
mix, and burn
songs on your Mac.

01:43:56.566 --> 01:43:59.800
And then came the iTunes
Music Store kicking off

01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:03.033
the digital music
revolution.

01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:08.033
And then it took on Podcasts
and it redefined radio.

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:11.166
And then video,
introducing us to

01:44:11.233 --> 01:44:13.933
on-demand movies and
ad-free TV, and if that

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.233
weren't enough, it also
handled all of your

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:20.899
syncing, making possible
the first iPod and iPhones.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.133
Well, now, customers love
iTunes and everything it can do.

01:44:26.199 --> 01:44:29.666
But if there is one thing
we hear over and over,

01:44:29.733 --> 01:44:33.100
it's can iTunes
do even more?

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:36.233
I think it can.

01:44:36.666 --> 01:44:41.366
Like how about
Calendar in iTunes?

01:44:41.433 --> 01:44:43.766
I mean, you could have all
of your appointments and

01:44:43.833 --> 01:44:47.866
your best tracks
right in one app.

01:44:47.933 --> 01:44:48.866
Could we take it further?

01:44:48.933 --> 01:44:49.633
I think so.

01:44:49.699 --> 01:44:51.600
How about Mail in iTunes?

01:44:52.199 --> 01:44:53.066
(Applause)

01:44:53.266 --> 01:44:55.300
And maybe Safari
in iTunes?

01:44:55.366 --> 01:44:57.800
And how are you going to
switch between these apps?

01:44:57.866 --> 01:45:00.199
Well, of course you
will add a dock.

01:45:00.266 --> 01:45:01.533
I think we've nailed it.

01:45:01.933 --> 01:45:03.166
(Applause)

01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:14.633
"Truth Be Told" our
team had a better idea.

01:45:14.699 --> 01:45:18.333
The future of Apple Music
or iTunes at not one app

01:45:18.399 --> 01:45:24.233
but three, Apple Music,
Apple Podcasts and Apple TV.

01:45:25.066 --> 01:45:27.466
(Applause)

01:45:29.066 --> 01:45:31.166
Let's start with Apple
Music because Apple Music

01:45:31.233 --> 01:45:34.500
in Catalina is the best
music app we have ever made.

01:45:35.166 --> 01:45:38.699
With its singular focus on
music, it's so simple, but

01:45:38.766 --> 01:45:41.933
it has all of the powerful
music features you expect

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.199
from iTunes all while
being just blazingly fast.

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.766
It's the best place for
Apple Music subscribers,

01:45:48.833 --> 01:45:51.066
with personalized
recommendations from a

01:45:51.133 --> 01:45:54.100
catalog of over
50 million tracks.

01:45:54.433 --> 01:45:58.333
And for those of you that
use iTunes to sync, we

01:45:58.399 --> 01:46:00.866
made that experience
better as well because now

01:46:00.933 --> 01:46:05.033
when you plug in your
phone, this is what you see.

01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:06.166
Nothing.

01:46:06.366 --> 01:46:09.399
(Applause)

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.199
If you do want to sync,
you can find it in the side

01:46:16.266 --> 01:46:20.266
bar in finder; all of your
sync options are right there.

01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:23.866
(Applause)

01:46:24.133 --> 01:46:27.666
And next, let's turn our
attention to Podcast.

01:46:27.733 --> 01:46:29.933
It brings a dedicated
Podcast listening

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.733
experience to the Mac and
it features all of the

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:35.133
great features you are
used to in iOS, like

01:46:35.199 --> 01:46:37.800
listen now where you can
see new episodes and keep track

01:46:37.866 --> 01:46:41.100
of your listening across all
of your devices and it

01:46:41.166 --> 01:46:44.633
has a great new feature and it has to do with search.

01:46:45.366 --> 01:46:48.233
You know, sometimes you
hear about something on

01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.033
the radio maybe or a new
podcast or something on

01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.766
the news and you think oh,
I want to hear more about

01:46:51.833 --> 01:46:54.133
that, but you are not sure
what show it was on or

01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:56.699
even that it appeared
in the title.

01:46:56.766 --> 01:46:59.833
Well, now we use machine
learning to index the

01:46:59.899 --> 01:47:03.533
contents of the spoken
content of Podcasts, so

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.633
now you can search that
content and find the

01:47:05.699 --> 01:47:09.066
Podcast with just a
few clicks in the app.

01:47:09.133 --> 01:47:10.000
It's great.

01:47:10.199 --> 01:47:12.266
(Applause)

01:47:14.366 --> 01:47:18.300
And finally, the Apple TV
app, your new home for TV

01:47:18.366 --> 01:47:20.366
and music on the Mac.

01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:22.866
Now, you will love having
access to Watch Now,

01:47:22.933 --> 01:47:25.766
including all of your
great channels like HBO

01:47:25.833 --> 01:47:29.199
and Showtime, and it has
all of your purchased

01:47:29.266 --> 01:47:31.699
movies for iTunes as well,
and they have never looked

01:47:31.766 --> 01:47:35.066
or sounded better because
now on recent Macs, we

01:47:35.133 --> 01:47:39.666
have support for 4K HDR
playback on the Mac with

01:47:39.733 --> 01:47:41.833
HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

01:47:42.933 --> 01:47:45.633
And Dolby Atmos playback
as well so you will

01:47:45.699 --> 01:47:49.366
experience amazing spatial
audio rendered right out

01:47:49.433 --> 01:47:51.333
of your MacBook's speakers.

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:54.899
So, that's Apple Music,
Apple Podcasts and Apple

01:47:54.966 --> 01:47:58.533
TV, and now I want to
turn to something new.

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.933
We call it sidecar.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.466
Yeah.

01:48:03.966 --> 01:48:07.433
Now, Mac users love
connecting their laptop to

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.766
an external display so
they can spread out their

01:48:09.833 --> 01:48:12.600
work, but often when they
have to leave on the go,

01:48:12.666 --> 01:48:15.266
they have to leave
that display behind.

01:48:15.333 --> 01:48:19.433
Well, no longer, because
now you can use your iPad

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.600
as a second display
for your Mac.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.300
(Applause)

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.899
It's great.

01:48:28.966 --> 01:48:30.866
You can spread out your
work right across your

01:48:30.933 --> 01:48:34.733
iPad, but, of course, some
pro users like using these

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.600
dedicated tablets for
precise input on their Mac.

01:48:39.399 --> 01:48:42.233
Well, now with the iPad
and Apple Pencil, you can

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.300
do that too.

01:48:45.366 --> 01:48:48.066
It works both wired and
wirelessly so you can get

01:48:48.133 --> 01:48:51.000
comfortable, and it
works across all of your

01:48:51.066 --> 01:48:54.233
favorite Mac Apps
that support tablets.

01:48:55.399 --> 01:48:58.600
Now, next I want to
turn to accessibility.

01:48:58.666 --> 01:49:01.333
Now, we believe technology
is most powerful when

01:49:01.399 --> 01:49:03.199
everyone can use it.

01:49:03.266 --> 01:49:06.066
So, we engineer a wide
array of assistive

01:49:06.133 --> 01:49:08.766
technologies into our
all of our products.

01:49:09.733 --> 01:49:11.733
Now, for users with
physical motor

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.366
limitations, voice can be
an extremely powerful way

01:49:14.433 --> 01:49:16.633
to operate a computer.

01:49:16.699 --> 01:49:21.000
And this year, we are proud
to introduce voice control.

01:49:21.066 --> 01:49:23.666
Now, voice control lets
you control your Mac

01:49:23.733 --> 01:49:26.600
entirely with your voice
and not just that.

01:49:26.666 --> 01:49:30.199
We are also bringing
it to iOS as well.

01:49:30.266 --> 01:49:32.766
I would like to show you
just how transformative

01:49:32.833 --> 01:49:34.366
this can be.

01:49:38.933 --> 01:49:40.766
>> MALE SPEAKER: Wake up.

01:49:40.833 --> 01:49:42.966
Voice control is a
breakthrough feature that

01:49:43.033 --> 01:49:45.966
gives you full control of
your devices, comma, with

01:49:46.033 --> 01:49:47.800
just your voice, period.

01:49:47.866 --> 01:49:50.500
It's a whole new way to
do everything you love,

01:49:50.566 --> 01:49:51.300
period.

01:49:52.266 --> 01:49:53.399
Like this.

01:49:53.466 --> 01:49:54.933
Correct love.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.033

01:49:59.466 --> 01:50:02.066
Open photos.

01:50:02.133 --> 01:50:03.833

Click share.

01:50:10.133 --> 01:50:11.300

01:50:12.399 --> 01:50:15.266
Tim, next field.

01:50:15.333 --> 01:50:17.966
Let's ride this one today.

01:50:18.033 --> 01:50:19.633
Thumbs up emoji.

01:50:19.699 --> 01:50:21.366
Click send.

01:50:21.633 --> 01:50:23.066
Open Maps.

01:50:23.133 --> 01:50:25.166
Show grid.

01:50:25.233 --> 01:50:26.033
Long press it.

01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.600

01:50:27.666 --> 01:50:30.066
Open app switcher.

01:50:30.133 --> 01:50:32.600

01:50:32.666 --> 01:50:33.800
Tap share.

01:50:34.899 --> 01:50:36.266
Tap Tim.

01:50:37.066 --> 01:50:38.199
Tap send.

01:50:47.533 --> 01:50:48.766
Hey, good to see you.

01:50:49.266 --> 01:50:50.533
Open music.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.933
Turn up the volume.

01:50:55.199 --> 01:50:57.933
(Applause)

01:51:10.633 --> 01:51:12.166
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So,
that's voice control.

01:51:12.233 --> 01:51:14.033
Now, it leverages the
latest Siri voice

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.899
recognition technology to
precisely understand what

01:51:16.966 --> 01:51:19.166
you are saying and all
of those commands and of

01:51:19.233 --> 01:51:21.933
course, your voice is
processed locally on

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.300
device so none of that
audio goes to Apple.

01:51:25.866 --> 01:51:29.333
Now, next, I want to turn
to a new solution that helps

01:51:29.399 --> 01:51:32.366
you find your Mac should it
ever be lost or stolen.

01:51:32.433 --> 01:51:34.000
It's called Find My.

01:51:34.233 --> 01:51:37.533
Now, Find My combines Find
My iPhone with Find My

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.266
Friends and it's now
available on the Mac and

01:51:40.333 --> 01:51:42.666
iOS devices as well.

01:51:42.733 --> 01:51:45.833
And it has a new twist
because it can now even

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:49.133
locate Apple devices
that are offline.

01:51:49.433 --> 01:51:51.699
Now, this is particularly
important for Macs because

01:51:51.766 --> 01:51:54.666
often your laptop is
folded up in a bag,

01:51:54.733 --> 01:51:58.199
asleep, and no longer
on the network.

01:51:58.266 --> 01:52:00.699
Now, the way this
works is really cool.

01:52:01.466 --> 01:52:04.266
Let's say you have
misplaced your MacBook.

01:52:04.333 --> 01:52:07.399
So, even when it's offline
and sleeping, it sends out

01:52:07.466 --> 01:52:10.466
a secure Bluetooth beacon
that can be detected by

01:52:10.533 --> 01:52:12.866
other people's Apple
devices nearby.

01:52:13.966 --> 01:52:16.199
Now, they can relay your
MacBook's location to the

01:52:16.266 --> 01:52:20.000
network and ultimately back
to you so you can find it.

01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:23.033
Now, what's amazing
is that this whole

01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:26.466
interaction is end to end
encrypted and anonymous.

01:52:26.533 --> 01:52:29.100
It uses just tiny bits of
data that piggyback on

01:52:29.166 --> 01:52:32.466
existing network traffic,
so there is no need to

01:52:32.533 --> 01:52:35.600
worry about your battery
life, your data usage,

01:52:35.666 --> 01:52:37.666
or your privacy.

01:52:38.566 --> 01:52:40.566
Next, activation lock.

01:52:40.633 --> 01:52:43.366
We are bringing activation
lock to your Mac to make

01:52:43.433 --> 01:52:45.833
it far less
attractive to thieves.

01:52:45.899 --> 01:52:49.366
It's available on all Macs
with a T2 security chip

01:52:49.433 --> 01:52:52.966
and it works just like
on your iPhone and iPad.

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:55.500
So, in the unfortunate
event that your Mac ever

01:52:55.566 --> 01:52:58.800
is stolen, the thief will
find it completely useless

01:52:58.866 --> 01:53:01.266
because they can't even
install or boot it unless

01:53:01.333 --> 01:53:04.066
you reactivate it with
your credentials.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.300
Now, I want to turn to
apps because there is much

01:53:07.366 --> 01:53:10.333
more to the App
story in Catalina.

01:53:10.399 --> 01:53:13.699
Now, you will find of
course the beautiful new

01:53:13.766 --> 01:53:17.266
photo browsing experience
in Photos, an updated

01:53:17.333 --> 01:53:19.966
start page in Safari.

01:53:20.033 --> 01:53:22.933
The brand-new gallery
view in Notes.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.966
And a completely
redesigned Reminders app,

01:53:28.033 --> 01:53:30.433
but also for the first
time, we're bringing

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.133
Screen Time to the Mac.

01:53:32.333 --> 01:53:34.266
Now, it has all of the
same great features from

01:53:34.333 --> 01:53:36.733
iOS, so you and your
family can understand the

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:39.266
complete picture of your
use across all of your

01:53:39.333 --> 01:53:41.933
devices and all of the
limits are enforced across

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.766
all of your devices.

01:53:44.699 --> 01:53:46.966
We think this is going to
be great for families.

01:53:47.033 --> 01:53:51.133
Now, of course, Mac users
also love third party apps

01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:54.300
and they love to have
more on the platform.

01:53:54.366 --> 01:53:56.833
We have been working
on a new project that

01:53:56.899 --> 01:53:59.333
internally we call Project
Catalyst, and it's new

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:02.233
technology that lets
developers quickly and

01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:05.300
efficiently create apps
for the Mac based on their

01:54:05.366 --> 01:54:07.166
existing iPad apps.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.333
Now, there are over a
million iPad apps out

01:54:10.399 --> 01:54:13.466
there and we think some of them would be fantastic on the Mac.

01:54:13.533 --> 01:54:16.433
Now, iPad developers, of
course, would also love to

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.033
have a greater audience
to sell their apps to and

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:23.233
there are 100 million
active Mac users out there

01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:24.533
waiting for them.

01:54:24.933 --> 01:54:26.966
Now, if you are running
Mojave, you already use

01:54:27.033 --> 01:54:29.233
Catalyst technology
because we used it to

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:32.899
build News, Stocks,
Voice Memos, Home.

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:36.666
Now, that was just V1 and we have learned a lot since then.

01:54:37.333 --> 01:54:39.966
We have spent the last
year expanding the number

01:54:40.033 --> 01:54:42.566
of categories of apps the
technology could support

01:54:42.633 --> 01:54:44.800
and we have tuned it up
so it results in a much

01:54:44.866 --> 01:54:47.600
better Mac App.

01:54:47.666 --> 01:54:49.133
We are pleased to announce
that we are making

01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:53.466
Catalyst available to developers today in macOS Catalina.

01:54:53.666 --> 01:54:56.166
(Applause)

01:55:01.899 --> 01:55:04.866
Now, the experience starts
right here in XCode.

01:55:04.933 --> 01:55:08.333
Just open up your existing
iPad project, check the

01:55:08.399 --> 01:55:10.533
Mac checkbox.

01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.266
And just like that, you
will get a huge head start

01:55:13.333 --> 01:55:17.000
because XCode
automatically builds in

01:55:17.066 --> 01:55:18.500
all of the fundamental
features like cursor

01:55:18.566 --> 01:55:20.033
controls, window controls
and so forth, and that

01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:23.399
lets you focus on the
finishing touches, maybe a

01:55:23.466 --> 01:55:26.399
translucent side bar, pull
down menus or whatever

01:55:26.466 --> 01:55:29.766
features would make your
Mac - your app just great

01:55:29.833 --> 01:55:31.033
on the Mac.

01:55:31.699 --> 01:55:34.333
Now, this means one
Development Team for the

01:55:34.399 --> 01:55:37.800
first time can build a
single app that can span

01:55:37.866 --> 01:55:41.833
all the way from
iPhone to iPad to Mac.

01:55:42.633 --> 01:55:44.100
Now, we have been
working with a number of

01:55:44.166 --> 01:55:47.333
developers previewing
Catalyst technology, and

01:55:47.399 --> 01:55:50.399
we have already seen
some great Mac Apps.

01:55:50.466 --> 01:55:54.399
For instance, the great
racing game Asphalt 9:

01:55:54.466 --> 01:55:56.600
Legends from Gameloft.

01:55:56.666 --> 01:55:58.000
Here is what
they had to say.

01:55:58.399 --> 01:56:01.500
"We had Asphalt 9: Legends
for the Mac running on

01:56:01.566 --> 01:56:02.766
the first day.

01:56:02.833 --> 01:56:06.133
It looks stunning and runs
super fast using Metal on

01:56:06.199 --> 01:56:07.966
powerful Mac hardware."

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:12.100
And Twitter, excited to
come back to the Mac with

01:56:12.166 --> 01:56:13.933
a native app.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.833
They said, "We had
Twitter for Mac running -

01:56:15.899 --> 01:56:19.033
including native Mac
features - in just days.

01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.233
Now a single team can
efficiently manage Twitter

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:24.866
for iPhone, iPad and Mac."

01:56:25.733 --> 01:56:28.300
And finally, we asked
Atlassian, Developers of

01:56:28.366 --> 01:56:30.766
Jira Cloud, leading
project management

01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:33.399
solution for agile
software development, to

01:56:33.466 --> 01:56:35.466
give Catalyst a try.

01:56:35.533 --> 01:56:37.833
To tell you more about it,
I would like to invite Rob

01:56:37.899 --> 01:56:40.699
Chatfield, Senior iOS
Engineer, to the stage.

01:56:40.766 --> 01:56:42.500
Rob, come on up.

01:56:42.533 --> 01:56:44.000
(Applause)

01:56:44.233 --> 01:56:48.033
>> ROB CHATFIELD:
Thanks, Craig.

01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:51.966
Jira has been on the web
for years and recently we

01:56:52.033 --> 01:56:54.800
have put a lot of effort
into mobile, like our iOS

01:56:54.866 --> 01:56:57.366
app that offers quick
and easy access to your

01:56:57.433 --> 01:56:58.600
projects on the go.

01:56:59.233 --> 01:57:01.300
Many of you have asked us
for a similar experience

01:57:01.366 --> 01:57:02.666
on the Mac.

01:57:02.733 --> 01:57:05.133
Well, today, I am thrilled
to announce that we have

01:57:05.199 --> 01:57:06.366
done just that.

01:57:07.166 --> 01:57:08.899
We were impressed that we
were able to get the Jira

01:57:08.966 --> 01:57:12.100
project up and running in
just a few days and it's a

01:57:12.166 --> 01:57:13.966
huge project.

01:57:14.033 --> 01:57:17.466
Now, our iOS devs
are Mac devs too.

01:57:17.533 --> 01:57:20.033
One code base, one team.

01:57:21.066 --> 01:57:25.433
Here is a preview.

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:28.466
The boards view looks
amazing on the Mac display

01:57:28.533 --> 01:57:31.333
with plenty of room for
multitasking, and the

01:57:31.399 --> 01:57:34.233
benefit of this being a
native app is that it's

01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:36.000
insanely fast.

01:57:36.066 --> 01:57:38.533
We can switch between
these views instantly

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:40.533
which is a level of
performance you just don't

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.833
get on the Web.

01:57:42.333 --> 01:57:45.133
And this is one project,
so all of the work we did

01:57:45.199 --> 01:57:48.433
on iPad automatically
translated to the Mac,

01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:52.466
like keyboard shortcuts,
Spotlight, and Drag and Drop.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.533
And it was easy to add
those finishing touches

01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:59.533
that make it perfect
for the desktop.

01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.500
For example, we added our top tasks into the custom toolbar.

01:58:03.566 --> 01:58:07.333
All of this never would
have happened without

01:58:07.399 --> 01:58:08.866
Project Catalyst.

01:58:08.933 --> 01:58:12.300
We are super excited to be
bringing the Jira app to

01:58:12.366 --> 01:58:14.399
Mac and can't wait
for you to try it.

01:58:14.466 --> 01:58:16.933
So, look for Jira Cloud
in the Mac App Store

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.233
later this year.

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.633
Thank you very much.

01:58:20.033 --> 01:58:24.899
(Applause)

01:58:26.166 --> 01:58:27.699
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So, we
are really excited about

01:58:27.766 --> 01:58:30.766
this technology and
excited to see what apps

01:58:30.833 --> 01:58:32.866
you all bring to the Mac
App Store this fall.

01:58:33.899 --> 01:58:36.266
So that's macOS Catalina.

01:58:36.333 --> 01:58:39.600
Sidecar, strong security
improvements, great new

01:58:39.666 --> 01:58:42.733
system apps and Project
Catalyst bringing a whole

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:46.199
new way to bring
new apps to the Mac.

01:58:47.333 --> 01:58:50.066
You know, you have seen
a lot today in terms of

01:58:50.133 --> 01:58:52.066
tools for pro users, and
you know who our biggest

01:58:52.133 --> 01:58:54.233
group of pros is?

01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.833
Well, it's developers,
all of you.

01:58:56.899 --> 01:59:01.733
And, you know, everything
we do for Developers is

01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:04.266
focused on the goal of
helping you create the

01:59:04.333 --> 01:59:07.533
greatest and most
innovative apps and we do

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.466
this by providing tools
and technologies designed

01:59:10.533 --> 01:59:12.600
to give you a head start.

01:59:13.733 --> 01:59:16.366
Well, this year we have a
whole bunch to talk about,

01:59:16.433 --> 01:59:19.699
like Metal and Core ML,
but we are going to cover

01:59:19.766 --> 01:59:21.199
that later in
the conference.

01:59:21.266 --> 01:59:23.866
Today I want to focus
on just two areas.

01:59:23.933 --> 01:59:25.866
AR and Swift.

01:59:25.933 --> 01:59:27.699
And we will start with AR.

01:59:28.399 --> 01:59:31.933
Today, we have three
really big announcements,

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.666
starting with RealityKit.

01:59:34.733 --> 01:59:37.333
So, you know, creating
complex 3D environments

01:59:37.399 --> 01:59:40.833
can require deep knowledge
of 3D modeling and mastery

01:59:40.899 --> 01:59:44.533
of sophisticated gaming
engines like Unity and

01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:47.600
Unreal, but what about the
developers who want to

01:59:47.666 --> 01:59:50.500
incorporate 3D and AR in
their apps but they don't

01:59:50.566 --> 01:59:52.100
have that experience?

01:59:52.166 --> 01:59:54.166
Well, that's where
RealityKit comes in.

01:59:54.466 --> 01:59:56.966
It's built from the ground
up for AR with photo

01:59:57.033 --> 01:59:59.933
realistic rendering,
amazing effects like

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.866
camera motion blur
and noise, and it is

02:00:02.933 --> 02:00:06.966
seamlessly integrated into ARKit and has a native Swift API.

02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:10.166
Now, how do you actually
model your 3D content?

02:00:10.233 --> 02:00:13.533
Well, that's where Reality
Composer comes in.

02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.733
Reality composer is a new
app featuring Drag and

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.100
Drop - a Drag and Drop
interface and a library of

02:00:19.166 --> 02:00:22.199
high quality objects and
animations making it

02:00:22.266 --> 02:00:25.233
incredibly fast and
easy to build an

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:27.466
interactive environment.

02:00:27.533 --> 02:00:29.033
Now, of course, it's
integrated with XCode, but

02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.600
it's also
available on iOS.

02:00:31.666 --> 02:00:35.433
So, you can edit, test,
and tune your app right on

02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:38.066
the device where it will
ultimately be delivered.

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.066
Now, of course, the
foundation of AR on iOS is

02:00:42.133 --> 02:00:45.800
ARKit, and ARKit
is a major update.

02:00:45.866 --> 02:00:48.766
I want to focus on
one area around the

02:00:48.833 --> 02:00:51.899
improvement in the way
people are handled in AR

02:00:51.966 --> 02:00:54.366
scenes starting with
people occlusion.

02:00:54.433 --> 02:00:56.066
Now, this is insane.

02:00:56.233 --> 02:00:57.466
(Applause)

02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:59.100
What used to require
painstaking compositing by

02:00:59.166 --> 02:01:01.566
hand can now be
done in real time.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:03.266
(Applause)

02:01:03.466 --> 02:01:05.300
Now, by knowing where
these people are in the

02:01:05.366 --> 02:01:07.100
scenes you can see we can
layer virtual content in

02:01:07.166 --> 02:01:08.800
front and behind them.

02:01:08.866 --> 02:01:12.166
And check this out;
Motion Capture.

02:01:12.233 --> 02:01:14.666
Just point your camera at
a person and we can track

02:01:14.733 --> 02:01:18.133
in real-time the positions
of their head, their torso and

02:01:18.199 --> 02:01:21.933
their limbs and feed it as an input into the AR experience.

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:23.433
(Applause)

02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:25.833
Now, Developers are going
to do amazing things with

02:01:25.899 --> 02:01:30.133
ARKit 3, and that
brings us to Minecraft.

02:01:30.199 --> 02:01:32.633
Minecraft is the
bestselling game of all

02:01:32.699 --> 02:01:35.666
time, and a great
platform for creativity.

02:01:35.733 --> 02:01:39.533
So, to see how ARKit is
enabling Minecraft to go

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.733
to the next level, I'm
happy to welcome to the

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.733
stage, Lydia Winters and
Saxs Persson from Mojang.

02:01:46.899 --> 02:01:48.733
(Applause)

02:01:54.966 --> 02:01:57.133
>> LYDIA WINTERS:
Thanks, Craig.

02:01:57.199 --> 02:01:59.433
Our amazing community
inspires us to push

02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:02.666
boundaries and build
unique experiences.

02:02:02.733 --> 02:02:06.066
We are here today to show
you our newest creation.

02:02:06.899 --> 02:02:07.833
>> SAXS PERSSON: We have
been dreaming about a

02:02:07.899 --> 02:02:10.433
Minecraft in the real
world and Minecraft in

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:12.100
Augmented Reality.

02:02:12.166 --> 02:02:15.366
We share a vision with
Apple, how AR can uniquely

02:02:15.433 --> 02:02:18.433
connect us to the world
and today technology is

02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.000
ready for that vision.

02:02:20.066 --> 02:02:21.733
We built something we
think is pretty special.

02:02:22.333 --> 02:02:24.399
>> LYDIA WINTERS: We are
excited to demo gameplay

02:02:24.466 --> 02:02:27.833
for the very first time
right here on stage.

02:02:28.066 --> 02:02:30.633
(Applause)

02:02:33.566 --> 02:02:36.300
This is Minecraft Earth.

02:02:38.033 --> 02:02:39.100
>> SAXS PERSSON: Let's
start with the basics.

02:02:39.166 --> 02:02:44.533
This is a real living,
breathing Minecraft world

02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:45.266
right on your tabletop
with red stone circuitry,

02:02:45.333 --> 02:02:48.000
fireworks, flowing water.

02:02:48.066 --> 02:02:51.899
You can break anything,
you can play with your

02:02:51.966 --> 02:02:54.733
mobs, and when I look at
Lydia, I can see what tool

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:57.966
she is holding and I can
see her name and we can

02:02:58.033 --> 02:02:59.966
see anything
she is building.

02:03:00.166 --> 02:03:02.233
>> LYDIA WINTERS: I'm going
to put myself into the build.

02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.266
There I am.

02:03:03.833 --> 02:03:04.366
>> SAXS PERSSON: Nice.

02:03:04.433 --> 02:03:05.699
Looks just like you.

02:03:05.766 --> 02:03:09.266
Let's use Motion Capture
and make your character wave.

02:03:09.333 --> 02:03:11.933
Try one wave.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.566
Let's try the trick
of the double wave.

02:03:14.633 --> 02:03:16.000
Cool.

02:03:16.833 --> 02:03:18.466
>> LYDIA WINTERS: This
looks amazing on the

02:03:18.533 --> 02:03:20.033
tabletop, but let's
use the stage.

02:03:30.433 --> 02:03:32.100
Here we go.

02:03:42.033 --> 02:03:44.000
(Applause)

02:03:49.233 --> 02:03:51.699
Look, Mom, I'm
in Minecraft.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.899
>> SAXS PERSSON: You fit
right in with the new

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:04.066
people occlusion feature
like you can fit right

02:04:04.133 --> 02:04:05.300
into your Minecraft world.

02:04:05.366 --> 02:04:06.666
That only works on iOS.

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:22.000
>> LYDIA WINTERS: It's
like hide and seek.

02:04:23.899 --> 02:04:26.899
>> SAXS PERSSON: This is
a fully interactive world

02:04:26.966 --> 02:04:28.433
even at this scale.

02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.633
>> LYDIA WINTERS: There
are some interesting

02:04:29.699 --> 02:04:30.666
levers over here.

02:04:30.733 --> 02:04:32.733
I'm going to press the one
with the feathers on it.

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:36.033
>> SAXS PERSSON: All right.

02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:36.866
Watch out for
the chickens.

02:04:36.933 --> 02:04:37.899
>> LYDIA WINTERS:
Chickens.

02:04:37.966 --> 02:04:39.399
>> SAXS PERSSON: I'm going
to put some seeds in my hand.

02:04:39.466 --> 02:04:40.966
They should come rushing over.

02:04:43.333 --> 02:04:46.500
>> LYDIA WINTERS: So cute.

02:04:46.566 --> 02:04:49.966
Hey Saxs, there is
another lever over here.

02:04:50.033 --> 02:04:51.466
It has TNT on it.

02:04:51.533 --> 02:04:52.933
I'm definitely
going to pull it.

02:04:54.466 --> 02:04:55.399
>> SAXS PERSSON:
Watch out.

02:04:56.566 --> 02:05:00.199
>> LYDIA WINTERS: I'm
right on the edge.

02:05:00.266 --> 02:05:01.666
Skeletons.

02:05:02.833 --> 02:05:03.633
>> SAXS PERSSON:
All right, Lydia.

02:05:03.699 --> 02:05:05.000
Can I help you out
with the skeletons?

02:05:05.233 --> 02:05:06.100
>> LYDIA WINTERS:
Thank you.

02:05:07.033 --> 02:05:08.600
>> SAXS PERSSON: Uh
oh, chicken, sorry.

02:05:09.333 --> 02:05:11.066
>> LYDIA WINTERS: Oh no.

02:05:11.133 --> 02:05:12.466
Skeletons only.

02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:16.300
>> SAXS PERSSON:
I'm trying.

02:05:16.366 --> 02:05:17.333
All right.

02:05:17.399 --> 02:05:19.199
That's a huge cave
underneath you we can light up.

02:05:20.833 --> 02:05:22.100
>> LYDIA WINTERS: It's
hard to believe that there

02:05:22.166 --> 02:05:24.033
is nothing on the ground
or around us on the stage.

02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:27.066
It's incredibly immersive.

02:05:27.266 --> 02:05:29.666
The fun, quirkiness and
surprises of Minecraft are

02:05:29.733 --> 02:05:32.466
all around to discover.

02:05:32.533 --> 02:05:33.933
Oh, no, Saxs, a creeper.

02:05:35.933 --> 02:05:39.600
(Applause)

02:05:50.199 --> 02:05:52.066
It's always a creeper.

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:57.066
Minecraft takes on its
biggest dimension yet, earth.

02:05:57.133 --> 02:05:59.600
Unleash your creativity,
build with friends and

02:05:59.666 --> 02:06:02.300
turn the real world
into your playground.

02:06:02.899 --> 02:06:05.133
>> SAXS PERSSON: Go to
Minecraft dot net to learn

02:06:05.199 --> 02:06:08.166
more and sign up for your chance to play on iOS this summer.

02:06:08.233 --> 02:06:09.866
>> LYDIA WINTERS: We can't
wait to see what you do in

02:06:09.933 --> 02:06:11.300
Minecraft Earth.

02:06:11.366 --> 02:06:12.100
Thanks, everyone.

02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:13.000
>> SAXS PERSSON:
Thank you.

02:06:13.166 --> 02:06:15.300
(Applause)

02:06:17.399 --> 02:06:19.233
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Isn't that great?

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.766
Now, just to be clear, no
chickens were harmed on

02:06:21.833 --> 02:06:23.133
the stage at WWDC.

02:06:23.199 --> 02:06:25.666
I know it was very lifelike,
but that was an illusion.

02:06:26.699 --> 02:06:31.699
So, that's ARKit 3, RealityKit and Reality Composer.

02:06:31.766 --> 02:06:34.933
It's a huge year for AR.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.066
It's also an enormous
year for Swift.

02:06:39.333 --> 02:06:41.233
(Applause)

02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:47.466
Now, platform programming
language transitions, they

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:50.199
only come along
every 20 to 30 years.

02:06:50.266 --> 02:06:53.633
You know, C and Objective
C, those were created in

02:06:53.699 --> 02:06:57.033
the 70s and 80s and Swift
was just launched five

02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:59.733
years ago and it's
just amazing how strong

02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:00.766
it's been going.

02:07:00.833 --> 02:07:04.399
There are over 450,000
apps on the App Store

02:07:04.466 --> 02:07:07.500
using Swift and
Developers are loving it.

02:07:07.733 --> 02:07:09.266
(Applause)

02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:10.800
Yes.

02:07:10.866 --> 02:07:12.433
Thank you all.

02:07:15.666 --> 02:07:17.933
But you know, a new
language enables new

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.966
paradigms and with
it, new frameworks.

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:24.333
Now, Objective C enabled
AppKit and then UIKit,

02:07:24.399 --> 02:07:26.199
improving developer
productivity by an order

02:07:26.266 --> 02:07:27.899
of magnitude and
ultimately igniting the

02:07:27.966 --> 02:07:29.833
app revolution.

02:07:30.033 --> 02:07:32.366
Now, when we introduce
Swift, the first step was

02:07:32.433 --> 02:07:35.199
to make sure developers
could access these great

02:07:35.266 --> 02:07:37.199
frameworks while taking
advantage of the

02:07:37.266 --> 02:07:40.266
languages, speed, and
expressiveness, but, of

02:07:40.333 --> 02:07:43.633
course, the biggest
gains were yet to come.

02:07:43.899 --> 02:07:47.100
The true step function in
development would only

02:07:47.166 --> 02:07:50.666
come when we engineered a
new framework, built from

02:07:50.733 --> 02:07:54.300
the ground up to take
advantage of everything

02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:56.300
that Swift had to offer.

02:07:56.366 --> 02:07:59.566
Today we are announcing
that new framework.

02:07:59.633 --> 02:08:02.699
It's called SwiftUI.

02:08:03.033 --> 02:08:05.066
(Applause)

02:08:16.766 --> 02:08:20.500
Now, SwiftUI is built in
Swift for Swift and it

02:08:20.566 --> 02:08:22.466
provides a new paradigm.

02:08:22.533 --> 02:08:25.000
You specify UI with
simple declarations.

02:08:25.066 --> 02:08:27.199
It makes code really
easy to write and really

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:28.633
easy to understand.

02:08:28.899 --> 02:08:32.899
It's designed to help you build better apps with way less code.

02:08:32.966 --> 02:08:35.833
For instance, let's take
an app like this, a simple list.

02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:37.566
We have all written
one of these.

02:08:37.633 --> 02:08:39.066
It turns out if you want
to write this with support

02:08:39.133 --> 02:08:41.733
for all of the modern
features, you might end up

02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:46.100
writing something
like this in UIKit.

02:08:46.166 --> 02:08:48.800
It's actually quite
a bit of code.

02:08:48.866 --> 02:08:51.766
Here is that same
thing in SwiftUI.

02:08:53.533 --> 02:08:54.633
That's it.

02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:55.800
(Applause)

02:08:56.633 --> 02:08:57.600
Just a few lines
of Swift code.

02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:02.933
Yes.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.933
Now, there is so much
that SwiftUI gives you.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.033
It frees you to focus on
the functionality in your

02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:10.666
apps and we automatically
do new things for you like

02:09:10.733 --> 02:09:14.333
when we add Dark Mode,
your app gets it automatically.

02:09:14.766 --> 02:09:16.966
And of course, the
framework is only part of

02:09:17.033 --> 02:09:19.033
the story because in XCode
there's a new interactive

02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:20.666
development experience.

02:09:20.733 --> 02:09:22.766
You can think about it
like Playgrounds cranked

02:09:22.833 --> 02:09:25.533
to eleven built for apps.

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.766
Now, to show you SwiftUI
in action, I would like to

02:09:29.833 --> 02:09:33.300
invite Josh Shaffer,
the head of our iOS UI

02:09:33.366 --> 02:09:36.833
frameworks team to the
stage to give you a live demo.

02:09:36.899 --> 02:09:37.899
Josh.

02:09:38.066 --> 02:09:41.600
(Applause)

02:09:43.966 --> 02:09:44.566
>> JOSH SHAFFER: All right.

02:09:44.633 --> 02:09:45.899
Thanks, Craig.

02:09:45.966 --> 02:09:49.266
Let me show you how easy it is to get started with SwiftUI.

02:09:49.866 --> 02:09:51.533
On the canvas on the
right, you can see my

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:53.066
simple hello world app.

02:09:53.133 --> 02:09:54.966
And I can just select the
text on the canvas and

02:09:55.033 --> 02:09:57.000
when I do, XCode
highlights the code in the

02:09:57.066 --> 02:09:58.366
editor on the left.

02:09:58.433 --> 02:10:00.133
Watch what happens
when I edit it.

02:10:00.199 --> 02:10:02.300
The preview updates
immediately.

02:10:02.633 --> 02:10:04.333
(Applause)

02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:09.466
Now, to get started let's
open our library of views.

02:10:09.533 --> 02:10:11.600
We can see options and
drag one right out and

02:10:11.666 --> 02:10:13.600
drop one right
on the canvas.

02:10:13.666 --> 02:10:15.633
As soon as I do, the code
for it is added to the

02:10:15.699 --> 02:10:16.966
editor on the left.

02:10:17.466 --> 02:10:20.399
With simple Drag and Drop,
we can get real code

02:10:20.466 --> 02:10:24.600
created instantly, and
built in inspectors let us

02:10:24.666 --> 02:10:27.000
adjust the layout of our
views exactly like you

02:10:27.066 --> 02:10:29.033
would in an app
like Keynote.

02:10:30.199 --> 02:10:31.966
The inspectors are
tailored for each type of

02:10:32.033 --> 02:10:34.399
view so you can see the
kind of options that you

02:10:34.466 --> 02:10:37.366
have, and choose exactly
the one that you want.

02:10:37.433 --> 02:10:39.733
And I can use the exact
same tools to edit the

02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:41.800
code directly too.

02:10:41.866 --> 02:10:44.633
So, with just one step, we
can take this view we have been

02:10:44.699 --> 02:10:47.500
building and convert it into
a scrollable list of views.

02:10:50.466 --> 02:10:52.699
Now, a list
requires content.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.100
(Applause)

02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:55.033
Thanks.

02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:56.399
It's really incredible.

02:10:57.133 --> 02:10:57.933
Okay.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.333
So, a list requires
content and for that we

02:10:59.399 --> 02:11:01.033
can bring in a model
object that I created

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.666
earlier and start
connecting it up to our views.

02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.699
For the first public app
written with SwiftUI, we

02:11:07.766 --> 02:11:09.233
thought it would be kind
of fun to help our friends

02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:11.199
in product marketing to
choose the perfect name

02:11:11.266 --> 02:11:13.033
for the next
release of MacOS.

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:16.399
So, here we have a list of
themes but we need a place

02:11:16.466 --> 02:11:17.933
to display a release name.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.066
For that, we can drag
in a custom component we

02:11:20.133 --> 02:11:22.800
created earlier and drop
it right at the top.

02:11:22.866 --> 02:11:25.899
Now, even with this little
amount of code, SwiftUI

02:11:25.966 --> 02:11:28.833
already provides default
support for really common

02:11:28.899 --> 02:11:31.333
features like localization
for right to left

02:11:31.399 --> 02:11:35.933
languages and, of course,
iOS 13's new Dark Mode.

02:11:36.133 --> 02:11:38.033
(Applause)

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.800
All right.

02:11:44.866 --> 02:11:47.033
Now, let's make this
interactive so that when

02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:49.033
we select a row in the
table, we will display a

02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:50.566
name for the theme.

02:11:50.633 --> 02:11:52.633
Now, we are ready to test
it out and with just a

02:11:52.699 --> 02:11:54.966
click, we can go from
designing our app to

02:11:55.033 --> 02:11:57.333
interacting with
it, right in XCode.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.233
Now, testing within XCode
is incredible, but I want

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.266
to try it on a device too,
so with just one more

02:12:04.333 --> 02:12:06.966
click we can now install
it on our phone and be

02:12:07.033 --> 02:12:09.066
ready to try it out there.

02:12:09.133 --> 02:12:12.933
So, let's try farms
or maybe food.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.233
That's great but what's
really incredible about this

02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:18.533
is that we can start to edit
it live right on the device.

02:12:19.833 --> 02:12:21.633
So, SwiftUI includes
built in support for

02:12:21.699 --> 02:12:23.266
animated transitions.

02:12:23.333 --> 02:12:25.733
So, let's see some options
and pick a cool one for the top.

02:12:26.633 --> 02:12:28.033
Now, this time when we
choose a name it is going

02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:29.266
to animate in.

02:12:29.333 --> 02:12:32.533
So, let's say deserts
or maybe beaches.

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.800
That's better, but we
all know that product

02:12:35.866 --> 02:12:39.100
marketing chooses these
names randomly, so to get

02:12:39.166 --> 02:12:41.233
a feel that matches that
reality, let's wrap our

02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:43.633
banner in a custom
randomizer component that

02:12:43.699 --> 02:12:46.066
I built earlier to help us
pick a name and now we are

02:12:46.133 --> 02:12:48.933
ready to choose the
next name for macOS.

02:12:50.666 --> 02:12:51.500
That one is not great.

02:12:51.566 --> 02:12:52.566
Let's try one more.

02:12:52.633 --> 02:12:54.366
Cute animals
seems promising.

02:12:54.433 --> 02:12:56.466
Well, that one is perfect.

02:12:56.533 --> 02:12:57.566
All right.

02:12:57.633 --> 02:12:59.766
So, because SwiftUI
includes built in support

02:12:59.833 --> 02:13:02.166
for integrating with
other Apple frameworks, I

02:13:02.233 --> 02:13:03.833
thought it would be fun
to use the new RealityKit

02:13:03.899 --> 02:13:06.566
framework to envision
the release of MacOS 10,

02:13:06.633 --> 02:13:08.866
Flying Squirrel.

02:13:08.933 --> 02:13:11.766
It looks like it's
going to be amazing.

02:13:11.833 --> 02:13:13.800
That's a Quick Look at
building user interfaces

02:13:13.866 --> 02:13:16.333
with SwiftUI and
XCode previews.

02:13:16.399 --> 02:13:18.300
You are going to love it.

02:13:18.666 --> 02:13:21.066
(Applause)

02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:26.300
>> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
What do you think?

02:13:26.533 --> 02:13:29.000
(Applause)

02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:38.433
Now, I'm sure that many of
you are really excited to

02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:41.133
adopt SwiftUI in your apps
and the good news is you

02:13:41.199 --> 02:13:43.899
can do it starting with a
single view all the way up

02:13:43.966 --> 02:13:45.966
to a whole application.

02:13:46.033 --> 02:13:49.300
And this isn't just
for building iOS apps.

02:13:49.366 --> 02:13:51.433
For the first time ever,
we now have a native

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:54.166
framework for building
Watch apps as well.

02:13:54.733 --> 02:13:56.733
(Applause)

02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:02.433
But not just that.

02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:05.066
SwiftUI is available
across all of our

02:14:05.133 --> 02:14:07.933
platforms and it provides
bindings to all of the

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.100
native controls so you can
customize your experiences

02:14:12.166 --> 02:14:14.733
specifically for each, all
while using a common API.

02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:16.466
It's incredibly powerful.

02:14:17.366 --> 02:14:19.633
Now, that's just some
of our big news for

02:14:19.699 --> 02:14:21.300
developers this morning.

02:14:21.366 --> 02:14:23.500
I want to thank you all
for spending the time with me.

02:14:23.833 --> 02:14:24.733
You are so awesome.

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:25.666
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.

02:14:25.733 --> 02:14:26.600
Thank you.

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.433
(Applause)

02:14:33.466 --> 02:14:36.466
>> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Craig.

02:14:36.533 --> 02:14:38.533
What an incredible morning.

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:39.233
Have you enjoyed it?

02:14:40.466 --> 02:14:40.800
(Applause)

02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:43.533
Yeah.

02:14:43.533 --> 02:14:47.300
Today - today we moved all
of our software platforms

02:14:47.366 --> 02:14:49.899
forward, providing
customers new ways to

02:14:49.966 --> 02:14:52.766
enrich their lives
and powerful tools to

02:14:52.833 --> 02:14:56.199
developers so they can
continue to change the world.

02:14:56.266 --> 02:15:00.566
All of the platforms will
be available as a beta today.

02:15:01.266 --> 02:15:02.966
(Applause)

02:15:04.233 --> 02:15:08.399
And the public seed for
macOS, iOS and iPad iOS

02:15:08.466 --> 02:15:12.199
will be available in July,
and, of course, all of

02:15:12.266 --> 02:15:14.933
this great software will
be available to our users

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.466
in the fall.

02:15:16.933 --> 02:15:19.333
(Applause)

02:15:19.733 --> 02:15:24.500
Now, you will also be able
to get an early look at

02:15:24.566 --> 02:15:28.933
the new MacPro and the Pro
Display XDR in our Pro

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.133
Studio just
across the street.

02:15:31.199 --> 02:15:32.733
I encourage
you to do that.

02:15:33.833 --> 02:15:36.433
We have a huge week
planned for you guys, with

02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.466
more than one hundred
sessions, more than two

02:15:38.533 --> 02:15:42.066
hundred hands on labs,
and over a thousand Apple

02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:45.166
engineers that are
here to help you.

02:15:45.233 --> 02:15:46.500
So, seek them out.

02:15:47.166 --> 02:15:49.000
We can't wait to see what
you guys are going to

02:15:49.066 --> 02:15:51.266
dream up and how you are
going to continue to

02:15:51.333 --> 02:15:52.500
change the world.

02:15:53.333 --> 02:15:55.933
Now, before I close this
morning, I would like to

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.366
thank everyone that worked
so hard at Apple on all of

02:16:01.433 --> 02:16:03.866
the products that
you saw this morning.

02:16:03.933 --> 02:16:07.166
These guys have given up
their nights and weekends

02:16:07.233 --> 02:16:10.133
from their families and so
on and so forth, and many

02:16:10.199 --> 02:16:13.899
of these innovations are
years in the making.

02:16:13.966 --> 02:16:14.600
So, thank you.

02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:16.166
Let's give them a
round of applause.

02:16:16.366 --> 02:16:17.633
(Applause)

02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.433
Yes.

02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:35.398
Thank you all for coming
and sharing the time with us.

02:16:36.032 --> 02:16:37.799
Have a great week.

02:16:37.866 --> 02:16:39.066
Thank you.

02:16:39.966 --> 02:16:43.500
(Applause)

02:16:50.333 --> 02:16:54.266
(Music playing)
