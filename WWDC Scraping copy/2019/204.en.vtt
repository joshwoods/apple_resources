[ Applause ]

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:16.136
>> Hi, everyone.

00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:18.806
I'm Jacob Xiao and I'll be

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:20.366
joined later by Kyle Macomber.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:22.256
We're so excited to show you

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:24.766
SwiftUI, a revolutionary new way

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.306
to build better apps faster.

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:29.516
We think the best way to learn

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:31.326
about Swift UI is to see it in

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:33.986
action by building an app.

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:35.756
Using SwiftUI feels like magic,

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.386
but to make it clear that I

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:38.176
don't have anything up my

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:39.906
sleeves, I want to go through

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.556
the entire process of creating

00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:43.436
an app in SwiftUI starting from

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:43.956
scratch.

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:46.236
So what kind of an app are we

00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:46.706
going to make?

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.506
Well, let me set the stage for

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:48.636
you.

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.166
Anybody here hate meetings?

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.926
Yeah? Well, so do we.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:55.726
But Kyle and I have found

00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:56.816
something that makes meetings

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:58.486
more bearable, and that's having

00:00:58.486 --> 00:00:59.736
them in amazing, fancy

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:00.396
conference rooms.

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.756
So we've been making a list of

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:03.936
all of the best conference rooms

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.546
we can find and we want to make

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:06.886
an app for it.

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:10.396
So let's dive in.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.926
Okay. I'll start by creating a

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:13.336
new project.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.906
And we'll call it Rooms.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:22.756
And I'll make sure that Use

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:23.546
SwiftUI is checked.

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.086
Now Xcode has started us off

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:34.776
with a view, with the view that

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:36.006
we can use to start building our

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:36.296
UI.

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:42.046
Our code is over here on the

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:42.316
left.

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:45.476
And on the right is the Canvas.

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:47.816
And if you're familiar with

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:48.666
Interface Builder or

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.566
Storyboards, you may think that

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.396
there's nothing new here.

00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:53.566
Some code on one side and a

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:54.646
visual Canvas on the other,

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:55.026
right?

00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:57.156
Well, there's a very important

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:57.476
difference.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:01.216
With Storyboards, you need to

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:02.726
choose between the benefits of

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.476
using a visual editor, or the

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:06.126
benefits of creating your UI in

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:06.436
code.

00:02:07.236 --> 00:02:08.895
And if you choose one and change

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.455
your mind later, then you have

00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:11.406
to start all over again.

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:14.046
But with SwiftUI, that problem

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:14.546
is gone.

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:17.136
Now your view definition is

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.946
always Swift's code and you can

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.666
always choose to edit the code

00:02:20.846 --> 00:02:22.726
directly or to use the visual

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:23.106
editor.

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:24.376
And you can always go back and

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:24.756
forth.

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:27.326
So if we select something in the

00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:29.986
Canvas, then that selection is

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:31.136
reflected in the code as well.

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:33.306
And if you change something in

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:35.756
the code, then that change is

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:36.986
reflected in the Canvas as well.

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:38.696
They work together seamlessly.

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:41.856
So let me tell you a little more

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:42.586
about how it works.

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:45.546
The Canvas shows us previews of

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:46.166
our view code.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.296
And it even helps us edit and

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:49.136
learn about that code.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.036
Xcode shows these previews by

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:53.856
compiling our real code and

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:55.106
running it to generate a result.

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:57.226
But one of my favorite things

00:02:57.226 --> 00:02:58.556
about previews is that they're

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:00.406
also created using SwiftUI code.

00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:02.296
In this case, the code right

00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:02.506
here.

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:06.036
And later on, we'll see how that

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:07.196
gives us a lot of power to

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:08.436
customize our previews.

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:11.516
Now our app is going to show a

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:13.216
list of conference rooms, so

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:14.056
let's make the cell for our

00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:14.396
list.

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:17.296
I'm going to add another piece

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.046
of text under this one to show

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:20.416
more detail about each room.

00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:23.396
And I'm going to add it by just

00:03:23.396 --> 00:03:24.756
dragging it out onto my Canvas.

00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:28.336
And Xcode even shows me what

00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:29.626
will happen when I place it at

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:30.396
different locations.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:33.406
Now when I drop it in, the

00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:35.336
preview updates to show my new

00:03:35.336 --> 00:03:38.166
text, but even better, Xcode has

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:39.666
actually edited my code to add

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:40.246
that text.

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:42.816
Xcode has embedded these views

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:44.876
into a Vstack to get the layout

00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:45.336
that I want.

00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:48.196
Now a Vstack or vertical stack

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:49.646
is one of the common layout

00:03:49.686 --> 00:03:50.776
elements in SwiftUI.

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:52.786
It lets you stack views

00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:53.196
vertically.

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:55.396
And there's also an Hstack that

00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:56.546
stacks views horizontally.

00:03:57.616 --> 00:03:58.816
And these stacks are containers.

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.566
I can place any views that I

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:03.646
want inside of them.

00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:05.046
Now I'm going to replace this

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:06.426
placeholder that Xcode has given

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:07.636
me with some more information

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:08.486
about the room.

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:10.516
We'll show the number of people

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:10.996
that it can hold.

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:12.756
And for now, let's just use a

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:13.536
hard-coded value.

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:17.055
Next, let's add an image next to

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:17.606
our text.

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.606
I can make edits in the code

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:22.146
just as easily as in the editor.

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:24.366
So let's embed our view in an

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:24.656
Hstack.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.246
I can Command-click on my view

00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:29.456
and choose Embed an H Stack.

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:32.336
And Xcode has updated the code

00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:33.006
to do just that.

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:35.806
Now I can add an image next to

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:36.416
my Vstack.

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:38.886
We'll add some assets in a bit,

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:40.816
but for now I'll just use an SF

00:04:40.816 --> 00:04:42.316
symbol image to get something up

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:43.000
and running.

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.546
SF symbols are new in iOS 13.

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:50.696
They're a rich set of

00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:52.066
Apple-provided images that you

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:53.526
can use in your app.

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:55.836
And already we have a basic

00:04:55.836 --> 00:04:56.536
version of our cell.

00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.376
Now, I'll use the Canvas to

00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:00.576
style the cell the way I want.

00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:03.496
I can Command-click on my stack

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:06.416
and choose Inspect to see some

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:07.296
of the properties that I can

00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:08.116
change for this stack.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:10.676
I'm going to set its alignment

00:05:10.736 --> 00:05:11.296
to be leading.

00:05:11.836 --> 00:05:14.746
And, once again, Xcode has

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:16.236
updated my code to make that

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:16.626
change.

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:19.886
Now, I can also Command-click on

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:23.876
my text to inspect that as well.

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:24.986
And let's change this to be a

00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:25.636
smaller font.

00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:27.936
I'm going to use sub-headline.

00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:30.936
And one of the great things

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:33.046
about Xcode modifying my code is

00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:34.156
it helps me to learn about

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:34.546
SwiftUI.

00:05:34.546 --> 00:05:37.776
For example, here it's added

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.136
this code to change the font.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.156
We call these kinds of methods

00:05:41.356 --> 00:05:43.056
modifiers and they're used in

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:44.766
SwiftUI to customize the way

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:46.046
your views look or behave.

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:48.506
I'm going to add another

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:50.826
modifier in code to set the

00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:53.216
foreground color to be a

00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:54.000
secondary color.

00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:00.366
Okay. Now that I have my cell,

00:06:00.716 --> 00:06:01.596
let's put it into a list.

00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:03.946
To do that, I'm going to

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:06.366
Command-click on our cell and

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.656
just choose Convert To List.

00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:11.086
This wraps my cell in a list and

00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:12.896
shows five iterations of it.

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:18.566
[ Applause ]

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.156
It's great to be able to do this

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:21.566
so easily.

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:22.566
And this code is all that I need

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:23.626
to show a list in my app.

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:24.946
There's no delegates or data

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.686
sources necessary, just views

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.786
inside of a list.

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.416
Next, let's hook this up to some

00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:30.676
data.

00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:35.256
I'm going to drag in some assets

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:36.666
and a model file that I created

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:36.986
earlier.

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:44.556
Now my model has a few fields of

00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:45.666
information that we'll use.

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:48.156
And to use this in a list in

00:06:48.156 --> 00:06:49.846
SwiftUI, I just need to make

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:51.106
this type identifiable.

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:57.526
This lets Lists know which items

00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:58.226
are coming and going.

00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:00.796
And all I need is an ID property

00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:01.576
which we already have.

00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:04.486
Now this model file also

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:05.866
includes some test data that I

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:08.906
can use for debugging my app.

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:10.296
Now let's go back to our view

00:07:10.986 --> 00:07:13.256
and let's pass in our data.

00:07:14.646 --> 00:07:17.526
I'll add a property for my

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:18.406
rooms.

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:22.246
And one of the great things

00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:23.596
about previews is that they can

00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:24.556
use their own test data.

00:07:25.286 --> 00:07:26.536
So I'll just pass in my test

00:07:26.536 --> 00:07:27.256
data right here.

00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:31.756
Now you may have noticed that

00:07:31.756 --> 00:07:33.246
this banner appeared above my

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:33.626
preview.

00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:36.096
When I make larger changes to my

00:07:36.096 --> 00:07:37.776
types like adding this rooms

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:39.716
property to our view, Xcode

00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:41.126
pauses the previews until I'm

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:42.296
ready to have them resume

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:42.716
updating.

00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:44.736
And I can just click button to

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:45.186
resume.

00:07:45.656 --> 00:07:48.086
Next, let's use our data to

00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:48.766
drive the list.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:50.986
We'll pass in our rooms to the

00:07:50.986 --> 00:07:54.116
list and then I'll update our

00:07:54.116 --> 00:07:55.736
text to show the room's name.

00:07:56.596 --> 00:07:58.326
And we'll also use the real

00:07:58.326 --> 00:08:01.206
capacity right here in our text.

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:07.856
And now that we have real

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:09.566
images, let's also use our Rooms

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:10.676
thumbnail for the image.

00:08:17.056 --> 00:08:17.176
Great.

00:08:18.516 --> 00:08:25.546
[ Applause ]

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:26.626
And you may have noticed the

00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:27.576
subtle change that happened to

00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:28.446
our list when we did this.

00:08:28.546 --> 00:08:30.826
When we started, our cells were

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:32.265
the standard 44 points tall.

00:08:32.265 --> 00:08:34.015
But when we changed to these

00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:35.706
larger images, the cells

00:08:35.706 --> 00:08:37.176
automatically expanded to make

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:38.596
sure those images fit without

00:08:38.596 --> 00:08:39.976
any extra work.

00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:42.081
[ Applause ]

00:08:42.145 --> 00:08:42.655
It's pretty cool.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.031
[ Applause ]

00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:47.066
And now that I have these images

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:48.456
in context, they look a little

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:48.916
bit sharp.

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:50.956
So let's add a corner radius to

00:08:50.956 --> 00:08:52.066
our image using another

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:52.636
modifier.

00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:54.846
And if you're not sure about

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:56.096
what modifiers are available,

00:08:56.806 --> 00:08:58.466
you can view and filter a list

00:08:58.466 --> 00:08:59.296
of them right here in the

00:08:59.296 --> 00:08:59.716
library.

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.596
Let's find Corner Radius and

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:03.686
we'll just drag it onto our

00:09:04.566 --> 00:09:04.696
image.

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:12.606
[ Applause ]

00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:15.056
Then we can tweak the values.

00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:17.296
That looks a little bit too big.

00:09:17.296 --> 00:09:17.526
Great.

00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:19.626
And now that our cells and our

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:21.486
lists are looking good, the next

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:22.706
thing that we need is to be able

00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:23.996
to tap on a cell to see more

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:24.426
details.

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:27.406
To support this, let's wrap our

00:09:27.406 --> 00:09:28.676
list in a navigation view.

00:09:30.406 --> 00:09:31.566
A navigation view shows a

00:09:31.566 --> 00:09:33.706
navigation bar and also has a

00:09:33.776 --> 00:09:34.986
stack to push views onto.

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:37.736
Let's also set a navigation bar

00:09:37.736 --> 00:09:39.826
title and we'll just use some

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:42.436
text that says Rooms to show

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:43.616
Rooms in our navigation bar.

00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:47.896
Now let's set up our cell to

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:48.796
push onto this stack.

00:09:50.076 --> 00:09:51.986
To do that, I'll wrap our cells

00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:53.326
content in a Navigation button.

00:09:53.966 --> 00:09:56.816
A Navigation button takes a

00:09:56.816 --> 00:09:58.796
destination which is a view that

00:09:58.796 --> 00:09:59.826
will push onto the stack.

00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:02.066
And to start with, we'll just

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.436
use some text that shows the

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.056
room's name.

00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:06.916
Then we'll put all of our cell's

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:08.406
content inside of that

00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.636
navigation button and we're

00:10:10.836 --> 00:10:11.456
ready to go.

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:13.796
And notice that our UI has

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:15.206
updated to automatically show

00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:16.206
these UI indicators.

00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:18.516
SwiftUI handles details like

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:19.936
this for me automatically so

00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:21.256
that my UI automatically looks

00:10:21.256 --> 00:10:21.866
right by default.

00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:25.026
Now let's also check that the

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:25.986
cell behaves correctly.

00:10:26.796 --> 00:10:27.906
I can just click on this play

00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:29.676
button in my preview, which

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:30.556
takes me into Live Mode.

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:33.066
And when I do this, Xcode is

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.856
compiling my code, sending it

00:10:34.856 --> 00:10:36.276
over to the Simulator, running

00:10:36.276 --> 00:10:37.876
it for me and showing the result

00:10:37.956 --> 00:10:39.016
of all of that right here in the

00:10:39.016 --> 00:10:40.596
Canvas, which means I can

00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:41.456
interact with my view.

00:10:42.446 --> 00:10:44.146
So I can tap on a cell to make

00:10:44.146 --> 00:10:45.696
sure that everything pushes and

00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:47.266
pops as I expect.

00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:50.256
And if I swipe to pop, you'll

00:10:50.256 --> 00:10:51.776
notice an advanced behavior that

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:52.656
SwiftUI has given me

00:10:52.656 --> 00:10:53.286
automatically.

00:10:53.896 --> 00:10:56.016
Our cells stay highlighted, and

00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:57.056
as I swipe, they are

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.316
interactively un-highlight it

00:10:58.586 --> 00:10:59.886
without us doing any extra work.

[ Applause ]

00:11:08.706 --> 00:11:10.396
Okay, so we've got our list and

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:11.496
it's working with its cells.

00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.406
But this view code is a little

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.086
bit large now.

00:11:14.856 --> 00:11:15.826
And I'd really like to factor

00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:17.346
the cell out to be its own view.

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:19.346
And Xcode helps me do this with

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.416
one simple operation.

00:11:21.206 --> 00:11:22.796
I can just command click on the

00:11:22.796 --> 00:11:24.206

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:36.246
extracted out down here and I

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:37.426
even get to choose the name for

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:37.936
my new view.

00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:40.796

for our room.

00:11:49.406 --> 00:11:50.656

00:11:56.426 --> 00:11:58.056
And with SwiftUI, views are

00:11:58.056 --> 00:11:59.316
really lightweight so you don't

00:11:59.316 --> 00:12:00.496
have to worry about creating

00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:01.686
extra views to better

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:02.896
encapsulate or separate your

00:12:02.896 --> 00:12:03.186
logic.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.676
Okay, next let's build our

00:12:06.676 --> 00:12:07.246
detail view.

00:12:07.906 --> 00:12:09.716
I'm going to create a new view

00:12:10.736 --> 00:12:11.896
and make sure to use the SwiftUI

00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:12.266
Template.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:15.336
And let's call this new view

00:12:15.486 --> 00:12:15.976
Room Detail.

00:12:20.216 --> 00:12:21.946
Xcode has automatically given me

00:12:21.946 --> 00:12:24.006
a new ViewStruct and also the

00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:25.406
preview code to create it.

00:12:26.386 --> 00:12:27.456
Now since I want this detail

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:28.626
view to show more information

00:12:28.626 --> 00:12:30.186
about my room, I'll add a

00:12:30.186 --> 00:12:30.976
property for the room.

00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:34.876
And just like I did before, I'll

00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:36.686
update my preview code to pass

00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:38.496
in one of our rooms from their

00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:39.686
test data.

00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:44.946
Then let's build our UI.

00:12:46.186 --> 00:12:48.396
We use an image and we'll show

00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:49.516
the room's image name.

00:12:53.396 --> 00:12:54.526
Okay, now we're showing our

00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:55.856
image but it's a little bit too

00:12:55.856 --> 00:12:56.576
large for our view.

00:12:57.616 --> 00:12:59.496
By default, SwiftUI shows all

00:12:59.496 --> 00:13:00.606
images at the size of their

00:13:00.606 --> 00:13:02.336
contents to prevent visual

00:13:02.336 --> 00:13:03.836
artifacts from scaling the image

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:04.496
up or down.

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:06.896
But for photos like this one, we

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:08.546
want to be able to resize them

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:08.896
down.

00:13:09.276 --> 00:13:10.676
And we can use an image-specific

00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:13.336
modifier called Resizable to do

00:13:13.336 --> 00:13:13.546
that.

00:13:15.126 --> 00:13:16.266
So I'll just drag this onto our

00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:19.866
view and all right, now it's

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:21.846
resizing to fill the size that

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:22.156
we have.

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:23.986
But really we want it to

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:25.456
maintain this original aspect

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:25.866
ratio.

00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:27.516
And we can do that with another

00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:29.766
modifier, this time aspect

00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:29.976
ratio.

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:34.346
And the aspect ratio modifier

00:13:34.386 --> 00:13:36.126
lets me choose between .fill,

00:13:36.976 --> 00:13:38.536
which expands the image to take

00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:41.346
up its entire frame, or .fit,

00:13:42.616 --> 00:13:43.846
which makes sure the image fits

00:13:43.846 --> 00:13:44.506
within the frame.

00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:48.106
And previews let me really

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:49.316
easily see and understand the

00:13:49.316 --> 00:13:50.076
difference between these

00:13:50.076 --> 00:13:50.576
different modes.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.276
For now, let's use Fit so we can

00:13:53.276 --> 00:13:54.056
see the full image.

00:13:55.526 --> 00:13:56.736
Now let's go back to our list

00:13:57.396 --> 00:13:58.706
and update our cell to push our

00:13:58.706 --> 00:13:59.376
new detail view.

00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:03.086
We'll create our Room Detail

00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:05.226
view and we'll just pass in the

00:14:05.226 --> 00:14:05.716
current room.

00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:10.076
Now I'll switch my preview back

00:14:10.076 --> 00:14:10.666
into live mode.

00:14:12.096 --> 00:14:13.786
And I can tap on my cell to see

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:14.246
our image.

00:14:15.416 --> 00:14:16.326
But now that I'm previewing it

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:18.076
here, I can see that I forgot to

00:14:18.076 --> 00:14:19.346
set the title in the navigation

00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:19.536
bar.

00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:21.276
So let's go back to our detail

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:21.956
view and fix that.

00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:27.246
Just like before, I can use the

00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:29.336
navigation bar title to set our

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:32.356
title and we'll pass in our

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:33.706
room's name as the title.

00:14:34.446 --> 00:14:36.196
But in the preview that I have

00:14:36.196 --> 00:14:37.476
here, we're only seeing the view

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.076
itself and I'd really like to be

00:14:39.076 --> 00:14:40.146
able to quickly verify my

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:40.606
change.

00:14:41.646 --> 00:14:42.886
Well, since previews have all

00:14:42.886 --> 00:14:44.206
the power of SwiftUI's views

00:14:44.206 --> 00:14:45.666
available, we can do just that.

00:14:46.856 --> 00:14:49.156
I can set up my preview to be

00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:50.426
inside of a navigation view

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:52.506
using the same code that I would

00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:53.036
anywhere else.

00:14:53.806 --> 00:14:55.706
And now my view's preview is

00:14:55.706 --> 00:14:58.446
inside of a navigation bar.

00:14:59.516 --> 00:15:03.776
[ Applause ]

00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:05.376
And now that I'm seeing it here,

00:15:05.536 --> 00:15:06.996
this large title looks like a

00:15:06.996 --> 00:15:07.826
little bit too much for our

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:08.366
detail view.

00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:10.346
So let's update our navigation

00:15:10.346 --> 00:15:12.346
bar title to set the display

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:13.236
mode to be inline.

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:15.576
Much better.

00:15:17.056 --> 00:15:18.216
Now when I'm picking a good

00:15:18.216 --> 00:15:19.446
conference room, there's one

00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:20.346
thing that's very important to

00:15:20.346 --> 00:15:20.476
me.

00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:22.376
The room has to have a good

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:22.726
table.

00:15:23.406 --> 00:15:24.356
I just can't focus on what

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:25.576
anyone is saying if the table

00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:26.596
isn't of the highest quality.

00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:29.086
[ Laughter ]

00:15:29.086 --> 00:15:30.156
And I can see that there's some

00:15:30.156 --> 00:15:31.946
kind of table in this room, but

00:15:31.946 --> 00:15:33.046
I really can't see its details

00:15:33.046 --> 00:15:33.426
well enough.

00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:35.896
But when the image was in Fill,

00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:38.246
I could see it nice and close.

00:15:38.856 --> 00:15:39.696
Look at that wood grain.

00:15:39.696 --> 00:15:43.196
So I'd like to be able to change

00:15:43.196 --> 00:15:44.906
back and forth between Fill to

00:15:44.906 --> 00:15:46.756
see the details of the room and

00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:48.426
Fit to see everything at once.

00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:51.276
But how do I actually change

00:15:51.276 --> 00:15:53.056
this aspect ratio's content mode

00:15:53.296 --> 00:15:54.176
from within my view?

00:15:55.146 --> 00:15:56.256
Well, to understand how to do

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:57.436
this, we really need to know

00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:59.006
more about how views work in

00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:00.036
SwiftUI and why.

00:16:00.696 --> 00:16:01.986
And so I'm going to invite Kyle

00:16:01.986 --> 00:16:03.456
to the stage to talk about that.

00:16:04.126 --> 00:16:04.376
Kyle?

00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:07.176
>> Well, hello, WWDC.

00:16:08.516 --> 00:16:12.576
[ Applause ]

00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:14.516
What does everyone think of

00:16:14.596 --> 00:16:14.976
SwiftUI so far?

00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:17.101
[ Applause ]

00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:18.426
Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.

00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:20.946
It's a little magical though.

00:16:21.076 --> 00:16:23.446
And so before we go any further,

00:16:23.446 --> 00:16:24.626
we're going to take a step back

00:16:25.106 --> 00:16:27.016
and talk about the way views

00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:28.476
work and why in SwiftUI.

00:16:29.996 --> 00:16:32.016
So we left off here implementing

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:32.806
Room Detail view.

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.396
In SwiftUI, a view is a struct

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:37.636
that conforms to the view

00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:39.736
protocol, rather than a class

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:41.186
that inherits from a base class

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:41.986
like UI view.

00:16:43.386 --> 00:16:44.516
This means your view doesn't

00:16:44.516 --> 00:16:45.916
inherit any stored properties.

00:16:46.626 --> 00:16:48.276
It's allocated on the stack and

00:16:48.276 --> 00:16:49.096
it's passed by value.

00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:52.216
Room Detail just stores a room,

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:54.416
so it's the size and weight of a

00:16:54.416 --> 00:16:54.726
room.

00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:56.846
No additional allocation or

00:16:56.846 --> 00:16:57.946
reference counting overhead.

00:17:00.046 --> 00:17:01.826
Behind the scenes, SwiftUI

00:17:01.866 --> 00:17:03.336
aggressively collapses your view

00:17:03.336 --> 00:17:05.286
hierarchy into an efficient data

00:17:05.286 --> 00:17:06.326
structure for rendering.

00:17:07.016 --> 00:17:08.636
Because of this, we make liberal

00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:11.136
use of small single-purpose

00:17:11.136 --> 00:17:13.046
views in SwiftUI, and you should

00:17:13.046 --> 00:17:13.506
too.

00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:15.965
What I want you to take away

00:17:15.965 --> 00:17:18.236
from the last couple slides is

00:17:18.536 --> 00:17:20.586
that views in SwiftUI are

00:17:20.586 --> 00:17:21.856
incredibly lightweight.

00:17:22.726 --> 00:17:24.586
As Jacob said, you should never

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.445
hesitate to refactor your

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:29.176
SwiftUI code because extracting

00:17:29.176 --> 00:17:30.676
a subview has virtually no

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:31.486
runtime overhead.

00:17:34.046 --> 00:17:34.636
Yeah, you can clap for that,

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:35.256
it's pretty great.

00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:38.696
[ Applause ]

00:17:39.196 --> 00:17:41.916
So a view in SwifthUI and a view

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:43.286
in a traditional UI framework

00:17:43.436 --> 00:17:44.936
fulfill the same primary role.

00:17:45.556 --> 00:17:47.426
They define a piece of UI.

00:17:48.136 --> 00:17:51.076
The view protocol only has a

00:17:51.076 --> 00:17:52.766
single requirement: a body

00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:54.626
property, which is, itself, a

00:17:54.626 --> 00:17:54.886
view.

00:17:55.436 --> 00:17:57.896
You build bigger views in

00:17:57.896 --> 00:17:59.416
SwiftUI by composing together

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:00.226
smaller views.

00:18:00.616 --> 00:18:02.116
We built Room Detail by

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:04.596
composing together image, a view

00:18:04.596 --> 00:18:05.616
of an image at its native

00:18:05.616 --> 00:18:08.736
resolution, resizable which

00:18:08.736 --> 00:18:10.916
opted it into stretch in either

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:14.156
dimension; and aspect ratio, a

00:18:14.156 --> 00:18:16.106
view that proportionally scales

00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:17.826
its child.

00:18:17.976 --> 00:18:19.306
The rendering of any view you

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:21.366
build is just the rendering of

00:18:21.996 --> 00:18:23.476
its body.

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:25.586
So if you set a break point and

00:18:25.586 --> 00:18:27.426
the debugger stops there, it

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:30.256
means the framework has decided

00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:31.736
it needs a fresh rendering of

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:31.976
your view.

00:18:35.046 --> 00:18:35.366
Tada.

00:18:38.046 --> 00:18:38.226
All right.

00:18:38.426 --> 00:18:41.566
So the framework knows when to

00:18:41.566 --> 00:18:43.256
fetch a new rendering of a view

00:18:43.626 --> 00:18:45.386
because in addition to defining

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:47.796
a piece of UI, in SwiftUI, a

00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:49.586
view defines its dependencies.

00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.016
Let's extend Room Detail to

00:18:53.016 --> 00:18:55.676
allow the user to toggle between

00:18:55.856 --> 00:18:58.756
fitting into and filling up the

00:18:58.756 --> 00:19:01.386
available space so Jacob can get

00:19:01.386 --> 00:19:02.546
a good look at that wood grain.

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:05.616
So, the first thing we'll need

00:19:06.056 --> 00:19:07.616
is a property, but it's a

00:19:07.616 --> 00:19:08.486
special property.

00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:10.526
It's a state property and it

00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:11.976
says whether or not the image is

00:19:11.976 --> 00:19:12.286
zoomed.

00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:15.356
When SwiftUI sees a view with a

00:19:15.356 --> 00:19:17.116
state variable, it allocates

00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:18.596
storage for that variable on the

00:19:18.596 --> 00:19:19.396
view's behalf.

00:19:19.856 --> 00:19:21.586
In this Memory diagram, the

00:19:21.586 --> 00:19:23.706
green is your app's memory, and

00:19:23.706 --> 00:19:25.456
purple is memory SwiftUI is

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:25.936
managing.

00:19:26.186 --> 00:19:27.766
And so this value of the zoom

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:29.716
variable, we got you covered.

00:19:33.086 --> 00:19:35.486
So if you decide to fill or fit

00:19:35.606 --> 00:19:38.576
based on that variable, then

00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:39.666
we've got a view that renders

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:41.766
like this when it's zoomed and

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:44.126
like this when it isn't.

00:19:45.396 --> 00:19:46.956
So, now, all we need is a

00:19:46.956 --> 00:19:51.186
tapAction to toggle back and

00:19:51.186 --> 00:19:52.436
forth between the two states.

00:19:52.866 --> 00:19:54.876
And then on tap, the image will

00:19:54.876 --> 00:19:58.806
zoom to Fill and shrink to Fit.

00:20:00.516 --> 00:20:09.126
[ Applause ]

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.056
So what actually is happening

00:20:12.746 --> 00:20:15.036
when we tap here?

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.506
Well, one of the special

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:18.686
properties of state variables is

00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:20.246
that SwiftUI can observe when

00:20:20.246 --> 00:20:21.216
they're read and written.

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:23.586
Because SwiftUI knows that Zoom

00:20:23.586 --> 00:20:26.456
here was read in body, it knows

00:20:26.456 --> 00:20:27.406
that the view's rendering

00:20:27.406 --> 00:20:30.976
depends on it, which means when

00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:32.646
the variable changes, the

00:20:32.646 --> 00:20:34.066
framework is going to ask for

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.356
body again using the new state

00:20:36.356 --> 00:20:36.686
value.

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:40.046
So it can refresh the rendering

00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:41.806
this time with a different

00:20:41.806 --> 00:20:42.426
content mode.

00:20:46.046 --> 00:20:47.716
So, traditional UI frameworks

00:20:47.756 --> 00:20:49.616
don't distinguish between state

00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:50.806
variables and plain old

00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:51.406
properties.

00:20:51.726 --> 00:20:53.616
But I've found this distinction

00:20:53.616 --> 00:20:55.116
to be incredibly clarifying.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:21:00.196
In SwiftUI, every possible state

00:21:00.196 --> 00:21:01.796
your UI might find itself in,

00:21:02.516 --> 00:21:04.926
the offset of a scroll view, the

00:21:04.926 --> 00:21:07.496
highlightedness of a button, the

00:21:07.496 --> 00:21:09.256
contents of a navigation stack.

00:21:10.126 --> 00:21:11.056
It's derived from an

00:21:11.056 --> 00:21:12.526
authoritative piece of data,

00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:15.216
often called a Source of Truth.

00:21:16.256 --> 00:21:17.596
Collectively, your state

00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:19.056
variables and your model

00:21:19.276 --> 00:21:20.996
constitute your Source of Truth

00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:23.256
for your entire application.

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:25.436
Earlier, I mentioned that this

00:21:25.436 --> 00:21:27.006
call to aspect ratio makes a

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:27.326
view.

00:21:28.736 --> 00:21:29.926
Its definition looks something

00:21:29.926 --> 00:21:32.956
like this, where content mode is

00:21:32.956 --> 00:21:34.726
a plain old Swift property.

00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:38.136
You can neatly classify every

00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:40.116
property as either a source of

00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:42.236
truth or a derived value.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.236
The Zoom state variable is a

00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:46.786
Source of Truth.

00:21:47.416 --> 00:21:49.526
The Content Mode property is

00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:50.826
derived from it.

00:21:51.696 --> 00:21:54.276
Recall SwiftUI can observe when

00:21:54.276 --> 00:21:55.776
state variables are read and

00:21:55.776 --> 00:21:56.176
written.

00:21:56.466 --> 00:21:58.266
So when one changes, it knows

00:21:58.266 --> 00:21:59.586
which renderings to refresh.

00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:01.936
The framework refreshes the

00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:03.676
rendering by asking for a new

00:22:03.676 --> 00:22:06.696
body, making a new aspect ratio

00:22:06.696 --> 00:22:08.656
view from scratch, thereby

00:22:08.756 --> 00:22:10.376
overriding the Content Mode and

00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:11.526
any other stored properties.

00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:14.846
This is the mechanism by which

00:22:14.976 --> 00:22:17.126
all derived values in SwiftUI

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:19.856
are kept up-to-date.

00:22:19.976 --> 00:22:22.266
So we've seen how we can declare

00:22:22.566 --> 00:22:24.536
a Source of Truth using a state

00:22:24.536 --> 00:22:27.346
variable, and that every plain

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.346
old property is a derived value.

00:22:30.376 --> 00:22:31.066
We're not going to see an

00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:33.356
example in this talk, but Swift

00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:34.756
gives you a tool called Binding,

00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:37.036
which is great for passing

00:22:37.036 --> 00:22:38.546
read/write derived values.

00:22:39.236 --> 00:22:41.166
And technically any constant can

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:42.506
serve as a perfectly good

00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:44.446
read-only Source of Truth as we

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:45.986
saw with the test data driving

00:22:45.986 --> 00:22:46.656
our previews.

00:22:47.296 --> 00:22:48.596
Now there's one more I want to

00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:49.896
call out, and I mentioned a

00:22:49.896 --> 00:22:51.726
second ago that collectively

00:22:51.816 --> 00:22:53.216
your state variables and your

00:22:53.216 --> 00:22:54.746
model constitute the Source of

00:22:54.746 --> 00:22:56.606
Truth for your entire app.

00:22:56.606 --> 00:22:57.646
And so we have this bindable

00:22:57.646 --> 00:22:59.656
object protocol Jacob used

00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.956
earlier to teach SwiftUI about

00:23:02.036 --> 00:23:03.596
how to observe changes from our

00:23:03.596 --> 00:23:03.966
model.

00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:07.816
This might be a lot really

00:23:07.816 --> 00:23:08.836
quickly, and so we have an

00:23:08.836 --> 00:23:11.676
entire talk later this week

00:23:11.676 --> 00:23:13.336
dedicated to developing your

00:23:13.336 --> 00:23:14.996
intuition about these different

00:23:14.996 --> 00:23:15.706
flow primitives.

00:23:18.056 --> 00:23:19.896
All right, let's step back and

00:23:19.896 --> 00:23:20.466
take stock.

00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:24.286
This is really different from

00:23:24.376 --> 00:23:25.806
what you do in a traditional

00:23:25.806 --> 00:23:27.306
life framework where the views

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:28.886
themselves persist and you try

00:23:28.886 --> 00:23:30.096
your hardest to keep them all up

00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:31.006
to date.

00:23:32.396 --> 00:23:34.396
You may not think about it this

00:23:34.396 --> 00:23:35.676
way when you use a traditional

00:23:35.676 --> 00:23:38.156
UI framework, but every time a

00:23:38.156 --> 00:23:40.216
view reads a piece of data, it's

00:23:40.216 --> 00:23:41.986
creating an implicit dependency.

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:44.106
It's a dependency because when

00:23:44.106 --> 00:23:45.976
that data changes, the view

00:23:45.976 --> 00:23:47.936
needs to update to reflect the

00:23:47.936 --> 00:23:48.566
new value.

00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:51.466
And when it fails to, that's a

00:23:51.466 --> 00:23:51.766
bug.

00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:55.006
SwiftUI automatically manages

00:23:55.006 --> 00:23:57.396
dependencies on your behalf by

00:23:57.396 --> 00:23:58.896
recomputing the appropriate

00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:00.526
derived values so this never

00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:00.976
happens again.

00:24:01.516 --> 00:24:07.936
[ Applause ]

00:24:08.436 --> 00:24:10.266
Of course, we don't just manage

00:24:10.336 --> 00:24:13.086
a single dependency at a time in

00:24:13.086 --> 00:24:14.146
our apps.

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:15.636
Our apps are big.

00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:17.096
They're complicated.

00:24:18.196 --> 00:24:19.326
When it comes to how much you

00:24:19.326 --> 00:24:20.866
have to hold in your head and

00:24:20.866 --> 00:24:22.156
how easy it is to make a

00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:24.246
mistake, the way we manually

00:24:24.246 --> 00:24:26.206
manage dependencies today, it's

00:24:26.206 --> 00:24:26.736
really hard.

00:24:27.686 --> 00:24:29.706
Despite my best efforts, every

00:24:29.706 --> 00:24:31.866
update to every app I've ever

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:33.276
shipped has had UI bugs.

00:24:34.096 --> 00:24:36.216
Every one of these lines is a

00:24:36.216 --> 00:24:36.866
dependency.

00:24:37.436 --> 00:24:39.516
And it's just the start.

00:24:42.086 --> 00:24:43.446
The thing I find the hardest

00:24:43.576 --> 00:24:45.316
about managing the complexity of

00:24:45.316 --> 00:24:47.666
my views is dealing with all the

00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:48.916
possible orders the different

00:24:48.916 --> 00:24:50.206
callbacks can get called in.

00:24:50.596 --> 00:24:53.526
So here's an old version of the

00:24:53.526 --> 00:24:54.906
room detail view that was

00:24:54.906 --> 00:24:56.536
implemented in UIKit.

00:24:57.096 --> 00:25:00.016
It had the same features as the

00:25:00.016 --> 00:25:01.596
one we've seen so far has, but

00:25:01.596 --> 00:25:03.006
it had one more.

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.486
Every once in a while, when we

00:25:06.486 --> 00:25:08.056
zoom in on a conference room

00:25:08.056 --> 00:25:09.996
image, it was too blurry to make

00:25:09.996 --> 00:25:11.246
out the wood grain on the table.

00:25:12.426 --> 00:25:14.476
And so we decided to add a

00:25:14.476 --> 00:25:16.326
special feature using neural

00:25:16.326 --> 00:25:18.316
networks and machine learning so

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:20.906
we could tap to enhance the

00:25:20.906 --> 00:25:23.946
image on a background thread and

00:25:23.946 --> 00:25:26.586
thus choose the right conference

00:25:26.586 --> 00:25:26.826
room.

00:25:30.076 --> 00:25:30.496
All right, yeah.

00:25:31.346 --> 00:25:32.236
Over-engineering, right?

00:25:33.606 --> 00:25:34.786
So there's only one problem with

00:25:34.786 --> 00:25:36.886
this feature and that's it had a

00:25:36.886 --> 00:25:37.146
bug.

00:25:37.526 --> 00:25:38.876
We got a report of a stray

00:25:38.876 --> 00:25:40.356
activity indicator that never

00:25:40.356 --> 00:25:41.066
stops spinning.

00:25:42.276 --> 00:25:43.266
How'd this happen?

00:25:44.076 --> 00:25:45.926
Well, it turns out if the events

00:25:45.956 --> 00:25:48.456
fired in a specific order, we

00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:51.956
forgot to clean up that activity

00:25:51.956 --> 00:25:52.446
indicator.

00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:54.806
In this case, if the user zoomed

00:25:54.806 --> 00:25:56.326
out and tapped the enhance

00:25:56.326 --> 00:25:59.056
button as it was animating away,

00:25:59.336 --> 00:26:00.776
the activity indicator would get

00:26:00.776 --> 00:26:01.066
stuck.

00:26:02.046 --> 00:26:03.716
These kinds of mistakes are easy

00:26:03.716 --> 00:26:05.066
to make when you mutate your

00:26:05.066 --> 00:26:06.976
subviews directly from event

00:26:06.976 --> 00:26:10.146
handler callbacks rather than

00:26:10.246 --> 00:26:12.016
updating your Source of Truth

00:26:12.306 --> 00:26:15.866
and deriving your UI from that.

00:26:17.636 --> 00:26:19.606
Now we make this mistake because

00:26:19.606 --> 00:26:20.676
when we're coding this code,

00:26:20.726 --> 00:26:22.076
it's really easy to only think

00:26:22.076 --> 00:26:22.806
about the happy path.

00:26:23.616 --> 00:26:25.106
Those are the ones that come

00:26:25.596 --> 00:26:26.906
easily to mind.

00:26:26.906 --> 00:26:28.106
And it's really easy to overlook

00:26:28.106 --> 00:26:29.436
the unhappy ones that don't.

00:26:30.056 --> 00:26:31.466
The problem is that as the

00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:33.966
number of possible events our

00:26:33.966 --> 00:26:37.086
view can respond to grows, the

00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:38.416
number of unhappy paths

00:26:38.536 --> 00:26:39.426
explodes.

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:42.456
Assume you get all four of these

00:26:42.456 --> 00:26:44.346
events, how many different

00:26:44.346 --> 00:26:45.646
possible orders are there that

00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:46.216
they could come in?

00:26:46.746 --> 00:26:49.726
Well, there's actually 24

00:26:49.726 --> 00:26:51.746
different orders for any four

00:26:51.746 --> 00:26:52.246
events.

00:26:52.806 --> 00:26:54.406
And in practice, it's even worse

00:26:54.456 --> 00:26:56.556
than that because every event

00:26:56.556 --> 00:26:57.846
can come in more than one time.

00:26:58.356 --> 00:26:59.836
Say for example a user is

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:01.156
mashing the enhance button.

00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:03.526
The challenge of managing this

00:27:03.526 --> 00:27:05.376
should be familiar to anyone

00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:06.536
who's ever implemented an

00:27:06.536 --> 00:27:08.156
interruptable animation where

00:27:08.156 --> 00:27:09.476
the completion handler can come

00:27:09.476 --> 00:27:11.006
in at a really unexpected time.

00:27:12.296 --> 00:27:13.856
If I could tell myself from five

00:27:13.856 --> 00:27:16.906
years ago anything about my job,

00:27:16.906 --> 00:27:18.666
it would be that UI programming

00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:20.506
is really hard.

00:27:20.946 --> 00:27:22.976
Like log-free concurrency hard.

00:27:25.046 --> 00:27:26.296
How many of you have written

00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:27.266
multi-threaded code?

00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:30.226
Probably all 2,000 of you, yeah.

00:27:30.826 --> 00:27:32.646
So no one pretends that's easy.

00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:34.606
It's taken me months to shake

00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:36.776
out all the bugs in some of my

00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:38.026
multi-threaded code, and even

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:39.796
then I wasn't 100% confident in

00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:40.546
its correctness.

00:27:41.086 --> 00:27:44.096
A lot of UI code is actually

00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:46.706
just like that, only instead of

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:48.616
a crash, your view ends up in

00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:49.906
the wrong place, or it's

00:27:49.906 --> 00:27:50.246
missing.

00:27:51.296 --> 00:27:52.916
This is because race conditions

00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:55.056
and UI inconsistencies share the

00:27:55.056 --> 00:27:56.426
same underlying source of

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:57.096
complexity.

00:27:57.626 --> 00:27:59.676
These easy-to-overlook

00:27:59.846 --> 00:28:00.446
orderings.

00:28:00.506 --> 00:28:03.676
Many of the views we all work on

00:28:04.176 --> 00:28:07.396
have way more than four events.

00:28:07.956 --> 00:28:09.976
You know, like model

00:28:09.976 --> 00:28:12.016
notifications, delegate methods,

00:28:12.106 --> 00:28:13.876
target actions, completion

00:28:13.876 --> 00:28:14.256
handlers.

00:28:14.416 --> 00:28:15.376
They're all events.

00:28:16.246 --> 00:28:18.396
A view with 12 would roughly

00:28:18.426 --> 00:28:20.546
equate to 12 factorial possible

00:28:20.546 --> 00:28:20.976
orderings.

00:28:21.596 --> 00:28:22.976
That's almost half a billion.

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:26.786
We've all worked on views with

00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:27.876
12 event handlers.

00:28:29.136 --> 00:28:30.956
So you can only fit so much in

00:28:30.956 --> 00:28:32.696
your head at a time.

00:28:35.056 --> 00:28:37.896
Yeah. This dotted line is one of

00:28:37.896 --> 00:28:40.406
the views in your app.

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:41.966
What do people think the

00:28:41.966 --> 00:28:42.756
difference between those two

00:28:42.756 --> 00:28:43.396
dots is?

00:28:45.486 --> 00:28:48.886
Anyone? Those are the bugs, yes.

00:28:49.876 --> 00:28:51.946
So as we add features, the

00:28:51.946 --> 00:28:53.696
number of possible orderings we

00:28:53.696 --> 00:28:56.436
have to think of increases

00:28:56.546 --> 00:28:57.386
exponentially.

00:28:57.386 --> 00:28:58.686
And the chance we overlook one

00:29:00.176 --> 00:29:01.056
-- it's the same.

00:29:01.316 --> 00:29:01.936
It's inevitable.

00:29:04.246 --> 00:29:06.246
So I imagine many of you

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:08.416
instinctively have reached for a

00:29:08.416 --> 00:29:10.346
way to handle this complexity in

00:29:10.346 --> 00:29:11.956
UIKit or AppKit when you program

00:29:11.956 --> 00:29:14.486
today, which is to collect all

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:15.766
your view update code in a

00:29:15.766 --> 00:29:16.516
single method.

00:29:17.226 --> 00:29:18.246
And then from these event

00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:20.006
handler callbacks, you call that

00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:20.576
one method.

00:29:21.366 --> 00:29:22.956
It's a really great way for the

00:29:22.956 --> 00:29:24.396
complexity to not explode on

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:24.463
you.

00:29:25.336 --> 00:29:26.846
Well, SwiftUI was heavily

00:29:26.846 --> 00:29:28.586
inspired by this best practice.

00:29:29.806 --> 00:29:31.486
When you are trying to implement

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:33.636
a view this way in UI today,

00:29:33.846 --> 00:29:34.956
there's all these tricky cases

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:36.136
you need to think about like

00:29:36.216 --> 00:29:37.456
adding or removing a subview

00:29:37.456 --> 00:29:38.726
from the view hierarchy, or

00:29:38.726 --> 00:29:39.696
pushing and popping off the

00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:40.506
navigation stack.

00:29:40.736 --> 00:29:42.126
Or performing updates to a table

00:29:42.126 --> 00:29:42.336
view.

00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:44.246
I was never able to figure out

00:29:44.366 --> 00:29:45.886
all of those cases all on my

00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:46.186
own.

00:29:47.236 --> 00:29:49.886
Well, we've spent all the time

00:29:49.886 --> 00:29:51.186
and done all the work and we've

00:29:51.186 --> 00:29:53.356
codified this best practice into

00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:54.296
SwiftUI on your behalf.

00:29:55.186 --> 00:29:56.716
The view protocol only has a

00:29:56.876 --> 00:29:58.506
single requirement: body.

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:00.816
A single entry point that the

00:30:00.816 --> 00:30:01.696
framework calls.

00:30:02.226 --> 00:30:04.826
That means there's only one

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.716
possible order it can ever get

00:30:06.716 --> 00:30:07.906
called in.

[ Applause ]

00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:19.066
Because of this pattern of

00:30:19.106 --> 00:30:20.656
simply fetching new views for

00:30:20.656 --> 00:30:21.586
the parts of the UI that

00:30:21.616 --> 00:30:25.156
changed, SwiftUI scales with

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.956
your brain, virtually

00:30:26.956 --> 00:30:28.986
eliminating UI inconsistencies.

00:30:30.546 --> 00:30:30.976
All right.

[ Applause ]

00:30:32.126 --> 00:30:33.306
Let's get back to the demo and

00:30:33.306 --> 00:30:34.406
finish the Room Detail view.

00:30:35.006 --> 00:30:35.346
Jacob?

00:30:42.066 --> 00:30:42.976
>> Okay, let's finish this app.

00:30:44.346 --> 00:30:45.636
Now, we know how to set up our

00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:46.646
view to zoom in.

00:30:47.886 --> 00:30:48.956
We'll add a state property.

00:30:52.166 --> 00:30:53.426
And we'll call it Zoomed and

00:30:53.876 --> 00:30:54.956
we'll default it to false.

00:30:56.456 --> 00:30:59.136
Then in our aspect ratio we'll

00:30:59.136 --> 00:31:00.836
use the Zoomed property to

00:31:00.836 --> 00:31:02.146
change between Fill when we're

00:31:02.146 --> 00:31:03.756
zoomed and Fit otherwise.

00:31:05.206 --> 00:31:06.526
And finally, we'll add our

00:31:06.526 --> 00:31:08.936
tapAction to toggle that Zoomed

00:31:08.936 --> 00:31:09.296
property.

00:31:13.276 --> 00:31:14.406
Now let's try it out in Live

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:14.596
Mode.

00:31:19.316 --> 00:31:20.726
Great, we can switch between

00:31:20.726 --> 00:31:21.556
these two different modes.

00:31:22.966 --> 00:31:24.096
But there's something missing

00:31:24.096 --> 00:31:24.346
here.

00:31:24.846 --> 00:31:25.876
Does anybody see it?

00:31:28.046 --> 00:31:28.676
That's right, it needs an

00:31:28.676 --> 00:31:29.186
animation.

00:31:29.186 --> 00:31:32.216
And with SwiftUI, animation's

00:31:32.216 --> 00:31:33.236
really easy to add.

00:31:34.486 --> 00:31:36.046
I can just wrap my change in a

00:31:36.046 --> 00:31:36.976
call to WithAnimation.

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:43.826
And now my change is animated.

00:31:44.516 --> 00:31:50.546
[ Applause ]

00:31:51.046 --> 00:31:52.746
And not only that, the animation

00:31:52.746 --> 00:31:53.706
is fully interactive and

00:31:53.706 --> 00:31:55.186
interruptible so I can always

00:31:55.186 --> 00:31:56.086
change between the different

00:31:56.086 --> 00:31:57.966
states and it always ends up in

00:31:57.966 --> 00:31:59.306
the right place.

[ Applause ]

00:32:02.186 --> 00:32:02.556
Yeah, it's great.

00:32:03.516 --> 00:32:05.646
[ Applause ]

00:32:06.146 --> 00:32:07.526
Now I would add the Enhance

00:32:07.526 --> 00:32:09.346
button next, but it turns out

00:32:09.476 --> 00:32:10.426
that the way Kyle trained the

00:32:10.426 --> 00:32:12.156
model, it only ever worked on

00:32:12.156 --> 00:32:13.226
that one image that he showed.

00:32:13.676 --> 00:32:16.096
So I'm going to add something

00:32:16.096 --> 00:32:16.556
more useful.

00:32:17.926 --> 00:32:19.166
One of our coworkers is in

00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:20.736
London so we often want to know

00:32:20.736 --> 00:32:21.576
which rooms have video

00:32:21.576 --> 00:32:22.066
conferencing.

00:32:23.196 --> 00:32:24.416
So let's show an icon for that

00:32:24.476 --> 00:32:25.726
on top of our detail view.

00:32:27.186 --> 00:32:29.546
I can use a Zstack to show views

00:32:29.606 --> 00:32:30.556
stacked on top of each other.

00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:35.856
So I'll put our existing image

00:32:35.856 --> 00:32:38.486
inside of that Zstack and then

00:32:38.616 --> 00:32:40.616
I'll add another image to show

00:32:40.616 --> 00:32:42.086
an icon for whether the room has

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:43.366
video or not.

00:32:44.236 --> 00:32:46.426
I'll just use a symbol image and

00:32:47.536 --> 00:32:49.416
we'll use Video.fill.

00:32:51.496 --> 00:32:52.816
Okay, we have our icon here, but

00:32:52.886 --> 00:32:54.016
it's a little bit small.

00:32:55.166 --> 00:32:56.436
But symbol images automatically

00:32:56.436 --> 00:32:57.826
use the current font to size

00:32:57.826 --> 00:32:59.306
themselves, so I can easily

00:32:59.306 --> 00:33:01.106
change to a larger font with a

00:33:01.106 --> 00:33:01.576
modifier.

00:33:02.196 --> 00:33:04.316
We'll just drag this into our

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:06.246
code and apply it to the image.

00:33:07.096 --> 00:33:07.886
And Title sounds good.

00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:10.316
Now we've got our larger image.

00:33:11.366 --> 00:33:12.606
Next, I want this image to be in

00:33:12.606 --> 00:33:13.186
the top-left.

00:33:13.986 --> 00:33:15.036
So let's set our Zstack's

00:33:15.036 --> 00:33:18.386
alignment to be topLeading.

00:33:19.076 --> 00:33:21.916
Okay. Next let's add some

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:23.416
padding so that this is not up

00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:24.116
against the edge here.

00:33:25.166 --> 00:33:26.676
Again, we can use a modifier to

00:33:26.676 --> 00:33:26.966
do this.

00:33:28.376 --> 00:33:29.596
And we'll just drag it in onto

00:33:29.596 --> 00:33:30.316
our system image.

00:33:30.846 --> 00:33:33.946
And All Edges seems like a good

00:33:33.946 --> 00:33:34.336
choice here.

00:33:35.606 --> 00:33:37.326
Okay, this is close, but I

00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:38.506
really want to have this icon

00:33:38.946 --> 00:33:40.166
all the way at the top of our

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:40.586
view area.

00:33:40.586 --> 00:33:43.116
And we can get our video icon

00:33:43.116 --> 00:33:44.736
there by putting our room image

00:33:44.866 --> 00:33:46.156
inside of a flexible frame.

00:33:47.096 --> 00:33:48.546
The frame will stretch to fill

00:33:48.546 --> 00:33:49.096
the whole screen.

00:33:49.096 --> 00:33:51.306
And when it has extra space, it

00:33:51.306 --> 00:33:53.516
will center its contents inside

00:33:53.516 --> 00:33:54.686
of it.

00:33:54.686 --> 00:33:56.026
This means that our room image

00:33:56.026 --> 00:33:56.836
will still be at the right

00:33:56.836 --> 00:33:57.066
place.

00:33:58.166 --> 00:34:00.016
So I'll add our flexible frame

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:00.646
to our image.

00:34:03.066 --> 00:34:04.796
And we'll use a minimum width of

00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:06.736
zero and a max width of

00:34:06.736 --> 00:34:07.176
infinity.

00:34:07.776 --> 00:34:10.096
And we'll do the same thing for

00:34:10.096 --> 00:34:10.396
our height.

00:34:16.186 --> 00:34:16.545
There we go.

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:20.226

SwiftUI, check out the Building

00:34:23.985 --> 00:34:26.136
Now we have our icon.

00:34:26.766 --> 00:34:27.906
But we only want it to appear

00:34:28.036 --> 00:34:29.056
when a room has video

00:34:29.056 --> 00:34:29.636
conferencing.

00:34:30.116 --> 00:34:30.815
So how do we do that?

00:34:32.076 --> 00:34:33.156
Well, the declarative syntax

00:34:33.156 --> 00:34:34.356
that we're using makes that

00:34:34.356 --> 00:34:34.886
really easy.

00:34:35.536 --> 00:34:36.926
We can just use an if.

00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:39.065
So I'll add an if and we'll

00:34:39.065 --> 00:34:40.835
check whether our room has

00:34:40.835 --> 00:34:41.156
video.

00:34:42.016 --> 00:34:43.476
And we'll only show our image

00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:46.416
when that's true.

00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:48.136
Now we can check if this is

00:34:48.136 --> 00:34:49.505
working by changing our preview

00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:51.356
data to a room that doesn't have

00:34:51.545 --> 00:34:53.056
video, which is nice.

00:34:54.076 --> 00:34:55.406
But even better, we can actually

00:34:55.406 --> 00:34:56.516
set up our previews to show

00:34:56.516 --> 00:34:58.176
multiple versions of our views

00:34:58.176 --> 00:34:58.626
at once.

00:34:59.966 --> 00:35:01.556
To do that, I'm just going to

00:35:01.556 --> 00:35:04.106
embed this view inside of a

00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:05.006
group.

00:35:05.126 --> 00:35:06.566
And now I can have multiple

00:35:06.566 --> 00:35:07.736
views here.

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:10.706
So let's create a second version

00:35:11.946 --> 00:35:12.846
using different test data.

00:35:13.936 --> 00:35:15.266
Now we have one version of our

00:35:15.266 --> 00:35:16.976
view with video conferencing,

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:18.606
and another version without.

00:35:19.516 --> 00:35:26.816
[ Applause ]

00:35:27.316 --> 00:35:29.266
Now let's go back to live mode.

00:35:30.836 --> 00:35:32.386
Now when I'm in the Zoom state,

00:35:32.666 --> 00:35:34.086
having that icon on top of my

00:35:34.086 --> 00:35:35.366
image is a little distracting.

00:35:36.196 --> 00:35:37.406
So let's update it to also

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:38.466
disappear when we're zoomed.

00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:40.656
We can do that just by updating

00:35:40.656 --> 00:35:40.976
our condition.

00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:49.696
Now the icon automatically shows

00:35:49.696 --> 00:35:51.156
and hides as we zoom in and out.

00:35:51.646 --> 00:35:52.976
But even better, it animates,

00:35:53.316 --> 00:35:54.006
fading in and out.

00:35:55.326 --> 00:35:56.676
And we can also customize that

00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:58.556
animation behavior by setting it

00:35:58.556 --> 00:35:59.536
to a different transition.

00:36:00.186 --> 00:36:04.796
So let's try .move and we'll use

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:06.066
the leading edge.

00:36:07.526 --> 00:36:09.306
Now our icon slides out and

00:36:09.306 --> 00:36:09.976
slides back in.

[ Applause ]

00:36:17.536 --> 00:36:18.416
And let me also make this a

00:36:18.416 --> 00:36:20.626
longer animation by specifying a

00:36:20.626 --> 00:36:22.696
custom animation with a duration

00:36:22.816 --> 00:36:23.426
of two seconds.

00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:27.006
Now we can see our animation in

00:36:27.006 --> 00:36:29.706
more detail and we can also see

00:36:29.706 --> 00:36:31.016
what happens if we tap on it

00:36:31.046 --> 00:36:31.946
while the animation is still

00:36:31.946 --> 00:36:32.266
going.

00:36:32.986 --> 00:36:34.036
It turns around and comes right

00:36:35.256 --> 00:36:35.556
back.

00:36:35.556 --> 00:36:37.226
Again, our animation is always

00:36:37.226 --> 00:36:39.156
interactive and we can always

00:36:39.206 --> 00:36:40.376
tap on it and it will end up in

00:36:40.376 --> 00:36:40.886
the right state.

00:36:41.546 --> 00:36:43.466
So that's our detail view.

00:36:44.256 --> 00:36:45.186
Now let's review what we just

00:36:45.216 --> 00:36:45.466
built.

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:48.616
Our detail view is configured

00:36:48.616 --> 00:36:50.806
with a room to show and remember

00:36:50.806 --> 00:36:51.926
that that's a derived value

00:36:52.106 --> 00:36:53.186
passed in by the parent of the

00:36:53.186 --> 00:36:53.396
view.

00:36:53.396 --> 00:36:55.726
And we also have our state

00:36:55.726 --> 00:36:57.706
property which controls whether

00:36:57.876 --> 00:36:58.986
this view is zoomed in or not.

00:36:58.986 --> 00:37:01.406
And this is persisted by the

00:37:01.406 --> 00:37:02.996
framework and controls the

00:37:02.996 --> 00:37:03.756
aspect ratio.

00:37:06.226 --> 00:37:08.046
Then we also have our video icon

00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:10.616
and that's only shown for views

00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:12.216
that have video conferencing and

00:37:12.216 --> 00:37:13.186
only when they're not zoomed.

00:37:14.146 --> 00:37:15.596
And we're also specifying this

00:37:15.596 --> 00:37:17.176
transition to make the icon

00:37:17.236 --> 00:37:17.916
slide in and out.

00:37:18.496 --> 00:37:20.196
But what's actually happening

00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:21.146
during that transition?

00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:23.516
Well, when this icon is removed,

00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:25.616
the view gets animated to a new

00:37:25.616 --> 00:37:28.316
position and SwiftUI waits until

00:37:28.316 --> 00:37:29.526
it finishes that animation to

00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:30.906
actually remove the view from

00:37:30.906 --> 00:37:31.446
the hierarchy.

00:37:32.496 --> 00:37:33.666
And the when it's coming back,

00:37:35.026 --> 00:37:36.496
SwiftUI inserts it off-screen

00:37:36.496 --> 00:37:38.046
and the moves it back in with an

00:37:38.046 --> 00:37:38.566
animation.

00:37:39.816 --> 00:37:40.896
I've wanted to be able to do

00:37:40.896 --> 00:37:42.306
AddSubview and RemoveSubview

00:37:42.306 --> 00:37:43.476
with an animation for a really

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:45.136
long time, so I'm really excited

00:37:45.136 --> 00:37:46.386
to finally have it.

00:37:47.516 --> 00:37:52.606
[ Applause ]

00:37:53.106 --> 00:37:54.346
And recall that this animation

00:37:54.396 --> 00:37:55.736
is always interactive right out

00:37:55.736 --> 00:37:56.146
of the box.

00:37:57.116 --> 00:37:58.306
This is where being data-driven

00:37:58.306 --> 00:37:59.566
instead of event-driven really

00:37:59.566 --> 00:38:00.006
shines.

00:38:00.566 --> 00:38:01.646
All those events that Kyle

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:02.986
talked about can happen while

00:38:02.986 --> 00:38:03.766
this is animating.

00:38:04.476 --> 00:38:05.846
And animations beginning and

00:38:05.846 --> 00:38:07.076
ending are even more events.

00:38:07.806 --> 00:38:09.146
It's incredibly difficult to

00:38:09.146 --> 00:38:10.506
build something like this in an

00:38:10.506 --> 00:38:11.476
event driven world.

00:38:11.926 --> 00:38:13.356
But in SwiftUI it's just one

00:38:13.356 --> 00:38:14.526
line of code.

00:38:17.066 --> 00:38:18.566
Now let's go back to our list of

00:38:18.566 --> 00:38:19.916
rooms and finish up this app.

00:38:24.046 --> 00:38:25.446
Over time, we need to be able to

00:38:25.446 --> 00:38:26.646
change our list of conference

00:38:26.646 --> 00:38:28.156
rooms, so let's add some editing

00:38:28.156 --> 00:38:28.526
support.

00:38:29.566 --> 00:38:30.546
And while we're at it, let's

00:38:30.546 --> 00:38:31.596
also make our data model a

00:38:31.636 --> 00:38:32.436
little more real.

00:38:33.526 --> 00:38:35.426
Right now, the data in our app

00:38:35.626 --> 00:38:36.476
is completely static.

00:38:37.096 --> 00:38:39.746
We have this array of rooms and

00:38:39.746 --> 00:38:41.096
whatever we start with is what

00:38:41.096 --> 00:38:41.736
we'll always have.

00:38:42.326 --> 00:38:44.136
So let's update our model to

00:38:44.136 --> 00:38:45.596
have a root store object that

00:38:45.596 --> 00:38:46.966
will contain our rooms and will

00:38:46.966 --> 00:38:48.266
be able to change over time.

00:38:48.856 --> 00:38:51.476
I'm going to drag in a prebuilt

00:38:51.476 --> 00:38:52.836
model file with our room store.

00:39:01.596 --> 00:39:03.346
Notice that our store is a

00:39:03.346 --> 00:39:04.906
mutable object which contains

00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:05.586
the rooms that we need.

00:39:06.616 --> 00:39:08.106
And all we need to do is tell

00:39:08.106 --> 00:39:09.856
SwiftUI when it changes.

00:39:10.926 --> 00:39:12.306
To do that, I'm going to conform

00:39:12.306 --> 00:39:13.226
it to the bindable object

00:39:13.256 --> 00:39:15.436
protocol which requires me to

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:16.706
have a DidChange property.

00:39:23.066 --> 00:39:24.416
Now new this year is the Combine

00:39:24.416 --> 00:39:25.956
framework which includes a large

00:39:25.956 --> 00:39:27.206
number of components you can use

00:39:27.206 --> 00:39:28.306
to connect your data together.

00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:30.586
Here we use the pass-through

00:39:30.586 --> 00:39:31.986
publisher, a pass-through

00:39:31.986 --> 00:39:34.106
subject from Combine which gives

00:39:34.106 --> 00:39:35.726
us a local object that we can

00:39:35.726 --> 00:39:37.126
subscribe to and send updates

00:39:37.126 --> 00:39:38.696
to, similar to a notification

00:39:38.696 --> 00:39:38.976
center.

00:39:42.856 --> 00:39:44.556
Then we'll just update our rooms

00:39:46.076 --> 00:39:48.586
to have a DidSet so that we can

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:49.626
notify our subject when our

00:39:49.626 --> 00:39:49.976
rooms change.

00:39:55.166 --> 00:39:56.056
And if you're interested to

00:39:56.056 --> 00:39:57.186
learn more about Combine, there

00:39:57.186 --> 00:39:58.476
are two sessions this week to

00:39:58.476 --> 00:40:00.286
take you through all of the

00:40:00.956 --> 00:40:01.156
details.

00:40:01.276 --> 00:40:02.736
Now let's go back to our view

00:40:03.436 --> 00:40:05.676
and update it to use our store.

00:40:07.026 --> 00:40:08.106
We'll change from this Rooms

00:40:08.106 --> 00:40:09.786
property to a Store property.

00:40:10.476 --> 00:40:13.316
And we'll make it an object

00:40:13.316 --> 00:40:15.356
binding to tell SwiftUI to

00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:16.536
listen to changes for this

00:40:16.536 --> 00:40:16.866
property.

00:40:17.876 --> 00:40:19.566
And again, the Data Flow Through

00:40:19.566 --> 00:40:20.626
SwiftUI session that Kyle

00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:22.076
mentioned earlier has a lot more

00:40:22.076 --> 00:40:23.296
information about how object

00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:24.376
binding and these other pieces

00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:24.636
work.

00:40:25.126 --> 00:40:27.716
Let's also update our preview to

00:40:27.716 --> 00:40:28.666
create our new store type.

00:40:32.216 --> 00:40:34.356
Using our test data.

00:40:34.526 --> 00:40:35.806
And we'll also update our list

00:40:36.026 --> 00:40:37.436
to pull the rooms from out of

00:40:37.976 --> 00:40:39.686
the store.

00:40:39.906 --> 00:40:40.126
Great.

00:40:40.826 --> 00:40:41.866
Now we're using our new model

00:40:41.946 --> 00:40:43.176
and whenever it updates, our

00:40:43.176 --> 00:40:44.156
view will create a fresh

00:40:44.156 --> 00:40:44.486
rendering.

00:40:45.996 --> 00:40:46.996
This means we're ready to add

00:40:46.996 --> 00:40:47.796
our editing support.

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:50.006
Let's start by adding a button

00:40:50.316 --> 00:40:51.896
to our list to add new rooms.

00:40:53.156 --> 00:40:54.376
Right now, we're using a single

00:40:54.376 --> 00:40:55.766
collection to drive the list

00:40:56.386 --> 00:40:57.336
which is great for lists that

00:40:57.336 --> 00:40:58.496
are entirely data-driven.

00:40:59.096 --> 00:41:00.626
But when I need more, SwiftUI

00:41:00.626 --> 00:41:02.536
also lets me mix static and

00:41:02.536 --> 00:41:04.106
dynamic content in lists and

00:41:04.106 --> 00:41:04.956
other containers.

00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:08.826
So I can replace this list using

00:41:08.826 --> 00:41:10.556
the collection with a ForEach.

00:41:11.166 --> 00:41:14.236
A ForEach creates a view for

00:41:14.236 --> 00:41:15.426
each item in its collection.

00:41:16.046 --> 00:41:19.336
So now I can add a static

00:41:19.336 --> 00:41:20.716
element right alongside this

00:41:20.716 --> 00:41:21.176
ForEach.

00:41:22.416 --> 00:41:23.796
I'll just go to the library and

00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:24.976
find a button.

00:41:27.286 --> 00:41:28.826
And then I can just drag it into

00:41:28.826 --> 00:41:31.266
my code to add it to our list.

00:41:33.296 --> 00:41:35.116
Let's update its text to show

00:41:35.116 --> 00:41:35.676
Add Room.

00:41:36.846 --> 00:41:38.136
And let's add a method to add

00:41:38.136 --> 00:41:38.756
that new room.

00:41:43.436 --> 00:41:45.616
Okay, we'll tell our Store to

00:41:45.616 --> 00:41:46.596
append a new room.

00:41:47.266 --> 00:41:51.246
And let's just use the room that

00:41:52.096 --> 00:41:52.436
we're in.

00:41:52.436 --> 00:41:53.446
It's called Hall 2 and I think

00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:54.816
there's what, about 2,000 of

00:41:54.906 --> 00:41:54.976
you.

00:41:59.046 --> 00:42:00.336
And finally, let's update our

00:42:00.336 --> 00:42:01.686
button to use our new Add Room

00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:01.976
method.

00:42:04.126 --> 00:42:05.746
Okay, now let's go to Live Mode

00:42:05.746 --> 00:42:06.646
and try out our new button.

00:42:07.406 --> 00:42:09.626
There it is, right next to all

00:42:09.626 --> 00:42:10.026
of our data.

00:42:10.166 --> 00:42:12.126
And when I tap it, we get our

00:42:12.126 --> 00:42:12.566
new room.

00:42:13.476 --> 00:42:13.716
Great.

00:42:14.516 --> 00:42:21.816
[ Applause ]

00:42:22.316 --> 00:42:23.456
So just like that, we were able

00:42:23.456 --> 00:42:24.626
to add this single static

00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:25.976
element alongside our

00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:26.956
data-driven collection.

00:42:27.936 --> 00:42:29.466
SwiftUI lets us easily describe

00:42:29.466 --> 00:42:30.656
these powerful combinations

00:42:31.256 --> 00:42:32.486
which makes it so much easier to

00:42:32.486 --> 00:42:33.716
build complex list UI's.

00:42:34.126 --> 00:42:35.466
No more off by one index path

00:42:35.466 --> 00:42:35.876
errors.

00:42:38.366 --> 00:42:39.896
But I want to style this to look

00:42:39.896 --> 00:42:40.406
even better.

00:42:41.386 --> 00:42:42.986
Let's put the Add button and all

00:42:42.986 --> 00:42:44.356
of our content into separate

00:42:44.356 --> 00:42:44.776
sections.

00:42:45.986 --> 00:42:48.296
We can change our list style to

00:42:49.356 --> 00:42:54.006
be grouped, which gives us this

00:42:54.006 --> 00:42:54.786
nice grouped appearance.

00:42:55.956 --> 00:42:57.296
Then we'll add a section

00:42:57.296 --> 00:42:58.786
container around our button.

00:43:02.166 --> 00:43:03.506
And another one around our

00:43:03.576 --> 00:43:04.016
ForEach.

00:43:07.336 --> 00:43:08.466
Great, now we have our separate

00:43:08.466 --> 00:43:08.796
sections.

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:12.126
Next, let's hook up deletion for

00:43:12.126 --> 00:43:12.536
our list.

00:43:13.676 --> 00:43:17.406
We'll add a method to delete a

00:43:17.406 --> 00:43:19.686
set of rooms and we'll pass in

00:43:20.156 --> 00:43:22.486
some offsets for where to remove

00:43:23.816 --> 00:43:23.916
them.

00:43:24.146 --> 00:43:25.526
Then we'll just tell our store

00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:28.026
to remove the rooms that those

00:43:28.026 --> 00:43:28.386
offsets.

00:43:32.296 --> 00:43:34.586
Then we can add a modifier onto

00:43:34.586 --> 00:43:36.146
our ForEach called OnDelete.

00:43:36.796 --> 00:43:39.056
And we can pass in our delete

00:43:39.056 --> 00:43:41.396
method to that modifier.

00:43:42.046 --> 00:43:44.526
Now if we go back into Live

00:43:44.526 --> 00:43:47.886
Mode, we can swipe on one of our

00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:49.646
rows and delete it, just like

00:43:50.756 --> 00:43:50.846
that.

00:43:51.516 --> 00:43:57.156
[ Applause ]

00:43:57.656 --> 00:43:59.206
This ForEach is now configured

00:43:59.206 --> 00:44:00.516
to call into our callback

00:44:01.596 --> 00:44:03.386
whenever items get removed from

00:44:03.386 --> 00:44:03.486
it.

00:44:04.406 --> 00:44:05.696
And then our callback calls into

00:44:05.696 --> 00:44:07.056
the Store to remove those items.

00:44:07.756 --> 00:44:08.656
And then our view updates.

00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:09.516
Okay.

00:44:10.536 --> 00:44:12.636
Now we want to be able to take

00:44:12.636 --> 00:44:13.816
our list into Edit Mode in

00:44:13.816 --> 00:44:14.936
addition to just allowing swipe

00:44:14.976 --> 00:44:15.406
to delete.

00:44:16.456 --> 00:44:18.786
So let's set a navigation bar

00:44:18.786 --> 00:44:20.206
item, and we can do that the

00:44:20.206 --> 00:44:21.606
same way we set this navigation

00:44:21.606 --> 00:44:22.606
bar title-- with another

00:44:22.606 --> 00:44:23.096
modifier.

00:44:26.206 --> 00:44:27.886
And to create an Edit button, we

00:44:27.886 --> 00:44:28.826
just create an Edit button.

00:44:28.826 --> 00:44:31.186
And there it is in our UI.

00:44:31.186 --> 00:44:34.016
And while we're at it, let's

00:44:34.016 --> 00:44:35.236
also add reordering support.

00:44:36.536 --> 00:44:37.996
Again, I'll just add a simple

00:44:37.996 --> 00:44:39.756
method to move items.

00:44:41.126 --> 00:44:42.436
And we'll move it from a source

00:44:43.196 --> 00:44:45.976
to a destination.

00:44:49.056 --> 00:44:50.306
And again, we'll just call into

00:44:50.306 --> 00:44:52.676
our Store's Rooms and tell it to

00:44:52.676 --> 00:44:52.906
move.

00:44:57.276 --> 00:44:57.556
Okay.

00:44:58.326 --> 00:45:00.556
Then just like before, we'll add

00:45:00.556 --> 00:45:02.116
another modifier, this time on

00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:05.126
Move, and tell it to call into

00:45:05.126 --> 00:45:07.676
the method that we just added.

00:45:07.886 --> 00:45:09.386
Now let's try our app again.

00:45:10.946 --> 00:45:12.116
We can toggle Edit Mode for our

00:45:12.116 --> 00:45:12.566
list.

00:45:13.476 --> 00:45:14.736
And notice that all of our data

00:45:14.736 --> 00:45:16.516
rows have editing controls but

00:45:16.516 --> 00:45:17.236
the button does not.

00:45:18.146 --> 00:45:19.776
SwiftUI automatically shows the

00:45:19.776 --> 00:45:21.516
right editing controls in the

00:45:21.516 --> 00:45:23.216
places that need it, without us

00:45:23.216 --> 00:45:24.976
having to do any extra work.

[ Applause ]

00:45:28.066 --> 00:45:28.526

[ Applause ]

00:45:31.046 --> 00:45:32.356
And of course now we can drag to

00:45:32.356 --> 00:45:34.496
reorder and tap on items to

00:45:34.496 --> 00:45:34.976
remove them.

[ Applause ]

00:45:43.086 --> 00:45:44.326
So let's quickly review what we

00:45:44.326 --> 00:45:44.796
just added.

00:45:45.956 --> 00:45:47.676
We customized our list to show

00:45:47.676 --> 00:45:50.016
multiple sections, and by

00:45:50.016 --> 00:45:50.956
setting its list style to

00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:51.266
grouped.

00:45:52.286 --> 00:45:53.586
And we mixed this static button

00:45:54.186 --> 00:45:55.306
together with our data-driven

00:45:55.306 --> 00:45:56.896
collection from our Rooms.

00:45:58.006 --> 00:45:59.046
And we also saw how we can

00:45:59.046 --> 00:46:00.476
quickly add editing operations

00:46:00.476 --> 00:46:01.696
to our list with just these

00:46:01.696 --> 00:46:03.836
modifiers and a few functions to

00:46:03.836 --> 00:46:04.556
modify our data.

00:46:05.276 --> 00:46:07.376
And remember how we made our

00:46:07.376 --> 00:46:08.936
room type identifiable earlier?

00:46:09.846 --> 00:46:11.726
Well, ForEach automatically

00:46:11.726 --> 00:46:12.896
watches for changes to its

00:46:12.896 --> 00:46:14.726
collection and synthesizes the

00:46:14.726 --> 00:46:16.536
correct insertions, deletions,

00:46:16.696 --> 00:46:18.436
and changes for us, so we no

00:46:18.436 --> 00:46:19.766
longer need to tell the list to

00:46:19.766 --> 00:46:21.456
add and remove rows, which means

00:46:21.456 --> 00:46:22.656
we no longer have to worry about

00:46:22.656 --> 00:46:23.306
getting data source

00:46:23.416 --> 00:46:24.606
inconsistency exceptions.

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:27.096

00:46:27.096 --> 00:46:27.536
Yep, that's right.

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:30.686
[ Applause ]

00:46:31.186 --> 00:46:31.926
So that's our list.

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:32.956
And we made this whole

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.856
sophisticated list UI with just

00:46:34.946 --> 00:46:36.636
this really minimal view code.

00:46:39.256 --> 00:46:40.876
Okay, now we were able to build

00:46:40.876 --> 00:46:42.306
this app up really quickly.

00:46:43.206 --> 00:46:44.126
But you might be thinking that

00:46:44.126 --> 00:46:45.176
there's still a lot more work we

00:46:45.176 --> 00:46:46.356
need to do to get it ready for

00:46:46.356 --> 00:46:46.856
customers.

00:46:47.676 --> 00:46:49.326
These days, support for dynamic

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:51.296
type, dark mode, accessibility,

00:46:51.296 --> 00:46:52.786
localization -- these are all

00:46:52.786 --> 00:46:53.806
just expected for an app.

00:46:55.046 --> 00:46:56.356
But with SwiftUI you get a lot

00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:57.636
more support for these behaviors

00:46:57.686 --> 00:46:58.266
automatically.

00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:00.226
And we can use previews to

00:47:00.226 --> 00:47:01.366
really quickly test all of

00:47:01.366 --> 00:47:01.586
these.

00:47:02.916 --> 00:47:04.156
So let's go to our preview and

00:47:04.956 --> 00:47:05.726
add some more views.

00:47:05.786 --> 00:47:08.446
Again, I'll add a group to let

00:47:09.036 --> 00:47:10.226
us have multiple children.

00:47:10.826 --> 00:47:13.476
And then I'll add another

00:47:13.476 --> 00:47:14.576
version of our view.

00:47:15.256 --> 00:47:17.676
And this time we'll change the

00:47:17.676 --> 00:47:21.716
environment to use a size

00:47:21.716 --> 00:47:23.726
category that's a much larger

00:47:24.406 --> 00:47:24.526
size.

00:47:27.066 --> 00:47:28.166
Let's go see how it looks.

00:47:28.266 --> 00:47:29.666
And everything automatically

00:47:30.326 --> 00:47:31.596
works great.

00:47:31.786 --> 00:47:31.856
Now --

[ Applause ]

00:47:34.386 --> 00:47:35.356

00:47:36.886 --> 00:47:37.006
free.

00:47:37.266 --> 00:47:38.666
Now the environment is a way

00:47:38.666 --> 00:47:39.796
that you can set contextual

00:47:39.796 --> 00:47:41.356
information about your views

00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:42.516
that flows down the view

00:47:42.516 --> 00:47:43.916
hierarchy and changes different

00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:45.456
aspects of any contained views

00:47:45.456 --> 00:47:46.126
all at once.

00:47:46.866 --> 00:47:48.136
It's great for making changes to

00:47:48.136 --> 00:47:49.566
a large set of views and it's

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.876
also great for customizing your

00:47:50.876 --> 00:47:52.286
previews to see your view in

00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:52.956
different contexts.

00:47:53.086 --> 00:47:55.976
So let's add another version of

00:47:55.976 --> 00:47:58.926
our view and update the

00:47:58.926 --> 00:48:00.976
environment to set its color

00:48:00.976 --> 00:48:02.286
scheme to be dark.

00:48:05.076 --> 00:48:06.116
And once again it all just

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:06.536
works.

00:48:07.516 --> 00:48:12.546
[ Applause ]

00:48:13.046 --> 00:48:14.516
And finally, let's also see how

00:48:14.516 --> 00:48:15.536
our app works with other

00:48:15.536 --> 00:48:16.036
languages.

00:48:17.046 --> 00:48:18.986
I have some English string files

00:48:19.126 --> 00:48:20.906
that I'll drag into my app.

00:48:27.186 --> 00:48:28.786
And I'll tell Xcode to localize

00:48:28.786 --> 00:48:28.976
them.

00:48:34.106 --> 00:48:35.996
Then I'll go to my project file

00:48:36.996 --> 00:48:39.376
and I'll import a localization

00:48:39.506 --> 00:48:40.726
that I have for Arabic.

00:48:47.046 --> 00:48:48.206
Now let's go back to our view

00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:49.466
and add one more preview.

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.396
Now, if we first set the layout

00:48:57.396 --> 00:49:00.906
direction to be right-to-left,

00:49:01.796 --> 00:49:03.326
we can see that this

00:49:03.326 --> 00:49:04.706
automatically works without any

00:49:04.706 --> 00:49:05.136
extra work.

00:49:05.136 --> 00:49:09.116
But if I also set the locale to

00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:16.876
be an Arabic locale, you can see

00:49:16.876 --> 00:49:17.976
that everything gets localized.

00:49:20.516 --> 00:49:25.736
[ Applause ]

00:49:26.236 --> 00:49:27.776
And even better, if we look back

00:49:27.776 --> 00:49:29.026
at our code, we didn't do

00:49:29.026 --> 00:49:30.346
anything extra to support these

00:49:30.346 --> 00:49:30.846
features.

00:49:31.516 --> 00:49:33.006
To get our text localizable, we

00:49:33.006 --> 00:49:34.246
didn't have to mark up which

00:49:34.246 --> 00:49:35.486
strings should be localizable or

00:49:35.486 --> 00:49:35.716
not.

00:49:36.136 --> 00:49:37.506
SwiftUI automatically infers

00:49:37.506 --> 00:49:37.746
that.

00:49:38.676 --> 00:49:40.286
For text using string literals,

00:49:40.676 --> 00:49:41.846
it's localizable by default.

00:49:43.276 --> 00:49:44.506
And for text that's created by

00:49:44.506 --> 00:49:46.066
getting passed a string, it

00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:47.286
defaults to getting used as-is.

00:49:48.216 --> 00:49:49.286
This means that all of our app

00:49:49.326 --> 00:49:51.396
text like Rooms and Add Room

00:49:51.686 --> 00:49:52.516
gets localized.

00:49:53.046 --> 00:49:54.946
But all of our content like

00:49:55.086 --> 00:49:56.906
these room names still gets

00:49:56.906 --> 00:49:57.566
passed right through.

00:49:58.296 --> 00:49:59.936
But even better, you can finally

00:49:59.936 --> 00:50:01.306
use string interpolations and

00:50:01.306 --> 00:50:02.446
have them localized correctly.

00:50:17.646 --> 00:50:19.086
concentrate on the unique parts

00:50:19.086 --> 00:50:20.436
of your app and build better

Now we built an iPhone app here,

00:50:25.206 --> 00:50:26.596
but you can use these same APIs

00:50:26.596 --> 00:50:27.936
and techniques across all of

00:50:27.936 --> 00:50:28.686
Apple's platforms.

00:50:29.556 --> 00:50:30.486

00:50:30.486 --> 00:50:31.806
automatic behaviors across all

00:50:31.806 --> 00:50:31.976
of them.

00:50:34.046 --> 00:50:35.316
Okay, let's take one last pass

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:36.486
through our app to review what

00:50:36.486 --> 00:50:37.516
we built and make sure

00:50:37.516 --> 00:50:38.456
everything is working right.

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.486
I'm a big fan of dark mode, so

00:50:41.486 --> 00:50:41.976
let's use that version.

00:50:45.166 --> 00:50:46.476
Okay, we have our list of rooms

00:50:46.826 --> 00:50:48.486
and we can tap on one of them to

00:50:48.486 --> 00:50:49.296
see more information.

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:51.556
And in our detail view we can

00:50:51.556 --> 00:50:53.356
tap to zoom to full screen which

00:50:53.356 --> 00:50:54.416
hides our video icon with a

00:50:54.416 --> 00:50:56.676
transition, and that animation

00:50:56.796 --> 00:50:57.586
is always interactive.

00:51:00.106 --> 00:51:02.156
And we can also edit our list to

00:51:02.156 --> 00:51:02.706
make changes.

00:51:03.346 --> 00:51:07.566
Let's move this one down, and I

00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:08.496
don't think anyone really wants

00:51:08.496 --> 00:51:09.836
to use the dungeon conference

00:51:10.346 --> 00:51:10.436
room.

00:51:13.616 --> 00:51:14.736
Actually, I'm also not sure why

00:51:14.846 --> 00:51:15.866
Kyle added this room that has an

00:51:15.866 --> 00:51:16.266
elephant.

00:51:16.266 --> 00:51:17.526
Let's get rid of that one too.

00:51:18.756 --> 00:51:20.226
And finally, let's add our

00:51:20.226 --> 00:51:20.756
conference room.

00:51:21.676 --> 00:51:21.926
Great.

00:51:22.266 --> 00:51:22.706
That's our app.

00:51:23.516 --> 00:51:29.666
[ Applause ]

00:51:30.166 --> 00:51:31.026
But there's one last thing that

00:51:31.026 --> 00:51:32.116
I want to point out and it's

00:51:32.116 --> 00:51:33.096
something that we didn't see.

00:51:33.926 --> 00:51:35.046
We just built up this entire

00:51:35.046 --> 00:51:36.796
application and tested all these

00:51:36.796 --> 00:51:38.746
rich behaviors without ever once

00:51:38.826 --> 00:51:40.626
building and running our app.

00:51:40.626 --> 00:51:42.056
Xcode previews let us view,

00:51:42.086 --> 00:51:43.496
edit, and debug our application

00:51:43.706 --> 00:51:44.656
way faster than was ever

00:51:44.656 --> 00:51:45.466
possible before.

00:51:46.556 --> 00:51:47.536
So thank you very much.

00:51:47.716 --> 00:51:48.926
I hope you enjoy using SwiftUI

00:51:48.926 --> 00:51:49.646
as much as I do.

00:51:49.936 --> 00:51:50.516
It's a lot of fun.

00:51:51.516 --> 00:51:54.776
[ Applause ]

00:51:55.276 --> 00:51:57.006
>> So our goal with this SwiftUI

00:51:57.356 --> 00:51:59.426
is to give you the shortest path

00:51:59.556 --> 00:52:00.796
to a great app that's going to

00:52:00.796 --> 00:52:02.106
reach the widest audience.

00:52:03.216 --> 00:52:06.066
We saw four of SwiftUI's key

00:52:06.066 --> 00:52:07.596
design principles at play today.

00:52:07.796 --> 00:52:09.836
We saw its declarative syntax,

00:52:10.226 --> 00:52:12.176
which will evoke the actual UI

00:52:12.176 --> 00:52:13.776
you're building and take care of

00:52:13.776 --> 00:52:15.286
those imperative details like

00:52:15.286 --> 00:52:17.076
adding and removing subviews on

00:52:17.076 --> 00:52:17.716
your behalf.

00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:20.296
We saw the compositional pieces

00:52:20.586 --> 00:52:22.046
and how you can combine together

00:52:22.296 --> 00:52:24.256
pieces of content, modifiers and

00:52:24.256 --> 00:52:26.396
containers to build exactly the

00:52:26.396 --> 00:52:27.506
UI you're looking for.

00:52:28.316 --> 00:52:29.636
We saw all the automatic

00:52:29.676 --> 00:52:31.886
behaviors you get by saying less

00:52:32.236 --> 00:52:33.536
and letting the framework take

00:52:33.536 --> 00:52:34.576
care of more.

00:52:35.206 --> 00:52:37.046
We talked about how SwiftUI

00:52:37.266 --> 00:52:39.196
keeps your views in a consistent

00:52:39.246 --> 00:52:40.866
state so you never end up with a

00:52:40.866 --> 00:52:42.096
view missing or in the wrong

00:52:42.096 --> 00:52:42.506
place.

00:52:43.156 --> 00:52:44.486
And of course we played with

00:52:44.486 --> 00:52:46.376
SwiftUI's awesome interruptal

00:52:46.376 --> 00:52:48.496
animations, which is one of my

00:52:48.496 --> 00:52:49.196
favorites.

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:51.256
I always felt like before I had

00:52:51.256 --> 00:52:52.806
to trade between having flashy

00:52:52.806 --> 00:52:54.686
animations and the crushing

00:52:54.686 --> 00:52:55.876
complexity that could come with

00:52:55.876 --> 00:52:56.016
it.

00:52:56.236 --> 00:52:57.356
But no longer.

00:52:57.916 --> 00:53:00.316
The goal with SwiftUI -- wait,

00:53:00.316 --> 00:53:01.916
we didn't look at it again.

00:53:01.916 --> 00:53:02.726
It's so cool, right?

00:53:03.286 --> 00:53:05.046
All right, the goal with SwiftUI

00:53:05.396 --> 00:53:07.976
is for us to take care of these

00:53:07.976 --> 00:53:09.686
basic features that every app

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:11.016
needs on your behalf.

00:53:11.476 --> 00:53:12.786
Because when you're building an

00:53:12.786 --> 00:53:14.166
app, it's not just the basic

00:53:14.166 --> 00:53:15.096
features you add.

00:53:15.376 --> 00:53:17.256
You've got all your special,

00:53:17.256 --> 00:53:19.036
unique features that make your

00:53:19.036 --> 00:53:20.186
app yours.

00:53:21.016 --> 00:53:22.686
And the goal is for us to bear

00:53:22.686 --> 00:53:24.656
more of this burden, the burden

00:53:24.656 --> 00:53:26.256
for all those things that you

00:53:26.256 --> 00:53:28.526
need to have to have a great app

00:53:29.036 --> 00:53:30.416
and let you spend more of your

00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:31.686
time focusing on things that

00:53:31.686 --> 00:53:32.676
make your app special.

00:53:33.676 --> 00:53:35.986
So I hope you all enjoyed your

00:53:35.986 --> 00:53:37.826
introduction to SwiftUI.

00:53:37.826 --> 00:53:39.516
Come find us in the labs.

00:53:39.696 --> 00:53:41.086
We'll be there this afternoon

00:53:41.086 --> 00:53:41.876
and throughout the week.

00:53:42.466 --> 00:53:44.086
And we called out to a couple

00:53:44.086 --> 00:53:45.496
sessions, Data Flow Through UI,

00:53:45.496 --> 00:53:46.836
and Building Custom Views.

00:53:47.076 --> 00:53:49.346
Your next stop in learning

00:53:49.346 --> 00:53:51.046
SwiftUI should be the SwiftUI

00:53:51.086 --> 00:53:52.296
Essentials talk where we're

00:53:52.296 --> 00:53:53.516
going to go into every piece of

00:53:53.516 --> 00:53:55.606
syntax and all the pieces that

00:53:55.606 --> 00:53:57.406
you can compose together to make

00:53:57.406 --> 00:53:58.416
views what they are.

00:53:58.416 --> 00:54:00.166
So I hope to see you there.

00:54:00.396 --> 00:54:03.056
Have a great WWDC and I hope you

00:54:03.056 --> 00:54:03.746
enjoy SwiftUI.
