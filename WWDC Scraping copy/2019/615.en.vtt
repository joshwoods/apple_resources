[ Music ]

00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:08.226
>> Hello. I'm Ben Harry from the

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:09.466
Game Center Engineering team.

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:12.166
In this presentation, I'm going

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.546
to talk about Game Center player

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.346
identifiers.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.716
To get started, I'm going to

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.156
give you a brief overview of

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:20.426
what Game Center offers to the

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:21.486
players of your games.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:24.856
Game Center is a social gaming

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.306
network that allows players to

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:27.496
track their best scores on

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:28.946
leaderboards, view their

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:30.396
achievements earned playing your

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.625
games, challenge their friends

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.226
to complete an achievement or to

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:36.876
beat a leaderboard score, and

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.156
play either real-time or

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:39.616
turn-based multiplayer games

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:40.416
with their friends.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:44.116
At the heart of Game Center

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:45.466
games are the players.

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.316
Players are represented by

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:49.606
objects that contain unique

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:51.296
information that differentiate

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:52.586
one player from another.

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:55.326
The object used to represent

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:56.606
Game Center players is the

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:57.466
GKPlayer.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.296
Every GKPlayer has a unique

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.976
nickname accessed by the alias

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:03.476
property.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.346
A player may also choose an

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:07.876
avatar image that will be used

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:09.326
within Game Center UIs.

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:12.546
In addition, each Game Center

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:13.986
user has a unique static

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.996
identifier that remains the same

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:17.496
across all games that the player

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:17.986
plays.

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:20.896
You may use this identifier to

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:22.516
store per-player information.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:27.896
Let me now talk about how a

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.316
player static identifier

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:30.666
currently works in Game Center.

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:33.346
You may already be familiar with

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:35.246
this, but let us consider this

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:36.696
example in case you need to

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.596
refresh your memory.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.896
Here we have two teams, Team A

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:41.846
and Team B.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:44.836
In this presentation, I will be

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:46.746
using the term team to represent

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:48.716
a development team that releases

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.276
a game to the App Store using

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.276
App Store Connect.

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.486
So, I have been playing two

00:01:54.486 --> 00:01:56.376
games from Team A and I also

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:57.836
really enjoy the game from Team

00:01:57.836 --> 00:01:58.136
B.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.296
As we see, my static Game Center

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:03.086
identifier is P123.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.466
Each of these games we'll see

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.836
the same value from my

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:08.636
identifier P123.

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:11.476
No matter which game I play, I

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.496
had the same static identifier.

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:16.546
Going forward, we now want to

00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:18.246
increase privacy by introducing

00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:20.386
new player identifiers that are

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:22.116
scoped to the either the team or

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:23.146
the game itself.

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:26.656
So let's begin with the first of

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:28.486
these new identifiers, the team

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:29.256
player ID.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.306
Remember that team refers to the

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.026
development team that releases a

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.186
game to the App Store.

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:38.816
Again, consider Team A and Team

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:40.776
B along with the same games from

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:41.276
before.

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:44.486
Notice that now I have two

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:45.616
different identifiers.

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:47.546
When I play either game from

00:02:47.546 --> 00:02:49.566
Team A, the value of my team

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:50.976
player ID will be T11.

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:53.446
When I play the game from Team

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.486
B, the value of my team player

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:57.216
ID will be T22.

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:00.196
This means that the value of my

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:02.236
team player ID scoped to the

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:03.836
team that releases the game I

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:04.226
play.

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:07.536
This is an improvement to player

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:10.236
privacy as Team A will only know

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:12.966
my team player ID as T11, and

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:14.686
Team B will only know my team

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:16.316
player ID as T22.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.926
So this is the team player ID.

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:22.416
I now want to tell you about our

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:24.066
other new player identifier, the

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.106
game player ID.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.636
The game player ID is unique per

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:30.526
game per player.

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:33.416
This means that my game player

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.396
ID is unique to each game that I

00:03:35.396 --> 00:03:35.816
play.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.276
Its value is also independent

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:40.566
from the team that releases the

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:40.926
game.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.446
Let us go back to our familiar

00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:46.556
teams, Team A and Team B.

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:49.406
As you can see here, my game

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:51.206
player ID is different for each

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:53.846
game that I play, regardless of

00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:54.856
which team has released the

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:55.156
game.

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:58.496
To further show how a game

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:00.146
player ID is independent from

00:04:00.146 --> 00:04:01.976
the team, let's consider the

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:03.446
case when a game is transferred

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:04.666
from one team to another.

00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:07.786
I am now going to show you what

00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:09.556
happens to my scoped identifiers

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.396
when Game 2 is transferred from

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:12.706
Team A to Team B.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.716
Let's say Team A transfers

00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:18.866
ownership of Game 2 to Team B.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.326
Now, when I play Game 2, my game

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.016
player ID for Game 2 remains

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:24.716
unchanged.

00:04:26.346 --> 00:04:28.136
My game player ID for Game 2

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.876
persisted with the game and is

00:04:29.876 --> 00:04:31.196
independent of the team.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.266
Now, you may have also noticed

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:36.546
something about my team player

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.606
ID for Game 2.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.786
My team player ID for Game 2

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:42.526
took on the value for Team B

00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:44.226
since it is now released to the

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:45.416
App Store by Team B.

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:49.176
So we have come to the scoping

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:50.086
of the new Game Center

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:51.456
identifiers and also what

00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:52.886
happens to these identifiers

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:53.966
when game ownership is

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:54.596
transferred.

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:57.866
I am now going to talk about how

00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:59.016
you may use the scope

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:00.456
identifiers in the games that

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:01.096
you develop.

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:05.636
As you have seen, we have added

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:07.296
two new scope identifiers to the

00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:09.596
GKPlayer, the team player ID and

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.766
the game player ID.

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:14.446
The team player ID and game

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:16.066
player ID have been introduced

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.156
with the goal of increasing

00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:19.586
player privacy, which aligned to

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:20.666
the Apple's commitment to

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:22.256
protecting the privacy of our

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:22.786
users.

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:26.436
This new identifiers replaced

00:05:26.436 --> 00:05:28.186
the existing static identifier

00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:30.356
or player ID on a GKPlayer.

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:34.506
The playerID property is now

00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:35.276
deprecated.

00:05:35.806 --> 00:05:36.926
So I encourage you to start

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:37.836
using these new scope

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:38.886
identifiers today.

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:43.736
As I mentioned earlier, the team

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:45.256
player ID and game player ID

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:46.866
have been introduced to replace

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:48.036
the static player ID.

00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:50.786
If you don't query the player ID

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:52.286
in your games, then you will not

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:53.716
need to make any changes.

00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:56.716
If you do query the player ID,

00:05:56.716 --> 00:05:58.386
you'll need to switch to the new

00:05:58.386 --> 00:05:59.566
scoped identifiers.

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:02.416
You'll be using the team player

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:03.616
ID in most cases.

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:06.846
Likewise, if you currently use

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:08.236
the static player ID to save

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.146
game data, you should move to

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:11.286
the team scoped ID.

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:13.576
Doing so will handle the

00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:15.086
situation in the device you

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:16.536
shared by multiple Game Center

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:17.116
players.

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.026
For those of you who may be

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:21.496
persisting the static player ID

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:24.116
in your own back end system, you

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:25.526
should also update to the new

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:26.736
scoped identifiers.

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:29.686
You can do this any time after a

00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:31.046
successful authentication.

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:35.086
Next, let me show you how scoped

00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:36.716
identifiers look for their local

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:38.536
player as compared to non-local

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:39.126
players.

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:42.066
As you probably know, the

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:44.136
GKLocalPlayer is the object that

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:45.456
represents the authenticated

00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:47.246
Game Center player on a device.

00:06:47.956 --> 00:06:50.056
At any given time, only one

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:51.616
player may be authenticated.

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:54.536
And the GKLocalPlayer has a

00:06:54.536 --> 00:06:56.096
persistent team player ID and

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:56.926
game player ID.

00:06:57.566 --> 00:06:59.766
But what about the GKPlayer?

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:02.206
A GKPlayer object provides

00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:03.956
information about other players.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:06.686
These are non-local players and

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:08.186
may be found in leaderboards

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:09.706
recently played lists

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:11.026
multiplayer matches and so

00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:11.386
forth.

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:14.306
The scoped identifiers for

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:16.266
GKPlayers will be instance based

00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:17.876
on the context in which they are

00:07:17.876 --> 00:07:18.346
used.

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:21.426
For example, their scope to each

00:07:21.426 --> 00:07:22.796
instance of a leaderboard or

00:07:22.796 --> 00:07:24.396
each instance of a multiplayer

00:07:24.396 --> 00:07:26.656
match, which means that you

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:28.286
cannot count on them to persist

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:29.506
in subsequent matches.

00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:33.756
Let's say you have your own

00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:35.066
player accounting system.

00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:36.496
In which case, you'll be loading

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:37.866
the corresponding GKPlayer

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:38.456
objects.

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:40.716
To do this, use the

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:42.326
loadPlayersForIdentifiers:

00:07:42.406 --> 00:07:43.676
withCompletionHandler method

00:07:43.676 --> 00:07:44.906
found on GKPlayer.

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:47.846
You may use either the team

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:49.646
player ID or the game player ID

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:51.006
for the identifiers.

00:07:53.436 --> 00:07:54.496
When you use the new

00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:56.246
identifiers, there is a very

00:07:56.516 --> 00:07:58.036
rare case where the scoped

00:07:58.036 --> 00:07:59.126
identifiers will not be

00:07:59.126 --> 00:07:59.606
available.

00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:02.196
So what should you do if the

00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:03.506
scoped identifiers are not

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:03.956
available?

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:06.986
Usually, when a player launches

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.516
one of your games, the scoped

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:10.246
identifiers for the local player

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:11.346
will be available after

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:12.636
successful authentication.

00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:16.296
However, there is a slim chance

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:17.806
that the scoped identifiers may

00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:18.876
not be available.

00:08:19.826 --> 00:08:21.696
For this case, we've added a new

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:23.046
API to GKPlayer.

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:25.256
Scoped IDs are persistent.

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:28.266
This property will be false if

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:29.206
they are not available.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.416
This means that you'll need to

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:34.066
check this property before using

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:35.506
the team player ID or game

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:36.976
player ID for the local player.

00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:40.206
So let's tie all this

00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:41.416
information together by

00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:43.025
considering an example of using

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:44.546
the scoped identifiers after

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:45.846
successful authentication.

00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:49.396
As you know, when the

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:50.886
authenticate handler returns,

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:52.486
you need to check if Game Center

00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:53.536
has returned you a view

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:54.086
controller.

00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:56.666
If so, then you present the view

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:57.826
controller when convenient.

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:02.276
If there is no view controller

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:03.206
and the local player has

00:09:03.206 --> 00:09:04.696
successfully authenticated, then

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.376
you will be able to use the

00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:07.996
scoped identifiers after first

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.636
checking the scoped IDs are a

00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:10.576
persistent value.

00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:15.286
If you are persisting the player

00:09:15.286 --> 00:09:17.166
ID in your own back end system,

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:19.116
now is when you should convert

00:09:19.116 --> 00:09:20.596
from the old static identifier

00:09:20.596 --> 00:09:22.296
to the new scope identifiers.

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:25.846
I will now wrap up by

00:09:25.846 --> 00:09:26.736
summarizing what I have

00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:27.496
presented today.

00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:30.036
Game Center is introducing new

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.696
scoped identifiers with the goal

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.106
of increasing player privacy.

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:36.166
A player's team player ID is

00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:37.586
scoped to your development team.

00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:40.446
A player's game player ID is

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.716
scoped to a game and will

00:09:41.716 --> 00:09:43.256
persist with that game if it is

00:09:43.256 --> 00:09:44.496
transferred from one developer

00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:45.066
to another.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.436
Use these new scoped identifiers

00:09:48.436 --> 00:09:50.096
in Game Center APIs as you will

00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:51.186
use the player ID.

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:54.136
Both of these identifiers are

00:09:54.136 --> 00:09:55.536
available now so start using

00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:56.056
them today.

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:00.786
