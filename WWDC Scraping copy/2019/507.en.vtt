00:00:01.516 --> 00:00:05.776
[ Music ]

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:08.116
>> Hi, my name is Eryk Vershen.

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:09.826
I'm an engineer on the HLS

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:10.676
Streaming Team.

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:12.906
Let's get started talking about

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:14.656
HLS Authoring for AirPlay 2

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:15.186
Video.

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:19.016
Ever since we introduced AirPlay

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:21.136
on iOS users have enjoyed

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:22.996
AirPlaying video to their Apple

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:26.216
TVs and starting this year we're

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:27.546
expanding that support

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:29.926
dramatically with AirPlay built

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.456
directly into TVs.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:35.906
Apple TV and AirPlay capable TVs

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:37.736
both provide the highest quality

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.196
video playback experience.

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:41.496
You may remember that we have

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:43.406
some specific requirements for

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:45.476
content delivered to tvOS and

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:46.246
Apple TV.

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:48.956
These AirPlay capable TVs are a

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:50.676
new class of devices so they

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.096
have their own requirements.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.076
We have a simple agenda.

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:56.886
I'll cover the new requirements

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.596
and then I'll talk about changes

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.296
we made to the validation tools

00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:01.816
to help you check for issues.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.606
We released a new version of the

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:08.206
HLS authoring specification

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:09.676
recently that talks about the

00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:11.376
additional requirements for

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:12.076
AirPlay 2.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:15.996
Here is a condensed list.

00:01:16.116 --> 00:01:18.136
Don't worry about absorbing this

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:18.856
list right now.

00:01:18.856 --> 00:01:20.366
I'll devote a whole slide to

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.266
each line item.

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:25.346
Let's look at the details.

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.536
You need to synchronize the

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:27.576
different variants.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.346
This makes switching easier.

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:31.626
If these color bars represent

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:32.576
different variants on a

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:35.806
timeline, what we want to do is

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:37.756
make them all line up nicely.

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:39.856
We are recommending that you use

00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:41.526
at least millisecond precision

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:44.186
and as always your video

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:46.206
segments should start with IDR

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:46.856
frames.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:49.756
You also want to avoid most

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:51.246
changes of discontinuities.

00:01:51.426 --> 00:01:53.396
For example, do not switch

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:56.296
between HEVC and H.264 or

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:58.196
between AAC and Dolby Digital.

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.146
These TVs aren't able to switch

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:03.076
as seamlessly as iOS or Apple

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:03.576
TV.

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:06.116
You can change your frame rate

00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:07.286
but not arbitrarily.

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:09.306
No switching between 25 frame

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:10.515
per second and 30.

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:15.146
You also want each codec to

00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:16.596
provide a good set of variance

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:17.416
on its own.

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.646
These TVs will stick with the

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:20.696
codec they start with.

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:23.116
So, in particular, don't try to

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:25.166
use H.264 just for low

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.276
resolution video and HEVC for

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:28.486
high-resolution video.

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:30.766
That works on other devices but

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:31.406
not here.

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:33.766
You should, of course, be using

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:34.946
I-frame variance.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.716
They make fast-forward, rewind

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:38.066
and seeking more effective.

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:40.186
Because these devices don't want

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:41.706
to switch codecs you need to

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:43.416
have a set of I-frame variance

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:44.946
matching the codec of the normal

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:45.436
video.

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:49.676
The encryption requirements

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.226
listed here aren't really

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:53.216
specific to AirPlay 2, but we

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:54.266
wanted to call them out.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.066
The common encryption standard

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.906
recommends 10% partial

00:02:58.906 --> 00:02:59.446
encryption.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:01.676
With FairPlay we are requiring

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:03.456
it; other patterns will not

00:03:03.456 --> 00:03:03.866
work.

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:06.446
For sample encryption there are

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:07.506
two ways to market.

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.836
The CMAF way with an senc box

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:12.586
and the ISO base media file

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:14.926
format way with a pair of saio

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:16.726
and saiz boxes.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:18.706
We prefer the second form, but

00:03:18.706 --> 00:03:19.746
you can provide both.

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.156
Lastly, some miscellaneous

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:23.866
requirements.

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:25.846
If you want to provide HDR

00:03:25.846 --> 00:03:27.456
content, your best bet is to

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:29.206
provide multiple formats.

00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:30.956
For example, Dolby Vision and

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:33.536
HDR 10 as TVs may support only

00:03:33.536 --> 00:03:37.256
one of the formats, use WebVTT

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:40.096
for subtitles and we are now

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:41.916
recommending MIME types for all

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:42.606
your content.

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:44.426
Let's go into little more detail

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:45.006
about that.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.196
We've had a MIME type for HLS

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.556
playlist for a long time.

00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:51.656
The MIME types we are suggesting

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:53.296
for video and audio are what you

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:54.076
might expect.

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:56.756
Notice we are using text/plain

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:58.626
for WebVTT even though the

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:01.576
WebVTT spec says text/VTT.

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:04.846
However, the text VTT type was

00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:06.796
not registered with the IANA and

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.796
will be rejected by some

00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:09.366
clients.

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:11.886
So use text/plain instead.

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:15.386
Here's a list of some of the

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:16.896
less common MIME types.

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:18.875
Now the last 2 on this list are

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.446
not applicable to AirPlay 2

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:21.116
content.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:22.476
I've listed them because we are

00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:24.026
recommending MIME types for all

00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:25.866
content not just AirPlay 2.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:30.146
Let's turn to how you can check

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:30.906
your streams.

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:34.776
Remember that there are two

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.936
tools for HLS validation.

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:39.036
These tools are complementary.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.796
Mediastreamvalidator is checking

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:44.296
against the HLS specification.

00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:45.786
HLSreport on the other hand is

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.136
checking against the authoring

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:47.986
specification.

00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:50.296
You should always be using both

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:50.856
tools.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:52.596
I suggest you make a script that

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:53.656
runs them as a pair.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:56.916
We've made an important change

00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:58.016
to HLSreport.

00:04:58.596 --> 00:05:00.086
Formerly you had to run it

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:02.206
multiple times with the dash os

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:03.556
option if you wanted to check

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:05.836
the rules for iOS and TVOS.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.676
Now it checks all rule sets by

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:10.456
default including the rules for

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.216
AirPlay 2.

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:14.346
The rule set option is there to

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.726
modify the sets you check but

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:17.206
most of you won't need to use

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:17.366
it.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.586
And while the OS option does

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:21.156
still work, you should stop

00:05:21.156 --> 00:05:21.706
using it.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.376
Let's look at how the output

00:05:25.376 --> 00:05:27.116
from HLSreport has changed.

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:30.326
Notice that the title line now

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:32.056
shows all the rule sets that

00:05:32.056 --> 00:05:32.656
were checked.

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:37.126
The rules portion is now grouped

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:38.886
into sections for each rule set.

00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:40.736
Here we have the general

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:41.456
requirements.

00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:43.696
There can be Must Fix and Should

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:45.766
Fix subsections for each rule

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:46.116
set.

00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:49.576
Now farther down in the output

00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:51.366
we have the iOS requirements.

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:54.096
I want you to notice that rule

00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:56.136
10 above here the last general

00:05:56.136 --> 00:05:58.166
rule is marked as Should Fix.

00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:01.666
Whereas here in the AirPlay 2

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:03.566
section the same rule is a Must

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:03.926
Fix.

00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:07.966
If there are no rule violations

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.516
for a section or subsection,

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:10.956
then that section or subsection

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:11.586
is dropped.

00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:13.876
For example, this stream has no

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.566
Should F ixes for AirPlay 2.

00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:19.656
The main points to take away are

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:21.496
we added new requirements for

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:22.726
AirPlay 2 devices.

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:25.456
Remember to use HLSreport so you

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:26.616
check against the authoring

00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:27.466
specification.

00:06:27.956 --> 00:06:30.496
And HLSreport now checks all

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:31.906
rule sets by default.

00:06:33.796 --> 00:06:36.006
This is session 507 so you know

00:06:36.006 --> 00:06:37.276
where to go for more info.

00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:39.066
We'll have links there to the

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.446
authoring specification to the

00:06:40.446 --> 00:06:42.086
tools and to other information

00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:43.126
about HLS.

00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:45.316
Thanks for your attention.

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:46.456
Have a great rest of the

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:46.946
conference.
