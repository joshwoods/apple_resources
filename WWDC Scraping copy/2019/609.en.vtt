00:00:20.146 --> 00:00:20.546
>> Good morning.

00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:22.266
Great to see you.

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.016
I hope you're all having an

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:25.156
awesome WWDC.

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:27.696
We're super excited to be here

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:29.156
today to chat with you about

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:30.836
Building AR Experiences with

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:31.686
Reality Composer.

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:34.186
I'm Michelle and with me are my

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:36.286
colleagues, Pau and Abhi.

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:37.886
And today we're going to cover

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.876
what Reality Composer is and how

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:41.346
it can help you create an AR

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:41.876
app.

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:44.236
After this session, you'll know

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:45.406
what's provided with Reality

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:47.406
Composer, how to set up your

00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:49.106
experiences in it, and then how

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:50.716
to take in-- take what you've

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.366
created in Composer into your

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:55.956
app in Xcode.

00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:58.126
So, first, what is Reality

00:00:58.126 --> 00:00:58.626
Composer?

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.766
As you've heard earlier this

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.786
week, Reality Composer is a

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:05.446
tool, an app, to help iOS

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.586
developers get started in

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:09.546
working with 3D and AR.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.886
Some of you have already begun

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:14.886
and it's been really, really

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:17.006
amazing to see what you've all

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:19.136
been making, posting, and

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:20.796
tagging with Reality Composer.

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:23.986
So, please keep doing it.

00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:26.306
If you're not familiar with 3D,

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:28.616
the first time you ever open a

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.896
3D app can be pretty daunting

00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:32.496
and it can be kind of time

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:35.036
consuming to even get started in

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:35.276
AR.

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:38.416
But with Reality Composer, it's

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:41.186
really easy to just pre-vis and

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:43.926
lay out your experiences using

00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:45.316
the built-in content library.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.936
Or, if you prefer, you can use

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:49.236
your own USDZs.

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:52.016
And if you're not familiar, USDZ

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:54.456
is just a 3D file format that's

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:56.146
supported in Reality Composer.

00:01:57.686 --> 00:01:58.926
Once you've got the experience

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:00.426
laid out, you can add simple

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:02.586
interactions and animations with

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:04.426
the behavior system before you

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:06.076
even commit to writing any code.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:07.646
So, it really speeds up the

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:09.336
iteration time on the experience

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:09.816
itself.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:12.066
And then finally, everything

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.116
that you've made in Reality

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:14.606
Composer you can take directly

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:17.736
into your app in Xcode.

00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:20.656
And so much about building for

00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:23.376
augmented reality is in seeing

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:25.376
how the experience feels in

00:02:25.376 --> 00:02:27.476
physical space, looking at it on

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:28.936
the intended device and seeing

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.816
how your audience might see that

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:31.446
experience.

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:33.616
So, Reality Composer is

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:37.466
available on macOS, iPhone and

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.386
iPad, and you can edit on iOS so

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:41.826
that you can develop on your

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.216
regular dev machine and then

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.806
edit on iOS in order to continue

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:48.096
working on the exact same

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:50.406
project on iPad or iPhone.

00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:53.716
Alternately, you can also just

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.536
start the project on your iOS

00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:57.686
devices and take it the other

00:02:57.686 --> 00:02:57.856
way.

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:04.386
So, today I'm going to take you

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:05.696
through building scenes.

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.726
Pau will cover adding behaviors

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:08.666
and using physics.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.106
And then Abhi's going to take

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:13.266
you through building an app.

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:17.536
So, for building scenes, first,

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:18.316
what's a scene?

00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:20.746
So, as you may have heard in the

00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:23.206
introduction to RealityKit and

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:25.246
Reality Composer talk, a Reality

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.986
Composer scene is essentially a

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:29.126
collection of entities and it

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.486
contains an anchor, objects,

00:03:31.996 --> 00:03:34.506
behaviors, and a physics world.

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:37.776
Every scene has exactly one

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:39.296
anchor, and when you start a

00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:41.156
project or when you start a

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:42.996
scene, any scene, you'll be

00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:44.836
asked what kind of scene, what

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:46.046
kind of experience are you

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:46.486
building.

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:48.576
If you're building something for

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:51.956
a room, a stage, or a tabletop,

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:53.466
you'll choose the horizontal

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:53.766
anchor.

00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:56.246
If you want it to be on a wall,

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:57.216
pick vertical.

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:00.546
If you're augmenting a book or

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:03.326
some packaging, a brochure, or a

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.666
movie poster, choose the image

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:06.076
anchor.

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:08.506
And for selfie effects like

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:11.446
glasses or hats, choose the face

00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:11.776
anchor.

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:14.616
Projects can have multiple

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:16.745
scenes but I think you'll find

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:17.805
when you're first starting out,

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:19.276
one or two scenes is usually

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:19.805
sufficient.

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:22.906
Okay, so in this case, let's

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.346
assume that you've picked the

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:25.296
horizontal anchor.

00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:27.596
And so here we are.

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:29.896
The content is our focus in

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:30.636
Reality Composer.

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:33.236
So, it's laid out exactly as you

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:35.556
would see it in AR in the Main

00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:37.476
View Port or the workspace.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:39.736
And this pane on the right here

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:42.116
shows you the properties of

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.406
whatever you selected and shows

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:46.116
you options for configuring that

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:49.106
entity, be it the object itself,

00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:50.656
like this text that's selected

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:50.926
here.

00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:52.476
You can see that it's selected

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:53.426
because of the ring.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:57.176
You can select the object, or a

00:04:57.176 --> 00:04:57.596
scene.

00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:00.256
I could show you more slides,

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.836
but why don't we check out

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.886
Composer together on iPad.

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:07.046
Oh, I want you to remember this

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:07.526
scene, though.

00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:08.456
Because we're going to be

00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:10.296
building up this little tutorial

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:11.806
over the course of the session

00:05:11.806 --> 00:05:12.186
together.

00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:15.316
It's Seasons and Solar System

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:15.706
lesson.

00:05:15.996 --> 00:05:19.946
We'll build up in AR.

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:23.676
Okay, so for our demo, I'm going

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:25.556
to show you three quite

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:27.816
different RC projects today.

00:05:27.816 --> 00:05:30.026
The first is a little primer.

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:34.426
And it's going to show you kind

00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:35.736
of just five really basic

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.366
examples of things you could

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:38.546
create in Reality Composer

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:39.876
probably just in a couple of

00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:40.316
minutes.

00:05:40.926 --> 00:05:44.186
The second is a much more richer

00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:46.696
and more complex experience, a

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:47.886
full experience, of what you

00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:49.156
could create just in Reality

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:51.366
Composer alone if you didn't

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:52.636
want to write code at all.

00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:53.816
So, this is great if you're not

00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:55.406
a developer or you're just kind

00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:56.506
of starting out and you want to

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:58.246
just try out the experience

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:00.926
before you fully commit to it

00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:02.946
when you make your app.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.776
And finally, we're going to

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:06.826
build that Seasons scene that we

00:06:06.826 --> 00:06:07.536
saw together.

00:06:08.146 --> 00:06:11.186
Okay, so here is the primer in

00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:11.976
Reality Composer.

00:06:11.976 --> 00:06:14.606
And I'm going to take us into

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:17.326
AR, because that was how we

00:06:17.326 --> 00:06:18.146
intended to see it.

00:06:18.956 --> 00:06:20.086
Okay, so these are the five

00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:21.426
examples I mentioned, and let's

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.986
press play so that we kind of

00:06:23.986 --> 00:06:25.826
see the interactions.

00:06:26.176 --> 00:06:28.536
So, when we started, we're just,

00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:29.126
oh, hi everyone.

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:32.236
When we just started, the spiral

00:06:32.236 --> 00:06:32.976
started spinning.

00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:35.316
And here, if I get close in the

00:06:35.316 --> 00:06:37.106
second example, I can make this

00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:37.916
chess piece jiggle.

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:42.886
I can tap this one for physics

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:43.966
[popping sound] and audio

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:44.033
[popping sound].

00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:46.076
It's kind of a fun sound.

00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:47.866
And then someone had asked if

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.636
I'm an animator and I have my

00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:52.266
own models, I have my own

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:54.676
animations, can I bring them

00:06:54.676 --> 00:06:55.566
into Reality Composer?

00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:57.856
And yes, you can.

00:06:57.856 --> 00:06:59.746
And you can trigger them on user

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:00.806
interactions like a tap.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.496
And if you're not an animator,

00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:04.546
you can use prebuilt emphasis

00:07:04.546 --> 00:07:06.416
animations on any object in the

00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:06.856
scene.

00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:08.546
Here we've applied them to some

00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:09.936
pretty basic shapes but you can

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:11.236
apply them, you know, to this

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:12.416
dancer as well.

00:07:13.026 --> 00:07:16.266
So, that's the Scene in AR.

00:07:17.516 --> 00:07:21.116
[ Applause ]

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:23.716
Next, I'm going to show you this

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:26.546
more complex experience, richer

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.176
experience.

00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:28.986
Oh, and you're probably

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:30.036
wondering how I'm moving the

00:07:30.036 --> 00:07:31.676
content around the scene and

00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:32.466
moving the camera.

00:07:32.866 --> 00:07:35.616
So, for panning, all I'm doing

00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:37.856
is taking two fingers, moving

00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:39.656
them across like this so I can

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:41.406
see the content exactly as I

00:07:41.406 --> 00:07:41.726
want.

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:43.906
If you were watching State of

00:07:43.906 --> 00:07:45.506
the Union on Tuesday, this

00:07:45.646 --> 00:07:47.286
island might look familiar to

00:07:47.286 --> 00:07:47.396
you.

00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:48.846
And we wanted to build up the

00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:49.856
experience a bit more.

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:50.706
So, if you imagine you're

00:07:50.706 --> 00:07:52.406
making, like, a museum

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:56.006
installation or a tourism center

00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:57.806
experience, that's something

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:59.426
that we kind of envisioned here.

00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:02.036
So, let's look at this here in

00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:06.056
AR and I'm going to press play

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:06.896
to start.

00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:10.466
[ Crashing waves ]

00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:12.606
So, you should hear some waves.

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:16.506
And now we're being prompted to

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:18.306
tap on the helicopter, so let's

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:18.606
do that.

00:08:19.516 --> 00:08:22.196
[ Helicopter blades thumping ]

00:08:22.696 --> 00:08:24.136
You can see we were also asked

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.886
to tap a location to learn more.

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:28.166
So, I'm going to do that tap on

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:29.516
these markers now, and you can

00:08:29.516 --> 00:08:31.766
see I'm getting more information

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:33.336
about each location as I tap.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.936
The other ones fade off.

00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:42.736
[ Helicopter blades thumping ]

00:08:43.236 --> 00:08:45.296
And so I'm just going to take

00:08:45.296 --> 00:08:46.816
apart what we did to build up

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:47.546
this scene.

00:08:49.106 --> 00:08:52.266
So, there's actually not much

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:55.226
custom content in this scene

00:08:55.226 --> 00:08:55.586
itself.

00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:57.676
There's only two artist-created

00:08:57.676 --> 00:08:59.996
custom USDZs, the island and the

00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:00.666
helicopter.

00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.016
You can see here we imported

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:02.506
them.

00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:04.476
You can import more if you want.

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:07.136
The rest are just built in from

00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:08.606
the content library that comes

00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:09.306
with Reality Composer.

00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:10.386
You can see we have a lot of

00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:12.076
stuff here.

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:13.736
Text, basic shapes.

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:14.746
And that's kind of what you're

00:09:14.896 --> 00:09:16.416
seeing in this scene.

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:18.806
These markers are just basic

00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:19.146
shapes.

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:22.156
We group them to create two

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:23.506
pieces as one marker.

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:25.606
Have text here.

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:27.816
The other question we get asked

00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:31.526
a lot is I work mostly in 2D and

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:33.696
so I have a lot of photos and,

00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:35.906
you know, company graphics.

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:37.556
Can I use them in Reality

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:37.936
Composer?

00:09:37.936 --> 00:09:39.766
And the answer is yes, of course

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:40.936
you can!

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:42.346
You can bring them into the

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:46.866
experience as photos using the

00:09:46.866 --> 00:09:48.496
Picture Frame, which is in the

00:09:48.496 --> 00:09:49.766
Content Library that we just

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:51.926
saw.

00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:54.556
Finally, you're probably

00:09:54.556 --> 00:09:55.756
wondering how did we create

00:09:55.756 --> 00:09:57.326
those little interactions.

00:09:57.686 --> 00:09:59.596
So, if we go to Behaviors by

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.066
clicking on this Behaviors

00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:04.326
button in the top right, you can

00:10:04.326 --> 00:10:05.496
see the Behaviors we used to

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:07.936
create the flow of that sequence

00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:09.606
and those interactions.

00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:12.116
So, we're billboarding things to

00:10:12.116 --> 00:10:13.376
look, you might've noticed as I

00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:15.146
moved around the scene, those

00:10:15.196 --> 00:10:17.346
items looked at me.

00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:18.926
So, we're using the Look At

00:10:18.926 --> 00:10:21.346
actions here to make everything

00:10:21.346 --> 00:10:22.206
look at the camera.

00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:24.866
At the beginning, you saw just

00:10:25.246 --> 00:10:28.006
the island, and everything else

00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:28.626
was hidden.

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:29.596
So, you can see that we hid

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.126
everything else and then we

00:10:31.126 --> 00:10:32.766
showed them to you in sequence.

00:10:33.016 --> 00:10:34.926
So, we waited for 0.2 seconds,

00:10:35.256 --> 00:10:37.276
and then first we showed the

00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:38.386
helicopter text.

00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.526
Then we showed the helicopter

00:10:40.526 --> 00:10:42.016
itself and its tap to start.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:44.826
And then we faded the markers in

00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:45.996
from below, so that's what this

00:10:45.996 --> 00:10:47.336
move from below is doing and I

00:10:47.336 --> 00:10:48.766
can preview that to you now just

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:50.356
by pressing play on the card.

00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:55.336
I'm going to show you also a

00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:56.216
little secret.

00:10:57.536 --> 00:11:00.066
These birds, you might've

00:11:00.736 --> 00:11:00.946
noticed--

00:11:05.616 --> 00:11:07.346
I'm just going to look at them

00:11:07.346 --> 00:11:07.646
here.

00:11:07.966 --> 00:11:10.226
So, we asked them to orbit the

00:11:10.226 --> 00:11:11.466
island as a group.

00:11:12.326 --> 00:11:14.646
And they're not really birds at

00:11:14.646 --> 00:11:15.106
all.

00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:17.886
They're just primitives that

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.336
we're using, or just basic

00:11:19.336 --> 00:11:22.346
shapes that we've put two move

00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:24.876
cards on to flap their wings.

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:26.396
So instead of investing time in

00:11:26.396 --> 00:11:27.936
creating birds, all we did was

00:11:27.936 --> 00:11:29.236
we took a couple shapes and put

00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:32.426
two action cards on them to make

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:33.136
an animation.

00:11:33.696 --> 00:11:35.126
And if you've tried to animate

00:11:35.186 --> 00:11:36.516
something in 3D before, you know

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:38.446
how time consuming a simple

00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:39.916
thing like this can be, and this

00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:41.286
takes just a couple of seconds.

00:11:41.906 --> 00:11:46.916
So, that's an example of a full

00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:48.786
experience that you can make in

00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:51.066
Reality Composer without any

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:51.596
code at all.

00:11:52.056 --> 00:11:53.656
And the really great part about

00:11:53.656 --> 00:11:55.246
this is that once you have this

00:11:55.246 --> 00:11:57.456
Reality file, you can just share

00:11:57.456 --> 00:11:59.986
it with anyone and preview it in

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:01.686
AR QuickLook, and the experience

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:03.046
will be exactly as you've done

00:12:03.046 --> 00:12:03.636
it in Composer.

00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:05.926
So, that's that second project.

00:12:07.516 --> 00:12:11.986
[ Applause ]

00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:14.516
So, finally let's build up the

00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:16.496
experience of the Seasons lesson

00:12:16.496 --> 00:12:16.896
together.

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:19.456
So, I'm going to add three

00:12:19.526 --> 00:12:21.516
celestial bodies, the Sun, the

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:22.886
Moon, and the Earth.

00:12:23.406 --> 00:12:25.276
So for this I'll just block in

00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:27.996
the scene with some placeholder

00:12:27.996 --> 00:12:29.706
objects to start us off.

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:31.096
So, here's the Sun.

00:12:31.096 --> 00:12:31.796
I've brought it in.

00:12:32.536 --> 00:12:36.976
And now I'm going to duplicate

00:12:37.536 --> 00:12:37.606
it

00:12:38.996 --> 00:12:44.056
to create the Earth and I'm just

00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:45.906
using pinch here to zoom us out

00:12:45.906 --> 00:12:47.496
a little bit, to move the

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:47.726
camera.

00:12:48.316 --> 00:12:51.486
So, let's grab this arrow to

00:12:51.486 --> 00:12:52.326
move the Earth over.

00:12:52.326 --> 00:12:56.636
And then next I need also a

00:12:56.636 --> 00:12:57.286
Moon.

00:12:58.026 --> 00:12:59.276
So, let's duplicate this guy one

00:12:59.276 --> 00:12:59.976
more time.

00:13:00.686 --> 00:13:02.056
Bring it over to about here.

00:13:02.056 --> 00:13:04.926
And then I can kind of grab

00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:06.516
anywhere in this ring to move it

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:07.466
up in this plane.

00:13:08.056 --> 00:13:09.176
So let's move it over.

00:13:09.596 --> 00:13:10.086
Okay, great.

00:13:10.086 --> 00:13:12.776
And now I want to scale the Moon

00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:13.806
down a little bit.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:15.236
So I'm just going to grab the

00:13:15.236 --> 00:13:17.186
ring and move inwards to scale

00:13:17.856 --> 00:13:17.926
it.

00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:20.656
There we go.

00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:22.956
Move it a little closer.

00:13:23.996 --> 00:13:24.886
Okay, so I have these three

00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:25.546
celestial bodies.

00:13:25.856 --> 00:13:27.406
Let's scale the Sun up.

00:13:27.446 --> 00:13:28.516
So I'll grab the ring again.

00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:30.176
Just grab it to scale.

00:13:31.586 --> 00:13:32.286
Scale the Sun.

00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:35.896
So we've got our three items

00:13:35.926 --> 00:13:36.126
there.

00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:40.366
Next I'm going to add some text.

00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:41.666
So I go to the content library

00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:42.026
again.

00:13:42.616 --> 00:13:43.596
Let's grab the text.

00:13:43.596 --> 00:13:46.526
And it's a little bit below

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:47.836
where I want it to be, so I'm

00:13:47.836 --> 00:13:49.496
just going to grab this green

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.366
arrow and drag it up.

00:13:51.336 --> 00:13:52.926
And you can see it pop up to the

00:13:52.926 --> 00:13:53.956
ground plane.

00:13:54.086 --> 00:13:56.536
And it's doing that because I

00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:57.546
have snapping turned on.

00:13:57.546 --> 00:13:58.466
So, if you look in the left

00:13:58.466 --> 00:13:59.276
corner, we have this little

00:13:59.276 --> 00:14:00.846
magnet, and I can turn snapping

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:02.256
off if I want to move stuff

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:03.586
freely, but actually I just want

00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:04.986
to pull this blue arrow to bring

00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:05.456
it forward.

00:14:05.886 --> 00:14:08.686
And I want it to be about half a

00:14:08.686 --> 00:14:13.106
meter or so from the Sun.

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:16.396
And I'm going to open the pane

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:17.886
that we saw on the right to

00:14:17.886 --> 00:14:19.156
change up the text.

00:14:19.586 --> 00:14:21.316
So, let's just make it say

00:14:21.406 --> 00:14:21.776
autumn.

00:14:22.356 --> 00:14:26.646
It's super easy to just add

00:14:26.646 --> 00:14:28.716
these elements in Composer.

00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:32.096
So, finally, I think that's

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:34.156
pretty much where I want it to

00:14:34.356 --> 00:14:34.496
be.

00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:35.506
So, all I'm doing to move the

00:14:35.506 --> 00:14:37.126
camera around is using my finger

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:37.956
and touching the screen.

00:14:38.956 --> 00:14:44.096
Next I'm going to add an arrow.

00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:47.946
And it's not pointing the right

00:14:47.946 --> 00:14:49.706
direction I want it to be, kind

00:14:49.706 --> 00:14:50.346
of rotated.

00:14:50.346 --> 00:14:52.276
So, I'm going to move the camera

00:14:52.756 --> 00:14:54.986
so I can see the green ring

00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:57.266
which is sitting on the ground

00:14:57.266 --> 00:14:57.536
plane.

00:14:57.826 --> 00:15:00.136
This ring rotates with the

00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:01.386
camera as I move, so I can

00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:03.186
always be working in the plane

00:15:03.356 --> 00:15:04.766
that I want to be working in.

00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:07.116
If I don't want to move the

00:15:07.116 --> 00:15:08.496
camera to have to do that, I can

00:15:08.496 --> 00:15:10.696
just tap on the arrow and that

00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:11.936
will lock into the corresponding

00:15:11.936 --> 00:15:12.086
area.

00:15:12.086 --> 00:15:12.856
You can see the ring got a

00:15:12.856 --> 00:15:13.696
little fatter there.

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:16.636
So I'm just going to rotate the

00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:18.356
area and it's snapping to 15

00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:19.116
degree increments.

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:20.006
Again, because I have that

00:15:20.046 --> 00:15:21.046
snapping turned on.

00:15:21.506 --> 00:15:23.076
But if I didn't want to have it

00:15:23.076 --> 00:15:24.396
snap, I could move it freely.

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:25.856
So here I'm dragging it and it's

00:15:25.856 --> 00:15:28.726
moving always in the horizontal

00:15:28.726 --> 00:15:30.056
plane for this green ring here.

00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:31.966
But I actually do want it to

00:15:31.966 --> 00:15:34.416
snap between the Sun, sphere,

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:35.586
and the autumn text.

00:15:35.586 --> 00:15:36.576
So, I'm going to turn snapping

00:15:36.576 --> 00:15:36.826
on.

00:15:36.826 --> 00:15:39.066
You can see it snapping into

00:15:39.066 --> 00:15:39.306
place.

00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:41.626
So, it's just super useful,

00:15:41.626 --> 00:15:42.186
super easy.

00:15:42.956 --> 00:15:46.086
Then I want to modify this arrow

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:46.646
a little bit.

00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:50.186
So, I can go ahead and click the

00:15:50.186 --> 00:15:52.466
icon next to snapping to modify

00:15:52.926 --> 00:15:52.993
it.

00:15:53.146 --> 00:15:54.906
I'm just going to zoom this in a

00:15:54.906 --> 00:15:56.026
little so we can see better.

00:15:56.116 --> 00:15:58.376
And I can grab this handle.

00:15:58.806 --> 00:15:59.406
Drag it.

00:16:00.736 --> 00:16:02.356
I'm also just going to make this

00:16:02.926 --> 00:16:04.926
just a touch smaller, a little

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:05.376
flatter.

00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:09.196
Okay. And then I'm going to move

00:16:09.196 --> 00:16:12.276
it just a little bit more.

00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:13.656
Okay, so now everything is kind

00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:15.086
of blocked out, and we did that

00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:15.936
in just a couple minutes.

00:16:16.936 --> 00:16:19.316
I actually want to replace these

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:21.046
celestial bodies because they're

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:22.356
all pretty indistinct right now

00:16:22.536 --> 00:16:24.386
and I want to import some custom

00:16:24.386 --> 00:16:24.966
USDZs.

00:16:25.736 --> 00:16:27.266
And since I already have them

00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:29.416
placed exactly where I want, I'm

00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:30.246
going to do a replace.

00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:32.206
So I just tap on this object.

00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:33.726
I get this edit menu.

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:34.816
Hit replace.

00:16:35.146 --> 00:16:40.946
And I'm going to import the Sun,

00:16:41.996 --> 00:16:43.886
and it'll just replace.

00:16:43.886 --> 00:16:45.386
And you can see it's the same

00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:47.226
scale and it's exactly in the

00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:48.336
right position that I wanted.

00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:52.906
I can do the same with the

00:16:52.906 --> 00:16:53.256
Earth.

00:16:53.256 --> 00:16:55.946
So let's do that really quick.

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:57.976
There it is.

00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:01.746
And the Moon, I'm just going to

00:17:03.326 --> 00:17:04.766
customize it a little bit here

00:17:04.766 --> 00:17:06.925
with some, let's see, I want the

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:07.986
map material.

00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:09.386
And I can make the Moon, like,

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:10.886
any color that I want, but I

00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:12.665
think I'm just going to pick

00:17:12.726 --> 00:17:14.866
grey for the sake of safety.

00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:18.826
And if I want to see any of

00:17:18.826 --> 00:17:19.925
these items a little better, I

00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.976
can just double tap on them to

00:17:22.026 --> 00:17:22.766
frame the object.

00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:24.046
It's a really easy way to get

00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:24.906
around the scene.

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:27.106
Or if I want to see the scene,

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:29.696
pull back, I can double tap on

00:17:30.106 --> 00:17:31.576
anywhere in the grid to see the

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:31.936
scene.

00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:33.396
Those shortcuts are here too.

00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:36.766
Frame scene or frame selected.

00:17:39.466 --> 00:17:42.066
Okay, so we're just about ready,

00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:43.666
I think, to add Behaviors.

00:17:44.026 --> 00:17:45.236
I could add all of the other

00:17:45.286 --> 00:17:46.526
elements but for the sake of

00:17:46.526 --> 00:17:49.126
time we won't do all of that

00:17:49.126 --> 00:17:49.326
now.

00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:50.846
There's a few tips I want to

00:17:50.846 --> 00:17:52.766
leave you with before we finish

00:17:52.816 --> 00:17:55.666
this part of the demo.

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:57.156
That replace that you saw?

00:17:57.946 --> 00:17:59.436
If we had Behaviors applied to

00:17:59.436 --> 00:18:00.816
this already like we were doing

00:18:01.236 --> 00:18:03.146
any animations on, like, let's

00:18:03.146 --> 00:18:05.446
say the Sun, if I replaced it,

00:18:05.976 --> 00:18:07.046
those Behaviors would stay.

00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:08.566
So, it's a huge time saver if

00:18:08.566 --> 00:18:09.766
you're just like swapping in new

00:18:09.766 --> 00:18:12.186
versions of content.

00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:13.196
It's really powerful.

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:15.386
And then also we mentioned

00:18:15.476 --> 00:18:16.516
having multiple scenes.

00:18:16.516 --> 00:18:18.096
You can access them here with

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:19.316
the Scene Selector in the top

00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:19.836
left.

00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:21.446
And so if you wanted to add any

00:18:21.446 --> 00:18:24.776
more scenes, you just add them

00:18:24.976 --> 00:18:25.330
here.

00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:29.206
If you are working with these

00:18:29.206 --> 00:18:31.266
entities in Xcode, you're going

00:18:31.266 --> 00:18:32.206
to want to name them.

00:18:32.206 --> 00:18:33.556
And you'll see more about this

00:18:33.556 --> 00:18:34.666
later on in the session.

00:18:35.136 --> 00:18:36.416
And you can do that when you

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:37.126
open the pane.

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:38.326
There's a configure panel and

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.436
you can just name the entity

00:18:39.436 --> 00:18:39.766
here.

00:18:40.056 --> 00:18:43.656
I'm going to name it Sun.

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:44.716
Finally, if there's something

00:18:44.716 --> 00:18:46.316
you didn't want to do, like

00:18:46.316 --> 00:18:49.226
let's say I moved the Earth and

00:18:49.226 --> 00:18:50.126
I didn't want to do that.

00:18:50.466 --> 00:18:51.906
I can undo that action.

00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:56.806
I can also long press and redo

00:18:56.976 --> 00:18:59.696
and it'll tell me, like, what

00:18:59.696 --> 00:19:02.996
the undo that I, what the undo

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:08.226
is that I'm about to invoke.

00:19:09.346 --> 00:19:09.456
Okay.

00:19:09.686 --> 00:19:10.896
Finally, some folks have asked

00:19:10.896 --> 00:19:12.026
what's the easiest way for me to

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.636
share my RC projects?

00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:15.866
And you can airdrop them between

00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:16.486
your devices.

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:18.326
Or like we talked about earlier,

00:19:18.326 --> 00:19:20.266
you can use the edit on iOS to

00:19:20.266 --> 00:19:21.746
go easily between your

00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:23.716
development machine and your iOS

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:24.000
devices.

00:19:26.736 --> 00:19:26.856
Okay.

00:19:27.836 --> 00:19:30.616
So, that's our scene now, ready

00:19:30.616 --> 00:19:32.006
for Behaviors.

00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:35.216
So, you just saw how to build

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:37.226
scenes in Reality Composer.

00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:39.566
So, we took you through how to

00:19:39.566 --> 00:19:41.476
lay stuff out quickly using the

00:19:41.476 --> 00:19:42.476
content library.

00:19:42.796 --> 00:19:44.426
We also showed you how to bring

00:19:44.806 --> 00:19:47.966
in your own custom USDZs.

00:19:47.966 --> 00:19:49.306
And now we're going to move on

00:19:49.386 --> 00:19:51.896
to adding interactions and

00:19:51.896 --> 00:19:52.436
behaviors.

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:53.796
So, to take you through all

00:19:54.406 --> 00:19:55.186
that, let's welcome my

00:19:55.186 --> 00:19:55.686
colleague, Pau.

00:19:56.516 --> 00:19:59.436
[ Applause ]

00:19:59.936 --> 00:20:02.336
>> Thank you, Michelle.

00:20:05.016 --> 00:20:07.666
So, now that we know how to

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.526
bring content to the scene, it's

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:11.576
time to bring all this content

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:11.926
to life.

00:20:12.786 --> 00:20:15.346
So, you might want to play some

00:20:15.346 --> 00:20:16.776
music when the user taps on an

00:20:16.776 --> 00:20:18.836
object, or maybe show some text

00:20:18.936 --> 00:20:20.466
when the user gets close to an

00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:20.776
object.

00:20:21.556 --> 00:20:22.906
Or maybe you just want to play

00:20:22.906 --> 00:20:24.136
some USD animation.

00:20:25.026 --> 00:20:26.206
And so in order to do that and

00:20:26.206 --> 00:20:27.966
more, we need to take advantage

00:20:27.966 --> 00:20:29.026
of Behaviors in Reality

00:20:29.026 --> 00:20:29.476
Composer.

00:20:30.456 --> 00:20:31.296
So, let's get started.

00:20:32.246 --> 00:20:34.396
As we've seen before, a scene in

00:20:34.396 --> 00:20:35.656
Reality Composer contains an

00:20:35.656 --> 00:20:38.326
anchor, objects, behaviors, and

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:38.946
the physics world.

00:20:39.916 --> 00:20:41.426
Behaviors are always scene

00:20:41.426 --> 00:20:41.766
scope.

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:42.956
That means that you can only

00:20:42.956 --> 00:20:44.676
target objects within the same

00:20:44.746 --> 00:20:45.000
scene.

00:20:47.176 --> 00:20:48.666
So, let's take a closer look at

00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:49.536
what the behavior is.

00:20:50.736 --> 00:20:52.326
A behavior is composed by two

00:20:52.326 --> 00:20:54.196
items, the trigger and the

00:20:54.196 --> 00:20:54.856
action sequence.

00:20:55.616 --> 00:20:56.516
The trigger, as the name

00:20:56.516 --> 00:20:58.546
suggests, is simply the criteria

00:20:58.546 --> 00:20:59.646
for the action sequence to

00:20:59.646 --> 00:20:59.956
begin.

00:21:00.686 --> 00:21:02.276
So, let's say we have a scene

00:21:02.276 --> 00:21:03.786
with a model of a record player.

00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:05.696
And when the user taps on it, we

00:21:05.696 --> 00:21:07.706
want to play some music and spin

00:21:07.706 --> 00:21:08.386
at the same time.

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:10.936
Well, in order to do that, you

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:11.766
just need to create the new

00:21:11.766 --> 00:21:14.776
behavior, use a tap trigger, and

00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:15.996
then create an action sequence

00:21:16.046 --> 00:21:17.976
comprised of a music action and

00:21:18.036 --> 00:21:19.500
the spin action.

00:21:20.786 --> 00:21:21.866
So, the first thing when

00:21:21.866 --> 00:21:23.376
creating a new behavior is to

00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:26.266
pick what trigger will begin the

00:21:26.266 --> 00:21:26.906
action sequence.

00:21:27.826 --> 00:21:29.336
Reality Composer comes with five

00:21:29.336 --> 00:21:30.366
different triggers that you can

00:21:30.366 --> 00:21:30.666
use.

00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:34.426
With the start trigger, the

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:35.886
action sequence will begin as

00:21:35.886 --> 00:21:37.116
soon as the scene is loaded.

00:21:37.116 --> 00:21:40.706
With the tap trigger, the action

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:42.566
sequence will begin once the

00:21:42.566 --> 00:21:44.616
user taps on an object that you

00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:44.896
define.

00:21:45.526 --> 00:21:48.226
With a proximity trigger, you

00:21:48.226 --> 00:21:49.736
define a threshold distance from

00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:50.816
the object to the camera.

00:21:51.746 --> 00:21:53.186
Once the camera is close enough

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:54.376
to the object, the action

00:21:54.376 --> 00:21:55.206
sequence will begin.

00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.756
With collision trigger, you

00:21:58.756 --> 00:22:00.656
define two objects, and once

00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:02.966
those two objects collide, the

00:22:02.966 --> 00:22:04.176
action sequence will begin.

00:22:05.016 --> 00:22:06.186
And the last trigger is the

00:22:06.186 --> 00:22:07.146
notification trigger.

00:22:07.776 --> 00:22:09.466
This trigger is what allows you

00:22:09.466 --> 00:22:10.736
to begin action sequences

00:22:10.936 --> 00:22:12.156
programmatically from your app

00:22:12.216 --> 00:22:13.876
and we'll take a look at this

00:22:13.876 --> 00:22:15.116
trigger in the last section of

00:22:15.116 --> 00:22:16.000
this talk.

00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:19.376
So, now let's move into action

00:22:19.376 --> 00:22:19.906
sequences.

00:22:20.846 --> 00:22:23.096
There are three main ways that

00:22:23.096 --> 00:22:24.816
you can modify the execution of

00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:25.606
action sequences.

00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:28.626
Those are groups, loops, and

00:22:28.626 --> 00:22:29.856
exclusive action sequences.

00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:32.096
So, let's start with groups.

00:22:33.096 --> 00:22:35.056
By default, in Reality Composer,

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:36.596
groups play sequentially.

00:22:36.796 --> 00:22:38.476
So, the actions go one after the

00:22:38.726 --> 00:22:38.816
other.

00:22:39.136 --> 00:22:40.916
But you can combine multiple

00:22:40.916 --> 00:22:42.106
actions if you want to play them

00:22:42.106 --> 00:22:42.576
in parallel.

00:22:43.136 --> 00:22:44.546
So, in this example, action two

00:22:44.546 --> 00:22:45.926
and three will play together

00:22:46.266 --> 00:22:47.896
right after action one finishes.

00:22:48.356 --> 00:22:50.366
And action four will only begin

00:22:50.596 --> 00:22:52.586
once all the action in the group

00:22:52.586 --> 00:22:53.476
are over.

00:22:55.376 --> 00:22:57.046
Action sequences can also be

00:22:57.046 --> 00:22:57.306
looped.

00:22:57.996 --> 00:22:59.286
So let's say you want to have

00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:01.016
some music in your scene and you

00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:02.566
want that music to loop forever.

00:23:03.076 --> 00:23:04.226
Well, you just need to create

00:23:04.226 --> 00:23:06.476
the behavior with music action

00:23:06.536 --> 00:23:08.066
in the action sequence and mark

00:23:08.136 --> 00:23:09.276
that action sequence to be

00:23:09.276 --> 00:23:09.486
looped.

00:23:10.146 --> 00:23:13.136
And the last part is the

00:23:13.136 --> 00:23:14.376
exclusive action sequences.

00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:16.606
In Reality Composer, you can

00:23:16.606 --> 00:23:19.346
mark an action sequence to be

00:23:19.956 --> 00:23:20.296
exclusive.

00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:21.776
Only one exclusive action

00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.276
sequences will play at any one

00:23:23.316 --> 00:23:23.586
time.

00:23:24.146 --> 00:23:26.336
That means once an exclusive

00:23:26.336 --> 00:23:28.666
action sequence starts or any

00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:29.786
other running exclusive action

00:23:29.786 --> 00:23:30.786
sequences will stop.

00:23:31.706 --> 00:23:33.286
And action sequences that are

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:35.046
nonexclusive, they will play,

00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:36.876
like, together with other

00:23:36.946 --> 00:23:38.026
exclusive and nonexclusive

00:23:38.026 --> 00:23:38.696
action sequences.

00:23:39.296 --> 00:23:41.146
And that's pretty much all you

00:23:41.146 --> 00:23:42.946
need to know about action

00:23:42.946 --> 00:23:43.476
sequences.

00:23:43.766 --> 00:23:44.966
So now let's take a look at some

00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:46.236
of the actions available to you

00:23:46.706 --> 00:23:47.496
in Reality Composer.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:52.326
With the visibility actions, you

00:23:52.326 --> 00:23:54.256
can bring objects in and out of

00:23:54.256 --> 00:23:56.006
your scene using animations.

00:23:56.746 --> 00:23:59.286
So, we support multiple type of

00:23:59.286 --> 00:24:00.566
animations, and you can use

00:24:00.566 --> 00:24:02.396
basic things like fade in-fade

00:24:02.396 --> 00:24:02.646
out.

00:24:03.556 --> 00:24:04.946
But you can also use more

00:24:04.946 --> 00:24:07.166
playful animations like scale up

00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:09.796
and then scale down.

00:24:12.856 --> 00:24:15.266
Reality Composer also supports

00:24:15.266 --> 00:24:18.396
animating objects in place with

00:24:18.396 --> 00:24:19.826
the emphasis similar to the show

00:24:19.826 --> 00:24:21.486
height, you can animate the

00:24:21.486 --> 00:24:22.916
object with different motion

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:24.256
types and animation styles.

00:24:25.066 --> 00:24:27.246
So, you can use BasicPop, but

00:24:27.736 --> 00:24:30.186
you can also use a more playful

00:24:30.486 --> 00:24:31.186
pop animation.

00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:35.016
You can also spin or orbit your

00:24:35.016 --> 00:24:38.246
object around other objects and

00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:39.866
if you're using a USD asset in

00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:41.476
your file, you can use their

00:24:41.476 --> 00:24:42.586
transform and skeletal

00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:43.056
animation.

00:24:43.686 --> 00:24:48.156
Now, with the move actions, you

00:24:48.156 --> 00:24:50.456
can translate, scale, and rotate

00:24:50.586 --> 00:24:51.516
an object in the same.

00:24:51.716 --> 00:24:53.986
With the Move By, the movement

00:24:53.986 --> 00:24:55.616
will be relative to where the

00:24:55.616 --> 00:24:56.306
object is right now.

00:24:56.306 --> 00:24:58.366
Like in this example, where the

00:24:58.366 --> 00:25:00.786
object always goes two units

00:25:00.786 --> 00:25:01.926
forward and one left.

00:25:02.316 --> 00:25:04.436
And with the Move To, you can

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:06.516
always move an object to a

00:25:06.516 --> 00:25:07.806
specified location in the scene.

00:25:08.546 --> 00:25:10.226
Like here, where the object is

00:25:10.226 --> 00:25:11.696
going back to the origin of the

00:25:11.696 --> 00:25:11.966
scene.

00:25:15.396 --> 00:25:17.006
With the Look At, you can make

00:25:17.006 --> 00:25:18.326
an object always face the

00:25:18.326 --> 00:25:18.706
camera.

00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:20.966
Like in this example, where the

00:25:20.966 --> 00:25:22.566
horse will always face the

00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:23.396
user's device.

00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:29.196
Now that we have all the

00:25:29.196 --> 00:25:31.466
animation actions, it's time to

00:25:31.466 --> 00:25:32.946
bring some sound to your

00:25:32.946 --> 00:25:33.516
experience.

00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:35.256
In Reality Composer, there's

00:25:35.396 --> 00:25:36.496
three actions that you can use

00:25:36.496 --> 00:25:37.716
to bring some audio to your

00:25:37.716 --> 00:25:38.466
scene.

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:40.986
With Play Sound, the audio will

00:25:40.986 --> 00:25:42.076
originate from the object

00:25:42.076 --> 00:25:42.426
itself.

00:25:42.926 --> 00:25:44.276
Like here, where the horse is

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:46.066
doing a horse sound.

00:25:46.966 --> 00:25:48.446
With Play Ambient, the sound

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:49.766
will be scene-oriented.

00:25:50.346 --> 00:25:53.746
And with Play Music, the audio

00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:54.746
will play without any

00:25:54.746 --> 00:25:55.476
transformations.

00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:58.986
So now let's take a quick demo,

00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:00.556
and let's take a quick look at

00:26:00.556 --> 00:26:02.346
how to bring some behaviors to

00:26:02.346 --> 00:26:04.176
the scene Michelle was building

00:26:04.176 --> 00:26:04.506
before.

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:07.346
Here we have a more complete

00:26:07.346 --> 00:26:10.046
scene compared to what Michelle

00:26:10.046 --> 00:26:10.496
was building.

00:26:10.496 --> 00:26:12.566
So, we have the Moon, the Earth,

00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:14.406
the Sun, and we have some text

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.526
and some sunrays showing the

00:26:16.526 --> 00:26:17.326
different seasons.

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:20.176
So, let's bring up the behavior

00:26:20.176 --> 00:26:21.646
final by clicking on the

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:22.986
behaviors button on the top

00:26:22.986 --> 00:26:23.496
right corner.

00:26:24.056 --> 00:26:27.006
And as you see here, there's

00:26:27.006 --> 00:26:28.366
already some behaviors.

00:26:28.746 --> 00:26:30.866
So let's hit play and see what

00:26:30.986 --> 00:26:32.826
is going on in this scene.

00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:36.466
So, you see here, there's no

00:26:36.466 --> 00:26:37.576
movement for the Moon, the

00:26:37.576 --> 00:26:38.286
Earth, or the Sun.

00:26:38.926 --> 00:26:40.356
But the different rays and

00:26:40.356 --> 00:26:42.446
seasons, text, are appearing in

00:26:42.446 --> 00:26:43.246
a sequential order.

00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:45.416
So, let's go ahead and create

00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:48.056
the new behavior for 20 minutes

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:49.516
the different Moon, Earth, and

00:26:49.516 --> 00:26:50.396
Sun objects.

00:26:50.866 --> 00:26:52.556
So for that, let's start by

00:26:52.556 --> 00:26:53.826
bringing a new behavior.

00:26:55.256 --> 00:26:56.546
We hit plus, and then here we

00:26:56.546 --> 00:26:58.126
can see all the available

00:26:58.276 --> 00:27:00.696
presets that we can pick from.

00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:02.456
But for this demo, we're going

00:27:02.456 --> 00:27:03.606
to start with a custom trigger.

00:27:03.606 --> 00:27:07.576
Now the first thing is to pick

00:27:07.576 --> 00:27:10.146
what trigger we want to use to

00:27:10.146 --> 00:27:11.556
begin the action sequence.

00:27:11.556 --> 00:27:12.646
And because we want to start

00:27:12.646 --> 00:27:14.376
animating these objects when the

00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:16.666
scene is loaded, we can bring up

00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:18.806
the library and choose the scene

00:27:18.896 --> 00:27:19.546
start.

00:27:20.836 --> 00:27:22.626
Great. Now it's time to start

00:27:22.626 --> 00:27:23.576
with the action sequence.

00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:26.296
For this action sequence, we

00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:28.286
want the Earth to orbit around

00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:29.876
the Sun, and then the Moon to

00:27:29.876 --> 00:27:30.986
orbit around the Earth.

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:32.356
And at the same time, we want to

00:27:32.356 --> 00:27:33.816
spin the Earth and the Sun.

00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:35.796
So let's start with the orbits.

00:27:37.596 --> 00:27:39.406
So we can bring the action

00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:41.696
library and then select orbit as

00:27:41.696 --> 00:27:42.506
the first action.

00:27:42.506 --> 00:27:44.286
The first thing when creating a

00:27:44.286 --> 00:27:45.936
new action is to define what

00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:48.476
targets are the targets of the

00:27:48.476 --> 00:27:48.836
action.

00:27:49.046 --> 00:27:50.316
So in this case, the affected

00:27:50.316 --> 00:27:52.346
object is going to be the Earth,

00:27:53.076 --> 00:27:54.696
and the center is going to be

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:55.366
the Sun.

00:27:56.856 --> 00:27:57.346
Great.

00:27:57.856 --> 00:27:59.186
We have all the properties like

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:01.426
duration, revolutions, align to

00:28:01.426 --> 00:28:03.146
path, and orbit direction.

00:28:03.566 --> 00:28:04.856
And for the direction, we want

00:28:04.856 --> 00:28:06.086
to use counter-clockwise.

00:28:07.776 --> 00:28:09.666
So, now, we can easily preview

00:28:09.666 --> 00:28:11.086
this action by just hitting play

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:13.656
on the play button in the action

00:28:13.656 --> 00:28:13.876
card.

00:28:15.136 --> 00:28:16.666
That was a bit fast.

00:28:16.936 --> 00:28:18.386
So, let's change the duration to

00:28:18.386 --> 00:28:21.436
something more suited for this

00:28:21.436 --> 00:28:21.756
scene.

00:28:22.136 --> 00:28:23.636
Let's start with 20 seconds.

00:28:24.216 --> 00:28:26.796
You can change duration and try

00:28:27.776 --> 00:28:28.126
again.

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:29.466
And yeah, I think that duration

00:28:29.646 --> 00:28:30.046
looks right.

00:28:30.776 --> 00:28:32.616
Now, let's bring the second

00:28:32.616 --> 00:28:32.876
orbit.

00:28:33.876 --> 00:28:36.706
So, we can bring again the

00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:38.416
library and select orbit.

00:28:39.496 --> 00:28:40.646
Now, the affected object is

00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:42.806
going to be the Moon and the

00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:45.446
center will be the Earth.

00:28:46.096 --> 00:28:47.896
The duration, we want it to be

00:28:47.896 --> 00:28:48.746
the same as before.

00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:51.316
And for the revolutions, because

00:28:51.316 --> 00:28:52.126
we are not trying to be

00:28:52.126 --> 00:28:53.326
physically accurate, we just

00:28:53.326 --> 00:28:54.426
want to have something that

00:28:54.426 --> 00:28:56.356
looks nice in the scene, we're

00:28:56.356 --> 00:28:58.146
going to use four.

00:28:58.296 --> 00:28:59.356
I think four is a good number.

00:28:59.716 --> 00:29:01.216
And now because the Moon is

00:29:01.276 --> 00:29:02.496
tidally locked with the Earth,

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:04.846
we want the Moon to be aligned

00:29:04.846 --> 00:29:05.346
to the orbit.

00:29:05.706 --> 00:29:07.666
So, we have to select align to

00:29:07.696 --> 00:29:07.986
path.

00:29:08.656 --> 00:29:10.306
And now the direction will be

00:29:10.306 --> 00:29:11.436
also counter clockwise.

00:29:12.276 --> 00:29:14.636
So, let's give that a try and

00:29:14.966 --> 00:29:16.586
yeah, this animation looks

00:29:17.036 --> 00:29:17.166
right.

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.756
So now that we have the orbits

00:29:19.756 --> 00:29:22.176
out of our way, let's begin with

00:29:22.176 --> 00:29:22.896
the spin actions.

00:29:23.746 --> 00:29:25.526
So for that, we bring another

00:29:25.526 --> 00:29:28.556
spin action and let's start with

00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:29.006
the Sun.

00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:31.386
Same direction as before.

00:29:31.496 --> 00:29:32.666
So, 20 seconds.

00:29:33.116 --> 00:29:34.826
And for iterations, I think four

00:29:34.826 --> 00:29:35.986
will be a good number.

00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:40.016
And same direction, so counter

00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:40.406
clockwise.

00:29:41.286 --> 00:29:43.776
If we hit play, we see that

00:29:43.776 --> 00:29:45.126
that's a good speed for the

00:29:45.126 --> 00:29:45.456
spin.

00:29:46.366 --> 00:29:48.686
Right. So, now, let's bring the

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:51.116
last action in the sequence

00:29:51.116 --> 00:29:52.376
which is the spin for the Earth.

00:29:53.676 --> 00:29:55.286
So, we create another spin.

00:29:55.656 --> 00:29:56.546
We select the Earth.

00:29:57.356 --> 00:29:58.296
Same duration.

00:29:59.706 --> 00:30:01.026
And because we want to have a

00:30:01.026 --> 00:30:02.526
higher number of iterations

00:30:02.526 --> 00:30:04.956
compared to the Sun, let's use

00:30:05.576 --> 00:30:07.206
10 for this example.

00:30:07.936 --> 00:30:09.356
And direction, again, counter

00:30:09.356 --> 00:30:09.726
clockwise.

00:30:10.786 --> 00:30:12.776
Let's give that a try and yeah,

00:30:12.776 --> 00:30:13.316
that looks right.

00:30:13.986 --> 00:30:16.306
So now our action sequence is

00:30:16.306 --> 00:30:17.246
completely laid out.

00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:19.736
So, let's try to play the whole

00:30:19.736 --> 00:30:20.366
action sequence.

00:30:20.546 --> 00:30:21.636
And we can do that by just

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:23.836
pressing play on the play button

00:30:23.836 --> 00:30:25.286
in the Action Sequence header.

00:30:26.816 --> 00:30:28.646
And what we see here is that

00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:29.816
only the Earth is moving.

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:31.156
And that's because the action

00:30:31.156 --> 00:30:32.796
sequence is playing all the

00:30:32.796 --> 00:30:34.176
actions sequentially, one after

00:30:34.176 --> 00:30:34.606
the other.

00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:36.546
What we want to do here though

00:30:36.546 --> 00:30:39.006
is to make all these actions

00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:39.816
running parallel.

00:30:40.056 --> 00:30:41.636
And for that we can use drag and

00:30:41.636 --> 00:30:43.126
drop and drag the different

00:30:43.126 --> 00:30:44.336
cards on top of each other.

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:47.446
And just by doing that, we

00:30:47.556 --> 00:30:49.076
create a group with the four

00:30:49.076 --> 00:30:49.496
actions.

00:30:50.296 --> 00:30:52.456
And now let's just go ahead and

00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:52.606
try [applause].

00:30:52.826 --> 00:30:54.976
Thanks.

00:30:55.266 --> 00:30:57.266
[ Applause ]

00:30:57.516 --> 00:30:58.726
So, now, let's go ahead and hit

00:30:58.776 --> 00:31:01.336
play and see how all the

00:31:01.336 --> 00:31:02.306
behaviors play together.

00:31:02.466 --> 00:31:04.496
And what we can see here is that

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:06.146
now all the orbit and spin

00:31:06.146 --> 00:31:07.606
actions play together at the

00:31:07.606 --> 00:31:09.106
same time as the text, and the

00:31:09.106 --> 00:31:11.546
rays appear in the scene when

00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:15.476
the Earth is passing by.

00:31:16.516 --> 00:31:19.706
[ Applause ]

00:31:20.206 --> 00:31:22.156
Okay. Let's go back to the

00:31:22.156 --> 00:31:22.223
[inaudible].

00:31:22.223 --> 00:31:24.786
So, that's how it easy it is to

00:31:24.906 --> 00:31:26.566
bring some interactions and

00:31:26.566 --> 00:31:28.186
behaviors to your scenes in

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:28.916
Reality Composer.

00:31:29.676 --> 00:31:31.626
Now, let's move onto physics.

00:31:31.726 --> 00:31:34.536
And so in order to create

00:31:34.536 --> 00:31:36.056
amazing and immersive AR

00:31:36.056 --> 00:31:37.856
experiences, you need your

00:31:37.856 --> 00:31:39.816
objects to feed right into the

00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:40.436
real world.

00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:42.216
You need your objects to move

00:31:42.216 --> 00:31:43.026
like real objects.

00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:45.016
And for that, we need to take

00:31:45.016 --> 00:31:46.636
advantage o this powerful

00:31:46.706 --> 00:31:48.316
physics engine available to you

00:31:48.316 --> 00:31:49.226
in Reality Composer.

00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:51.986
So, let's take a look at it.

00:31:52.536 --> 00:31:54.276
This is an example of a scene

00:31:54.366 --> 00:31:55.306
that you can build in Reality

00:31:55.306 --> 00:31:56.636
Composer using physics.

00:31:57.346 --> 00:31:57.946
I use it here.

00:31:58.286 --> 00:31:59.686
The sphere is falling because of

00:31:59.686 --> 00:32:01.226
gravity, then it's colliding

00:32:01.226 --> 00:32:01.766
with the pins.

00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:04.606
And right at the end, once it

00:32:04.606 --> 00:32:05.896
bounces with the green box,

00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:08.436
it's, we show this, like, winner

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:08.806
text.

00:32:09.546 --> 00:32:11.326
So, let's see how we can build

00:32:11.326 --> 00:32:11.976
this kind of scene.

00:32:12.556 --> 00:32:14.896
There's three different ways

00:32:14.896 --> 00:32:16.006
that you can influence the

00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:17.586
physics simulation in your

00:32:17.586 --> 00:32:17.916
scene.

00:32:19.186 --> 00:32:20.736
A variety of materials will

00:32:20.736 --> 00:32:22.306
define how your objects interact

00:32:22.306 --> 00:32:23.536
with the scene and with other

00:32:23.536 --> 00:32:24.026
objects.

00:32:25.336 --> 00:32:26.376
With the force action and the

00:32:26.376 --> 00:32:28.866
gravity, you can determine how

00:32:28.866 --> 00:32:30.176
the forces will play into your

00:32:30.176 --> 00:32:30.466
world.

00:32:30.526 --> 00:32:32.856
And with the collision trigger

00:32:33.346 --> 00:32:34.826
and the collision shapes, you

00:32:34.826 --> 00:32:36.196
can define how the collision

00:32:36.196 --> 00:32:37.986
mechanics will work in your

00:32:37.986 --> 00:32:38.806
physics simulation.

00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:41.476
So, let's start with materials.

00:32:41.476 --> 00:32:44.036
In Reality Composer, there's six

00:32:44.036 --> 00:32:45.186
different materials that you can

00:32:45.186 --> 00:32:45.496
use.

00:32:46.596 --> 00:32:48.216
You have to define the materials

00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:49.496
for the scene and for the

00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:50.026
objects.

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:52.756
So, let's say you use material

00:32:52.856 --> 00:32:53.456
for your object.

00:32:53.656 --> 00:32:55.326
Use ice as the material of your

00:32:55.326 --> 00:32:55.536
object.

00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:57.446
This will make your object slide

00:32:57.446 --> 00:32:58.036
through the scene.

00:32:58.626 --> 00:33:00.956
If you use rubber instead, your

00:33:00.956 --> 00:33:03.356
object will be much more bouncy.

00:33:03.896 --> 00:33:08.746
Now, let's move onto forces.

00:33:10.206 --> 00:33:11.716
All your scene will have gravity

00:33:11.716 --> 00:33:14.346
enabled by default and the value

00:33:14.346 --> 00:33:15.356
will be set to the Earth's

00:33:15.356 --> 00:33:15.736
gravity.

00:33:16.006 --> 00:33:17.346
But you can change that to any

00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:17.966
value you want.

00:33:18.526 --> 00:33:22.066
With the force action, you can

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.186
give your object an initial

00:33:23.186 --> 00:33:23.676
impulse.

00:33:24.256 --> 00:33:26.276
You define a direction, how much

00:33:26.356 --> 00:33:27.716
velocity you want to give to the

00:33:27.716 --> 00:33:27.966
object.

00:33:28.326 --> 00:33:29.406
And you can build these kinds of

00:33:29.406 --> 00:33:30.896
behaviors where you can add the

00:33:30.896 --> 00:33:32.966
force once the user taps on the

00:33:33.426 --> 00:33:33.686
object.

00:33:35.676 --> 00:33:37.426
And now that your objects have

00:33:37.426 --> 00:33:39.426
materials and can be affected by

00:33:39.496 --> 00:33:42.106
forces, it's time to make them

00:33:42.106 --> 00:33:42.886
collide with each other.

00:33:43.526 --> 00:33:45.516
So, by default, in Reality

00:33:45.516 --> 00:33:47.746
Composer, all the objects don't

00:33:47.746 --> 00:33:49.066
participate in the physics

00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:49.556
simulation.

00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:51.426
If you want your objects to

00:33:51.426 --> 00:33:52.986
collide with other objects, you

00:33:52.986 --> 00:33:55.206
have to set the collide option.

00:33:55.656 --> 00:33:57.886
If you want your objects to be

00:33:57.886 --> 00:33:59.516
moved by the physics simulation,

00:33:59.836 --> 00:34:01.586
you need to set the simulate

00:34:01.586 --> 00:34:01.936
option.

00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:04.496
So, here you can see how default

00:34:04.826 --> 00:34:06.596
collides and simulate options

00:34:06.746 --> 00:34:08.786
affect the objects in the scene.

00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:15.275
[ Applause ]

00:34:15.775 --> 00:34:17.235
So, the collision mechanics are

00:34:17.266 --> 00:34:18.886
determined by the shapes of the

00:34:18.886 --> 00:34:19.636
object in a scene.

00:34:20.366 --> 00:34:21.516
In Reality Composer, there's

00:34:21.716 --> 00:34:23.166
three different shapes that you

00:34:23.166 --> 00:34:23.556
can use.

00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:25.956
And those are box, sphere, and

00:34:25.956 --> 00:34:26.335
capsule.

00:34:27.476 --> 00:34:28.936
Those shapes will determine how

00:34:28.936 --> 00:34:30.815
your object moves in the scene

00:34:30.815 --> 00:34:32.346
and how it collides with other

00:34:32.346 --> 00:34:34.916
objects and the anchor.

00:34:37.295 --> 00:34:39.116
And with the collide trigger,

00:34:39.356 --> 00:34:40.266
you can build these kinds of

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:42.606
behaviors where here we have a

00:34:42.656 --> 00:34:44.666
collide trigger with the sphere

00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:45.335
and the box.

00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:47.386
And that way we can detect when

00:34:47.386 --> 00:34:49.096
the user is winning this game

00:34:49.326 --> 00:34:50.565
and show the winner text.

00:34:54.716 --> 00:34:56.456
And that's pretty much all we

00:34:56.456 --> 00:34:57.666
have to say about physics in

00:34:57.666 --> 00:34:58.396
Reality Composer.

00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:00.696
So now I would like to hand it

00:35:00.696 --> 00:35:02.276
over to my colleague, Abhi, to

00:35:02.276 --> 00:35:03.676
talk you through how to build

00:35:03.676 --> 00:35:04.956
apps using Reality Composer.

00:35:05.096 --> 00:35:06.976
Abhi?

00:35:07.516 --> 00:35:10.766
[ Applause ]

00:35:11.266 --> 00:35:11.946
>> Hi everyone.

00:35:11.946 --> 00:35:12.586
My name is Abhi.

00:35:12.586 --> 00:35:13.816
I'm super excited to be here

00:35:13.816 --> 00:35:14.236
today.

00:35:14.236 --> 00:35:15.406
So, earlier in the session, we

00:35:15.406 --> 00:35:17.296
saw how with Reality Composer we

00:35:17.296 --> 00:35:18.736
can create amazing 3D

00:35:18.736 --> 00:35:20.426
experiences and then bring it to

00:35:20.426 --> 00:35:21.636
life with behaviors.

00:35:22.036 --> 00:35:23.096
Now, let's see how we can take

00:35:23.096 --> 00:35:24.746
those AR experiences and

00:35:24.866 --> 00:35:27.616
integrate them into our app.

00:35:27.616 --> 00:35:28.956
So to get started, we provide

00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:29.586
three different ways.

00:35:30.346 --> 00:35:32.056
The first is create a new

00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:34.386
RealityKit AR or Game template

00:35:34.386 --> 00:35:35.036
right in Xcode.

00:35:36.106 --> 00:35:37.516
Then second is to create a new

00:35:37.516 --> 00:35:39.166
project from Reality Composer.

00:35:39.796 --> 00:35:41.076
And the third is to export a

00:35:41.076 --> 00:35:42.926
Reality file from Reality

00:35:42.926 --> 00:35:44.356
Composer and then include it

00:35:44.356 --> 00:35:45.586
inside your app.

00:35:46.596 --> 00:35:47.936
To get started, let's start

00:35:47.936 --> 00:35:49.416
about the two essential files,

00:35:49.506 --> 00:35:51.346
the Reality Composer project and

00:35:51.346 --> 00:35:52.096
the Reality file.

00:35:52.096 --> 00:35:53.806
And we'll get started by talking

00:35:53.806 --> 00:35:54.736
about the Reality Composer

00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:55.156
project.

00:35:55.686 --> 00:35:58.296
So, this is the project file for

00:35:58.296 --> 00:35:59.056
Reality Composer.

00:35:59.726 --> 00:36:01.036
It's included automatically

00:36:01.316 --> 00:36:03.606
inside of RealityKit AR and Game

00:36:03.606 --> 00:36:04.156
templates.

00:36:04.776 --> 00:36:06.506
It's previewable right inside of

00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:07.586
Xcode; we have Xcode

00:36:07.586 --> 00:36:08.186
integration.

00:36:08.846 --> 00:36:10.656
And Xcode automatically exports

00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:12.486
your Reality Composer project as

00:36:12.486 --> 00:36:14.026
a Reality file during the build

00:36:14.376 --> 00:36:16.426
step of Xcode.

00:36:16.576 --> 00:36:18.026
So, here we can see our Reality

00:36:18.026 --> 00:36:18.886
Composer project.

00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:20.596
In Xcode 11, we're able to

00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:21.906
preview it and we're able to

00:36:21.906 --> 00:36:23.176
preview each of our scenes as

00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:23.476
well.

00:36:23.476 --> 00:36:25.266
And in the upper right-hand

00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:26.356
corner, we can see an Open in

00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:27.816
Reality Composer button, and

00:36:27.816 --> 00:36:28.636
this will launch Reality

00:36:28.636 --> 00:36:30.236
Composer right from Xcode.

00:36:30.236 --> 00:36:33.736
As I mentioned earlier, if you

00:36:33.736 --> 00:36:35.326
have a Reality Composer project

00:36:35.396 --> 00:36:37.216
in your Xcode application during

00:36:37.216 --> 00:36:38.966
the build step, we automatically

00:36:38.966 --> 00:36:40.776
generate a Reality file for you.

00:36:40.776 --> 00:36:42.456
And it's included inside of your

00:36:42.456 --> 00:36:44.066
application, just like any other

00:36:44.066 --> 00:36:44.526
resource.

00:36:44.526 --> 00:36:46.046
You can access it exactly the

00:36:46.046 --> 00:36:46.516
same way.

00:36:47.246 --> 00:36:48.556
So, what is a Reality file?

00:36:48.946 --> 00:36:50.906
This is a central object for how

00:36:50.906 --> 00:36:52.746
you will use your application

00:36:52.746 --> 00:36:53.576
and work with your AR

00:36:53.576 --> 00:36:54.046
experience.

00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:55.656
It contains all the data

00:36:55.656 --> 00:36:57.796
required for rendering and

00:36:57.796 --> 00:36:59.586
simulation, and it's optimized

00:36:59.586 --> 00:37:00.326
for RealityKit.

00:37:01.166 --> 00:37:01.986
Like I said earlier, it's

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:03.646
exported from Reality Composer

00:37:04.086 --> 00:37:05.556
or it's automatically exported

00:37:05.626 --> 00:37:07.286
by Xcode during the build step

00:37:07.286 --> 00:37:07.936
of your project.

00:37:08.346 --> 00:37:10.946
You can use a Reality file

00:37:11.086 --> 00:37:12.236
either by referencing it

00:37:12.236 --> 00:37:14.316
directly in your application or

00:37:14.316 --> 00:37:15.636
previewing it in AR Quick Look,

00:37:15.636 --> 00:37:17.406
and we encourage you guys to go

00:37:17.406 --> 00:37:18.536
check out the Advances in AR

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.486
Quick Look session tomorrow to

00:37:20.546 --> 00:37:21.926
learn more about that.

00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:24.726
Diving a little bit deeper, what

00:37:24.726 --> 00:37:25.886
is a Reality file?

00:37:26.386 --> 00:37:27.526
So because this is a file

00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:29.016
exported from Reality Composer,

00:37:29.626 --> 00:37:30.956
it'll contain each of the scenes

00:37:30.956 --> 00:37:32.476
that you've created in Reality

00:37:32.476 --> 00:37:33.146
Composer.

00:37:33.146 --> 00:37:34.196
For example, we have two scenes

00:37:34.196 --> 00:37:36.646
here, and it also contains every

00:37:36.646 --> 00:37:38.376
object that you've created in

00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:39.076
the application.

00:37:39.076 --> 00:37:41.656
When we think about a scene in a

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:43.186
Reality file, we consider a

00:37:43.186 --> 00:37:44.966
scene an anchor, an anchor

00:37:44.966 --> 00:37:46.066
entity, specifically.

00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:47.796
So, this contains for example

00:37:47.796 --> 00:37:48.746
the horizontal anchor

00:37:48.746 --> 00:37:50.436
information that you set up in

00:37:50.436 --> 00:37:51.186
Reality Composer.

00:37:55.916 --> 00:37:57.396
So, we thought one of the

00:37:57.396 --> 00:37:59.396
biggest difficulties in working

00:37:59.396 --> 00:38:01.806
with Reality files was being

00:38:01.806 --> 00:38:02.916
able to access things with

00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:03.486
strings.

00:38:03.486 --> 00:38:05.426
And we both have the Reality

00:38:05.426 --> 00:38:07.316
Composer project and Xcode.

00:38:07.726 --> 00:38:09.326
So, we wanted to introduce a way

00:38:09.326 --> 00:38:11.016
to make this very easy to work

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:12.296
with, almost like just an

00:38:12.296 --> 00:38:12.716
object.

00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.326
And so we decided to do that

00:38:14.326 --> 00:38:15.916
with code generation in Xcode.

00:38:16.756 --> 00:38:18.266
What code generation will do is

00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:19.646
analyze the structure of your

00:38:19.646 --> 00:38:21.726
Reality Composer project and

00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:22.966
generate an object, a real

00:38:22.966 --> 00:38:24.286
object that you can use inside

00:38:24.286 --> 00:38:24.996
of your application.

00:38:25.346 --> 00:38:26.966
So for example here, we have our

00:38:26.966 --> 00:38:28.796
Solar System Reality Composer

00:38:28.796 --> 00:38:30.596
project, and we automatically

00:38:30.596 --> 00:38:32.316
generate a Solar System object

00:38:32.316 --> 00:38:34.466
that you can use in your app.

00:38:39.976 --> 00:38:41.516
So, the code generated for you

00:38:41.516 --> 00:38:43.416
is an application-specific API

00:38:44.456 --> 00:38:46.206
for your scenes, for your named

00:38:46.206 --> 00:38:47.636
entities that Michelle mentioned

00:38:47.636 --> 00:38:50.796
earlier, for notify actions, and

00:38:50.796 --> 00:38:51.826
for notification triggers.

00:38:51.956 --> 00:38:52.976
And we'll get to the second,

00:38:52.976 --> 00:38:54.956
those last two items later in

00:38:55.856 --> 00:38:57.066
the session.

00:38:57.226 --> 00:38:58.396
The first step to get started

00:38:58.396 --> 00:38:59.696
with code generation and working

00:38:59.696 --> 00:39:01.286
with your AR experience is to

00:39:01.286 --> 00:39:02.566
give names to everything you

00:39:02.566 --> 00:39:04.266
care about and one axis in code

00:39:04.626 --> 00:39:05.756
right in Reality Composer.

00:39:06.086 --> 00:39:07.126
And you can do that here in the

00:39:07.196 --> 00:39:08.936
Settings pane under Configure.

00:39:08.936 --> 00:39:10.296
So for example here we've given

00:39:10.296 --> 00:39:13.036
the Sun, our Sun USDZ that we

00:39:13.036 --> 00:39:14.676
imported, the name Sun.

00:39:14.756 --> 00:39:16.236
And we'll use this name to

00:39:16.236 --> 00:39:17.086
access it in code.

00:39:17.726 --> 00:39:20.086
So, how does our Reality

00:39:20.086 --> 00:39:21.656
Composer project get converted

00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:24.126
into an object that we can use?

00:39:24.756 --> 00:39:26.396
At the top level, our Reality

00:39:26.396 --> 00:39:28.516
Composer project becomes, for

00:39:28.516 --> 00:39:30.166
example, solarsystem.swift.

00:39:30.926 --> 00:39:33.146
Our scene becomes an entity that

00:39:33.146 --> 00:39:33.806
has anchoring.

00:39:33.806 --> 00:39:35.046
And this is really important,

00:39:35.046 --> 00:39:35.996
because it means when you load

00:39:35.996 --> 00:39:37.166
it, you can add it right into

00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.426
your scene's anchors.

00:39:39.426 --> 00:39:40.986
Additionally, any objects you

00:39:40.986 --> 00:39:42.416
set up get converted into

00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:42.826
entities.

00:39:43.036 --> 00:39:44.296
These are real RealityKit

00:39:44.296 --> 00:39:45.306
entities that you can use.

00:39:45.306 --> 00:39:46.366
You can work with exactly the

00:39:46.366 --> 00:39:46.896
same way.

00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:50.216
In addition, we also provide two

00:39:50.216 --> 00:39:51.186
different ways to load your

00:39:51.186 --> 00:39:51.756
scene.

00:39:51.946 --> 00:39:53.716
One that is synchronous and one

00:39:53.716 --> 00:39:54.676
that is asynchronous.

00:39:55.246 --> 00:39:58.626
So, taking a look at loading a

00:39:58.626 --> 00:40:00.876
Reality file synchronously, here

00:40:00.876 --> 00:40:02.826
we have our solar system as our

00:40:02.826 --> 00:40:04.336
example again and we'd like to

00:40:04.336 --> 00:40:05.566
load the seasonsChapter.

00:40:05.566 --> 00:40:07.556
And we can do that with a single

00:40:07.556 --> 00:40:07.896
line of code.

00:40:07.896 --> 00:40:10.826
So, we can say solarsystem.load

00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:11.536
seasons chapter.

00:40:11.636 --> 00:40:13.046
And we'll get returned an anchor

00:40:13.046 --> 00:40:14.196
that we can then add into our

00:40:14.196 --> 00:40:14.586
view.

00:40:14.686 --> 00:40:15.536
It's super simple.

00:40:17.296 --> 00:40:19.316
Next, if we want to load our

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:20.806
seasonschapter asynchronously or

00:40:20.806 --> 00:40:22.746
any scene, we can use for

00:40:22.746 --> 00:40:24.896
example the solarsystem.load

00:40:24.896 --> 00:40:26.736
seasons chapter async, and we'll

00:40:26.736 --> 00:40:27.726
get a result object.

00:40:27.836 --> 00:40:29.206
And we can handle the success

00:40:29.206 --> 00:40:29.476
case.

00:40:29.956 --> 00:40:30.696
We'll get the anchor.

00:40:30.696 --> 00:40:32.716
Or we can handle the failure

00:40:32.716 --> 00:40:34.166
case, and display the error to

00:40:34.166 --> 00:40:34.556
the user.

00:40:35.116 --> 00:40:37.566
In addition, if we want to

00:40:37.566 --> 00:40:38.876
access the named entities in our

00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:41.056
scene, we can do so as easily as

00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:44.036
calling for example seasons.sun,

00:40:44.036 --> 00:40:45.136
.earth, and .moon.

00:40:45.436 --> 00:40:46.576
And this will give us access to

00:40:46.576 --> 00:40:47.846
the entity that we named in

00:40:47.846 --> 00:40:48.596
Reality Composer.

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:49.996
It's just like working with any

00:40:49.996 --> 00:40:50.556
other object.

00:40:51.796 --> 00:40:53.466
So, putting it all together with

00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:55.236
code generation in Xcode and

00:40:55.236 --> 00:40:57.286
Reality Composer, we can load

00:40:57.286 --> 00:40:58.356
our AR experience in our

00:40:58.356 --> 00:41:00.146
application with just two lines

00:41:00.146 --> 00:41:00.506
of code.

00:41:01.396 --> 00:41:03.186
The first is loading our chapter

00:41:03.286 --> 00:41:05.046
or loading our scene, and the

00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:06.916
second is adding it right into

00:41:06.916 --> 00:41:07.426
our view.

00:41:07.586 --> 00:41:09.886
It's super easy.

00:41:10.516 --> 00:41:15.416
[ Applause ]

00:41:15.916 --> 00:41:17.886
So, that's code generation in

00:41:17.886 --> 00:41:18.356
Xcode.

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:20.196
We also provide a way to access

00:41:20.196 --> 00:41:21.046
your Reality file.

00:41:21.046 --> 00:41:22.356
For example, in cases where

00:41:22.356 --> 00:41:23.736
you're downloading content off

00:41:23.736 --> 00:41:24.966
of a server and you want to

00:41:24.966 --> 00:41:25.746
display that in your

00:41:25.746 --> 00:41:28.036
application, to do that, we have

00:41:28.136 --> 00:41:29.256
RealityKit API.

00:41:29.896 --> 00:41:31.286
So, to load a Reality file

00:41:31.286 --> 00:41:33.136
synchronously, you first need to

00:41:33.136 --> 00:41:34.906
get the URL just like any other

00:41:34.906 --> 00:41:35.946
resource in your application

00:41:35.946 --> 00:41:36.206
bundle.

00:41:36.206 --> 00:41:40.706
And next, using the entity.load

00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:42.586
anchor method, passing the URL

00:41:42.586 --> 00:41:44.146
of the resource, and the name of

00:41:44.146 --> 00:41:45.016
the scene that you'd like to

00:41:45.016 --> 00:41:46.626
load, and this will give you

00:41:46.626 --> 00:41:47.926
back an anchor that you can use.

00:41:48.306 --> 00:41:49.716
Optionally, you can also use

00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:51.506
entity.load which will load the

00:41:51.506 --> 00:41:53.216
entity tree without the anchor

00:41:53.216 --> 00:41:53.716
information.

00:41:54.916 --> 00:41:56.496
To load your Reality file

00:41:56.496 --> 00:41:57.806
asynchronously, there's also a

00:41:57.806 --> 00:41:58.986
way to do that.

00:41:58.986 --> 00:41:59.966
So the first step is exactly the

00:41:59.966 --> 00:42:00.286
same.

00:42:00.656 --> 00:42:02.806
Just get the URL resource of the

00:42:02.806 --> 00:42:03.166
resource.

00:42:04.256 --> 00:42:06.276
Use entity.load anchor async,

00:42:06.436 --> 00:42:07.976
passing in the URL and the name

00:42:07.976 --> 00:42:08.766
of the scene that you'd like to

00:42:08.766 --> 00:42:09.126
load.

00:42:09.606 --> 00:42:10.556
This will give you a load

00:42:10.556 --> 00:42:11.076
request.

00:42:11.076 --> 00:42:12.886
And using the new combined

00:42:12.886 --> 00:42:14.726
framework, we can receive a

00:42:14.726 --> 00:42:16.396
completion and then receive the

00:42:16.396 --> 00:42:17.856
value, and the value contains

00:42:17.856 --> 00:42:18.916
the anchor that we'd like to

00:42:18.916 --> 00:42:19.086
load.

00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:20.366
So, you can put this right into

00:42:20.366 --> 00:42:21.126
your AR view scene.

00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:23.866
Accessing entities.

00:42:23.866 --> 00:42:25.026
You can do this through

00:42:25.026 --> 00:42:27.686
anchor.find entity, and then

00:42:27.686 --> 00:42:29.006
passing the name of the object

00:42:29.006 --> 00:42:29.916
that you'd like to load.

00:42:29.916 --> 00:42:31.906
For example, Sun, Earth, and

00:42:31.906 --> 00:42:32.236
Moon.

00:42:33.006 --> 00:42:34.546
So, that's how easy it is with

00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:35.806
code generation in Xcode with

00:42:35.806 --> 00:42:37.686
the RealityKit to bring your AR

00:42:37.686 --> 00:42:38.686
experiences into your

00:42:38.686 --> 00:42:39.076
application.

00:42:39.626 --> 00:42:42.806
So, next, let's talk about how

00:42:42.806 --> 00:42:44.626
our application can interact

00:42:44.846 --> 00:42:45.786
with our AR content.

00:42:46.086 --> 00:42:47.046
We can create amazing

00:42:47.046 --> 00:42:48.646
experiences right inside of

00:42:48.646 --> 00:42:50.016
Reality Composer, but how do we

00:42:50.016 --> 00:42:50.906
actually work with it?

00:42:51.206 --> 00:42:52.936
So, as Pau mentioned earlier, we

00:42:52.936 --> 00:42:54.446
have a great built-in set of

00:42:54.446 --> 00:42:56.076
actions already for you, but

00:42:56.076 --> 00:42:56.976
there might be actions that you

00:42:56.976 --> 00:42:58.126
want to define yourself.

00:42:58.666 --> 00:43:00.336
So to do that, we've created the

00:43:00.336 --> 00:43:01.226
notify action.

00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.506
This is an action that you set

00:43:03.506 --> 00:43:04.516
up in Reality Composer.

00:43:05.156 --> 00:43:08.536
It's called alongside your other

00:43:08.536 --> 00:43:10.476
action sequences, exactly in the

00:43:10.476 --> 00:43:11.056
same order.

00:43:11.056 --> 00:43:12.296
For example, if it's sequenced,

00:43:12.566 --> 00:43:13.486
it'll be called in that

00:43:13.536 --> 00:43:13.966
sequence.

00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:16.566
There's a settable closure in

00:43:16.566 --> 00:43:17.746
your application code, so you

00:43:17.746 --> 00:43:19.696
can define the implementation of

00:43:19.696 --> 00:43:20.186
this action.

00:43:21.546 --> 00:43:22.716
And just like accessing an

00:43:22.716 --> 00:43:24.026
entity through code generation,

00:43:24.516 --> 00:43:26.096
the Notify action is also

00:43:26.096 --> 00:43:29.066
accessible through your object.

00:43:29.856 --> 00:43:31.786
So, in Reality Composer, we can

00:43:31.786 --> 00:43:33.296
set up a notify action here and

00:43:33.656 --> 00:43:36.016
we can give it an identifier.

00:43:36.016 --> 00:43:37.566
This is the identifier we'll use

00:43:37.636 --> 00:43:39.356
in code to reference our notify

00:43:39.356 --> 00:43:40.836
action and provide a custom

00:43:40.836 --> 00:43:41.436
implementation.

00:43:41.996 --> 00:43:45.496
In the structure of our

00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:48.226
generated object, the actions

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:49.536
lives alongside your energies

00:43:49.696 --> 00:43:50.986
inside of the scene object.

00:43:51.746 --> 00:43:53.106
So here we have actions and a

00:43:53.106 --> 00:43:54.236
property actions.

00:43:55.406 --> 00:43:56.796
Inside of the actions class,

00:43:57.126 --> 00:43:58.216
you'll see multiple notify

00:43:58.216 --> 00:43:59.906
actions that have the name of

00:43:59.906 --> 00:44:01.106
the identifier you've given your

00:44:01.106 --> 00:44:01.696
notify action.

00:44:02.086 --> 00:44:03.486
So you can access these as

00:44:03.486 --> 00:44:04.866
simply as the loaded

00:44:04.866 --> 00:44:07.186
anchor.actions and then the name

00:44:07.186 --> 00:44:07.916
of the action that you care

00:44:07.916 --> 00:44:08.146
about.

00:44:08.566 --> 00:44:09.946
In addition, we also generate an

00:44:09.946 --> 00:44:11.676
all actions array, so you can do

00:44:11.676 --> 00:44:12.616
great things with this, just

00:44:12.616 --> 00:44:13.506
like any other collection in

00:44:13.506 --> 00:44:13.856
Swift.

00:44:14.126 --> 00:44:15.086
You can filter over it, you can

00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:15.746
iterate over it.

00:44:15.746 --> 00:44:16.956
Anything you can do with an

00:44:16.956 --> 00:44:18.506
array in Swift, you can do with

00:44:18.506 --> 00:44:19.436
this all actions property.

00:44:20.106 --> 00:44:22.306
To actually set the

00:44:22.306 --> 00:44:23.626
implementation of a notify

00:44:23.626 --> 00:44:25.846
action, you first need to access

00:44:25.846 --> 00:44:26.956
it through your Alert anchor.

00:44:27.356 --> 00:44:28.286
So, for example here,

00:44:28.646 --> 00:44:31.716
seasonschapter.actions .display

00:44:31.716 --> 00:44:33.826
Earth details, and then provide

00:44:33.826 --> 00:44:34.586
the custom closer.

00:44:34.796 --> 00:44:35.866
So .onaction.

00:44:36.396 --> 00:44:37.526
And the entity that you'll get

00:44:37.526 --> 00:44:38.866
returned inside of this closure

00:44:39.226 --> 00:44:40.706
is the target entity you set up

00:44:40.706 --> 00:44:41.546
in Reality Composer.

00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:45.826
On the other side, to actually

00:44:45.826 --> 00:44:47.736
kick off action sequences and

00:44:47.736 --> 00:44:48.676
provide a way to do this as

00:44:48.676 --> 00:44:50.406
well, we have a couple of great

00:44:50.406 --> 00:44:52.166
built-in triggers such as Scene

00:44:52.166 --> 00:44:53.346
Start and Proximity.

00:44:53.656 --> 00:44:54.846
But there might be times you

00:44:54.846 --> 00:44:56.636
want to provide custom triggers.

00:44:56.636 --> 00:44:58.156
For example, selecting a segment

00:44:58.156 --> 00:44:59.486
of control or tapping on a

00:44:59.486 --> 00:44:59.726
button.

00:44:59.996 --> 00:45:01.436
And for that, we're providing

00:45:01.676 --> 00:45:02.726
the Notification Trigger.

00:45:03.846 --> 00:45:05.286
So Notification Trigger is set

00:45:05.286 --> 00:45:06.456
up in Reality Composer.

00:45:07.336 --> 00:45:09.016
It starts an action sequence or

00:45:09.016 --> 00:45:10.396
multiple sequences that have the

00:45:10.396 --> 00:45:11.216
same identifier.

00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:13.896
It's posted from the runtime of

00:45:13.896 --> 00:45:14.546
your application.

00:45:15.256 --> 00:45:16.606
And it's accessible just like a

00:45:16.606 --> 00:45:18.246
Notify Action and acts as your

00:45:18.246 --> 00:45:20.366
entities just by name in your

00:45:20.366 --> 00:45:20.636
code.

00:45:20.636 --> 00:45:23.416
You can set up a notification

00:45:23.416 --> 00:45:24.806
trigger right inside of your

00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:26.816
behavior and here we have given

00:45:26.816 --> 00:45:28.536
it the identifier show gold

00:45:28.536 --> 00:45:28.846
star.

00:45:29.256 --> 00:45:30.466
And we'll use this name in code.

00:45:30.466 --> 00:45:33.916
Just like actions, it lives

00:45:33.916 --> 00:45:35.536
right alongside your entities in

00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:38.846
the generated code inside of a

00:45:38.846 --> 00:45:41.516
new notifications object class.

00:45:42.976 --> 00:45:44.266
And inside of Notifications,

00:45:44.266 --> 00:45:45.546
just like Notify Actions, you'll

00:45:45.546 --> 00:45:46.886
have Notification Triggers

00:45:47.246 --> 00:45:48.506
corresponding to the names, the

00:45:48.506 --> 00:45:49.806
identifiers that you've given to

00:45:49.806 --> 00:45:51.476
those Notification Triggers in

00:45:51.476 --> 00:45:52.276
Reality Composer.

00:45:52.626 --> 00:45:53.856
And just like Notify Actions,

00:45:54.076 --> 00:45:54.986
you have an array that you can

00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:56.396
filter over it or iterate over

00:45:56.396 --> 00:45:56.696
as well.

00:45:57.746 --> 00:45:59.196
That's called all notifications.

00:45:59.726 --> 00:46:02.536
You can post a Notification

00:46:02.536 --> 00:46:04.946
Trigger by calling the post

00:46:04.946 --> 00:46:06.246
method, and this will fire an

00:46:06.286 --> 00:46:07.696
action sequence or sequences

00:46:07.696 --> 00:46:08.436
with the same name.

00:46:09.296 --> 00:46:10.556
And you can also pass in an

00:46:10.556 --> 00:46:11.566
optional override set.

00:46:12.106 --> 00:46:13.056
This is really powerful for

00:46:13.056 --> 00:46:14.266
cases where you want to copy an

00:46:14.266 --> 00:46:16.206
entity and dynamically call an

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:18.066
action sequence on only the new

00:46:18.066 --> 00:46:18.476
entity.

00:46:19.106 --> 00:46:20.686
The overrides will take as a key

00:46:20.686 --> 00:46:22.006
the name of the original target

00:46:22.006 --> 00:46:23.546
of the action in Reality

00:46:23.546 --> 00:46:25.106
Composer, and then you pass in

00:46:25.106 --> 00:46:25.766
the new target.

00:46:25.766 --> 00:46:26.716
So when the action sequence

00:46:26.716 --> 00:46:28.846
runs, it only targets the new

00:46:28.846 --> 00:46:29.176
entity.

00:46:29.626 --> 00:46:31.806
So, let's pull this all together

00:46:31.806 --> 00:46:34.906
and let's check it out in Xcode.

00:46:35.516 --> 00:46:39.500
[ Applause ]

00:46:47.176 --> 00:46:49.066
So, here I have my application.

00:46:49.066 --> 00:46:50.546
Over the course of the session,

00:46:50.546 --> 00:46:52.156
Pau and Michelle have built up

00:46:52.416 --> 00:46:54.286
the Seasons chapter of our Solar

00:46:54.286 --> 00:46:54.986
System lesson.

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:56.536
And here I want to implement a

00:46:56.536 --> 00:46:58.036
second chapter based on the

00:46:58.036 --> 00:46:59.226
sizes of different celestial

00:46:59.226 --> 00:46:59.646
bodies.

00:46:59.966 --> 00:47:01.826
So here we have our Xcode 11,

00:47:01.826 --> 00:47:03.906
just our base application, and

00:47:03.906 --> 00:47:04.876
we have already included our

00:47:04.876 --> 00:47:05.966
Reality Composer project.

00:47:05.966 --> 00:47:07.646
Again, you can create a new AR

00:47:07.646 --> 00:47:09.266
or Game template or you can drag

00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:10.616
a Reality Composer project right

00:47:10.616 --> 00:47:11.756
into Xcode.

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:16.726
We can preview the project right

00:47:16.726 --> 00:47:19.106
in Xcode here and go ahead and

00:47:19.106 --> 00:47:20.286
open it in Reality Composer.

00:47:20.926 --> 00:47:25.436
Let's take a quick tour of this

00:47:25.436 --> 00:47:26.696
and the application before

00:47:26.696 --> 00:47:27.356
writing some code.

00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:29.866
So, in our chapter we've set up

00:47:29.866 --> 00:47:31.876
a couple of entities and we've

00:47:31.876 --> 00:47:33.336
given our scene a name and we've

00:47:33.336 --> 00:47:34.886
given different entities that we

00:47:34.886 --> 00:47:35.486
care about a name.

00:47:35.486 --> 00:47:36.786
For example this gold star is

00:47:36.786 --> 00:47:37.706
called special star.

00:47:38.026 --> 00:47:39.496
This is the name we'll use in

00:47:40.396 --> 00:47:41.206
our code.

00:47:41.416 --> 00:47:42.266
Additionally, we've set up a

00:47:42.266 --> 00:47:43.196
couple of behaviors.

00:47:43.196 --> 00:47:45.856
So for example, for the Moon, we

00:47:45.856 --> 00:47:46.826
want to know when the Moon is

00:47:46.826 --> 00:47:47.926
tapped so we can store some

00:47:47.926 --> 00:47:50.986
application state, and also hide

00:47:51.546 --> 00:47:53.266
all the other text labels and

00:47:53.266 --> 00:47:55.166
only display the Moon's labels.

00:47:55.166 --> 00:47:56.196
And all of these actions happen

00:47:56.196 --> 00:47:57.246
at the same time because they're

00:47:57.246 --> 00:47:58.000
grouped.

00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.256
Additionally, we have a notify

00:48:00.256 --> 00:48:01.736
action and we'll use this to

00:48:01.736 --> 00:48:02.756
know when the Moon is tapped

00:48:02.756 --> 00:48:03.876
inside of our application.

00:48:04.756 --> 00:48:05.816
We've implemented the same

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.336
action sequence for the Earth

00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:08.306
and the Sun as well.

00:48:09.416 --> 00:48:10.646
We also have a Look At camera

00:48:10.646 --> 00:48:11.866
action set up when the scene

00:48:11.866 --> 00:48:13.646
starts, so each of our text

00:48:13.646 --> 00:48:15.826
labels will look at the camera

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:16.816
no matter where we're looking.

00:48:17.376 --> 00:48:20.096
And we have a hide on start

00:48:20.096 --> 00:48:22.096
action sequence which will hide

00:48:22.096 --> 00:48:23.316
all the entities that we want to

00:48:23.316 --> 00:48:24.866
view only at specific times.

00:48:24.866 --> 00:48:25.726
For example, the chapter

00:48:25.726 --> 00:48:28.646
completed, text, and the text

00:48:29.616 --> 00:48:29.846
labels.

00:48:29.936 --> 00:48:31.046
Additionally, we have some

00:48:31.046 --> 00:48:32.326
action sequences that will be

00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:33.206
triggered in code.

00:48:33.206 --> 00:48:34.896
We'll get to this later in this

00:48:34.896 --> 00:48:36.746
demo, that will scale the

00:48:36.746 --> 00:48:37.726
celestial bodies to their

00:48:37.726 --> 00:48:40.366
relative sizes, scale them back

00:48:40.506 --> 00:48:41.456
to the same size.

00:48:42.366 --> 00:48:44.286
Display the chapter completed

00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:45.756
text.

00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:47.156
Begin the Earth orbit.

00:48:47.416 --> 00:48:48.766
And hide all of the other

00:48:48.766 --> 00:48:49.616
celestial bodies.

00:48:50.426 --> 00:48:51.396
And we have a cool little

00:48:51.396 --> 00:48:53.116
animation fired from a

00:48:53.116 --> 00:48:56.056
notification trigger that will

00:48:56.056 --> 00:48:58.066
show the gold star, spin it, and

00:48:58.066 --> 00:48:58.726
give it a bounce.

00:49:00.046 --> 00:49:01.366
So let's jump back to our Xcode

00:49:01.366 --> 00:49:03.746
application now and do a quick

00:49:03.746 --> 00:49:03.946
tour.

00:49:04.106 --> 00:49:05.466
So this application is pretty

00:49:05.466 --> 00:49:05.976
straightforward.

00:49:06.206 --> 00:49:07.516
It's a single view application.

00:49:08.026 --> 00:49:10.356
And at the top level we have an

00:49:10.356 --> 00:49:12.976
AR view, a segmented control to

00:49:12.976 --> 00:49:15.676
switch between size and detail

00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:18.466
view, a lesson completed button,

00:49:18.466 --> 00:49:19.636
so the student can just say I'm

00:49:19.636 --> 00:49:21.676
done with the lesson and view

00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:22.886
the chapter at the end.

00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:25.226
In a detail view, that will show

00:49:25.226 --> 00:49:26.526
more details as we tap on the

00:49:26.526 --> 00:49:29.506
Moon, the Earth, and the Sun.

00:49:29.506 --> 00:49:30.506
Additionally, we have some view

00:49:30.506 --> 00:49:31.906
models that will just drive that

00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:33.066
detail view, so it just shows

00:49:33.066 --> 00:49:35.176
some text, and then some basic

00:49:35.176 --> 00:49:36.736
application logic to kick off

00:49:36.736 --> 00:49:37.166
our loading.

00:49:37.496 --> 00:49:38.736
And let's look at loading first.

00:49:40.136 --> 00:49:41.356
So down here, the first thing

00:49:41.356 --> 00:49:42.896
you'll notice is we're using

00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:44.166
code generation in this project.

00:49:44.716 --> 00:49:46.846
So our Reality Composer project

00:49:46.846 --> 00:49:48.086
is automatically converted into

00:49:48.086 --> 00:49:49.016
an object that we can use.

00:49:49.016 --> 00:49:50.356
It's a real type, so we can use

00:49:50.356 --> 00:49:52.216
it right here for the size

00:49:52.216 --> 00:49:53.516
chapter property.

00:49:54.506 --> 00:49:55.796
So for example, Solar System

00:49:55.796 --> 00:49:57.676
lesson.size chapter is a real

00:49:57.676 --> 00:49:58.486
type that we can use.

00:49:59.036 --> 00:50:02.016
We can go ahead and load our

00:50:02.016 --> 00:50:04.066
scene and let's walk through

00:50:04.216 --> 00:50:04.816
this code as well.

00:50:04.816 --> 00:50:06.186
So what we're doing is loading

00:50:06.186 --> 00:50:08.426
the size chapter asynchronously

00:50:08.836 --> 00:50:11.596
and then we're handling, we're

00:50:11.596 --> 00:50:13.266
giving the loaded anchor

00:50:13.546 --> 00:50:14.706
collision shapes so that tap

00:50:14.706 --> 00:50:15.196
triggers work.

00:50:15.196 --> 00:50:16.976
And then we're adding it into

00:50:16.976 --> 00:50:17.376
our scene.

00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:19.086
Because we'll be using the size

00:50:19.086 --> 00:50:20.546
chapter later, we're storing it

00:50:20.606 --> 00:50:22.576
in the size chapter property and

00:50:22.576 --> 00:50:23.816
we're setting up notify actions,

00:50:23.816 --> 00:50:24.706
which we'll get to later.

00:50:24.706 --> 00:50:25.806
Right now it's not hooked up.

00:50:26.616 --> 00:50:27.706
So let's go ahead and run this.

00:50:28.086 --> 00:50:29.046
We'll see with just a few lines

00:50:29.046 --> 00:50:30.806
of code we're bringing our

00:50:30.806 --> 00:50:32.596
entire AR experience and it

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:33.896
should work exactly the same way

00:50:33.896 --> 00:50:35.336
it did in Reality Composer.

00:50:35.906 --> 00:50:38.036
So here we go.

00:50:38.036 --> 00:50:38.676
We have our scene.

00:50:38.676 --> 00:50:39.556
We see the content.

00:50:39.556 --> 00:50:40.806
For example, chapter completed

00:50:40.806 --> 00:50:42.366
is hidden and when we tap on

00:50:42.366 --> 00:50:43.856
each of our celestial bodies,

00:50:44.266 --> 00:50:45.836
we'll see text automatically

00:50:45.836 --> 00:50:47.896
appear and it will face the

00:50:47.896 --> 00:50:49.046
camera no matter where we're

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:51.696
looking, and same with the Sun.

00:50:52.076 --> 00:50:52.856
So, that looks pretty great.

00:50:52.856 --> 00:50:53.866
With a few lines of code, we

00:50:53.866 --> 00:50:54.966
brought our entire Reality

00:50:54.966 --> 00:50:56.746
Composer project into Xcode.

00:50:56.746 --> 00:50:57.496
It's super simple.

00:50:57.946 --> 00:50:59.186
What I want to do next is

00:50:59.186 --> 00:51:00.676
actually fill in this detail

00:51:00.676 --> 00:51:00.856
view.

00:51:00.856 --> 00:51:01.916
You'll notice when I tapped the

00:51:01.916 --> 00:51:03.516
Sun, for example, the detail

00:51:03.516 --> 00:51:05.026
view didn't actually get filled

00:51:05.026 --> 00:51:05.196
in.

00:51:05.256 --> 00:51:07.706
So let's jump back to Xcode and

00:51:07.706 --> 00:51:09.626
fill in the notify actions.

00:51:14.836 --> 00:51:17.186
So because our notify actions

00:51:17.186 --> 00:51:18.586
are automatically generated for

00:51:18.586 --> 00:51:20.336
us, we also get an all actions

00:51:20.396 --> 00:51:21.846
array that we can filter over.

00:51:22.096 --> 00:51:23.646
And we're going to filter over

00:51:23.646 --> 00:51:25.196
those actions to get only the

00:51:25.196 --> 00:51:26.446
actions we care about which

00:51:26.446 --> 00:51:27.186
begin with display.

00:51:27.766 --> 00:51:31.576
So, let's walk through this

00:51:31.576 --> 00:51:32.000
code.

00:51:33.296 --> 00:51:35.066
Because we set up notify actions

00:51:35.126 --> 00:51:36.956
in our size chapter, we can jump

00:51:36.956 --> 00:51:38.666
back to Reality Composer to look

00:51:39.266 --> 00:51:40.326
at those.

00:51:40.536 --> 00:51:41.796
For each the Moon, the Earth,

00:51:41.796 --> 00:51:44.266
and the Sun, right here, display

00:51:44.266 --> 00:51:45.446
Moon details, display Earth

00:51:45.446 --> 00:51:46.706
details, and display Sun

00:51:46.706 --> 00:51:48.306
details, we can access these in

00:51:48.306 --> 00:51:48.566
code.

00:51:48.886 --> 00:51:49.996
And we want to actually filter

00:51:49.996 --> 00:51:51.946
over our notify actions for only

00:51:52.076 --> 00:51:53.516
actions that begin with display,

00:51:53.746 --> 00:51:55.016
because we want to set the same

00:51:55.266 --> 00:51:56.536
closure for each of them.

00:51:57.846 --> 00:51:59.036
So, jumping back to Xcode,

00:51:59.486 --> 00:52:00.446
that's what we're doing here.

00:52:00.606 --> 00:52:02.506
We're doing size chapter.actions

00:52:02.506 --> 00:52:03.816
.all actions, and we're

00:52:03.816 --> 00:52:05.246
filtering over it, getting the

00:52:05.246 --> 00:52:06.836
identifier from the notify

00:52:06.836 --> 00:52:08.836
action object, and checking that

00:52:08.836 --> 00:52:09.766
it starts with display.

00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:12.366
Next we're iterating over all of

00:52:12.366 --> 00:52:14.126
the display actions and setting

00:52:14.126 --> 00:52:16.306
the same closure for each using

00:52:16.306 --> 00:52:17.306
the on-action property.

00:52:18.456 --> 00:52:19.776
And we're taking the target of

00:52:19.776 --> 00:52:21.426
our notify action, in this case

00:52:21.426 --> 00:52:22.656
for the Moon it's the Moon, for

00:52:22.656 --> 00:52:24.016
the Sun it's the Sun, and for

00:52:24.016 --> 00:52:26.506
the Earth it's the Earth, and

00:52:26.506 --> 00:52:27.726
using that entity to display

00:52:27.726 --> 00:52:28.566
different view models.

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:30.926
So let's run this application

00:52:30.926 --> 00:52:31.096
now.

00:52:31.636 --> 00:52:33.116
And what we like to see is

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:34.176
different view models appear

00:52:34.176 --> 00:52:35.646
when we tap on each of our

00:52:35.646 --> 00:52:37.046
celestial bodies.

00:52:37.876 --> 00:52:38.516
There we go.

00:52:39.516 --> 00:52:41.146
So we have our content, and now

00:52:41.146 --> 00:52:42.826
when we tap on the Moon, because

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.826
we've set up a notify action and

00:52:44.826 --> 00:52:46.376
we're observing those

00:52:46.376 --> 00:52:48.276
notifications, we're now seeing

00:52:48.276 --> 00:52:49.646
the Moon detail right at the

00:52:49.646 --> 00:52:50.266
bottom here.

00:52:50.536 --> 00:52:52.056
When we tap on the Earth, we see

00:52:52.056 --> 00:52:53.906
Earth's details, and we tap on

00:52:53.906 --> 00:52:55.586
the Sun, we're seeing the Sun's

00:52:55.586 --> 00:52:55.926
details.

00:52:56.236 --> 00:52:57.146
That looks pretty great.

00:52:58.616 --> 00:52:59.906
We also were keeping some state.

00:52:59.996 --> 00:53:01.786
So, when we tap on all three of

00:53:02.016 --> 00:53:03.256
our Earth, Sun, and Moon

00:53:03.256 --> 00:53:05.296
actions, we're just making sure

00:53:05.296 --> 00:53:06.146
that three different actions

00:53:06.146 --> 00:53:07.626
were called, and we display a

00:53:07.626 --> 00:53:09.086
complete lesson button up here

00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:09.866
in the right-hand corner.

00:53:10.926 --> 00:53:12.576
So what we want to do now is

00:53:12.626 --> 00:53:13.886
using Notification Triggers,

00:53:14.566 --> 00:53:16.096
fire off those size relative

00:53:16.096 --> 00:53:18.016
size, and size to same size

00:53:18.016 --> 00:53:19.556
action sequences that we set up

00:53:19.556 --> 00:53:21.046
in Reality Composer using the

00:53:21.046 --> 00:53:22.716
segmented control at the top and

00:53:22.716 --> 00:53:23.726
the button in the upper

00:53:23.726 --> 00:53:25.000
right-hand corner.

00:53:30.376 --> 00:53:31.956
So, we can do this with a

00:53:31.956 --> 00:53:33.436
segmented control value change

00:53:33.436 --> 00:53:33.686
method.

00:53:33.686 --> 00:53:34.796
This is an Interface Builder

00:53:34.796 --> 00:53:36.336
method that we've set up and

00:53:36.336 --> 00:53:37.836
hooked up in Interface Builder

00:53:37.836 --> 00:53:38.226
itself.

00:53:42.066 --> 00:53:44.076
And using our Notification

00:53:44.076 --> 00:53:46.216
Action, Triggers, we can fire

00:53:46.216 --> 00:53:47.656
the scale to same size action

00:53:47.656 --> 00:53:49.046
sequence, which we set up in

00:53:49.046 --> 00:53:52.036
Reality Composer down here,

00:53:52.036 --> 00:53:53.726
which will scale each of our

00:53:53.726 --> 00:53:55.146
celestial bodies back to their

00:53:55.146 --> 00:53:56.656
original scale of 100%.

00:53:57.836 --> 00:53:59.396
And when the size segmented

00:53:59.396 --> 00:54:00.486
control is selected, we want to

00:54:00.486 --> 00:54:02.426
scale our Sun to a relative size

00:54:02.866 --> 00:54:03.326
to the Earth.

00:54:04.316 --> 00:54:06.486
To do that, we can fire our

00:54:07.056 --> 00:54:09.686
scale to relative sizes action

00:54:09.686 --> 00:54:10.156
sequence.

00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:12.676
And finally when the lesson

00:54:12.676 --> 00:54:14.476
completed button is tapped, this

00:54:14.476 --> 00:54:15.576
is an Interface Builder action

00:54:15.576 --> 00:54:17.386
that we've set up and hooked up,

00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:20.956
we'll fire the chapter completed

00:54:21.286 --> 00:54:22.206
Notification Trigger.

00:54:22.936 --> 00:54:24.536
And what this one does is

00:54:24.536 --> 00:54:25.756
because there are three

00:54:25.756 --> 00:54:27.096
different Notification Triggers

00:54:27.206 --> 00:54:28.506
hooked up in Reality Composer,

00:54:28.876 --> 00:54:30.156
we'll fire all three of these

00:54:30.156 --> 00:54:31.046
action sequences.

00:54:31.456 --> 00:54:32.736
We'll fade out the existing

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:33.196
content.

00:54:34.666 --> 00:54:36.276
We'll then begin an orbit of our

00:54:36.276 --> 00:54:37.446
little Earth and little Moon.

00:54:38.006 --> 00:54:40.686
And we'll show the chapter

00:54:40.686 --> 00:54:41.756
completed section.

00:54:42.266 --> 00:54:46.346
So, let's run this now and see

00:54:46.346 --> 00:54:46.906
our application.

00:54:50.876 --> 00:54:51.956
All right, so here we have our

00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:52.366
content.

00:54:52.926 --> 00:54:54.296
We can tap on the Moon.

00:54:54.296 --> 00:54:55.676
Everything works exactly the

00:54:55.676 --> 00:54:56.826
same as we set up in Reality

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:57.326
Composer.

00:54:57.566 --> 00:54:59.146
And now when we tap the size

00:54:59.146 --> 00:55:00.426
segmented control when looking

00:55:00.426 --> 00:55:01.996
at the Earth and the Sun, we get

00:55:01.996 --> 00:55:03.986
a really good scale of just how

00:55:03.986 --> 00:55:05.756
big the Sun is compared to

00:55:05.756 --> 00:55:05.966
Earth.

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:06.956
It's pretty tiny.

00:55:07.556 --> 00:55:09.466
So, that looks great.

00:55:09.616 --> 00:55:11.596
Let's size it back, and let's

00:55:11.596 --> 00:55:12.346
complete our lesson.

00:55:12.346 --> 00:55:13.526
I'm going to tap the lesson

00:55:13.526 --> 00:55:14.666
completed, the complete lesson

00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:15.716
button at the top right-hand

00:55:15.716 --> 00:55:16.026
corner.

00:55:16.686 --> 00:55:18.306
And we'll see our content fades

00:55:18.306 --> 00:55:19.836
out, and we see our chapter

00:55:19.836 --> 00:55:22.086
completed along with an orbit

00:55:22.086 --> 00:55:23.186
starting for our tiny Sun.

00:55:23.696 --> 00:55:24.936
That looks pretty great, and we

00:55:24.936 --> 00:55:26.486
can see how with Notification

00:55:26.486 --> 00:55:28.576
Triggers and Notify Actions, we

00:55:28.576 --> 00:55:29.876
can work with our application

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:30.936
and our AR content.

00:55:31.226 --> 00:55:32.276
There's one last thing I want to

00:55:32.276 --> 00:55:32.446
do.

00:55:32.446 --> 00:55:33.676
We discussed post with

00:55:33.676 --> 00:55:35.076
overrides, and I want to show

00:55:35.076 --> 00:55:36.146
you how we can use that to

00:55:36.146 --> 00:55:37.656
display dynamic content using

00:55:37.656 --> 00:55:38.436
application state.

00:55:39.116 --> 00:55:40.196
So because this is a lesson

00:55:40.196 --> 00:55:41.606
application, we want to display

00:55:41.606 --> 00:55:43.146
gold stars based on how well a

00:55:43.146 --> 00:55:44.426
student does.

00:55:46.986 --> 00:55:48.476
For this session, I think we all

00:55:48.476 --> 00:55:49.406
did pretty great so I'm just

00:55:49.406 --> 00:55:50.346
going to give us three stars,

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:51.566
and we can see how we can set

00:55:51.566 --> 00:55:51.956
this up.

00:55:52.546 --> 00:55:53.576
This is a method that we're

00:55:53.576 --> 00:55:55.826
calling inside of our display

00:55:55.826 --> 00:55:58.316
details view up above where

00:55:58.396 --> 00:55:59.176
we're keeping state.

00:55:59.726 --> 00:56:02.896
So this looks like a lot of code

00:56:02.896 --> 00:56:03.986
that I just pasted in, but let's

00:56:03.986 --> 00:56:04.506
walk through it.

00:56:05.366 --> 00:56:06.396
So the first thing we're doing

00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:08.496
is accessing our special star

00:56:08.496 --> 00:56:09.756
entity that we set up in Reality

00:56:09.756 --> 00:56:12.056
Composer right here.

00:56:12.276 --> 00:56:15.966
We've given it the name special

00:56:15.966 --> 00:56:17.196
star, so we're now accessing it

00:56:17.566 --> 00:56:18.336
right in Xcode.

00:56:19.456 --> 00:56:21.016
Next, we're triggering the show

00:56:21.016 --> 00:56:23.826
gold star action sequence right

00:56:23.826 --> 00:56:25.336
in code, so that will display

00:56:25.336 --> 00:56:26.286
the first gold star.

00:56:26.286 --> 00:56:27.556
But we want to display three.

00:56:28.216 --> 00:56:29.806
So, we can do that by

00:56:30.136 --> 00:56:31.576
dispatching after maybe two and

00:56:31.576 --> 00:56:33.216
a half seconds for this demo,

00:56:33.636 --> 00:56:34.996
and we're going to clone the

00:56:34.996 --> 00:56:35.446
star.

00:56:36.456 --> 00:56:37.496
Then we're going to position it

00:56:37.936 --> 00:56:39.926
to the right and up a little

00:56:39.926 --> 00:56:40.236
bit.

00:56:40.996 --> 00:56:41.776
We're going to add it to our

00:56:41.776 --> 00:56:42.296
scene.

00:56:42.556 --> 00:56:45.096
And then using post overrides,

00:56:45.096 --> 00:56:46.296
we're passing in the original

00:56:46.296 --> 00:56:47.696
target of the action sequence,

00:56:47.996 --> 00:56:50.006
and then passing in the new

00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:51.556
action, the new target of the

00:56:51.556 --> 00:56:52.696
action, in this case the right

00:56:52.696 --> 00:56:53.056
star.

00:56:53.296 --> 00:56:55.266
And we want to do the same thing

00:56:55.266 --> 00:56:55.986
for the left star.

00:56:56.046 --> 00:56:57.036
So, we're copying it again,

00:56:57.556 --> 00:56:58.266
copying the star.

00:56:59.016 --> 00:57:00.476
Positioning it to the left and

00:57:00.476 --> 00:57:02.686
down a little bit, adding it to

00:57:02.686 --> 00:57:04.336
our scene, and again, posting

00:57:04.336 --> 00:57:05.756
with overrides, taking the

00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:07.316
original name and passing in the

00:57:07.316 --> 00:57:08.806
left star this time as the

00:57:09.036 --> 00:57:10.576
target of our action sequence.

00:57:11.856 --> 00:57:12.916
So, let's build and run this app

00:57:12.916 --> 00:57:13.956
now, and what we'd like to see

00:57:13.956 --> 00:57:15.686
is three gold stars appear, even

00:57:15.686 --> 00:57:16.916
though we've only set up one in

00:57:16.916 --> 00:57:17.646
our application.

00:57:17.776 --> 00:57:18.876
This is driven entirely by

00:57:18.876 --> 00:57:19.656
application [inaudible].

00:57:25.456 --> 00:57:26.786
So here's our scene again.

00:57:27.196 --> 00:57:28.476
We can walk through the lesson.

00:57:29.136 --> 00:57:31.376
I think I'm done now, so I'll

00:57:31.976 --> 00:57:33.786
click complete lesson.

00:57:34.236 --> 00:57:35.466
And we see one gold star

00:57:35.466 --> 00:57:36.006
appears.

00:57:36.736 --> 00:57:37.946
We'll see a second gold star

00:57:37.946 --> 00:57:38.466
appears.

00:57:38.946 --> 00:57:40.146
And there's our third star.

00:57:40.146 --> 00:57:41.206
We did a great job, so we got

00:57:41.206 --> 00:57:41.816
three stars here.

00:57:42.516 --> 00:57:47.500
[ Applause ]

00:57:51.436 --> 00:57:53.106
So, that's how easy it is to

00:57:53.106 --> 00:57:54.696
load your AR content into your

00:57:54.696 --> 00:57:56.936
application, begin working with

00:57:56.936 --> 00:57:58.326
it with notify actions to

00:57:58.326 --> 00:57:59.156
provide your custom

00:57:59.156 --> 00:58:00.616
implementations, and then

00:58:00.616 --> 00:58:02.296
Trigger Action sequences that

00:58:02.296 --> 00:58:03.566
you set up in Reality Composer

00:58:03.896 --> 00:58:05.276
using Notification Triggers.

00:58:05.436 --> 00:58:08.336
So, let's take a tour of what we

00:58:08.336 --> 00:58:08.866
learned today.

00:58:09.026 --> 00:58:10.366
We learned with Reality Composer

00:58:10.366 --> 00:58:11.906
we can create amazing AR

00:58:11.906 --> 00:58:14.036
experiences using the built-in

00:58:14.146 --> 00:58:15.766
modular assets, for example the

00:58:15.766 --> 00:58:17.166
sphere or the cube.

00:58:17.506 --> 00:58:18.896
And then we can bring those

00:58:18.896 --> 00:58:20.776
assets to life with behaviors

00:58:21.096 --> 00:58:23.506
and simple interactions.

00:58:24.616 --> 00:58:25.606
Finally, we can bring those

00:58:25.606 --> 00:58:27.536
amazing AR experiences into our

00:58:27.536 --> 00:58:29.146
applications using code

00:58:29.146 --> 00:58:30.546
generation and deep integration

00:58:30.546 --> 00:58:31.056
with Xcode.

00:58:31.256 --> 00:58:32.646
We have already seen some

00:58:32.646 --> 00:58:34.206
amazing stuff being created by

00:58:34.206 --> 00:58:36.206
you guys using Reality Composer.

00:58:36.506 --> 00:58:37.916
We encourage you guys to keep

00:58:37.916 --> 00:58:38.326
creating.

00:58:38.326 --> 00:58:39.996
We're super excited to see the

00:58:39.996 --> 00:58:41.686
amazing AR applications that you

00:58:41.686 --> 00:58:42.246
can create.

00:58:43.126 --> 00:58:44.876
We have some sessions and labs

00:58:44.876 --> 00:58:46.796
available to you guys today and

00:58:46.796 --> 00:58:49.076
tomorrow, and we encourage you

00:58:49.076 --> 00:58:50.046
guys to bring questions, your

00:58:50.046 --> 00:58:51.426
projects, anything else, we're

00:58:51.426 --> 00:58:52.146
happy to help you.

00:58:52.646 --> 00:58:54.956
Have a great rest of your WWDC.
