[ Music ]

00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:09.566
>> Good evening, developers, and

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:13.376
welcome to the 2019 Apple Design

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:13.666
Awards.

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:16.065
Now, here's your host, Senior

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.286
Director of Evangelism, John

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:18.906
Geleynse.

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:25.836
[ Music ]

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.886
>> Hello. Well, hello, and

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:30.806
welcome to another Apple Design

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:31.176
Awards.

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:32.936
Thanks for joining us this

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:34.606
afternoon, especially after a

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:36.756
long, but exciting day.

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:39.116
And I just want to particularly

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:40.716
thank all of you who have joined

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.016
us from around the world online

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:44.296
on the live stream for the

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:45.246
ceremony right now.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.266
We've got a huge group.

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:52.046
You know, it's great for us to

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:53.626
join as a community, and gather

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:55.856
like this to take a few moments

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:58.686
to celebrate and acknowledge

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.356
excellence in innovation and

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:00.756
design.

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.386
Because at Apple, we've been

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.306
awarding excellent design for

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.666
more than two decades now.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:09.886
What started originally as the

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:11.556
Apple Human Interface Design

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:13.196
Excellence Awards, or HIDE

00:01:13.196 --> 00:01:15.396
Awards for short, was renamed a

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.606
few years later to what is now

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:19.456
known as the Apple Design

00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:20.000
Awards.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.676
You know, the world around us is

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:27.856
stunningly beautiful, and as

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:29.616
humans, we're attracted to

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:32.436
beautiful things, and to

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:33.476
incredible designs.

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:36.806
We're drawn to these things, and

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.496
we respond to them deeply.

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:42.056
And at Apple, we believe the

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:43.466
true -- the beauty -- that

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.916
beautiful design is both

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:47.936
appearance and function, and

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:49.796
something that works well with

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:51.416
each component deeply

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.046
considered, and each aspect

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.326
carefully crafted -- that that

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:56.986
can be profoundly beautiful.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.936
And so, simply judging something

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.146
by how it looks isn't enough.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.356
It's how it works.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.746
It has to work as beautifully as

00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:10.425
it looks, and great design

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.126
reflects the broader definition

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:12.946
of beauty.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.486
And it runs deeper than the

00:02:15.486 --> 00:02:16.066
interface.

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:18.136
It's coherent, and it's

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:19.116
cohesive.

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:21.446
And it helps us to engage with

00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:23.276
each other in new, and

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.176
innovative, and life-enhancing

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:27.556
ways, and like compelling

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:29.966
beauty, great design draws us

00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:30.736
in.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:33.836
And the Apple Design Awards have

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:35.306
always been about this --

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.026
recognizing great design, and

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:40.526
then celebrating the developers

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.486
who positively impact everyone

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:44.226
else, and real people with the

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.196
things that they create, the

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:47.546
things that you create.

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.116
Now, we select our winners each

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:53.476
year by evaluating them in

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:56.000
basically three key areas.

00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:58.616
The first area is design.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:01.836
We're looking for apps that are

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:03.586
-- that have strong visual

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.566
design, that are efficient and

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.366
easy to use, that have great

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:12.336
game play, that have attention

00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:15.136
to detail and polish, that are

00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:16.636
internally coherent.

00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:19.876
On the technology front, we're

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:22.486
evaluating technology usage, and

00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:23.636
so we're looking for apps that

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.096
are fast and responsive.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.216
We're looking for apps that take

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:28.946
full advantage of all of the

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:30.186
capabilities of our latest

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:32.506
devices, and we're looking for

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:34.926
apps that use the latest Apple

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.686
technologies to do really great

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:38.466
new things.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.836
And on the innovation front,

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.216
we're looking for brilliance.

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:47.306
We're looking for new ideas.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.296
We're looking for uniqueness,

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:54.476
platform differentiation, and

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:55.606
things that just weren't

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:56.666
possible before.

00:03:57.306 --> 00:03:59.996
And the developers of our

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:02.116
winning apps this evening have

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.276
done an outstanding job, and

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.086
outstanding work in these three

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:09.106
areas, and more, and we want to

00:04:09.106 --> 00:04:10.096
honor that work.

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:12.266
We want to acknowledge the

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.766
distinct joy and the challenges

00:04:14.836 --> 00:04:16.466
of the app creation process that

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.706
we're all so familiar with.

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:20.426
We want to honor the endless

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.926
hours, the late nights, and the

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.886
dedication that goes into the

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:26.006
pursuit of excellence.

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:29.706
We want to recognize the

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:32.196
dead-ends, and the frustration,

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:34.196
and the exhaustion sometimes

00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:37.626
that often goes unseen, and

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:38.786
we're all familiar with that.

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:41.066
And we want to honor the

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:43.086
unconventional thinking, the

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:45.756
creativity, and the new ideas

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:48.176
that lead to breakthroughs and

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:49.496
innovative solutions.

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:51.216
So let's get started.

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:53.936
Winners tonight are going to win

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:55.956
some pretty great -- some pretty

00:04:55.956 --> 00:04:58.846
amazing prizes, and each prize

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.206
package includes a 512 gigabyte

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:04.446
iPhone XS with a set of AirPods,

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:09.456
a 512 gigabyte 12.9-inch iPad

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:11.466
Pro with Apple Pencil 2,

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:18.646
a 64 gigabyte 4K Apple TV, an

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.346
Apple Watch Series 4,

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:27.066
a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro,

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:30.786
and a fully-loaded iMac Pro.

00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:33.306
In addition --

00:05:36.346 --> 00:05:37.606
in addition -- and this is what

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:41.136
all of you want -- each winner

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:42.786
will -- each winning develop --

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:43.946
each winning app will be

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:45.246
highlighted on the App Store,

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:47.066
similar to what we did last year

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:48.406
on the Today tab for the Apple

00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:49.776
Design Award winners, and what

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:51.016
we did throughout the year

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.506
following the ceremony.

00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:53.906
So this year's winners will be

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:55.456
highlighted in prominent ways on

00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:56.246
the App Stores.

00:05:57.196 --> 00:05:58.546
And lastly, each winner will

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:00.076
take home one of the coveted

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:01.636
Apple Design Award trophies,

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:06.776
except that we thought it was

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:08.016
time for a refresh.

00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:11.476
And so, we have a completely new

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:13.466
trophy this year, redesigned

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:15.036
from the Apple Design Team.

00:06:15.496 --> 00:06:17.146
It retains the integrity and

00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:18.596
recognizable qualities of the

00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:21.166
original award, but reinterprets

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:22.786
these with the qualities of our

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:23.706
latest products.

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:26.596
It's made out of 100% recycled

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:27.686
aluminum, and featured a

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:29.986
mirror-finished stainless steel

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.766
Apple logo inlay.

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:33.966
It's pretty sweet, if you ask

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:34.330
me.

00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:37.326
All right.

00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:41.326
So we have nine -- we have nine

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:43.546
winners today, and each winner

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:45.336
will be announced and demoed by

00:06:45.336 --> 00:06:46.706
a colleague -- by colleagues of

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.576
mine from the Apple -- from the

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:49.446
-- from Apple's World Wide

00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:50.896
Developer Relations Team.

00:06:51.196 --> 00:06:52.706
Now, a little bit differently

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:54.316
than other years -- if we

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:55.846
announce your app, if we

00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:57.566
announce you as a winner, please

00:06:57.606 --> 00:06:59.596
stay in your seat because we're

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.726
going to first talk about your

00:07:00.726 --> 00:07:02.456
app, and explain it to the

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.296
community.

00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:04.816
And we're going to demo it, and

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:06.436
when we've completed the demo,

00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:07.616
we're going to call you forward

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:09.236
on stage, and ask that you'd

00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:10.576
come up on stage using these

00:07:10.576 --> 00:07:13.506
stairs here at this location.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:16.966
So, let's find out who the

00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:18.036
winners are.

00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:21.026
To present our first winners,

00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:21.866
I'd like to invite my

00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:24.116
colleagues, Si Ching and Oscar

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:24.536
on stage.

[ Music ]

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:32.076
>> Thanks, John.

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.906
For our first award today, we

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:36.656
have a gorgeous platform game

00:07:37.036 --> 00:07:38.566
designed for the mobile screen

00:07:38.696 --> 00:07:39.696
from the ground up.

00:07:40.056 --> 00:07:41.676
It's optimized for the portrait

00:07:41.676 --> 00:07:43.506
orientation with simple

00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:44.636
drag-and-release controls.

00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:46.996
Oscar and I had so much fun with

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:48.486
this game, and we can't wait to

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:49.066
show it to you.

00:07:49.826 --> 00:07:53.066
The first award goes to Ordia by

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:53.486
Loju.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:08:04.086
[ Applause ]

00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:06.566
Okay, let's get the demo up.

00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:09.896
Okay, Oscar, let's take this

00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:11.336
game for a spin.

00:08:11.786 --> 00:08:13.996
Ordia tells the story of a first

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:16.066
life form emerging from this

00:08:16.216 --> 00:08:18.466
gooey primordial soup, and then

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:20.406
goes on a precarious trip to

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:21.786
start its journey as a living

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:22.126
being.

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.986
It needs to jump through caves,

00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:26.306
gather nutrition, while also

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:27.686
avoid being eaten or killed.

00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:30.966
Ordia has its amazingly-rich and

00:08:31.016 --> 00:08:33.015
vibrant design style, a lovely

00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:34.785
blobbiness and bounciness

00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:36.155
throughout -- not just with the

00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:37.716
visuals, but also the sound

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:37.976

[ Game Sounds ]

00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:44.676
What we love about this game is

00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:46.296
that it's intuitive enough so

00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:48.376
you simply start playing, and it

00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:50.076
introduces rules and challenges

00:08:50.076 --> 00:08:51.916
gradually as you go through the

00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:53.176
levels.

00:08:53.176 --> 00:08:54.986
It uses colors to communicate

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:55.936
the roles of each element.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.416
Green and yellow things are

00:08:57.476 --> 00:08:59.146
friendly, while pink things must

00:08:59.176 --> 00:08:59.726
be avoided.

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:02.316
It also leverages our Taptic

00:09:02.316 --> 00:09:04.086
Engine just the right amount, so

00:09:04.216 --> 00:09:05.796
you get this subtle and

00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:06.886
satisfying feedback while you

00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:06.976
play.

00:09:11.086 --> 00:09:12.616
Ordia has three universes.

00:09:13.176 --> 00:09:15.906
They are immersive, consistent,

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.786
yet also distinct from each

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:19.626
other, with carefully balanced

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:21.176
color palette, different game

00:09:21.176 --> 00:09:22.446
elements, and soundtracks.

00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:24.596
Now, let's have a look at the

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:25.296
jungle universe.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:26.996
This is actually a really tough

00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:27.406
level.

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:28.616
I've never been able to go

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:29.906
through without dying, so good

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:30.500
luck, Oscar.

00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:35.246
I love the pacing of this game.

00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:37.106
The challenges alternate

00:09:37.296 --> 00:09:38.716
smoothly between speed, timing,

00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:42.136
and accuracy, while also offers

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.496
you these little resting pods,

00:09:43.846 --> 00:09:45.366
where your Ordia can regenerate

00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:46.826
if it dies, so you can breathe a

00:09:46.826 --> 00:09:47.156
little.

00:09:47.626 --> 00:09:49.706
The balance between difficulty

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.546
and satisfaction is very well

00:09:51.546 --> 00:09:53.136
managed, so you just feel like

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.716
you have to play one more level.

00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:59.106
Ordia caters for accessibility

00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:00.116
with great care.

00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:02.366
Its colorblindness mode has even

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:03.786
been tested on monochrome.

00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:06.456
Now, what if you want to do a

00:10:06.456 --> 00:10:08.256
challenge on a level where you

00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:10.176
catch every single nutrition, or

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.546
race for your fastest completion

00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:00.346

would share with you today, I

00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:31.426
would start drawing, and

completely lose track of what I

00:12:32.936 --> 00:12:34.816
was supposed to be doing, which

00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:36.606

picking the color of the paper,

up the drawing tools in advance,

so you're not messing around

00:12:55.516 --> 00:12:57.276

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:58.766
have some really great drawing

They have a great felt-tip pen

00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:20.136
that looks basically like you

00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:22.266
would expect a pen to look, and

00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:24.876
they have great markers with

really nice buildup of ink for

00:13:34.256 --> 00:13:35.986
Now, playing with these tools --

00:13:36.506 --> 00:13:37.606
it kind of -- it takes me back

00:13:38.006 --> 00:13:39.036
to when I was a kid.

00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:41.146
My mom -- she was a really great

00:13:41.146 --> 00:13:42.856

00:13:42.896 --> 00:13:44.216
business called Inklings.

00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:46.146
And -- yeah, I thought that was

00:13:46.146 --> 00:13:47.516
a pretty clever name, by the

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:47.746
way.

00:13:48.546 --> 00:13:49.846
And when she would get supplies

00:13:49.846 --> 00:13:51.386
for her business, she would

00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:53.266
often take me with her, and I

00:13:53.266 --> 00:13:54.946
would have so much fun just

00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:57.156
playing with all of the markers

00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:01.996
of takes me back to that

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:04.816
experience, but the real heart

00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:06.706
of the interface here is

00:14:06.706 --> 00:14:08.536
customizing the drawing tools.

00:14:09.286 --> 00:14:10.866
Everything in this interface is

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:12.336

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:13.656
these really great optional

00:14:13.716 --> 00:14:14.436
sound effects.

00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:16.126
Check out when you change the

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:18.546
brush size, how the nibs change

00:14:18.546 --> 00:14:20.696
in response, or when you change

00:14:20.696 --> 00:14:23.386
the nibs, they pop on and pop

00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:23.736
off.

00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:26.086
But the heart of this interface

00:14:26.086 --> 00:14:27.256
is changing the color.

00:14:27.676 --> 00:14:29.636
You adjust the value on the side

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:31.896
here on the right, swipe side to

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:34.506
side to adjust saturation, and

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.646
color by just spinning the color

00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:37.056
wheel.

00:14:37.926 --> 00:14:39.926
And check out how all of these

00:14:40.266 --> 00:14:41.646
-- all of these colors have

00:14:41.746 --> 00:14:42.706
unique names.

00:14:43.256 --> 00:14:45.166
There's 1400 names in all.

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:46.876
It's just like a real marker

00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:47.226
set.

00:14:48.216 --> 00:14:50.166
Now, I'm feeling inspired to

00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:52.356
actually draw something, so to

00:14:52.356 --> 00:14:54.236
extend the canvas and stay in a

00:14:54.236 --> 00:14:56.276
state of flow, I just swipe over

00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:56.946
to the side.

00:14:57.766 --> 00:14:59.256
I'll draw something in the theme

00:14:59.256 --> 00:15:01.236
of calligraphy in front of a

00:15:01.236 --> 00:15:02.446
couple thousand people, so

00:15:02.446 --> 00:15:03.596
hopefully I do this all right.

00:15:03.596 --> 00:15:05.596
I'm going to draw a little

00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:06.186
feather pen.

00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:08.116
So I'm just going to trace in

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.886
the outline with a felt-tip

00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:10.376
marker.

00:15:11.116 --> 00:15:14.846
It's looking pretty good.

00:15:15.696 --> 00:15:18.136
It's a little bit flat, so I

00:15:18.246 --> 00:15:20.886
think I'm going to add in some

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:21.676
shading.

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:25.386
It's a little bit more

00:15:25.386 --> 00:15:25.786
realistic.

00:15:25.786 --> 00:15:29.616
And then zoom in here -- whoops

00:15:30.356 --> 00:15:34.876
-- add in some color for the

00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:36.976
feather pen, and then touch

00:15:37.026 --> 00:15:38.976
things up with the eraser.

00:15:40.426 --> 00:15:40.756
All right.

00:15:41.286 --> 00:15:43.206
That's looking pretty good, but,

Well, technology hasn't quite

gotten us there yet, but playing

this game gives you a sense of

Now, beyond the stunning imagery

00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:28.256
that you see, what really

00:18:28.256 --> 00:18:29.756
impressed us about this game is

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:31.226
that this kind of attention to

00:18:31.226 --> 00:18:33.696
detail actually extends to its

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.286
bespoke soundtrack, its

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.236
natural-feeling haptics, and

00:18:37.236 --> 00:18:38.746
more than that, the

00:18:38.746 --> 00:18:40.486
storytelling.

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.246
Notice how Frendt is taken aback

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.716
when Arina's able to walk over

00:18:43.716 --> 00:18:45.896
the clouds, and then he catches

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:47.716
up, still a little unsure.

00:18:47.716 --> 00:18:50.396
And here, I just stopped time,

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.636
and I do that by just not

00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:54.456
tapping anything.

00:18:54.456 --> 00:18:55.616
This means that I'm never

00:18:55.616 --> 00:18:57.696
feeling rushed or under any kind

00:18:57.696 --> 00:18:58.316
of time pressure.

00:18:58.466 --> 00:19:01.066
We think this game play mechanic

00:19:01.066 --> 00:19:05.126
is really simple, yet effective.

00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:06.196
Now, because you move both

00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:07.936
characters at once, and only

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:09.986
control the flow of time, an

00:19:09.986 --> 00:19:11.426
interesting interplay happens

00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:13.876
between the two characters.

00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:16.396
Here, you will notice that Arina

00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:18.056
is no longer able to move any

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.126
more forward in time, and that's

00:19:20.206 --> 00:19:21.506
because Frendt has fallen

00:19:21.506 --> 00:19:22.000
behind.

00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:24.796
So let's go back in time, and

00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:26.006
see what we can do differently

00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:27.536
to help him out.

each time I hop over the saw

00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.046

00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:34.436
through the plank.

00:19:34.436 --> 00:19:36.506
So let me go back and forth in

00:19:36.506 --> 00:19:37.406
time a few times.

up, and they continue their

00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:50.706
journey.

00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:52.586
Just around the island, there

00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:53.186
are these bells.

00:19:53.186 --> 00:19:54.226

00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:28.446
phenomenal with that kind of

00:25:28.476 --> 00:25:29.146
performance.

00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:31.406
All right, up next, for our next

00:25:31.406 --> 00:25:33.756

>> Do you sometimes find that

00:25:43.996 --> 00:25:45.746
you take a photo, and it doesn't

00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:47.126
quite capture the feeling of the

00:25:47.126 --> 00:25:47.386
moment?

00:25:47.866 --> 00:25:49.136
The secret is, professional

00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:50.286
photographers adjust their

00:25:50.286 --> 00:25:51.666
photos after the shoot, and

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:53.066
create the desired effect.

00:25:53.406 --> 00:25:54.866
But that takes time, and for

00:25:54.866 --> 00:25:56.086
most of us, we don't even know

00:25:56.086 --> 00:25:57.076
where to start -- what colors

00:25:57.076 --> 00:25:58.196
need adjusting, or how do you

00:25:58.196 --> 00:25:59.206
find that perfect composition.

00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:01.236
But this is exactly where this

00:26:01.236 --> 00:26:02.156
app truly shines.

be achieved with this incredible

app exclusively on the iPad.

00:26:16.156 --> 00:26:17.036
>> Thank you, Ennis.

00:26:17.246 --> 00:26:18.746
I'm really excited to show you

00:26:18.746 --> 00:26:20.546
all just how easy it is to edit

00:26:20.546 --> 00:26:22.586
photos on your iPad using

00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:23.726
Pixelmator Photo.

00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:25.096
Let's get started.

00:26:25.096 --> 00:26:26.956
I've got this great image of

00:26:26.956 --> 00:26:28.546
this boy playing soccer on a

00:26:28.596 --> 00:26:30.366
beach in India, but I think with

00:26:30.366 --> 00:26:32.236
a few simple adjustments, we can

00:26:32.236 --> 00:26:33.856
really make this photo pop.

00:26:34.166 --> 00:26:35.096
I'm first going to hit the

00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:36.856
Auto-Enhance button, which is

00:26:37.296 --> 00:26:39.246
already making this look quite a

00:26:39.246 --> 00:26:40.076
bit better.

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:41.506
But I want it to have a more

00:26:41.506 --> 00:26:43.626
vintage look to it, and for

00:26:43.626 --> 00:26:44.816
that, I'm going to have a look

00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:46.906
at some of the many built-in

00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:47.856
presets within this app.

00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:50.156
I love all these different film

00:26:50.156 --> 00:26:52.536
looks, and the urban looks, but

00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:53.656
I specifically like these

00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:54.846
classic films.

00:26:55.226 --> 00:26:56.526
So I'm going to choose number 2.

00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.226
I think that looks really good,

00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:00.766
and there's one more thing I

00:27:00.766 --> 00:27:02.666
want to do to this image, which

00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:04.666
is to crop it before I share it

00:27:05.126 --> 00:27:06.206
with my friends.

00:27:07.196 --> 00:27:09.036
And what's really unique about

00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:10.796
the cropping in Pixelmator Photo

00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:13.596
is, the team trained a custom

00:27:13.596 --> 00:27:15.436
Core ML model on thousands and

00:27:15.436 --> 00:27:16.696
thousands of images to gain a

00:27:16.696 --> 00:27:18.576
deep understanding of the

00:27:18.666 --> 00:27:20.226
content of the photos.

00:27:20.876 --> 00:27:24.506
And by doing that, they let me,

00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:26.666
as their customer, just simply

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:28.066
enable this Smart Cropping

00:27:28.136 --> 00:27:30.166
feature, and I can choose a

00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:31.906
different aspect ratio, like a

00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:33.126
square frame.

00:27:33.536 --> 00:27:35.116
And there, in two taps, I have

00:27:35.116 --> 00:27:36.576
this perfectly-cropped image

00:27:36.576 --> 00:27:37.216
ready to share.

00:27:37.216 --> 00:27:39.446
Let's take a look at one more

00:27:39.446 --> 00:27:40.176
photo.

00:27:40.546 --> 00:27:41.776
I'm going to tap on the Files

00:27:41.776 --> 00:27:44.956
button here on the top, and I'm

00:27:44.956 --> 00:27:46.836
going to choose this photo of

00:27:46.836 --> 00:27:48.296
this lovely couple in New York.

00:27:48.686 --> 00:27:51.026
And this is indicative of a lot

00:27:51.026 --> 00:27:52.406
of the photos we have in our

00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:53.406
personal libraries.

00:27:53.906 --> 00:27:56.016
It's a really sweet moment, but

00:27:56.016 --> 00:27:57.466
it suffers from a very

00:27:57.466 --> 00:27:59.636
unfortunate lighting situation.

00:28:00.236 --> 00:28:03.116
I'm going to use the ML Enhance

00:28:03.186 --> 00:28:05.806
again to immediately improve the

00:28:05.806 --> 00:28:08.216
image, but what I want to show

00:28:08.216 --> 00:28:09.596
you is what's happening behind

00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:10.306
the scenes.

00:28:11.196 --> 00:28:14.046
The Pixelmator team spent months

00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:16.866
training a custom Core ML model

00:28:16.866 --> 00:28:19.656
on over 20 million image pairs,

00:28:19.946 --> 00:28:21.906
and from that, they learned how

00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:24.156
to automatically control over 32

00:28:24.156 --> 00:28:25.876
different adjustments, from

00:28:25.876 --> 00:28:27.136
white balance, hue and

00:28:27.136 --> 00:28:29.426
saturation, lightness, color

00:28:29.426 --> 00:28:30.066
balance.

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:31.996
Understanding all these

00:28:31.996 --> 00:28:33.716
individual adjustments on your

00:28:33.716 --> 00:28:36.346
own can be very daunting, but

00:28:36.346 --> 00:28:37.816
with the ML Enhance feature,

00:28:38.026 --> 00:28:39.496
it's a perfect place to start.

00:28:39.626 --> 00:28:41.366
I can do something like simply

00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:43.006
bump the black point just a

00:28:43.006 --> 00:28:45.186
little bit more, and I think

00:28:45.186 --> 00:28:46.026
that looks great.

00:28:46.756 --> 00:28:48.406
I can deep-press on this photo

00:28:48.406 --> 00:28:50.136
to compare it, and I think

00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:51.486
you'll agree that's a much

00:28:51.786 --> 00:28:53.236
better version of this image.

00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:55.666
So that's just a very quick tour

00:28:56.696 --> 00:29:00.096
of the simplicity of Pixelmator

00:29:00.096 --> 00:29:00.686
Photo.

00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:04.746
By leveraging Metal and Core ML,

00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:06.076
the app is fast, and it's

00:29:06.076 --> 00:29:06.756
intelligent.

00:29:06.756 --> 00:29:09.336

00:29:09.336 --> 00:29:11.226

The Pixelmator Team is

00:30:48.706 --> 00:30:51.366
consistently in lockstep with

for its beautiful animation,

illustration, and creative

00:31:16.946 --> 00:31:18.736
approach to throwing a ball at a

00:31:18.736 --> 00:31:19.386
block.

00:31:19.896 --> 00:31:21.626
While you play, you learn basic

00:31:21.626 --> 00:31:24.126
physics and geometry with rhythm

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:24.636
and music.

00:31:25.546 --> 00:31:27.216

00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:28.906
key elements to helping you

your groove.

too, Paolo.

game with my son, Luca.

00:31:47.296 --> 00:31:48.236
It's his favorite game right

00:31:48.236 --> 00:31:50.226
now, and the reason for that is

00:31:50.266 --> 00:31:51.396
that the first time you launch

00:31:51.396 --> 00:31:53.026
ELOH, you realize that there is

00:31:53.026 --> 00:31:53.706
no onboarding.

00:31:54.006 --> 00:31:55.266
There are no instructions.

00:31:55.846 --> 00:31:58.026
Just like many great iOS games,

00:31:58.026 --> 00:31:59.766
you just learn by playing.

00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:01.766
Now, the goal of the game is to

00:32:01.766 --> 00:32:03.656
get the little ball that emits

00:32:03.656 --> 00:32:05.496
from this speaker down to the

00:32:05.496 --> 00:32:07.686
target, and you do that by --

00:32:07.686 --> 00:32:09.886
you achieve that by tapping on

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:12.566
these tribal masks, and moving

00:32:12.566 --> 00:32:14.436
them around the screen.

00:32:14.536 --> 00:32:14.866
Great.

00:32:15.076 --> 00:32:16.716
I think my reputation is saved.

00:32:16.716 --> 00:32:18.496
Level four is done.

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:20.746
Now, the game has 99 levels, and

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:23.256
as you would expect, things can

00:32:23.256 --> 00:32:25.486
get more complicated.

00:32:25.486 --> 00:32:28.546
Yet, the game still offers a

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.866
very relaxing experience, and I

00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:32.956
think the key component here is

00:32:32.956 --> 00:32:34.396
the sound effects, and the

00:32:34.396 --> 00:32:36.646
soundtrack, which complements

00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:39.916
the beautiful graphics and

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:41.076
delightful animations.

00:32:41.076 --> 00:32:43.006
And the other fun aspect is

00:32:43.006 --> 00:32:44.446
that, while you're playing,

00:32:44.636 --> 00:32:46.056
you're actually composing your

00:32:46.056 --> 00:32:47.646
very own soundtrack.

00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:48.216
Cool.

00:32:48.476 --> 00:32:52.736
Let's get through level 12.

00:32:52.926 --> 00:32:53.306
Great.

00:32:53.466 --> 00:32:54.906
Now, level 12 is special,

00:32:55.046 --> 00:32:57.116
because we get rewarded with a

00:32:57.116 --> 00:32:58.616
little totem animation.

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:00.826
What is also fun about this game

00:33:00.826 --> 00:33:02.346
is that there is no score.

00:33:02.346 --> 00:33:04.576
There is no -- there are no time

00:33:04.576 --> 00:33:05.196
constraints.

00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:08.436
Therefore, a little six-year-old

00:33:08.436 --> 00:33:10.506
kid can play without any time

00:33:10.506 --> 00:33:12.896
pressure, or fear of making

00:33:12.896 --> 00:33:13.696
mistakes.

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:17.446
ELOH is the result of a great

00:33:17.446 --> 00:33:19.046
team collaborating from across

00:33:19.116 --> 00:33:21.996

00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:21.086
I think it's super-fun, and

00:43:21.206 --> 00:43:23.236
super-compelling, with great

00:43:23.376 --> 00:43:25.326
game play and deep system

00:43:25.326 --> 00:43:26.006

00:43:26.766 --> 00:43:28.456
All right, to present our final

00:43:28.456 --> 00:43:29.836
award tonight, I'd like to

00:43:29.836 --> 00:43:32.476
introduce Doug Lemoine and Larry

00:43:43.386 --> 00:43:45.266
you don't need to be a big team

00:43:45.266 --> 00:43:46.986
to create an experience that's

00:43:47.036 --> 00:43:48.516
truly groundbreaking.

00:43:49.066 --> 00:43:51.096
>> It solves a new problem using

00:43:51.096 --> 00:43:52.796
powerful technology that's so

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.956
seamless, it's almost invisible.

00:43:55.736 --> 00:43:57.026
>> When Larry and I first saw

00:43:57.026 --> 00:43:58.706
this, I think we had the same

00:43:58.706 --> 00:43:59.206
reaction.

00:43:59.726 --> 00:44:00.876
This must be fake.

00:44:13.466 --> 00:44:14.616
>> All right, let's take a look.

00:44:15.456 --> 00:44:17.616
The core of the experience is a

00:44:17.616 --> 00:44:19.376
list of drills and workouts.

00:44:19.536 --> 00:44:21.256
These drills are super-easy to

00:44:21.256 --> 00:44:23.286
set up, and require no special

00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:27.256
equipment, unless you count this

00:44:28.356 --> 00:44:29.986
headband, which I carry

00:44:30.226 --> 00:44:30.686
everywhere.

00:44:31.466 --> 00:44:33.476
Let's do a dribbling drill.

00:44:34.706 --> 00:44:36.776
>> In this case, we're going to

00:44:36.776 --> 00:44:38.556
use a tripod, but it's just as

00:44:38.556 --> 00:44:40.676
common to use your iPhone popped

00:44:40.676 --> 00:44:42.346
up against a water bottle.

00:44:42.986 --> 00:44:44.276
>> So the drill will get started

00:44:44.276 --> 00:44:45.156
when I'm in the frame.

00:44:45.486 --> 00:44:48.826
>> The iPhone camera, Core ML,

00:44:48.826 --> 00:44:50.466
and Vision frameworks are doing

00:44:50.466 --> 00:44:52.456
all the work, not Doug.

00:44:52.946 --> 00:44:55.126
But to be fair, Doug is really

00:44:55.126 --> 00:44:57.186
good, but even non-experts can

00:44:57.186 --> 00:44:58.696
benefit from HomeCourt's ability

00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:00.006
to make them a better basketball

00:45:00.006 --> 00:45:00.276
player.

00:45:01.006 --> 00:45:02.476
Lower and faster dribbling will

00:45:02.476 --> 00:45:03.566
make you score more points.

00:45:03.916 --> 00:45:05.836
Faster, Doug, faster.

00:45:06.596 --> 00:45:07.186
Good job.

00:45:07.186 --> 00:45:09.396
>> So at the end of the drill, I

00:45:09.396 --> 00:45:10.666
get a nice little summary.

00:45:11.886 --> 00:45:13.136
>> And in addition to doing

00:45:13.136 --> 00:45:14.196
these dribbling workouts,

00:45:14.406 --> 00:45:15.816
HomeCourt is also great for

00:45:15.816 --> 00:45:17.206
tracking shooting drills.

00:45:17.526 --> 00:45:18.876
In fact, you can see up here on

00:45:18.876 --> 00:45:20.536
the screen, it has tracked your

00:45:20.536 --> 00:45:22.276
makes and your misses, as well

00:45:22.276 --> 00:45:23.816
as where you shot the ball from.

00:45:24.196 --> 00:45:25.816
In fact, it also gives you this

00:45:25.816 --> 00:45:27.066
nice video where you can see

00:45:27.066 --> 00:45:28.716
your shots, and where you took

00:45:28.716 --> 00:45:29.376
them from.

00:45:29.986 --> 00:45:32.116
You know, Doug, this is really

00:45:32.116 --> 00:45:32.866
revolutionary.

00:45:33.376 --> 00:45:34.776
>> It's true, Larry [laughter].

00:45:35.946 --> 00:45:37.686
Before HomeCourt, you would have

00:45:37.686 --> 00:45:39.056
to do this stuff manually.

00:45:39.056 --> 00:45:41.176
You'd have to have someone track

00:45:41.176 --> 00:45:41.726
it for you.

00:45:42.276 --> 00:45:43.306
>> Absolutely.

00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:45.356
And today, you see kids, and

00:45:45.356 --> 00:45:47.636
even adults, using HomeCourt to

00:45:47.636 --> 00:45:48.456
improve their skills.

00:45:49.136 --> 00:45:50.346
>> So when you finish a drill,

00:45:50.346 --> 00:45:51.476
you can actually share your

00:45:51.476 --> 00:45:52.846
results with your friends, your

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.646

00:45:57.886 --> 00:46:00.246
basketball is way more fun when
