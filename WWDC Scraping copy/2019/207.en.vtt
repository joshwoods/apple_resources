[ Applause ]

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:20.496
>> Hi. I'm Danny Mandel.

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:22.166
And welcome to Introducing

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:23.386
SiriKit Media Intents.

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.946
We've added media domain support

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:27.806
to SiriKit for audio use cases

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:29.986
and we're super excited to tell

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.366
you all about it.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:34.096
So what are we going to cover in

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:34.556
this session?

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:36.836
The first thing we'll do is

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.816
introduce the new SiriKit Media

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.456
Intents and talk about their

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.026
capabilities.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:43.796
Then we'll talk about what's

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:45.286
required for you to handle

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:46.616
SiriKit Media requests on your

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:47.376
app.

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:49.496
And finally, we'll talk about

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:50.726
some best practices you're going

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:52.466
to want to follow to provide the

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.126
best user experience possible

00:00:54.446 --> 00:00:55.646
when you add SiriKit Media

00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:57.326
Support to your app.

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:01.386
This year, we're allowing you to

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:03.966
control audio in a whole new way

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.536
with SiriKit Media Intents.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.276
And we think people are going to

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.856
love using the Siri Media

00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:10.226
capabilities you build into your

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:10.626
apps.

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:12.796
With SiriKit Media Intents,

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.506
people will be able to do things

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:17.226
like play audio, update taste

00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:19.216
profiles, add to collections,

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:20.236
and search.

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:22.276
This means that they'll be able

00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:24.366
to use the rich natural language

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.136
processing capabilities of Siri

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:28.996
to say things like "Play Khalid

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:31.386
on my app," to immediately begin

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:35.286
playing Khalid in your app.

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:37.946
Let's take a look at the new

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:39.746
SiriKit Media Intents and their

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:40.436
capabilities.

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:44.486
There are four SiriKit Media

00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:44.876
Intents.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:46.816
The first intent is

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:48.006
INPlayMediaIntent.

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:51.056
INPlayMediaIntent allows people

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:52.516
to play audio by saying

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.676
something like "Play Outer Peace

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:55.746
in my app."

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:58.346
Now, you might remember that we

00:01:58.346 --> 00:01:59.816
launched Media Playback Support

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:01.746
in IOS 12 with Shortcuts.

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:03.696
And this year, we're adding

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:04.826
SiriKit features to

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.206
INPlayMediaIntent.

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:09.765
The next intent is

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:10.946
INAddMediaIntent.

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:14.046
INAddMediaIntent allows people

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:16.146
to add items to their playlists

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:16.926
and libraries.

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:20.376
An example of this could be "add

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.676
this song to my road trip

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:24.486
playlist in my app."

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:25.526
We have

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:27.636
INUpdateMediaAffinityIntent,

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:29.096
which allows people to express

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:30.456
affinity for media items.

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:32.746
People can say this by saying

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:34.456
something as simple as "I like

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:34.916
this song."

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:38.186
And finally, we have

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:40.416
INSearchForMediaIntent, which

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.746
lets people search your app for

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:43.156
a particular media item.

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:46.156
For example, "Find Billie Eilish

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:48.886
in my app."

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:51.076
Let's talk about the supported

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:52.496
media types in SiriKit Media.

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:54.906
SiriKit Media supports a number

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:56.206
of different audio types, with

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:57.276
the first one being music.

00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:00.066
And music support is going to

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:01.636
let you say things like "Play

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:03.246
the song Awesome Song in my

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:03.486
app."

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.296
In addition to songs, we have

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.696
support for albums, artists,

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:09.756
playlists, genres, and many

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:09.956
more.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.926
So you're going to want to check

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:13.236
out the documentation for

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:14.956
INMediaSearch to get the full

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:16.386
list of supported search terms.

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.506
And we want you to adopt as many

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:20.386
of them as possible to provide

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:22.286
the best Siri user experience in

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:23.256
your app.

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:24.976
Additionally, we have playback

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:27.406
controls, like shuffle, repeat,

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:28.256
and playback queues.

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:30.566
And this lets people say things

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:32.246
like "Play Khalid shuffle in my

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.926
app," or, "Play Outer Peace next

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:35.646
in my app."

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:40.386
The next supported audio type is

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:40.916
Podcasts.

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:42.826
People can begin playing

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:44.026
podcasts by saying something

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:45.416
like "Put on the Stuff You

00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:46.806
Should Know podcast for my app."

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:49.626
Additionally, people can also

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:51.076
control the playback order and

00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:53.106
speeds of podcast episodes.

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:55.266
This lets people say something

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:56.916
like "Play the newest episode of

00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:58.246
Stuff You Should Know podcast in

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.286
my app," or, "Play the Stuff You

00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:01.836
Should Know podcast in my app at

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:02.456
double speed."

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.046
Moving on, we have audiobook

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:07.546
support.

00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:09.846
This lets people say things like

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:11.646
"Play the audiobook Becoming in

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:11.986
my app."

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:14.536
And like Podcasts, people can

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:16.005
begin to playback at a specific

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.065
speed when asking to play

00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:17.516
audiobooks.

00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:20.616
And finally, we have radio

00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:20.966
support.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.536
Radio support allows people to

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:25.346
ask for a specific radio station

00:04:25.346 --> 00:04:26.556
in your Radio Playback app.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:29.796
For example, "Play 89.1 FM in my

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:29.956
app."

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:33.956
And don't worry if your app

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:35.006
doesn't fall into one of the

00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:36.586
previous media types, you can

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:37.996
still adopt the SiriKit Media

00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.826
Intent and get the full power.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:41.706
People will be able to say

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:43.456
things like "Play search term in

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:44.886
my app," and you'll be able to

00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:45.986
look up search term in your app

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:46.636
and play it.

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:48.796
The only thing that will be

00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:49.986
missing will be support for

00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:51.216
strongly parsed media types.

00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:52.976
So say you had a nature sounds

00:04:52.976 --> 00:04:55.356
app and you said "Play reptile

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:57.296
sounds in my app," or, "Play

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.426
mammal sounds in my app," Siri

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:00.326
is not going to know that those

00:05:00.326 --> 00:05:01.196
are two different types of

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:01.796
animal sounds.

00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:04.306
So you'd get a string of mammal

00:05:04.306 --> 00:05:07.716
sounds or reptile sounds, and

00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:09.066
you could look it up and play

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:09.166
it.

00:05:09.306 --> 00:05:10.856
So not quite as structured as

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:12.396
the other types but still

00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:15.026
supported.

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:17.456
Let's look at how we handle

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.106
these intents in SiriKit.

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:23.666
So the first thing to know about

00:05:24.076 --> 00:05:25.336
how to request with SiriKit

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:26.936
Media is that SiriKit Media

00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:28.436
Intents are just like any other

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:29.156
SiriKit domain.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:31.486
So all the intent-handling

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:32.906
happens in your Intents app

00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:35.136
extension, where you conform to

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:36.266
the SiriKit Media Intent

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:36.966
handling protocols.

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:39.626
The details of SiriKit request

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:40.516
handling have been covered

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:42.326
really well in previous WWDC

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:44.086
talks, so I'd refer you to those

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:45.906
talks and to the developer

00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:47.616
documentation online for more

00:05:47.616 --> 00:05:49.596
general details about SiriKit

00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:50.276
Request Processing.

00:05:53.196 --> 00:05:54.846
Now let's look at what happens

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:56.516
for a typical request in the

00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:57.546
SiriKit Media domain.

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:00.236
The request processing begins

00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:01.886
when someone says "Play cool

00:06:01.886 --> 00:06:02.826
song in my app."

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:04.726
And Siri is going to recognize

00:06:04.726 --> 00:06:05.796
that this is a request for your

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:07.146
app, it's going to launch your

00:06:07.146 --> 00:06:07.906
Intents Extension.

00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:09.906
Now, there are three steps in

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:11.116
SiriKit Request Processing:

00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:13.456
resolve, confirm, and handle.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.856
The first step in request

00:06:16.856 --> 00:06:18.206
processing is the resolve step.

00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:20.666
In the media domain, the resolve

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:21.886
step is where we take the

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:24.086
intents' INMediaSearch object

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.306
and we run a search against our

00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:26.966
app catalog.

00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:29.406
The output of resolve is one or

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:31.436
more concrete media item objects

00:06:31.436 --> 00:06:31.756
to play.

00:06:33.056 --> 00:06:34.696
Alternatively, if we didn't find

00:06:34.696 --> 00:06:36.526
anything that matched or another

00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:38.276
error occurred, we can return an

00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:39.986
unsupported result, which will

00:06:39.986 --> 00:06:41.346
tell Siri to display the

00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:44.776
appropriate error dialog.

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:46.306
The next step in Request

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:47.576
Processing is the confirm step.

00:06:48.706 --> 00:06:50.426
And typically, we discourage use

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:51.646
of the confirm step in the Media

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:51.926
domain.

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:54.156
In looking at usage in our own

00:06:54.156 --> 00:06:56.516
apps, we find that using confirm

00:06:57.136 --> 00:06:58.526
actually lowers the likelihood

00:06:58.526 --> 00:06:59.866
that people will continue on to

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:00.376
play media.

00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:01.926
So we don't recommend using the

00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:03.156
confirm step in the Media

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:03.456
domain.

00:07:04.076 --> 00:07:06.976
The final step in Request

00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:09.066
Processing is the handle step.

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:11.716
Now, for INPlayMediaIntent, this

00:07:11.716 --> 00:07:12.776
ends up being really simple,

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:13.996
because we're going to return

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:15.766
the response code "handle an

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:17.256
app," which is going to do a

00:07:17.256 --> 00:07:18.456
background app launch.

00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:23.076
And inside of our background app

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.116
launch, we're just going to play

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:26.846
media like we normally do in our

00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:26.973
app.

00:07:26.973 --> 00:07:29.106
The only tricky part here is

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:29.446
testing.

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:30.566
You're going to want to make

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:31.676
sure everything plays because

00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:32.466
there's not going to be any UI

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:33.146
on screen.

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.106
You're also going to want to

00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:35.506
make sure that you test in a

00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:36.746
variety of situations.

00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:39.576
For example, in CarPlay or when

00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:40.336
you're wearing headphones.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:41.766
So now that we've seen an

00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:43.526
overview of SiriKit Request

00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:45.386
Processing, let's take a look at

00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:46.826
a simplified resolve media items

00:07:46.826 --> 00:07:47.106
method.

00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:48.986
And the first thing to note is

00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:50.366
that the parameters are going to

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:52.166
be slightly different but the

00:07:52.216 --> 00:07:53.636
same resolve logic is going to

00:07:53.636 --> 00:07:55.286
be the same for all four media

00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:55.776
intents.

00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:58.406
Resolve's job is to search the

00:07:58.406 --> 00:07:59.086
app catalog.

00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:00.296
And you're going to want to do

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:01.516
it the same way for all four

00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:02.676
intents.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:06.126
So we'll initialize a result to

00:08:06.126 --> 00:08:07.056
the unsupported result.

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:08.676
And this is going to tell Siri

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:09.726
to say the appropriate error

00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:11.566
dialogue if we don't find

00:08:11.566 --> 00:08:14.536
anything in our app catalog.

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:16.976
INMediaSearch is the intent

00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:18.426
field that contains the details

00:08:18.426 --> 00:08:19.466
about what the user asks to

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:19.666
play.

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:22.166
INMediaSearch represents the

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:23.216
universe of all the

00:08:23.216 --> 00:08:24.666
audio-related queries that Siri

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:25.206
supports.

00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:27.716
Our job in Resolve is to go from

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.006
that universe of possibilities

00:08:29.536 --> 00:08:30.716
to a single item to play.

00:08:31.626 --> 00:08:33.246
And in this example, the first

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:34.946
thing we're going to do is read

00:08:34.946 --> 00:08:36.236
the media name off the

00:08:36.236 --> 00:08:37.166
INMediaSearch.

00:08:39.376 --> 00:08:40.926
Then we're going to retrieve a

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:42.246
list of items from our app

00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:42.716
catalog.

00:08:43.676 --> 00:08:46.436
And we're going to use the media

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:47.496
name property off the media

00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:48.906
search to compare against the

00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:50.786
item's name property.

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:53.956
And we'll talk a little bit more

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:55.346
about this later on, but this

00:08:55.386 --> 00:08:56.276
isn't really something you're

00:08:56.276 --> 00:08:57.416
going to want to do in your

00:08:57.416 --> 00:08:58.906
shipping app.

00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:02.346
But if we had an exact match on

00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:04.326
the name, we found the item to

00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:05.996
play, and we're going to create

00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:07.796
a success result using that

00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:08.506
item's properties.

00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:11.996
Then we'll call a completion

00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:13.826
handler and move on to handle.

00:09:14.326 --> 00:09:17.386
And in this case, as we said

00:09:17.386 --> 00:09:19.196
before, handle ends up being

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:20.786
very short, since all we're

00:09:20.786 --> 00:09:21.996
going to do is return the

00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:23.726
handleInApp success response

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:23.996
code.

00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:25.586
And this is going to start the

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:26.746
process of background launching

00:09:26.746 --> 00:09:27.116
our app.

00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:29.396
Now let's take a look at

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:30.376
background app launch.

00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:33.666
The method that we implement in

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:35.546
our app delegate to support

00:09:35.596 --> 00:09:36.886
background app launch is

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.886
application handling intent

00:09:39.216 --> 00:09:39.856
completion handler.

00:09:41.846 --> 00:09:43.306
Again, this is a pretty short

00:09:43.306 --> 00:09:44.026
implementation.

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:47.416
We're going to read the first

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:48.966
media item to play out of the

00:09:48.966 --> 00:09:51.796
intent and then we're going to

00:09:51.796 --> 00:09:53.216
just play it in our app the way

00:09:53.216 --> 00:09:53.836
we normally do.

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.256
And finally, we'll call the

00:09:57.256 --> 00:09:58.886
completion handler with our

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:00.786
success response code.

00:10:01.856 --> 00:10:03.446
So now that we've seen the new

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:04.786
intents and how they all fit

00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:06.526
together, let's hand it over to

00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:08.286
Ryan Klems, who's going to show

00:10:08.286 --> 00:10:09.906
us how this all works in a real

00:10:10.096 --> 00:10:10.166
app.

00:10:11.516 --> 00:10:17.216
[ Applause ]

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:18.346
>> Thanks, Danny.

00:10:20.816 --> 00:10:22.066
Adding SiriKit Media Intent

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:23.216
handling to your existing media

00:10:23.216 --> 00:10:24.196
application is easy.

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:25.536
Here we have our music

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:26.846
application and all we need to

00:10:26.846 --> 00:10:29.176
do to add Siri support is to add

00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:30.636
the Siri extension target, add a

00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:33.496
few methods, and then we'll up

00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:34.816
and handling Siri requests in no

00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:35.086
time.

00:10:36.056 --> 00:10:36.966
To add to the intent's

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:38.176
extension, all we have to do is

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:41.226
go to file, new, target, select

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:45.326
the intents extension and click

00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:45.796
next.

00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:50.896
Give it a name and then click

00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:51.336
finish.

00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:55.396
It will go ahead and create our

00:10:55.396 --> 00:10:56.516
intent handler for us.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.486
We'll want to go ahead and add

00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:01.196
the Siri capability to our

00:11:01.196 --> 00:11:01.836
application.

00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:07.166
And then we'll come over to our

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.896
control extension and we will

00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:12.406
add our intents that we support,

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:13.456
and in this example, we'll just

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:14.736
go ahead and support the

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:19.266
INPlayMediaIntent and the

00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:20.406
INAddMediaIntent.

00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:27.836
We'll go ahead and select the

00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:28.656
music type.

00:11:30.646 --> 00:11:31.896
We have a few methods here that

00:11:31.896 --> 00:11:33.406
we want to add to make sure that

00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:34.836
we build in our extension.

00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:41.666
And we'll want to make sure to

00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:44.976
turn on our proper code signing.

00:11:46.156 --> 00:11:47.396
Now we'll come over to our

00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:49.496
intent handler and all we need

00:11:49.496 --> 00:11:51.086
to do is add support for the

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.516
INPlayMediaIntent handling

00:11:52.516 --> 00:11:53.016
protocol.

00:11:53.716 --> 00:11:57.636
And then we'll drop in some

00:11:57.636 --> 00:12:01.526
stubs for our resolve and handle

00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:03.196
methods.

00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:06.436
For this beginning example,

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:07.436
we're just going to return the

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:10.566
unsupported result from resolve

00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:11.856
media items, which will cause

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.096
Siri to speak to the fact that

00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:14.256
it couldn't find the item.

00:12:15.096 --> 00:12:16.296
So we'll go ahead and try that

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:16.506
out.

00:12:16.846 --> 00:12:17.536
This is what that would've

00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:17.936
looked like.

00:12:28.096 --> 00:12:30.376
So Siri speaks to the fact that

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:32.446
it couldn't find the item due to

00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:33.326
the fact that we returned the

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:35.656
unsupported from the intent

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:35.936
handler.

00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:39.286
So what we'll do now is we'll go

00:12:39.286 --> 00:12:41.326
ahead and hook this up to our

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:42.766
existing search implementation.

00:12:48.056 --> 00:12:50.456
And in this case, the first

00:12:50.456 --> 00:12:51.076
thing that we're going to want

00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:52.496
to do is determine what the user

00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:53.206
is searching for.

00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:55.096
So for this simple example,

00:12:55.096 --> 00:12:57.136
we'll just search for an artist.

00:12:57.846 --> 00:13:03.046
And in the method, we'll go

00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:06.106
ahead and resolve the media

00:13:06.106 --> 00:13:06.476
item.

00:13:24.046 --> 00:13:25.146
And once we resolve the media

00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:27.196
item, then we will return to our

00:13:27.196 --> 00:13:28.966
handle method and we're just

00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:30.456
going to return the handleInApp

00:13:31.236 --> 00:13:33.176
method response code, which will

00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:34.656
cause us to background launch

00:13:34.656 --> 00:13:35.346
the application.

00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:36.326
So in order to do that, we'll

00:13:36.326 --> 00:13:37.566
switch over to our app delegate

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:41.176
and we need to add the handle

00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:41.866
intent method.

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:43.796
And this will just extract the

00:13:43.796 --> 00:13:45.806
INMediaItem that we passed, that

00:13:45.806 --> 00:13:46.886
we resolved, in the previous

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:48.796
step, and pass that to playback.

00:13:49.506 --> 00:13:51.656
And so we'll go ahead and play

00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:53.506
what that would look like.

00:13:59.456 --> 00:14:00.766
So you can see, we return the

00:14:00.896 --> 00:14:02.896
INMediaItem and it has resolved

00:14:02.896 --> 00:14:04.706
that, handed it back to the

00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:06.456
application, and begun playback.

00:14:07.436 --> 00:14:08.486
So now that we've done that, why

00:14:08.486 --> 00:14:09.476
don't we go ahead and add

00:14:09.476 --> 00:14:12.696
support for the add method.

00:14:12.756 --> 00:14:14.436
So to do that, we'll just extend

00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:16.446
this by adding the

00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:17.776
INAddMediaIntent handling

00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:18.256
protocol.

00:14:22.836 --> 00:14:25.146
And then we'll add our methods

00:14:25.186 --> 00:14:27.706
for resolving and handling for

00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:28.356
the add method.

00:14:29.316 --> 00:14:30.166
So you notice here that the

00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:31.636
resolve media items for add

00:14:31.636 --> 00:14:33.646
looks pretty much identical to

00:14:33.646 --> 00:14:35.066
the resolve method for play.

00:14:36.966 --> 00:14:38.456
Additionally, now for ad, we'll

00:14:38.456 --> 00:14:39.706
also have a resolve media

00:14:39.706 --> 00:14:40.456
destination.

00:14:40.536 --> 00:14:41.316
And this is where we're going to

00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:42.166
determine whether the user's

00:14:42.166 --> 00:14:43.396
trying to add to the library or

00:14:43.396 --> 00:14:44.196
to a playlist.

00:14:45.186 --> 00:14:46.316
And in the case of a playlist,

00:14:46.316 --> 00:14:47.126
you might want to do something

00:14:47.126 --> 00:14:49.246
like "Return playlist name not

00:14:49.246 --> 00:14:51.526
found," if the playlist that the

00:14:51.526 --> 00:14:53.236
user specified was not present

00:14:53.236 --> 00:14:53.966
in their library.

00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:59.136
And also, what's different in

00:14:59.196 --> 00:15:00.716
the ad is there's no reason to

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:02.196
go back to the application like

00:15:02.306 --> 00:15:03.816
to begin playback like we do in

00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:04.866
the Play Media Intent.

00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:06.476
So in this case what we would do

00:15:06.476 --> 00:15:07.336
is we would actually handle

00:15:07.396 --> 00:15:08.746
everything in the extension

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:09.146
itself.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:11.756
So we have the resolved media

00:15:11.756 --> 00:15:12.786
item, and we'll just go ahead

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:15.646
and use our applications methods

00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:16.966
to add to the library or to the

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:17.566
playlist.

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:18.766
And in this case, we're just

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:19.896
going to use the media player

00:15:19.896 --> 00:15:21.366
utilities to add to it.

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:23.226
So let's go ahead and take a

00:15:23.226 --> 00:15:24.026
look at what that would look

00:15:24.076 --> 00:15:24.246
like.

00:15:37.316 --> 00:15:38.546
So it speaks to the item that is

00:15:38.546 --> 00:15:39.976
added to the playlist as well as

00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:41.076
the playlist name, because those

00:15:41.076 --> 00:15:43.426
are specified in the request.

00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:45.846
So as you can see, it's

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.376
relatively easy to add support

00:15:47.376 --> 00:15:48.236
to your application.

00:15:48.236 --> 00:15:49.186
And we really look forward to

00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:50.606
seeing what you do in your

00:15:50.606 --> 00:15:51.156
application.

00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:51.626
Thank you.

00:15:52.016 --> 00:15:53.586
[ Applause ]

00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:54.246
Danny, back to you.

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:58.356
>> Thanks, Ryan.

00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:00.216
So what did Ryan show us?

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.306
First, he showed us how to add

00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:03.776
our intents extension to our

00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:04.596
app.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.536
Then he showed us how to specify

00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:08.066
our supported intents and

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:09.076
supported media types.

00:16:09.486 --> 00:16:11.106
And finally, he showed us how to

00:16:11.106 --> 00:16:13.676
implement resolve and handle for

00:16:13.676 --> 00:16:15.486
INPlayMediaIntent and

00:16:15.486 --> 00:16:17.416
INAddMediaIntent so we could

00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:19.646
immediately begin playing and

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:22.286
adding media using Siri.

00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:25.036
So let's look at some best

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:26.106
practices you're going to want

00:16:26.106 --> 00:16:27.936
to follow when you adopt SiriKit

00:16:27.936 --> 00:16:28.246
Media.

00:16:28.866 --> 00:16:31.686
We have great news if you've

00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:33.036
already implemented shortcut

00:16:33.036 --> 00:16:34.326
support for media playback.

00:16:35.116 --> 00:16:36.966
SiriKit Media uses the same code

00:16:37.056 --> 00:16:38.596
and handle and for background

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:39.106
app launch.

00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:41.916
While Shortcuts operates on

00:16:41.916 --> 00:16:43.656
previously donated intents which

00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:45.206
don't require intent resolution,

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:47.626
SiriKit does require a resolve

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:47.896
step.

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:49.416
So the two things you're going

00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:51.516
to need to add are your resolve

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:52.976
method and your intent handler,

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:54.226
and you're going to need to

00:16:54.226 --> 00:16:55.696
update your intents extension

00:16:55.696 --> 00:16:57.286
supported media types in Xcode

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.556
so Siri knows what content types

00:16:59.556 --> 00:17:00.286
your app supports.

00:17:01.516 --> 00:17:03.256
The extensions handle method

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.396
should be the same between both

00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:05.876
implementations and the

00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:08.205
background app launch to the app

00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:10.016
delegate's handle intent can be

00:17:10.016 --> 00:17:11.766
the same, as long as you use the

00:17:11.806 --> 00:17:13.705
same identifiers for your media

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:14.036
items.

00:17:14.036 --> 00:17:17.096
So let's see what this looks

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:17.415
like.

00:17:17.756 --> 00:17:18.695
Here's our Shortcuts

00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:19.915
implementation from last year.

00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:21.406
You'll notice that there's no

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:22.516
resolve method, but the rest of

00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:22.976
it's the same.

00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:25.056
So to go from Shortcuts to

00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:27.546
SiriKit, we just add in our

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.016
resolve method and we're good to

00:17:31.396 --> 00:17:31.476
go.

00:17:31.726 --> 00:17:32.926
Now let's talk about what you

00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:34.096
need to do to bring SiriKit

00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:37.656
Media Support to the Apple

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:37.906
Watch.

00:17:37.906 --> 00:17:39.186
On watchOS, apps launch in the

00:17:39.186 --> 00:17:39.696
foreground.

00:17:40.086 --> 00:17:41.376
And the way you do that is by

00:17:41.376 --> 00:17:44.516
returning INPlayMediaIntent

00:17:44.516 --> 00:17:46.636
response code continueInApp from

00:17:46.906 --> 00:17:47.906
your handle method in your

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:48.686
intent's extension.

00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:51.246
This code is going to do a

00:17:51.246 --> 00:17:52.776
foreground app launch and

00:17:52.776 --> 00:17:53.906
forward the intent to your

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.386
WKExtension delegate in your

00:17:55.456 --> 00:17:55.546
app.

00:17:55.546 --> 00:17:59.486
You'll note that the apps handle

00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:00.676
method looks pretty similar to

00:18:00.676 --> 00:18:01.526
the one in iOS.

00:18:02.186 --> 00:18:03.596
The method signature is slightly

00:18:03.596 --> 00:18:05.006
different, but you're going to

00:18:05.006 --> 00:18:06.616
want to read the intent off the

00:18:06.616 --> 00:18:08.616
NSUser activities interaction

00:18:08.616 --> 00:18:09.066
property.

00:18:09.316 --> 00:18:11.256
And then, just like on iOS, you

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.376
read the media item to play and

00:18:13.376 --> 00:18:15.406
start playback in your app.

00:18:16.516 --> 00:18:17.696
One word of caution.

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.136
You're going to want to use the

00:18:19.136 --> 00:18:21.266
on-device cache in your resolve

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.436
method on watchOS.

00:18:22.746 --> 00:18:24.446
Only go over the network if it's

00:18:24.546 --> 00:18:25.626
absolutely necessary.

00:18:26.446 --> 00:18:29.676
So we know that when someone

00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:31.876
says "Play Awesome Song in my

00:18:31.876 --> 00:18:33.926
app," the first step in Request

00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:35.566
Processing is to resolve the

00:18:35.566 --> 00:18:36.476
media items to play.

00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:38.506
And we looked at a previous

00:18:38.506 --> 00:18:40.276
implementation where we checked

00:18:40.276 --> 00:18:41.336
the value of the media item's

00:18:41.376 --> 00:18:43.356
name against the intent's media

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:43.996
name property.

00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:46.796
And it was an exact match.

00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:49.076
So what are some edge cases that

00:18:49.076 --> 00:18:50.066
we didn't cover in that

00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:50.786
implementation?

00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:53.786
The first place that our

00:18:53.786 --> 00:18:54.856
previous method won't do the

00:18:54.856 --> 00:18:56.206
right thing is if we have a

00:18:56.206 --> 00:18:58.036
mismatch on either case or

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:58.616
punctuation.

00:18:59.376 --> 00:19:01.426
So in this example, "Play hello

00:19:01.426 --> 00:19:02.896
in my app," we can see a few

00:19:02.896 --> 00:19:04.066
cases where exact string

00:19:04.066 --> 00:19:05.096
comparison will fail.

00:19:06.296 --> 00:19:07.666
The exact song title is

00:19:07.876 --> 00:19:09.206
uppercase HELLO with an

00:19:09.206 --> 00:19:09.986
exclamation point.

00:19:10.606 --> 00:19:11.856
But it's possible that the Siri

00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:13.096
speech engine could give us

00:19:13.296 --> 00:19:14.076
lowercase hello.

00:19:14.726 --> 00:19:16.026
Or maybe it gives us uppercase

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:17.246
HELLO without the exclamation

00:19:17.246 --> 00:19:17.496
point.

00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:19.806
So it's really important that we

00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.916
ignore case and punctuation in

00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:23.426
our resolve method.

00:19:25.476 --> 00:19:27.736
Similarly, a lot of music

00:19:27.736 --> 00:19:28.876
entities have things in the

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.686
title that people either won't

00:19:30.726 --> 00:19:33.026
say or they're going to say in a

00:19:33.026 --> 00:19:34.826
way that doesn't exactly match

00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:35.706
with the item's title.

00:19:36.556 --> 00:19:37.726
For instance, a lot of albums

00:19:37.816 --> 00:19:39.116
come in a deluxe edition

00:19:39.116 --> 00:19:39.536
variant.

00:19:39.886 --> 00:19:41.086
And people aren't going to say

00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:42.606
this when they ask to play the

00:19:42.606 --> 00:19:42.986
album.

00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:45.846
They aren't going to say "Play

00:19:45.846 --> 00:19:47.226
the album Outer Peace deluxe

00:19:47.226 --> 00:19:48.846
edition in my app," they'll say

00:19:48.846 --> 00:19:50.196
"Play the album Outer Peace in

00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:50.566
my app."

00:19:51.986 --> 00:19:53.086
And soundtracks are another

00:19:53.086 --> 00:19:53.506
example.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.596
People aren't going to say --

00:19:55.596 --> 00:19:57.006
they'll say "Play the Rocket Man

00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:58.016
soundtrack in my app."

00:19:58.836 --> 00:19:59.836
And they aren't going to say

00:19:59.836 --> 00:20:01.046
"Music from the motion picture."

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:03.786
And finally, a lot of hip-hop

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.376
songs have this featuring

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:06.546
abbreviation in their title.

00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:09.966
So people either won't say it or

00:20:09.966 --> 00:20:10.696
they'll say the word

00:20:10.696 --> 00:20:11.166
"featuring."

00:20:11.346 --> 00:20:12.706
So exact match isn't going to

00:20:12.706 --> 00:20:13.666
work here either.

00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.756
And podcasts also have some

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:23.036
cases where there is a mismatch

00:20:23.296 --> 00:20:25.076
between what people say and what

00:20:25.076 --> 00:20:26.126
entity titles are.

00:20:27.106 --> 00:20:29.116
So some podcasts have the word

00:20:29.116 --> 00:20:30.156
"podcast" in their title.

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:32.616
So if someone said "Play the

00:20:32.686 --> 00:20:34.246
Stuff You Should Know podcast in

00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:36.706
my app," Siri could parse it as

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:39.316
stuff you should know in a media

00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:40.836
item type of podcast.

00:20:41.436 --> 00:20:42.976
So an exact match isn't going to

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:43.806
work here either.

00:20:44.726 --> 00:20:46.696
And additionally, some podcasts

00:20:46.806 --> 00:20:49.326
come in audio or video variants,

00:20:49.326 --> 00:20:50.676
and that audio or video word

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:51.726
appears in the title.

00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:54.376
But SiriKit Media implies the

00:20:54.376 --> 00:20:56.426
audio variety, so people aren't

00:20:56.426 --> 00:20:59.716
going to say that either.

00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:01.076
Finally, remember that you're

00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:01.866
working with a speech

00:21:01.866 --> 00:21:03.756
recognizer, and the speech

00:21:03.756 --> 00:21:05.566
recognizer can come with word

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:06.586
formatting variations.

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:08.166
So if someone asks to play the

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.106
song 81st, you can get the

00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:12.286
number 81 st or you can get the

00:21:12.326 --> 00:21:13.796
hyphenated eighty-first.

00:21:15.286 --> 00:21:16.416
Or if someone asks to play the

00:21:16.416 --> 00:21:17.866
song I Love You Son, you could

00:21:17.866 --> 00:21:19.786
get sun or son.

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:23.116
Now, Siri is going to do the

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:25.056
best job it can to give you the

00:21:25.056 --> 00:21:26.386
entity titles for the things

00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:27.086
that it knows about.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:30.496
But it's better for you to be

00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:33.546
flexible in your resolve method.

00:21:35.096 --> 00:21:38.136
When you implement your SiriKit

00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:39.846
Media Support, you control what

00:21:39.846 --> 00:21:42.246
Siri says by the INMediaItem

00:21:42.246 --> 00:21:43.446
objects you return from your

00:21:43.446 --> 00:21:44.046
resolve method.

00:21:44.976 --> 00:21:46.906
As you can see here, the user

00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:48.106
asks to play the song Maybe

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:49.986
Sometime by Special Disaster

00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:51.436
team in Control Audio.

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.856
And Siri said, "Here's Maybe

00:21:53.856 --> 00:21:55.536
Sometime by Special Disaster

00:21:55.536 --> 00:21:57.146
Team from Control Audio."

00:21:57.896 --> 00:22:00.316
In this case the returned

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:02.826
INMediaItem had a title property

00:22:02.826 --> 00:22:04.756
of Maybe Sometime and an artist

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.226
property of Special Disaster

00:22:06.226 --> 00:22:06.416
team.

00:22:07.306 --> 00:22:08.966
So make sure you always populate

00:22:09.486 --> 00:22:12.216
title, artist, and type in the

00:22:12.216 --> 00:22:13.946
returned media items, as these

00:22:13.976 --> 00:22:15.586
can all influence what Siri

00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:15.866
says.

00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:18.396
And one thing to note, if you

00:22:18.396 --> 00:22:19.686
return more than one item in

00:22:19.686 --> 00:22:21.226
your resolve method, Siri is

00:22:21.226 --> 00:22:22.376
going to speak to the first item

00:22:22.376 --> 00:22:23.506
in the list.

00:22:25.146 --> 00:22:26.966
It's super important that you

00:22:27.046 --> 00:22:28.596
handle error cases appropriately

00:22:28.596 --> 00:22:29.426
in SiriKit Media.

00:22:30.456 --> 00:22:31.426
When you're interacting with an

00:22:31.426 --> 00:22:32.926
intelligent assistant like Siri,

00:22:32.926 --> 00:22:34.996
it can be unclear why something

00:22:34.996 --> 00:22:35.946
happened when it happened.

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:37.586
And handling error cases

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:39.036
appropriately is going to allow

00:22:39.036 --> 00:22:40.506
you to give the user the best

00:22:40.506 --> 00:22:41.476
idea of what happened when

00:22:41.476 --> 00:22:42.186
something goes wrong.

00:22:43.136 --> 00:22:44.576
So the most common case you're

00:22:44.576 --> 00:22:45.906
going to run into is when you

00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.116
don't find something in your app

00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:48.136
catalog that someone's asked

00:22:48.136 --> 00:22:48.356
for.

00:22:48.476 --> 00:22:50.776
And you handle this case by just

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:52.006
returning the unsupported

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:53.626
resolution result from resolve

00:22:53.626 --> 00:22:54.186
media items.

00:22:55.236 --> 00:22:56.016
But there's a lot of other

00:22:56.016 --> 00:22:57.686
errors that could happen.

00:22:57.686 --> 00:22:58.676
Maybe someone asks to play

00:22:58.736 --> 00:23:00.416
something that requires cellular

00:23:00.416 --> 00:23:02.026
data but they have the cellular

00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:03.216
data switch turned off for your

00:23:04.186 --> 00:23:04.276
app.

00:23:04.696 --> 00:23:06.206
Or maybe they ask to play

00:23:06.206 --> 00:23:07.306
something that requires a

00:23:07.306 --> 00:23:08.836
subscription and they don't have

00:23:08.836 --> 00:23:09.016
one.

00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:11.426
The full list is in

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.986
INPlayMediaMediaItem

00:23:12.986 --> 00:23:13.826
UnsupportedReason.

00:23:14.216 --> 00:23:15.476
And there's generally similar

00:23:15.476 --> 00:23:17.536
naming for all four intents, so

00:23:17.536 --> 00:23:18.766
make sure you adopt them for all

00:23:18.766 --> 00:23:19.756
the intents you support.

00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:21.846
Now let's talk about some of the

00:23:21.846 --> 00:23:23.316
variety of things that people

00:23:23.316 --> 00:23:25.106
say to Siri and how you can do a

00:23:25.106 --> 00:23:27.146
good job handling of them in

00:23:27.146 --> 00:23:28.086
your SiriKit Media

00:23:28.086 --> 00:23:28.826
implementation.

00:23:29.466 --> 00:23:32.306
So one of the most popular

00:23:32.306 --> 00:23:33.626
things that people say to Siri

00:23:33.626 --> 00:23:35.486
is "Play my app."

00:23:35.816 --> 00:23:36.906
They don't tell you exactly what

00:23:36.906 --> 00:23:38.196
it is that they want to play,

00:23:39.346 --> 00:23:41.386
and it's your job as a SiriKit

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:43.276
Media developer to choose the

00:23:43.276 --> 00:23:45.816
right thing to do for your app.

00:23:46.036 --> 00:23:47.186
Now, this might be something as

00:23:47.186 --> 00:23:48.656
simple as resuming an existing

00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:49.036
queue.

00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:51.386
If you're not an audiobooks or

00:23:51.386 --> 00:23:53.196
podcasting app, this is probably

00:23:53.196 --> 00:23:54.356
the most reasonable behavior to

00:23:54.356 --> 00:23:54.726
implement.

00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:57.236
But you can make the behavior as

00:23:57.236 --> 00:23:58.096
dynamic as you like.

00:23:58.926 --> 00:24:00.996
Maybe you want to direct them to

00:24:00.996 --> 00:24:02.976
a recommended playlist or some

00:24:02.976 --> 00:24:04.036
hot new trending music.

00:24:04.616 --> 00:24:05.426
The choice is yours.

00:24:06.186 --> 00:24:07.266
And how do you know that someone

00:24:07.266 --> 00:24:09.336
said, "Play my app," well, there

00:24:09.336 --> 00:24:10.626
will be no search criteria

00:24:10.626 --> 00:24:12.306
specified in the INMediaSearch

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:12.646
object.

00:24:13.246 --> 00:24:14.426
One thing that might seem like a

00:24:14.426 --> 00:24:16.396
good idea is to ask someone what

00:24:16.396 --> 00:24:17.016
they want to play.

00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:19.186
But for the same reason that we

00:24:19.186 --> 00:24:20.646
don't recommend using confirm,

00:24:21.196 --> 00:24:22.596
we don't recommend this

00:24:22.596 --> 00:24:22.986
approach.

00:24:23.746 --> 00:24:24.946
Putting dialogue prompts in

00:24:24.946 --> 00:24:26.686
front of people is one of the

00:24:26.686 --> 00:24:27.876
most common ways that they'll

00:24:27.876 --> 00:24:29.146
quit the SiriKit Media

00:24:29.146 --> 00:24:29.636
experience.

00:24:30.326 --> 00:24:33.766
People can ask to initiate

00:24:33.766 --> 00:24:34.706
playback with additional

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:36.526
controls, and some of the

00:24:36.526 --> 00:24:37.876
supported options are repeat,

00:24:37.966 --> 00:24:39.466
shuffle, resume, and playback

00:24:39.466 --> 00:24:40.126
queue location.

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:43.366
And if you support these in your

00:24:43.366 --> 00:24:45.216
app, make sure you support them

00:24:45.216 --> 00:24:46.866
in your INPlayMediaIntent

00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:48.456
implementation as well.

00:24:50.026 --> 00:24:51.196
And people can also ask to play

00:24:51.196 --> 00:24:52.326
content with a variety of search

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:52.776
options.

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:54.476
And one of the most useful

00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:55.726
search options is the sort

00:24:55.726 --> 00:24:56.156
parameter.

00:24:56.976 --> 00:24:58.196
You can say things like "Play

00:24:58.196 --> 00:24:59.406
the new Stuff You Should Know

00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:00.896
podcast in my app," and you'll

00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:02.446
get INMediaSortOrder newest.

00:25:03.306 --> 00:25:04.436
Or you can ask for the best

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:05.816
album by an artist, and you'll

00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:08.006
get INMediaSortOrder best.

00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:09.566
Or you can ask your app for a

00:25:09.686 --> 00:25:11.296
recommendation, and you'll get

00:25:11.406 --> 00:25:13.026
INMediaSortOrder recommended.

00:25:13.866 --> 00:25:14.926
Check out the full list in

00:25:15.016 --> 00:25:15.966
INMediaSortOrder.

00:25:16.146 --> 00:25:19.396
And another powerful search

00:25:19.396 --> 00:25:20.876
option is the reference

00:25:20.876 --> 00:25:22.266
property, which can have

00:25:22.416 --> 00:25:23.696
INMediaReferenceCurrently

00:25:23.696 --> 00:25:24.046
Playing.

00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:26.356
This is really useful for

00:25:26.356 --> 00:25:27.766
INAddMediaIntent or

00:25:27.766 --> 00:25:30.056
INUpdateMediaIntent, because

00:25:30.056 --> 00:25:31.816
people can easily add the

00:25:31.816 --> 00:25:33.066
currently playing item to a

00:25:33.066 --> 00:25:35.206
library or a playlist, or they

00:25:35.206 --> 00:25:36.656
can tell your app that they love

00:25:36.656 --> 00:25:37.746
or they hate their currently

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:38.306
playing item.

00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:41.006
And one thing to note too is if

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:42.336
you've populated the external

00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:43.576
content identifier in

00:25:43.576 --> 00:25:46.096
MPNowPlayingInfo center, that

00:25:46.096 --> 00:25:47.436
identifier is going to be in

00:25:47.436 --> 00:25:48.876
INMediaSearch's identifier

00:25:48.876 --> 00:25:50.586
property, so you know exactly

00:25:50.586 --> 00:25:54.036
what item to find.

00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:56.556
Now, telling Siri more about how

00:25:56.556 --> 00:25:58.726
your customer uses your app is

00:25:58.786 --> 00:26:00.306
going to help Siri provide a

00:26:00.306 --> 00:26:01.806
wonderful SiriKit Media

00:26:01.806 --> 00:26:02.346
experience.

00:26:06.256 --> 00:26:08.256
So when you give user vocabulary

00:26:08.256 --> 00:26:10.426
to Siri, this helps Siri

00:26:10.476 --> 00:26:11.626
understand the parts of your

00:26:11.626 --> 00:26:13.446
catalog that are interesting to

00:26:13.446 --> 00:26:13.966
your customer.

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:16.266
It's important to note it's not

00:26:16.266 --> 00:26:17.806
the entire contents of your app

00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:19.806
catalog, it's only the pieces of

00:26:19.836 --> 00:26:21.086
content that your customer is

00:26:21.086 --> 00:26:21.876
specifically interested in.

00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:25.056
It's also important to note that

00:26:25.056 --> 00:26:26.746
the vocabulary is ordered, so

00:26:26.746 --> 00:26:28.236
make sure that you include the

00:26:28.236 --> 00:26:29.916
most important items at the

00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:30.926
beginning of the collection.

00:26:32.146 --> 00:26:33.076
And depending on the type of

00:26:33.076 --> 00:26:34.706
media your app supports, you're

00:26:34.706 --> 00:26:35.776
going to send different types to

00:26:35.776 --> 00:26:36.106
Siri.

00:26:37.316 --> 00:26:39.466
Music apps should use playlist

00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:41.006
title and music artist name.

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:43.206
Audiobook apps should use

00:26:43.336 --> 00:26:44.816
audiobook title and audiobook

00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:45.196
author.

00:26:45.926 --> 00:26:47.496
And podcasting apps should use

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:48.636
show title.

00:26:50.256 --> 00:26:51.516
And for those things that are

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:53.806
applicable to everybody that

00:26:53.806 --> 00:26:55.346
uses your app, check out the

00:26:55.346 --> 00:26:57.196
global vocabulary support in

00:26:57.196 --> 00:26:57.706
SiriKit.

00:26:58.486 --> 00:27:02.136
So in conclusion, we're

00:27:02.136 --> 00:27:03.746
launching new SiriKit Media

00:27:03.746 --> 00:27:05.906
Intents to allow you to use Siri

00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:07.776
to control your audio apps.

00:27:08.006 --> 00:27:09.796
You'll be able to play, add,

00:27:10.366 --> 00:27:11.976
update taste profiles, and

00:27:12.026 --> 00:27:13.336
search for media using the new

00:27:13.336 --> 00:27:13.716
intents.

00:27:14.876 --> 00:27:16.056
It's very important that you

00:27:16.056 --> 00:27:17.266
provide the best experience

00:27:17.266 --> 00:27:17.766
possible.

00:27:18.396 --> 00:27:20.486
And you can do this by embracing

00:27:20.486 --> 00:27:21.546
search flexibility.

00:27:22.296 --> 00:27:24.426
Because people don't say exactly

00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:25.226
what they want to play.

00:27:26.246 --> 00:27:27.366
You can handle errors

00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:29.486
appropriately, so people know

00:27:29.486 --> 00:27:30.756
what's happened when something

00:27:30.756 --> 00:27:31.206
goes wrong.

00:27:31.826 --> 00:27:32.816
And you're going to you want to

00:27:32.816 --> 00:27:34.006
make sure that you construct

00:27:34.326 --> 00:27:35.856
your INMediaItem objects

00:27:35.856 --> 00:27:37.996
appropriately so Siri can speak

00:27:38.116 --> 00:27:39.716
the best dialogue possible.

00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:42.336
And finally, make sure you give

00:27:42.336 --> 00:27:44.506
Siri the important contextual

00:27:44.506 --> 00:27:46.736
information possible so Siri can

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:48.516
make the best choices possible

00:27:49.136 --> 00:27:50.326
on your customer's behalf.

00:27:51.106 --> 00:27:54.686
