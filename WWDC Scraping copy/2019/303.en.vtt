00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.026
Apple Deployment Programs, at

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:04.916
the end of this year.

00:06:05.486 --> 00:06:06.856
It's time to get on board with

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:07.496
ABM and ASM.

00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:10.126
Because, in fact, you're getting

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:12.976
even more benefits now with the

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:14.646
same Managed Apple ID you use to

00:06:14.646 --> 00:06:16.816
sign in to ABM and ASM, you get

00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:18.506
access to the AppleSeed for IT,

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.366
so that you can get all of the

00:06:20.366 --> 00:06:21.986
new beta software releases, like

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:23.376
everything we seeded this week,

00:06:23.826 --> 00:06:25.446
including documentation and test

00:06:25.446 --> 00:06:26.916
plans, to help you ensure that

00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:28.626
those new software releases will

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:30.496
work well in your organization,

00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:32.536
and when you find some things

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:34.396
you don't particularly like, use

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:35.676
Feedback Assistant built into

00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:38.256
all of our OSs now to file

00:06:38.456 --> 00:06:39.836
suggestions to us, so that we

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:41.436
can associate those with your

00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:43.076
organization and more accurately

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:44.126
track them in engineering.

00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:47.556
That concludes our update on ABM

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:49.246
and ASM, and now I'd like to

00:06:49.246 --> 00:06:50.766
turn to another great example of

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:52.336
how we provide you with the same

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:53.706
tools on every platform and

00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:54.776
allow you to choose the best

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:55.626
devices for you.

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.026
And that's Classroom.

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:00.786
In March, we released the latest

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:03.106
update to Classroom for iPad and

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:05.446
Mac, but now it enables teachers

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:06.876
to manage student Macs with the

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:08.206
same great feature set that

00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:09.536
they've grown to love while

00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:10.836
managing student iPads.

00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:12.826
On the left, you can see that

00:07:12.826 --> 00:07:14.076
students can manage their

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:15.496
classes with a new classroom

00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:17.336
pane in system preferences, just

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:18.546
like they do in settings on

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:19.486
iPad.

00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:21.986
And we also brought all of the

00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:23.716
settings that configure certain

00:07:23.716 --> 00:07:25.306
classroom behaviors that you

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:27.346
have on iOS back to macOS,

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.986
including the ones that control

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:31.566
Classroom's Screensview feature.

00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:33.476
But we didn't stop there.

00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:34.956
We also made all of the other

00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:36.356
screen viewing features that you

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:38.096
know and love in macOS from

00:07:38.096 --> 00:07:39.916
screen sharing, screenshot, and

00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:41.936
Apple Note desktop respect those

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:44.446
restrictions, as well.

00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:46.656
Earlier this week, we seeded our

00:07:46.656 --> 00:07:48.476
fall release of Classroom, which

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:49.836
of course, support Dark Mode on

00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:50.876
iOS 13.

00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:53.526
And we've and a great new

00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:54.886
feature that will help teachers

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:56.866
regain student attention without

00:07:57.056 --> 00:07:58.956
needing to lock the device, we

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.556
call it Hide Apps, and it works

00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:00.796
like this.

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:03.046
When the teacher taps the new

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:04.776
Hide button in the toolbar, the

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:05.886
student is returned to home

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.666
screen on their iPad.

00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:10.326
That concludes our Classroom

00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:10.826
update.

00:08:10.936 --> 00:08:12.066
Now I'd like to turn to a couple

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:12.956
of other announcements that

00:08:12.956 --> 00:08:14.166
impact device management.

00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:17.166
We all saw on Monday the

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:18.456
announcement of desktop-class

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:19.536
browsing on iPad.

00:08:20.356 --> 00:08:22.206
This may impact your MDM product

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:24.146
if you are using the UserAgent

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:25.336
string to distinguish between

00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:28.056
iPad and Mac to customize your

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:29.306
UI or your enrollment flow.

00:08:29.306 --> 00:08:30.516
You're going to need to stop

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:32.535
doing that, because iPad now

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:33.366
identifies as Mac.

00:08:34.236 --> 00:08:36.126
For more about this great new

00:08:36.126 --> 00:08:37.686
feature for iPad, check out the

00:08:37.686 --> 00:08:40.916
session from earlier this week.

00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:42.446
We've also brought a number of

00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.056
great device management features

00:08:44.446 --> 00:08:47.086
custom to on iOS and macOS to

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:50.296
AppleTV, we now allow

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.676
organizations to control when

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:53.586
software updates appear in the

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:55.666
tvOS UI and allow you to

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:57.376
configure date and time

00:08:57.376 --> 00:08:58.086
automatically.

00:08:59.376 --> 00:09:00.246
Hopefully, you're all using

00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:01.256
content caching in your

00:09:01.256 --> 00:09:02.996
organization, and now tvOS

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:04.716
screensavers are also cashed,

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.256
saving you a lot of bandwidth.

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:09.356
[ Applause ]

00:09:09.696 --> 00:09:11.606
That concludes our first section

00:09:11.606 --> 00:09:12.776
of content, and now I'd like to

00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:14.426
turn to some features that help

00:09:14.426 --> 00:09:15.686
us strike that right balance

00:09:15.686 --> 00:09:18.026
between security, privacy, and

00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:18.756
manageability.

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:21.636
And the first one is a really

00:09:21.636 --> 00:09:23.496
big deal that Craig highlighted

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.026
in the keynote on Monday, I'd

00:09:25.096 --> 00:09:26.396
like to ask Bob Whiteman to come

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:27.876
on stage and tell you all about

00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:28.626
user enrollment.

00:09:29.516 --> 00:09:34.676
[ Applause ]

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:36.536
>> Hi, I'm Bob Whiteman, Senior

00:09:36.536 --> 00:09:39.186
Device Management Engineer at

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:39.856
Apple.

00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:41.226
Until now, there have been two

00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:42.806
ways to manage iOS devices.

00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:44.856
Device enrollments provide many

00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:45.836
device-wide management

00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:47.656
capabilities, and for

00:09:47.656 --> 00:09:49.046
institutionally owned devices

00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:50.756
that are supervised, automated

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.706
device enrollment provides all

00:09:52.706 --> 00:09:53.526
of the device management

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.596
capabilities as well as

00:09:55.756 --> 00:09:56.686
automated set up.

00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:59.096
When users bring their personal

00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:01.066
devices to work or school, they

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:02.756
don't really want the admin to

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:04.736
manage the entire device, and

00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:06.386
BYOD admins don't really want to

00:10:06.386 --> 00:10:07.836
manage the entire device either.

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:09.146
They just want to provide the

00:10:09.206 --> 00:10:11.066
apps, data, and configuration

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:12.656
that users need in order to be

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:13.216
productive.

00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:15.606
Today, I'm presenting a new way

00:10:15.606 --> 00:10:17.556
to manage BYOD devices called

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:18.656
User Enrollments.

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:23.306
This is a new MDM enrollment

00:10:23.306 --> 00:10:25.346
option that provides a better

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:26.476
balance for BYOD.

00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:28.236
It protects the privacy of

00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:29.786
personal data, while still

00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:31.056
securing corporate data.

00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:33.716
When users and admins achieve

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.126
this better balance, there is

00:10:35.126 --> 00:10:36.896
greater acceptance of BYOD

00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:38.936
programs, and more productive

00:10:38.936 --> 00:10:39.436
users.

00:10:39.436 --> 00:10:40.946
Everyone wins.

00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.096
User enrollments are built on

00:10:43.096 --> 00:10:43.956
three pillars.

00:10:44.236 --> 00:10:46.036
The first is a Managed Apple ID,

00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:47.796
alongside the Personal Apple ID.

00:10:48.516 --> 00:10:50.076
The second is cryptographic

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:52.676
separation of personal and work

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.866
data, and the third is a limited

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:56.546
set of device-wide management

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:57.356
capabilities.

00:10:58.026 --> 00:11:01.586
A Managed Apple ID is required

00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:02.586
for user enrollment.

00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:04.256
This is the anchor for the

00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:06.246
user's work identity on the

00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:06.796
device.

00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:08.626
Now this is not a multiuser

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.056
system.

00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:10.736
It's a multi- persona system.

00:11:10.866 --> 00:11:12.256
It's the same user wearing

00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.106
different hats.

00:11:14.056 --> 00:11:15.756
The admin creates the Managed

00:11:15.756 --> 00:11:17.746
Apple ID in Apple School Manager

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:19.136
or Apple Business Manager, and

00:11:19.386 --> 00:11:21.096
the user must sign into the

00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:22.646
Managed Apple ID during the

00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:23.886
enrollment process.

00:11:24.876 --> 00:11:26.416
Federated off means that this

00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:27.816
works very well for the user,

00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:28.886
since they are challenged for

00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:29.936
credentials that they already

00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:31.296
know from the organization.

00:11:32.086 --> 00:11:33.436
And when the enrollment ends,

00:11:33.686 --> 00:11:35.656
the Managed Apple ID is removed

00:11:35.656 --> 00:11:38.376
from the device.

00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:40.386
Managed Apps and Accounts use

00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:41.896
the Managed Apple ID's iCloud

00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.206
account and Personal Apps and

00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:45.886
Accounts use the personal Apple

00:11:45.886 --> 00:11:47.436
ID's iCloud account, if there is

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:48.236
one signed in.

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:50.866
Third-party apps are always

00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:52.496
entirely either managed or

00:11:52.496 --> 00:11:53.106
unmanaged.

00:11:53.196 --> 00:11:54.476
They can't change mode, and you

00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:56.056
can't run them in both modes at

00:11:56.056 --> 00:11:56.706
the same time.

00:11:57.756 --> 00:11:59.426
Some of the built-in apps like

00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:01.576
Notes, our account based, which

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:02.686
means they can handle both

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.456
managed accounts and unmanaged

00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:06.056
accounts, and these apps will

00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:07.646
use the appropriate Apple ID,

00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:08.846
depending on which account they

00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:11.986
are operating on at the time.

00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:13.416
The next pillar is data

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:14.026
separation.

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:16.476
When the enrollment starts, iOS

00:12:16.656 --> 00:12:18.906
creates a managed APFS volume,

00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:20.106
and it uses separate

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.506
cryptographic keys for this.

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:23.906
When enrollment ends, iOS

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:25.476
destroys the cryptographic keys

00:12:25.556 --> 00:12:26.366
and the volume.

00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:27.656
So, the data is gone.

00:12:28.156 --> 00:12:29.596
Now it's always been the case

00:12:29.596 --> 00:12:31.286
that iOS removes managed data

00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:32.256
when enrollment ends

00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:32.986
appropriately.

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:34.916
So, this is a cryptographic

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.196
backstop to make sure that the

00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:38.106
data is provably gone, just in

00:12:38.106 --> 00:12:39.226
case something goes wrong during

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:40.386
the unenrollment process.

00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:43.956
The managed APFS volume contains

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:45.686
the managed versions of all of

00:12:45.686 --> 00:12:46.416
these items.

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:48.856
App containers are any local

00:12:48.856 --> 00:12:50.776
data stored by third-party apps.

00:12:51.726 --> 00:12:53.636
The Notes app stores local data

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:55.436
for managed Notes accounts on

00:12:55.436 --> 00:12:57.616
the managed APFS volume and for

00:12:57.616 --> 00:12:59.336
personal notes accounts on the

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.656
personal or system APFS volume.

00:13:03.446 --> 00:13:05.166
When iOS creates this managed

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:07.476
APFS volume, it also creates a

00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:08.476
managed keychain.

00:13:09.016 --> 00:13:10.936
This stores any secure items

00:13:11.006 --> 00:13:12.536
that are saved by third-party

00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:13.806
apps like passwords and

00:13:13.806 --> 00:13:15.986
certificates, and it also stores

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:17.566
the authentication credentials

00:13:17.686 --> 00:13:19.306
for managed accounts.

00:13:20.456 --> 00:13:22.206
Mail attachments and full email

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:24.156
bodies are stored on the managed

00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:27.326
APFS partition, although there

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:28.876
is a central database for mail

00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:30.206
that lives on the system

00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:31.606
partition that contains some

00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:33.616
metadata and five-line previews.

00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:35.216
Rest assured, this data is

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:36.436
removed when the enrollment

00:13:36.436 --> 00:13:36.846
ends.

00:13:40.276 --> 00:13:42.526
Once the data is separated, the

00:13:42.526 --> 00:13:44.606
management of this data must be

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:45.606
separated, as well.

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.396
User enrollments have a few

00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:49.026
limited capabilities for

00:13:49.026 --> 00:13:50.516
managing the entire device, but

00:13:50.516 --> 00:13:52.016
they have no capabilities for

00:13:52.016 --> 00:13:53.726
managing personal apps and data.

00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:56.736
User enrollment management is

00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:58.726
based upon a modified version of

00:13:58.726 --> 00:13:59.916
the MDM protocol.

00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:02.786
And it starts the same way as

00:14:02.786 --> 00:14:03.956
device enrollments, with the

00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:05.486
enrollment profile.

00:14:06.056 --> 00:14:10.866
The Managed Apple ID key is what

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:12.326
signifies this as a user

00:14:12.326 --> 00:14:12.856
enrollment.

00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:14.396
And the value of this is the

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.026
user name of the managed Apple

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:17.796
ID that the user must sign into.

00:14:19.136 --> 00:14:20.516
There's also a payload

00:14:20.516 --> 00:14:21.606
organization key.

00:14:21.746 --> 00:14:22.846
This is an existing key for

00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:24.166
device enrollments, but becomes

00:14:24.316 --> 00:14:26.006
particularly useful for user

00:14:26.006 --> 00:14:26.896
enrollments, because this

00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:28.556
identifies the managed accounts

00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:29.216
on the device.

00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:31.576
It will appear in Settings and

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:32.656
in the Notes app and some other

00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:33.196
places.

00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:35.286
And also note that there's no

00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:36.776
access rights key here.

00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:38.856
Device enrollments use access

00:14:38.856 --> 00:14:39.926
rights to gate certain

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:41.846
management capabilities for

00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:43.206
device enrollments, but these

00:14:43.206 --> 00:14:44.456
simply don't apply to the user

00:14:44.456 --> 00:14:44.876
enrollments.

00:14:44.876 --> 00:14:45.936
So, they're not specified.

00:14:47.836 --> 00:14:49.806
There's more differences between

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:50.996
the device enrollment protocol

00:14:50.996 --> 00:14:52.236
and the user enrollment protocol

00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:52.946
than I go to can go through

00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:54.086
here, but I will cover the most

00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:54.816
important points.

00:14:55.576 --> 00:14:57.426
First of all, profile service

00:14:57.466 --> 00:14:59.186
profiles and user enrollments do

00:14:59.186 --> 00:14:59.766
not mix.

00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:01.456
You cannot use them to enroll,

00:15:01.456 --> 00:15:03.016
and you can install one via a

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:03.806
user enrollment.

00:15:05.576 --> 00:15:07.536
Device enrollments use the UDID

00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:09.096
as the primary identifier of the

00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:10.526
device that is communicating.

00:15:11.426 --> 00:15:13.706
User enrollments do not provide

00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:15.476
UDID or any other persistent

00:15:15.506 --> 00:15:17.086
identifier to the MDM server.

00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:18.586
This includes serial number,

00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:20.536
IMEI, MEID.

00:15:21.256 --> 00:15:22.976
Instead, when enrollment starts,

00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:25.216
iOS creates and enrollment ID,

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:27.136
and this is communicated to the

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:28.916
MDM server in all MDM

00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:29.736
communications.

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:32.656
The MDM server can use this as

00:15:32.656 --> 00:15:34.096
its primary identifier for the

00:15:34.096 --> 00:15:34.616
enrollment.

00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:37.026
And when the enrollment ends,

00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:39.616
iOS destroys this enrollment ID.

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:40.886
So, if the same device enrolls

00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:42.506
again, it will get a different

00:15:42.656 --> 00:15:43.466
enrollment ID.

00:15:44.636 --> 00:15:45.756
There's something similar for

00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:46.466
ActiveSync.

00:15:47.866 --> 00:15:49.746
When a user enrollment installs

00:15:49.746 --> 00:15:51.496
an exchange account, that goes

00:15:51.496 --> 00:15:53.016
into a user enrollment mode.

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:57.676
It uses a EAS device identifier

00:15:57.896 --> 00:15:59.136
that was generated at the start

00:15:59.136 --> 00:15:59.986
of the enrollment, and it

00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:01.616
communicates it both to the

00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:03.426
exchange server and to the MDM

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:04.946
server in the device information

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:06.096
query, so, they can use that to

00:16:06.156 --> 00:16:07.416
correlate as they usually do.

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:09.266
And again, this is destroyed

00:16:09.266 --> 00:16:10.316
when the enrollment ends.

00:16:11.786 --> 00:16:13.906
And the token update command

00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:15.876
does not include the unlock

00:16:15.936 --> 00:16:16.326
token.

00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:17.916
This means that the MDM server

00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:19.236
cannot clear the device

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:19.826
passcode.

00:16:22.726 --> 00:16:24.436
One of the top reasons why users

00:16:24.436 --> 00:16:26.826
reject BYOD programs is because

00:16:26.826 --> 00:16:27.776
they are concerned that the

00:16:27.776 --> 00:16:29.486
admin may erase the entire

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:30.616
device, and they will lose their

00:16:30.616 --> 00:16:31.836
personal data on their own

00:16:31.836 --> 00:16:32.296
device.

00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:34.016
User enrollments do not the

00:16:34.016 --> 00:16:35.706
support Erase Device command.

00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:40.086
[ Applause ]

00:16:40.586 --> 00:16:42.586
And there's a similar thing for

00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:43.306
ActiveSync.

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:45.316
If the exchange account is in

00:16:45.316 --> 00:16:46.746
user enrollment mode, the

00:16:46.746 --> 00:16:48.236
exchange server cannot send the

00:16:48.236 --> 00:16:49.226
RemoteWipe command.

00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:51.796
Instead, the MDM server can end

00:16:51.796 --> 00:16:54.046
the enrollment, and the exchange

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.636
server can send the Account-only

00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:57.276
RemoteWipe, which only remove

00:16:57.276 --> 00:16:59.186
managed data in leave personal

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:01.176
data untouched.

00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:03.836
Some queries will only return

00:17:04.185 --> 00:17:05.296
the managed results.

00:17:05.366 --> 00:17:07.016
So, for instance, the MDM server

00:17:07.016 --> 00:17:08.646
cannot find out what personal

00:17:08.816 --> 00:17:09.786
apps are installed on the

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:10.256
device.

00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:12.266
This is one place where we've

00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:13.665
added a new feature for device

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:14.256
enrollments.

00:17:14.465 --> 00:17:16.486
They have a new managed-only key

00:17:16.816 --> 00:17:18.346
that filters the results in the

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:19.596
same way.

00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:24.516
When installing applications,

00:17:24.656 --> 00:17:26.165
user enrollments cannot take

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:27.935
over or abandon management of an

00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:28.026
app.

00:17:28.906 --> 00:17:30.496
The app is always removed when

00:17:30.496 --> 00:17:31.386
the enrollment ends.

00:17:31.976 --> 00:17:33.026
User enrollments support

00:17:33.026 --> 00:17:35.706
enterprise app distribution, and

00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:36.926
user-based VPP with

00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:37.986
PurchaseMethod 1.

00:17:38.386 --> 00:17:40.056
This ensures that the purchase

00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:41.616
goes on the managed Apple ID,

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:43.986
not the personal Apple ID.

00:17:46.636 --> 00:17:48.696
For VPN, user enrollments

00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:50.206
support the Per-app VPN, and

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:51.496
we've expanded it with some new

00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:51.986
keys.

00:17:52.596 --> 00:17:54.726
These keys help guide the

00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:56.006
traffic for the related

00:17:56.006 --> 00:17:57.416
protocols through the Per-app

00:17:57.416 --> 00:17:57.666
VPN.

00:17:58.376 --> 00:17:59.506
These are also available for

00:17:59.506 --> 00:18:01.976
device enrollments, but for user

00:18:01.976 --> 00:18:02.926
enrollments, there's a very

00:18:02.926 --> 00:18:04.406
important limitation on these,

00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:06.316
which is that the second-level

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:08.536
domain of the VPN server must

00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:10.586
match the second-level domain in

00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:11.826
the values for these keys.

00:18:12.056 --> 00:18:14.246
So, for instance, if the VPN

00:18:14.246 --> 00:18:18.016
server is VPN.acme.com, the mail

00:18:18.016 --> 00:18:19.276
domains can include

00:18:19.316 --> 00:18:21.816
mail.acme.com, but they cannot

00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:23.886
include mail.aol.com.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:25.566
This ensures that only the

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:27.156
managed accounts are guided

00:18:27.156 --> 00:18:28.546
through the Per-app VPN.

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:31.976
If a user enrollment installs a

00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:34.026
passcode policy, iOS will

00:18:34.026 --> 00:18:35.976
enforce a six-digit not simple

00:18:35.976 --> 00:18:36.586
passcode.

00:18:39.396 --> 00:18:41.246
And it does not support more

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.796
complex passcode requirements.

00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:44.366
The main reason for this is

00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:47.126
because a more complex passcode

00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:49.586
requirement increases the risk

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:50.726
that the user will forget the

00:18:50.726 --> 00:18:53.056
passcode, and the MDM server

00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:54.296
can't help out the user in this

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:55.536
case by clearing the passcode.

00:18:55.536 --> 00:18:56.796
So, it would be unfair to

00:18:56.956 --> 00:18:57.756
require this.

00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:00.296
For more information on why this

00:19:00.296 --> 00:19:02.196
is the sweet spot for passcode

00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:03.656
policies, I suggest reading the

00:19:03.656 --> 00:19:05.556
latest edition of iOS security

00:19:05.556 --> 00:19:06.046
document.

00:19:07.086 --> 00:19:09.036
If you need proxying for Wi-Fi,

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.016
use WPAD configured on the

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:11.736
access points.

00:19:11.906 --> 00:19:13.426
The Wi-Fi payload does not

00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:15.066
support any of the proxy keys.

00:19:15.926 --> 00:19:17.746
And defaults in logging payloads

00:19:17.896 --> 00:19:18.746
are not supported.

00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:21.746
Now these are very useful for

00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:23.256
troubleshooting or for reporting

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:25.176
issues to Apple, and they can be

00:19:25.176 --> 00:19:26.776
installed, but it must be done

00:19:26.776 --> 00:19:27.536
by the user.

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:28.996
So that they have a chance to

00:19:28.996 --> 00:19:30.536
accept the changes that these

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:31.676
will make to their personal

00:19:34.456 --> 00:19:34.616
device.

00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:36.036
User enrollments do support some

00:19:36.036 --> 00:19:36.726
restrictions.

00:19:37.116 --> 00:19:38.516
Managed Open In is available,

00:19:38.686 --> 00:19:40.166
and the allowLockScreen

00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:41.696
restrictions are there, so that

00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:43.256
managed data does not appear on

00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:43.866
the lock screen.

00:19:44.546 --> 00:19:47.166
But it doesn't support any of

00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:48.116
the supervised-only

00:19:48.116 --> 00:19:49.696
restrictions, and it doesn't

00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:51.336
support any of the restrictions

00:19:51.336 --> 00:19:52.366
that really have nothing to do

00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:54.386
with managed data like content

00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:55.786
ratings or ones that turn off

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.216
major features like iCloud.

00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:00.136
These also apply to their

00:20:00.136 --> 00:20:01.586
ActiveSync equivalents when an

00:20:01.586 --> 00:20:02.966
exchange account is in user

00:20:02.966 --> 00:20:03.596
enrollment mode.

00:20:04.846 --> 00:20:06.206
And I have an important warning

00:20:06.256 --> 00:20:08.006
for MDM server developers.

00:20:08.826 --> 00:20:10.166
Make sure that your server is

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:12.266
resilient to unexpected or

00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:14.426
absent keys and the results, as

00:20:14.736 --> 00:20:16.666
these capabilities are going to

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:16.976
change over time.

00:20:20.366 --> 00:20:21.256
Now I'd like to welcome my

00:20:21.256 --> 00:20:22.726
colleague Ren to the stage to

00:20:22.726 --> 00:20:24.056
demonstrate the user enrollment.

00:20:24.316 --> 00:20:24.586
Ren?

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:30.006
[ Applause ]

00:20:30.506 --> 00:20:30.986
>> Thanks Bob.

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:42.126
>> All right, hi everyone.

00:20:42.336 --> 00:20:43.996
My name is Ren, and today, I'm

00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:45.216
going to demo the user

00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:45.856
enrollment flow.

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:47.796
Just like device enrollment,

00:20:48.156 --> 00:20:49.716
user enrollment starts with the

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:50.606
profile, as well.

00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:53.066
To get that profile, today I'm

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:54.996
going to go to an actual website

00:20:55.196 --> 00:20:56.766
of a company called Acme Inc.

00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:01.176
This is the website, and please

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:03.336
be aware that this is just a

00:21:03.396 --> 00:21:04.096
demo website.

00:21:04.516 --> 00:21:05.606
In the real world, you might

00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:07.036
have to authenticate first to

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.106
download anything.

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.046
But we skipped that step in this

00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:10.636
demo.

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:14.076
And as Bob has said, user

00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:16.006
enrollment works very closely

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.556
with the Managed Apple ID.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:19.826
So, I will have to provide this

00:21:19.826 --> 00:21:21.716
ID information to this website

00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:23.436
to have it download, or

00:21:23.436 --> 00:21:24.966
generate, a profile for me.

00:21:25.896 --> 00:21:28.426
Let me paste in the username and

00:21:28.426 --> 00:21:29.436
type on the enroll button.

00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:32.866
Read the warning carefully, and

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:34.206
now, the profile has been

00:21:34.206 --> 00:21:35.326
downloaded to my phone.

00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:37.966
Let's go to Settings to check it

00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:39.266
out.

00:21:39.536 --> 00:21:41.076
After opening Settings, who will

00:21:41.076 --> 00:21:42.896
notice that a new cell with

00:21:43.046 --> 00:21:44.966
text, "Enroll in Acme Inc.," has

00:21:44.966 --> 00:21:46.366
been added to this page.

00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:48.546
And that is the shortcut to

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:50.756
start user enrollment, and I'm

00:21:50.756 --> 00:21:54.216
going to take it now.

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:56.376
This is a new UI we made for

00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:57.086
user enrollment.

00:21:57.766 --> 00:21:59.056
We merged the profile

00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:00.636
[inaudible] information, the

00:22:00.636 --> 00:22:02.676
warning, and consent all into

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:03.306
one page.

00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:05.206
We hope this will make your

00:22:05.206 --> 00:22:06.666
profile installation experience

00:22:06.966 --> 00:22:07.646
much simpler.

00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:10.526
Also, if you want to dig more

00:22:10.526 --> 00:22:11.746
into the details of this

00:22:11.746 --> 00:22:13.566
profile, you can do that by

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:15.266
tapping on the Details button at

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:15.866
the top right.

00:22:16.426 --> 00:22:19.656
Let's take a look at the MDM

00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:21.206
payload of this profile.

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:24.566
And you will notice that the

00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:27.046
managed Apple ID I provided at

00:22:27.046 --> 00:22:28.946
the website has been added to

00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:30.906
this payload, and this is the

00:22:30.906 --> 00:22:32.396
key to trigger user enrollment.

00:22:33.156 --> 00:22:35.156
Also, we removed the Access

00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:36.226
Rights section from this

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:38.056
payload, because it's not needed

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:39.056
with user enrollment.

00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:41.266
Something that you might not

00:22:41.266 --> 00:22:43.646
have noticed is if you go back

00:22:43.756 --> 00:22:45.076
to the top-level page of this

00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:47.476
profile, you won't find any

00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:48.956
warning talking about the things

00:22:49.006 --> 00:22:50.676
the company can do to the

00:22:50.676 --> 00:22:52.176
employee's -- this device.

00:22:52.846 --> 00:22:54.396
And that is because, as Bob has

00:22:54.426 --> 00:22:55.986
mentioned, we carefully

00:22:55.986 --> 00:22:58.826
restricted the capability of the

00:22:58.826 --> 00:22:59.356
MDM server.

00:22:59.696 --> 00:23:01.556
So, it won't be able to disturb

00:23:01.856 --> 00:23:03.416
your personal user experience

00:23:03.646 --> 00:23:04.906
using your personal device.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:07.896
Everything seems fine so far.

00:23:07.896 --> 00:23:08.906
Let's continue profile

00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:10.756
installation by tapping on the

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:12.446
big rounded corner button on the

00:23:12.446 --> 00:23:12.826
bottom.

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:15.636
I will provide my device

00:23:15.696 --> 00:23:19.586
password, and now I'm prompted

00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:21.276
to sign in this Managed Apple

00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:21.526
ID.

00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:23.556
So, depend on whether this

00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:26.046
account is Federated or not, the

00:23:26.046 --> 00:23:27.276
UI you see here might be

00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:28.046
slightly different.

00:23:28.726 --> 00:23:29.746
Here I'm just using a

00:23:29.746 --> 00:23:31.476
non-Federated regular account.

00:23:31.816 --> 00:23:33.266
So, I just have to type in my

00:23:33.366 --> 00:23:36.416
password for this account, and

00:23:36.506 --> 00:23:37.956
tap on sign in to continue.

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.786
Now, a bunch of things are

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:41.736
happening on the background.

00:23:42.216 --> 00:23:44.046
We have created a separate disk

00:23:44.046 --> 00:23:45.606
volume on this device for

00:23:45.606 --> 00:23:46.436
enterprise usage.

00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:48.476
We are signing in this Managed

00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:49.986
Apple ID to this device and

00:23:50.136 --> 00:23:51.886
enrolling this device into the

00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:52.566
MDM server.

00:23:53.396 --> 00:23:54.886
All these steps are tied

00:23:54.956 --> 00:23:56.976
together, so if either of them

00:23:57.056 --> 00:23:58.486
failed, they will revert

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.206
everything and pretend like

00:24:00.206 --> 00:24:01.146
nothing has happened.

00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:03.666
Now the user enrollment has

00:24:03.846 --> 00:24:05.096
completed successfully.

00:24:05.536 --> 00:24:07.496
The MDM server can start sending

00:24:07.556 --> 00:24:09.096
MDM commands like install

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:10.556
application, curate device

00:24:10.556 --> 00:24:11.926
information, etc., to this

00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:12.266
device.

00:24:13.006 --> 00:24:14.436
The pop-up you see now, it

00:24:14.436 --> 00:24:15.796
actually came from the MDM

00:24:15.796 --> 00:24:18.306
server asking me to install an

00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:19.136
app called Slack.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:21.556
Let's approve it, and the

00:24:21.556 --> 00:24:22.766
installation shall start

00:24:22.816 --> 00:24:23.276
shortly.

00:24:23.746 --> 00:24:26.526
Another tip about user

00:24:26.526 --> 00:24:28.266
enrollment is, if you want to

00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:29.806
check out the account we just

00:24:29.866 --> 00:24:31.576
signed in, you can do that by

00:24:31.576 --> 00:24:35.316
going to Settings, Account and

00:24:35.426 --> 00:24:36.766
Password -- Password and

00:24:36.766 --> 00:24:38.996
Accounts, and you will find that

00:24:38.996 --> 00:24:40.266
interface account there.

00:24:41.016 --> 00:24:42.536
The same account has also been

00:24:42.536 --> 00:24:44.776
added to apps like Files and

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.306
Notes, and it's ready for you to

00:24:46.306 --> 00:24:46.566
use.

00:24:47.286 --> 00:24:48.526
Let's take a look at the Files,

00:24:48.526 --> 00:24:49.226
for example.

00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:52.426
After opening files, you will

00:24:52.426 --> 00:24:54.536
notice that a new iCloud drive

00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:56.396
with tag Enterprise has been

00:24:56.396 --> 00:24:59.266
added to Files, and all your

00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:00.996
enterprise data will be sent

00:25:01.346 --> 00:25:02.416
through this iCloud drive.

00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:04.726
All right that's it for demo.

00:25:04.976 --> 00:25:06.186
Thanks for watching, and back to

00:25:06.186 --> 00:25:06.546
you, Bob.

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:15.696
[ Applause ]

00:25:16.196 --> 00:25:17.516
>> User enrollments are also

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.836
supported on macOS.

00:25:19.576 --> 00:25:20.866
They work with a Managed Apple

00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:21.326
ID.

00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:23.496
It creates a managed APFS

00:25:23.496 --> 00:25:24.166
volume.

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:26.336
Notes data is fully separated

00:25:26.336 --> 00:25:27.386
between the volumes, depending

00:25:27.386 --> 00:25:28.616
on the account, and the

00:25:28.616 --> 00:25:29.896
management capabilities are

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:31.546
similar to what I described for

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:32.896
iOS, although there are some

00:25:32.896 --> 00:25:34.406
platform-specific differences.

00:25:35.536 --> 00:25:37.116
This allows users to access the

00:25:37.116 --> 00:25:39.376
same Managed Apple ID on their

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:42.556
personal iOS device and on their

00:25:45.216 --> 00:25:45.326
Mac.

00:25:45.546 --> 00:25:46.576
user enrollments provide a

00:25:46.646 --> 00:25:48.156
better balance for BYOD.

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:50.906
It's time to set a new agreement

00:25:50.906 --> 00:25:52.656
between admins and their users.

00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:54.626
Admins should evaluate user

00:25:54.626 --> 00:25:56.536
enrollments, and they should

00:25:56.536 --> 00:25:58.066
reevaluate their security

00:25:58.066 --> 00:25:59.966
policies and shed some of these

00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:01.396
outdated requirements that don't

00:26:01.396 --> 00:26:03.226
make sense on modern devices.

00:26:04.086 --> 00:26:05.906
Admins should provide a privacy

00:26:05.966 --> 00:26:08.126
policy to protect and reassure

00:26:08.126 --> 00:26:08.816
their users.

00:26:09.316 --> 00:26:10.696
We think this is the best way to

00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:12.516
bring BYOD devices into an

00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:13.096
organization.

00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:13.886
Thank you.

00:26:14.516 --> 00:26:19.996
[ Applause ]

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.726
>> Thank you very much, Bob and

00:26:21.726 --> 00:26:23.626
Ren, and now I'd like to take us

00:26:23.656 --> 00:26:25.206
through a couple of other topics

00:26:25.206 --> 00:26:27.026
related to balancing these

00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:27.636
values.

00:26:28.266 --> 00:26:29.146
The first, Certificate

00:26:29.146 --> 00:26:30.866
Transparency, an important new

00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:32.246
security enhancement that we

00:26:32.246 --> 00:26:33.686
brought to all of our OSs last

00:26:33.686 --> 00:26:34.126
December.

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:37.756
However, this can sometimes leak

00:26:37.756 --> 00:26:39.046
internal host names to public

00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:40.576
logs that enterprises might be

00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:41.286
concerned about.

00:26:41.606 --> 00:26:43.166
So, at the same time, we added a

00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:44.846
new payload, enabling them to

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.976
opt out specifically sensitive

00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:48.856
certificates or domains, and

00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:49.806
they can install as many

00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:51.326
payloads as they need to manage

00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:53.476
all of those sensitive items.

00:26:54.976 --> 00:26:56.966
We also added support for WPA3

00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:58.736
security type to the Wi-Fi

00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:00.446
payload, including both personal

00:27:00.446 --> 00:27:02.066
and enterprise authentication.

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:05.526
We also wanted to make it much

00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:07.116
easier for MDM servers to use

00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:08.456
the newer, more efficient push

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:10.676
API to communicate with all of

00:27:10.676 --> 00:27:11.816
their enrolled devices.

00:27:12.156 --> 00:27:13.856
So, we now support token-based

00:27:13.856 --> 00:27:16.496
authentication for APNS.

00:27:16.496 --> 00:27:20.106
Now this is not new.

00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:21.536
We talked about this last year,

00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:22.726
but this year, we're actually

00:27:22.726 --> 00:27:24.096
enforcing that if you're using a

00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:26.406
device enrollment, those devices

00:27:26.536 --> 00:27:28.136
will be supervised and

00:27:28.136 --> 00:27:29.436
enrollment will be mandatory.

00:27:30.376 --> 00:27:31.436
And this year, we're taking the

00:27:31.436 --> 00:27:32.986
opportunity to further deprecate

00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:34.656
the allow pairing key, because

00:27:34.656 --> 00:27:36.186
that sets that value permanently

00:27:36.186 --> 00:27:37.186
at enrollment time.

00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:39.386
Instead, we recommend using the

00:27:39.386 --> 00:27:41.026
existing configuration profile

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.306
restriction, which can be

00:27:42.306 --> 00:27:43.366
changed at any time.

00:27:43.366 --> 00:27:46.986
Now I'd like to turn to a number

00:27:46.986 --> 00:27:49.836
of macOS-specific topics related

00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:51.176
to, again, mitigating the

00:27:51.176 --> 00:27:52.436
impacts of various security

00:27:52.436 --> 00:27:53.856
improvements on manageability.

00:27:54.546 --> 00:27:55.736
The first, a security

00:27:55.736 --> 00:27:57.426
improvement introduced in Mojave

00:27:57.546 --> 00:27:59.346
that made it more difficult to

00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:00.846
enable remote management when

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:01.986
configuring new Macs.

00:28:02.706 --> 00:28:05.416
In macOS X.14.4, we added a pair

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.886
of new commands that enable you

00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:08.786
to enable remote desktop

00:28:08.786 --> 00:28:11.416
management via two MDM commands,

00:28:12.336 --> 00:28:13.676
and they also configure the most

00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:14.946
common options that you'll need

00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:16.366
for ongoing management of those

00:28:16.366 --> 00:28:17.876
Macs, using Remote Desktop.

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:22.666
We also wanted to allow you to

00:28:23.046 --> 00:28:24.536
use your mobile accounts with

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.836
Macs using FileVault.

00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:27.846
So, there's a new capability

00:28:27.846 --> 00:28:29.876
that MDM servers can manage a

00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.086
new bootstrap token.

00:28:31.766 --> 00:28:33.096
They asked the client Mac for

00:28:33.096 --> 00:28:34.676
that token, and then escrow it

00:28:34.676 --> 00:28:35.676
themselves.

00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:37.646
Then whenever a new user signs

00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:39.426
in on that Mac, it will request

00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:40.836
the bootstrap token from the MDM

00:28:40.836 --> 00:28:42.556
server and use it to generate

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:44.036
the SecureToken needed to mount

00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:45.336
the file systems and boot the

00:28:45.336 --> 00:28:45.466
Mac.

00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:48.546
[ Applause ]

00:28:49.046 --> 00:28:50.186
We think this will great for

00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:51.596
helping with password changes in

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.376
your organization.

00:28:53.006 --> 00:28:55.996
Now the privacy policy payload

00:28:55.996 --> 00:28:58.226
is not new in Catalina, though

00:28:58.226 --> 00:28:59.906
it's also a great example of a

00:28:59.906 --> 00:29:01.506
way that we help you mitigate

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.126
the impact of important security

00:29:03.126 --> 00:29:04.426
enhancements on your ability to

00:29:04.426 --> 00:29:06.316
manage Apple devices, and

00:29:06.316 --> 00:29:07.226
there's some new security

00:29:07.226 --> 00:29:08.926
enhancements in macOS Catalina

00:29:08.926 --> 00:29:10.516
that are now also configurable

00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:11.436
using this policy.

00:29:11.986 --> 00:29:13.606
For example, enabling keyloggers

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:14.486
or screen recording in the

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:16.806
background, or whitelisting your

00:29:16.806 --> 00:29:18.046
internal apps that you don't

00:29:18.046 --> 00:29:19.716
want to notarize, so that they

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:20.996
continue to run, even though

00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:22.786
macOS Catalina requires that

00:29:22.786 --> 00:29:24.186
apps and text be notarized.

00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:29.866
Next, there is a new change that

00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:32.066
is new in macOS, Catalina,

00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:33.496
where, again, we're tweaking the

00:29:33.496 --> 00:29:34.686
balance between security

00:29:34.686 --> 00:29:35.616
manageability.

00:29:36.236 --> 00:29:38.476
Enabling FileVault via MDM now

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:39.906
requires user-approved MDM

00:29:39.906 --> 00:29:41.816
enrollments, which means you can

00:29:41.816 --> 00:29:43.626
no longer pass off credentials

00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:45.286
on the command line's fdesetup.

00:29:45.966 --> 00:29:47.006
So, you should review your

00:29:47.006 --> 00:29:48.556
scripts and MDM agents if you

00:29:48.556 --> 00:29:50.196
have one in your MDM product, to

00:29:50.196 --> 00:29:51.456
be prepared for this change.

00:29:51.906 --> 00:29:54.676
Next, I think I heard there's

00:29:54.676 --> 00:29:55.976
been a lot of excitement about

00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:57.426
Activation Lock coming to T2

00:29:57.426 --> 00:29:58.906
Macs and macOS Catalina.

00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:00.096
So, of course, we made this

00:30:00.096 --> 00:30:02.096
manageable via MDM, just like

00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:02.336
iOS.

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:05.146
In fact, your MDM servers will

00:30:05.146 --> 00:30:06.966
use the same endpoint in API as

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:07.216
iOS.

00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:09.846
Those APIs will be available

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:11.226
soon, and service fully

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:12.816
available later this summer.

00:30:12.816 --> 00:30:13.976
So, you can test your

00:30:13.976 --> 00:30:15.406
implementation and have it ready

00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:16.516
when that kept a Catalina ships

00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:17.186
later this fall.

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:20.696
[ Applause ]

00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:24.976
It's a big deal.

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:26.576
Again, a couple of changes to

00:30:26.576 --> 00:30:27.836
tweak that balance.

00:30:28.056 --> 00:30:29.646
We're deprecating in macOS

00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:31.216
Catalina, although all of these

00:30:31.216 --> 00:30:32.316
capabilities will continue to

00:30:32.316 --> 00:30:34.746
work in Catalina, starting with

00:30:34.746 --> 00:30:36.236
silent profile installation from

00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:37.016
the command line.

00:30:38.316 --> 00:30:39.926
With Screen Time coming to macOS

00:30:39.926 --> 00:30:41.736
and Catalina, we are deprecating

00:30:41.736 --> 00:30:43.386
path-based app black and

00:30:43.386 --> 00:30:44.616
whitelists that are currently

00:30:44.616 --> 00:30:45.906
configured using the parental

00:30:45.906 --> 00:30:47.356
controls application access

00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:47.816
payload.

00:30:48.936 --> 00:30:50.456
And if your MDM server is still

00:30:50.456 --> 00:30:52.286
using the outdated user channel

00:30:52.286 --> 00:30:53.836
only enrollments, you should

00:30:53.836 --> 00:30:54.626
move to the modern

00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:56.126
macOS-specific enrollments that

00:30:56.126 --> 00:30:57.326
are required for user

00:30:57.326 --> 00:30:59.096
enrollments and also will be for

00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:00.686
any future enhancements to macOS

00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:01.596
device management.

00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:05.916
Can we get a finely for the

00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:06.366
slide?

00:31:07.446 --> 00:31:08.336
I've been showing a version of

00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:09.486
this for I don't want to say how

00:31:09.486 --> 00:31:10.846
many years, but this year, in

00:31:11.026 --> 00:31:13.196
iOS 13 we will stop honoring the

00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:14.886
list of restrictions created

00:31:14.886 --> 00:31:16.336
before supervision existed,

00:31:16.536 --> 00:31:17.306
which really should be

00:31:17.306 --> 00:31:20.046
supervised only, but there'll be

00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:21.406
some grandfathering to make the

00:31:21.406 --> 00:31:22.776
transition a bit easier for

00:31:22.776 --> 00:31:24.096
organizations relying on these

00:31:24.096 --> 00:31:24.816
restrictions.

00:31:25.336 --> 00:31:27.486
For unsupervised devices with

00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:28.916
these restrictions enforced on

00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:31.016
iOS 12, when they're upgraded to

00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:32.756
iOS 13, they will remain in

00:31:32.756 --> 00:31:34.656
force, but they will not be

00:31:34.656 --> 00:31:36.236
honored on those unsupervised

00:31:36.236 --> 00:31:37.926
devices if you backup and then

00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:39.366
restore to that device or

00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:40.816
another unsupervised device.

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:43.746
This means that MDM servers need

00:31:43.746 --> 00:31:44.616
to stop sending these

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:45.796
restrictions to unsupervised

00:31:45.796 --> 00:31:46.906
devices, because they will no

00:31:46.906 --> 00:31:47.716
longer be honored.

00:31:50.596 --> 00:31:52.146
Bob explained that user

00:31:52.146 --> 00:31:53.246
enrollment does not support the

00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:54.966
unlock token, and we're also

00:31:54.966 --> 00:31:56.276
making some changes device

00:31:56.276 --> 00:31:57.796
enrollment related to it.

00:31:58.236 --> 00:31:59.436
Specifically, though, this is

00:31:59.436 --> 00:32:00.996
not new best practice.

00:32:01.036 --> 00:32:02.406
I always advise that you get the

00:32:02.406 --> 00:32:03.696
unlock token as soon as you need

00:32:03.696 --> 00:32:04.476
it and remember it.

00:32:04.476 --> 00:32:06.756
It will now only be available in

00:32:06.756 --> 00:32:07.996
the first successful token

00:32:07.996 --> 00:32:09.106
update after enrollment.

00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:12.036
Similarly, devices which have

00:32:12.036 --> 00:32:13.476
been paired and supervised with

00:32:13.476 --> 00:32:15.506
Apple Configurator, you still

00:32:15.506 --> 00:32:16.876
need to get the unlock token

00:32:16.876 --> 00:32:18.436
before you set a passcode on

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.136
that device.

00:32:19.686 --> 00:32:21.866
So, that brings us to the end of

00:32:21.866 --> 00:32:23.596
our second section of content,

00:32:24.086 --> 00:32:26.146
and I'd like to now turn to some

00:32:26.146 --> 00:32:27.586
new device capabilities that

00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:29.016
allow you to continue using

00:32:29.016 --> 00:32:30.276
services you're already using

00:32:30.276 --> 00:32:31.426
while adding some great new

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:33.226
Apple services to help Apple

00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:34.336
devices stand out in your

00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:34.966
organization.

00:32:35.666 --> 00:32:36.946
The first one is another really

00:32:36.946 --> 00:32:38.296
big deal that Craig highlighted

00:32:38.296 --> 00:32:40.176
in Monday's keynote, and I'd

00:32:40.176 --> 00:32:41.376
like to ask Matt Chanda to come

00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:42.706
on stage and tell you all about

00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:43.526
Single Sign-On.

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:43.896
Matt?

00:32:44.516 --> 00:32:50.216
[ Applause ]

00:32:50.716 --> 00:32:51.346
>> Thanks, Todd.

00:32:52.156 --> 00:32:53.086
Good morning, my name's Matt

00:32:53.086 --> 00:32:54.566
Chanda, and I am a consulting

00:32:54.566 --> 00:32:55.686
engineer and part of the team

00:32:55.686 --> 00:32:57.036
that created Single Sign-On.

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.426
As you know, almost all

00:32:59.426 --> 00:33:00.896
enterprise apps and websites

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.096
need to authenticate in order to

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:02.486
function.

00:33:03.306 --> 00:33:04.806
These apps connect the systems

00:33:04.806 --> 00:33:06.396
of record either in the cloud,

00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:09.066
on premise, and sometimes both.

00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:11.396
Recently though, authentication

00:33:11.396 --> 00:33:12.086
has been getting more

00:33:12.086 --> 00:33:12.796
complicated.

00:33:13.406 --> 00:33:14.406
You have to handle multiple

00:33:14.406 --> 00:33:15.926
authentication protocols such as

00:33:15.926 --> 00:33:19.186
Kerberos, OpenID Connect, and

00:33:20.376 --> 00:33:20.726
SAML.

00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:21.726
You're now federated to the

00:33:21.726 --> 00:33:23.476
cloud, and you need to trust

00:33:23.476 --> 00:33:25.186
your devices and use more than

00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:26.026
just passwords for

00:33:26.026 --> 00:33:26.706
authentication.

00:33:27.446 --> 00:33:29.426
So, how do organizations deal

00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:30.356
with these challenges?

00:33:31.026 --> 00:33:32.306
Well, they use Single Sign-On to

00:33:32.306 --> 00:33:32.546
help.

00:33:33.086 --> 00:33:36.366
When they use Single Sign-On,

00:33:36.366 --> 00:33:37.716
they have a suite of apps and

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:40.086
websites that they log in once

00:33:40.086 --> 00:33:42.116
too, and is reused across all of

00:33:42.116 --> 00:33:42.206
them.

00:33:43.176 --> 00:33:44.576
Organizations will also use this

00:33:44.576 --> 00:33:46.096
to improve the user experience

00:33:46.096 --> 00:33:48.186
of authentication, avoid the

00:33:48.186 --> 00:33:50.076
user friction of signing in over

00:33:50.076 --> 00:33:50.776
and over again.

00:33:52.146 --> 00:33:53.606
Some organizations just don't

00:33:53.606 --> 00:33:54.436
have passwords.

00:33:55.016 --> 00:33:55.966
So, they have to use Single

00:33:55.966 --> 00:33:57.886
Sign-On to authenticate, and the

00:33:57.886 --> 00:33:59.586
challenge is that not every

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:01.646
application supports their

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:03.446
authentication stack.

00:34:05.496 --> 00:34:08.226
And, with all the risks these

00:34:08.226 --> 00:34:10.126
days, you want to supplement

00:34:10.126 --> 00:34:11.436
your authentication processes

00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:12.746
with trust score data and other

00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:13.985
information about the device

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.235
that you're running on.

00:34:16.216 --> 00:34:17.536
So, today I'd like to tell you

00:34:17.536 --> 00:34:18.716
about the powerful new Single

00:34:18.716 --> 00:34:20.146
Sign-On capabilities we added to

00:34:20.146 --> 00:34:22.676
both iOS 13 and macOS Catalina.

00:34:23.755 --> 00:34:25.196
It's enabled by the extensible

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:27.666
SSO MDM profile, as well as

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:29.406
associated domains, and it works

00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:30.585
great with user enrollment, as

00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:30.815
well.

00:34:32.065 --> 00:34:33.496
The extension has the option to

00:34:33.496 --> 00:34:37.255
show UI, load a webpage, or just

00:34:37.255 --> 00:34:38.516
handle the request silently.

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:41.516
We think these changes will help

00:34:41.516 --> 00:34:44.735
you use and create SSO solutions

00:34:45.156 --> 00:34:46.446
that are both secure and

00:34:46.446 --> 00:34:47.076
user-friendly.

00:34:47.676 --> 00:34:49.255
So, in our session today, I will

00:34:49.255 --> 00:34:50.255
provide a summary of Single

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:51.536
Sign-On and how it works.

00:34:52.206 --> 00:34:53.376
For more detail, look for a

00:34:53.376 --> 00:34:54.565
recorded session after the

00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:55.985
conference with code samples and

00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:56.616
more information.

00:34:57.096 --> 00:35:01.026
Earlier this week, you heard

00:35:01.026 --> 00:35:02.446
about an awesome new feature for

00:35:02.696 --> 00:35:04.246
consumer apps called Sign in

00:35:04.246 --> 00:35:04.766
with Apple.

00:35:05.216 --> 00:35:06.226
This is going to be great for

00:35:06.226 --> 00:35:07.306
consumer apps, but they don't

00:35:07.306 --> 00:35:08.336
support all the complex

00:35:08.336 --> 00:35:09.926
scenarios that are needed for

00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:11.396
enterprise applications.

00:35:12.606 --> 00:35:14.126
So, Single Sign-On is different,

00:35:14.336 --> 00:35:15.656
and it's intended for

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:17.296
third-party identity providers,

00:35:17.296 --> 00:35:19.396
such as Microsoft, Okta, Ping,

00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:19.946
and others.

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:22.696
In addition, you should know

00:35:22.696 --> 00:35:24.036
that managed Apple IDs will not

00:35:24.036 --> 00:35:28.276
work with Sign In with Apple.

00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:30.236
Okay, so, in order to make

00:35:30.236 --> 00:35:31.896
Single Sign-On work, you need to

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.546
have a set of apps and websites,

00:35:34.136 --> 00:35:35.386
and you have to have an identity

00:35:35.386 --> 00:35:36.466
provider that they're set up to

00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:36.926
use.

00:35:37.376 --> 00:35:38.686
And then, what glues it together

00:35:38.686 --> 00:35:40.026
will be the new Single Sign-On

00:35:40.026 --> 00:35:40.606
extension.

00:35:41.616 --> 00:35:42.626
So, we'll focus on the Single

00:35:42.626 --> 00:35:43.926
Sign-On extension today.

00:35:43.926 --> 00:35:47.546
All right, so how does it work?

00:35:48.436 --> 00:35:49.406
There are two types of

00:35:49.406 --> 00:35:50.926
extensions, redirect and

00:35:50.926 --> 00:35:51.326
credential.

00:35:52.336 --> 00:35:53.396
So, let's start with redirect

00:35:53.396 --> 00:35:53.856
extensions.

00:35:54.446 --> 00:35:58.086
Redirect extensions are intended

00:35:58.086 --> 00:35:59.486
for modern authentication

00:35:59.486 --> 00:36:00.286
protocols, such as

00:36:00.286 --> 00:36:02.356
OpenIDConnect, OAuth 2, or SAML.

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:04.496
They will run on top of web

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:05.886
technologies, and they

00:36:05.886 --> 00:36:06.826
frequently are paired with

00:36:06.826 --> 00:36:08.346
Federation to on-premise or

00:36:08.346 --> 00:36:09.276
cloud systems for

00:36:09.276 --> 00:36:10.016
authentication.

00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:14.546
Let's check out an example of

00:36:15.276 --> 00:36:15.606
the flow.

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.816
With Safari, we will route a

00:36:17.816 --> 00:36:19.526
request to the Single Sign-On

00:36:19.526 --> 00:36:20.976
extension instead of loading the

00:36:20.976 --> 00:36:21.676
webpage.

00:36:23.436 --> 00:36:25.066
The extension will receive the

00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:27.306
headers, the body, and the URL

00:36:27.306 --> 00:36:27.996
of the request.

00:36:29.196 --> 00:36:30.596
It's now up to the extension to

00:36:30.596 --> 00:36:31.756
complete the authentication

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:32.946
process with the identity

00:36:32.946 --> 00:36:33.396
provider.

00:36:34.566 --> 00:36:37.236
And when ready, it will return a

00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:39.396
URL response back to Safari.

00:36:40.846 --> 00:36:41.776
Please take note that this

00:36:41.776 --> 00:36:43.266
response should not be large.

00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:45.666
It's intended for a web form

00:36:45.716 --> 00:36:48.146
post of SAML response or other

00:36:48.146 --> 00:36:49.406
tokens back to the server.

00:36:49.776 --> 00:36:51.126
Don't try to load a giant, 1-meg

00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:51.856
webpage in it.

00:36:56.046 --> 00:36:57.556
So, what can these extensions

00:36:57.556 --> 00:36:57.956
do?

00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:59.566
They can do a lot of things.

00:36:59.756 --> 00:37:01.616
I've listed a few of them here.

00:37:01.906 --> 00:37:02.896
They can choose to present a

00:37:02.896 --> 00:37:04.576
native screen for authentication

00:37:04.646 --> 00:37:06.106
instead of loading the webpage.

00:37:06.906 --> 00:37:07.776
The native screen could ask for

00:37:07.776 --> 00:37:08.906
the username and password if

00:37:08.906 --> 00:37:10.576
that applies, or it can ask for

00:37:10.576 --> 00:37:12.166
additional multi-factors, as

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.986
your requirements dictate.

00:37:15.876 --> 00:37:17.426
If you've generated keys with

00:37:17.426 --> 00:37:19.386
the secure enclave, perhaps they

00:37:19.386 --> 00:37:20.796
can sign attributes and send it

00:37:20.796 --> 00:37:21.886
along with the request to

00:37:21.886 --> 00:37:23.976
strongly pair the device with

00:37:23.976 --> 00:37:25.516
the user, so that you have that

00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:27.636
extra confidence in the request.

00:37:28.856 --> 00:37:30.016
Other trust score values could

00:37:30.016 --> 00:37:31.326
be appended, such as the version

00:37:31.326 --> 00:37:32.386
of the operating system running

00:37:32.386 --> 00:37:33.706
on the device or whatever else

00:37:33.706 --> 00:37:36.086
you need to feel good about it.

00:37:37.186 --> 00:37:39.826
It could simply load a webpage

00:37:39.826 --> 00:37:40.996
and follow the redirects for

00:37:40.996 --> 00:37:42.596
Federation, and that's going to

00:37:42.596 --> 00:37:44.546
be a very common scenario.

00:37:45.756 --> 00:37:47.686
And with the new FIDO2

00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:49.826
capabilities in macOS this year,

00:37:49.826 --> 00:37:51.656
it could use web authentication

00:37:51.656 --> 00:37:52.886
to authenticate the device, as

00:37:52.886 --> 00:37:54.276
well, if your identity provider

00:37:54.276 --> 00:37:55.486
supports it.

00:37:56.296 --> 00:37:57.636
For more information on web

00:37:57.636 --> 00:37:59.286
authentication, see the What's

00:37:59.286 --> 00:38:00.666
New in Authentication session in

00:38:00.666 --> 00:38:01.606
this year's conference.

00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:05.336
Redirect extensions will also

00:38:05.336 --> 00:38:06.376
work for native apps.

00:38:07.246 --> 00:38:08.626
Native apps have an additional

00:38:08.626 --> 00:38:09.466
capability though.

00:38:09.596 --> 00:38:11.236
They can send operations to the

00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:11.766
extension.

00:38:12.696 --> 00:38:14.656
These operations would be, or

00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:16.746
examples are login, refresh

00:38:16.746 --> 00:38:18.006
tokens, or logout.

00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:20.716
This way, the app developers can

00:38:20.716 --> 00:38:22.486
decide when does authentication

00:38:22.576 --> 00:38:23.736
fit within the flow of my

00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:24.426
application?

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.576
And hopefully, the extension

00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:27.756
will accommodate that.

00:38:28.266 --> 00:38:30.166
And for the enterprise

00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:31.896
developers in the audience, this

00:38:31.896 --> 00:38:33.086
means you can effectively use

00:38:33.086 --> 00:38:34.886
the extension as your identity

00:38:34.886 --> 00:38:36.316
library or authentication

00:38:36.316 --> 00:38:36.736
library.

00:38:37.946 --> 00:38:39.376
It avoids the need to include a

00:38:39.376 --> 00:38:40.886
copy of the library in every app

00:38:40.886 --> 00:38:42.036
that you have and then

00:38:42.036 --> 00:38:43.356
subsequently maintaining it over

00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:43.716
time.

00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:48.031
[ Applause ]

00:38:48.046 --> 00:38:48.526
It'll be great.

00:38:51.476 --> 00:38:52.696
So, let's check out the flow for

00:38:52.696 --> 00:38:53.706
native app.

00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:57.126
The native app will send the

00:38:57.126 --> 00:38:58.646
operation to the extension

00:38:58.646 --> 00:39:00.246
instead of the URL request.

00:39:00.246 --> 00:39:01.656
In this example, it's login.

00:39:02.096 --> 00:39:04.336
The extension is still

00:39:04.336 --> 00:39:05.506
responsible for completing the

00:39:05.506 --> 00:39:07.026
authentication process with the

00:39:07.026 --> 00:39:09.416
identity provider, and when

00:39:09.416 --> 00:39:10.656
ready, it will return the URL

00:39:10.656 --> 00:39:11.986
response, but really, most

00:39:11.986 --> 00:39:13.246
importantly, the tokens that are

00:39:13.246 --> 00:39:14.636
needed by that application that

00:39:14.636 --> 00:39:16.136
they requested, in order to

00:39:16.376 --> 00:39:17.676
process and work correctly,

00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:19.426
think ID tokens and access

00:39:19.456 --> 00:39:20.856
tokens for consuming other

00:39:20.856 --> 00:39:21.326
services.

00:39:21.806 --> 00:39:24.906
Now that we know what it does,

00:39:25.146 --> 00:39:26.426
let's talk about what we need to

00:39:26.426 --> 00:39:27.236
do to make it work.

00:39:27.916 --> 00:39:31.706
It is enabled by the extensible

00:39:31.706 --> 00:39:34.586
SSO profile in iOS 13 and macOS

00:39:34.586 --> 00:39:35.106
Catalina.

00:39:36.616 --> 00:39:37.606
Check out the example here.

00:39:37.606 --> 00:39:39.156
The identifier is

00:39:39.156 --> 00:39:41.376
com.apple.extensiblesso.

00:39:41.976 --> 00:39:45.456
It specifies the specific

00:39:45.456 --> 00:39:46.776
extension that you want to use

00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:48.046
in your environment, including

00:39:48.046 --> 00:39:48.996
the team identifier.

00:39:50.456 --> 00:39:52.696
It lists the type, in this case,

00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:56.756
redirect, as well as the list of

00:39:56.756 --> 00:39:59.136
URLs that will be redirected to

00:39:59.136 --> 00:39:59.576
the extension.

00:40:03.156 --> 00:40:04.946
And finally, an optional

00:40:04.946 --> 00:40:07.216
dictionary of extension-specific

00:40:07.216 --> 00:40:08.156
values from the MDM.

00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:10.146
In this example, I'm sending a

00:40:10.146 --> 00:40:11.226
user name, but you can put

00:40:11.226 --> 00:40:12.186
whatever you need in there.

00:40:15.876 --> 00:40:17.496
The second requirement is to use

00:40:17.496 --> 00:40:18.656
associated domains.

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:20.856
You're required to use

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:22.086
associated domains because you

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.406
can't just redirect any

00:40:23.406 --> 00:40:24.726
authentication traffic on the

00:40:24.726 --> 00:40:25.836
device to your extension.

00:40:26.756 --> 00:40:29.266
You can only redirect traffic

00:40:29.266 --> 00:40:30.936
that is owned by you or your

00:40:30.936 --> 00:40:31.786
identity provider.

00:40:33.796 --> 00:40:34.846
So, in order to set up

00:40:34.846 --> 00:40:36.806
associated domains, you need to

00:40:36.806 --> 00:40:38.866
use the offserve service type,

00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:40.526
followed by a colon, and then,

00:40:40.526 --> 00:40:41.996
each of the host names in the

00:40:41.996 --> 00:40:42.936
URL list that we saw in the

00:40:42.936 --> 00:40:43.646
previous slides.

00:40:43.646 --> 00:40:47.626
If your app has multiple hosts,

00:40:47.816 --> 00:40:49.096
then you need to list each one

00:40:49.096 --> 00:40:50.446
separately in the file.

00:40:53.156 --> 00:40:54.976
Associated Domains also requires

00:40:54.976 --> 00:40:57.476
that the host app ID is in the

00:40:57.476 --> 00:40:59.356
Apple app site association file

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:00.786
that on the destination server.

00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:03.676
The server must be accessible by

00:41:03.676 --> 00:41:05.596
the device and have a valid SSL

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:05.966
cert.

00:41:07.046 --> 00:41:08.396
User-approved or custom root

00:41:08.396 --> 00:41:09.796
certificates are not supported.

00:41:12.076 --> 00:41:14.096
However, in some cases, the

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.886
associated domains are not known

00:41:15.886 --> 00:41:16.816
at the time the app is

00:41:16.816 --> 00:41:17.306
developed.

00:41:18.146 --> 00:41:20.076
A great example of this is when

00:41:20.076 --> 00:41:21.706
an identity provider develops an

00:41:21.706 --> 00:41:25.626
extension, but each customer's

00:41:25.626 --> 00:41:26.666
hostname is different.

00:41:26.996 --> 00:41:28.046
They can't list thousands of

00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.256
them in an entitlement file.

00:41:29.256 --> 00:41:30.176
It just won't happen.

00:41:30.806 --> 00:41:32.166
When this occurs, we can use the

00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:33.786
new Manage Associated Domains

00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:35.376
profile on macOS.

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:39.396
In the example here, note that

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:41.956
the payload value is the same as

00:41:41.956 --> 00:41:42.756
what would've been in the

00:41:42.756 --> 00:41:45.216
entitlement file that was on the

00:41:45.766 --> 00:41:48.156
app that was developed.

00:41:48.156 --> 00:41:49.546
On iOS, you can use a new

00:41:49.546 --> 00:41:51.276
associated domains application

00:41:51.276 --> 00:41:53.906
attribute, and again, note that

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:56.696
the value of the attribute is

00:41:56.696 --> 00:41:57.596
the same as what would've been

00:41:57.596 --> 00:41:58.836
in the entitlements file in the

00:41:58.906 --> 00:42:00.616
host app that would happen.

00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:03.896
The last step for using managed

00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:06.176
associated domains is to include

00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:07.946
the managed associated domain's

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:10.556
entitlement in the host apps

00:42:10.556 --> 00:42:10.946
file.

00:42:11.106 --> 00:42:12.256
This lets us know that you want

00:42:12.256 --> 00:42:13.566
to use the managed values, in

00:42:13.566 --> 00:42:14.566
addition to what you already

00:42:14.566 --> 00:42:15.966
have inside the entitlement

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:16.306
file.

00:42:17.606 --> 00:42:18.936
The associated domain's array

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:21.466
has to be present and not empty,

00:42:22.466 --> 00:42:23.546
and you can even have other

00:42:23.546 --> 00:42:24.866
values in there already, and we

00:42:24.866 --> 00:42:26.936
will pin the ones from the MDM

00:42:26.936 --> 00:42:28.426
into the list there for you to

00:42:28.426 --> 00:42:29.506
use.

00:42:30.276 --> 00:42:31.866
For more details on associated

00:42:31.866 --> 00:42:33.996
domains, how to use them, check

00:42:33.996 --> 00:42:35.306
out the What's New in Universal

00:42:35.306 --> 00:42:36.406
Links session in this year's

00:42:36.406 --> 00:42:36.956
conference.

00:42:41.216 --> 00:42:42.146
All right, and that completes

00:42:42.146 --> 00:42:43.246
redirect extensions.

00:42:44.366 --> 00:42:45.096
So, now let's shift to

00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:46.276
credential extensions.

00:42:48.936 --> 00:42:50.346
Credential extensions are

00:42:50.346 --> 00:42:50.876
intended for

00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:52.486
challenge-response-type

00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:53.896
authentication flows, and a

00:42:53.896 --> 00:42:54.926
great example of this is

00:42:54.926 --> 00:42:55.566
Kerberos.

00:42:56.876 --> 00:42:58.296
These flows are different than

00:42:58.296 --> 00:43:00.176
redirects, because the client

00:43:00.176 --> 00:43:01.606
will request the data and then

00:43:01.606 --> 00:43:02.566
they are challenged for

00:43:02.566 --> 00:43:03.326
authentication.

00:43:04.446 --> 00:43:07.286
Whereas redirect extensions, the

00:43:07.286 --> 00:43:08.906
client will proactively go out

00:43:08.906 --> 00:43:10.496
and retrieve tokens before

00:43:10.496 --> 00:43:12.296
they're needed and then use

00:43:12.296 --> 00:43:12.466
them.

00:43:14.056 --> 00:43:15.136
We also support custom

00:43:15.136 --> 00:43:16.626
authentication challenges for

00:43:17.366 --> 00:43:17.486
this.

00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:20.836
Credential extensions are

00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:21.696
different in redirect

00:43:21.696 --> 00:43:23.446
extensions, in that they receive

00:43:23.446 --> 00:43:24.756
HTTP challenge from the

00:43:24.756 --> 00:43:25.936
operating system and not the

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:26.506
request.

00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:29.156
The challenge will include the

00:43:29.156 --> 00:43:30.586
URL and the headers that were

00:43:30.586 --> 00:43:31.116
returned.

00:43:31.616 --> 00:43:34.136
The MDM profile will contain a

00:43:34.136 --> 00:43:36.896
list of hosts or host suffixes

00:43:37.476 --> 00:43:38.936
that applies to that extension.

00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:41.176
So, for example, if you have

00:43:41.266 --> 00:43:43.246
.example.com, it'll be treated

00:43:43.246 --> 00:43:44.736
as a suffix.

00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:47.606
Operations are also supported

00:43:47.606 --> 00:43:49.286
for credential-mode extensions,

00:43:50.356 --> 00:43:51.756
and there's not an associated

00:43:51.756 --> 00:43:55.576
domain requirement for them.

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:56.696
Okay, so let's check out the

00:43:56.696 --> 00:43:57.036
flow.

00:43:58.436 --> 00:43:59.986
In Safari, or your native app,

00:43:59.986 --> 00:44:01.116
it'll make a request to a

00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:01.586
server.

00:44:02.756 --> 00:44:04.216
The server will return an

00:44:04.216 --> 00:44:06.676
authentication challenge back to

00:44:06.676 --> 00:44:07.796
the operating system, which we

00:44:07.796 --> 00:44:08.946
will route to the extension.

00:44:10.006 --> 00:44:11.346
Just like the other extensions,

00:44:11.346 --> 00:44:14.126
it is required that it completes

00:44:14.126 --> 00:44:15.516
the authentication process with

00:44:15.516 --> 00:44:17.166
the identity provider or the

00:44:17.166 --> 00:44:18.726
authentication servers, whatever

00:44:18.726 --> 00:44:20.726
it may be.

00:44:20.966 --> 00:44:22.546
And when ready, the extension

00:44:22.546 --> 00:44:25.416
will return the headers back to

00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:26.496
the operating system, which will

00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:27.936
get sent back to the server, and

00:44:28.436 --> 00:44:29.916
assuming the server accepts it,

00:44:30.086 --> 00:44:31.236
the data will be returned back

00:44:31.236 --> 00:44:33.026
to the calling app that's

00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:33.336
needed.

00:44:33.606 --> 00:44:36.356
And that's the flow for

00:44:36.356 --> 00:44:37.466
credential extensions.

00:44:37.946 --> 00:44:39.516
And now for a demo of credential

00:44:39.516 --> 00:44:40.556
mode extensions, I'd like to

00:44:40.556 --> 00:44:42.016
call my colleague, Rick Lemmon.

00:44:42.256 --> 00:44:42.486
Rick?

00:44:43.516 --> 00:44:47.766
[ Applause ]

00:44:48.266 --> 00:44:49.406
>> Hey, thanks a lot, Matt.

00:44:49.906 --> 00:44:51.306
Hi everybody, my name's Rick

00:44:51.306 --> 00:44:52.616
Lemmon, and I'm an engineer on

00:44:52.616 --> 00:44:53.866
the Apple Professional Services

00:44:53.866 --> 00:44:54.026
Team.

00:44:55.076 --> 00:44:56.386
Today, I'd like to demonstrate a

00:44:56.386 --> 00:44:57.726
credential mode extension to you

00:44:58.536 --> 00:44:59.136
that we've built.

00:44:59.776 --> 00:45:01.246
This extension makes it easy for

00:45:01.246 --> 00:45:02.886
users to use Single Sign-On with

00:45:02.886 --> 00:45:04.086
your apps and websites.

00:45:04.896 --> 00:45:06.046
If you develop a Single Sign-On

00:45:06.046 --> 00:45:08.056
extension, you'll probably

00:45:08.056 --> 00:45:09.436
deliver it to your users as part

00:45:09.436 --> 00:45:10.506
of an app.

00:45:10.506 --> 00:45:12.256
So, this app can be used to

00:45:12.256 --> 00:45:13.836
deliver functionality that might

00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:14.936
not make sense to deliver in

00:45:14.936 --> 00:45:17.456
your extension, such as

00:45:17.456 --> 00:45:18.986
displaying status information to

00:45:18.986 --> 00:45:20.486
the user or allowing them to

00:45:20.486 --> 00:45:21.656
change their password.

00:45:22.276 --> 00:45:24.036
In our extension, what we've

00:45:24.036 --> 00:45:25.676
done is use a menu extra to do

00:45:25.676 --> 00:45:25.846
this.

00:45:25.846 --> 00:45:26.876
So, that's a little great key

00:45:26.876 --> 00:45:27.676
that we see up here.

00:45:28.536 --> 00:45:30.136
So, what I'd like to do now is

00:45:30.136 --> 00:45:31.286
go ahead and sign into the

00:45:31.286 --> 00:45:31.686
extension.

00:45:32.696 --> 00:45:33.966
Let's go ahead and sign in.

00:45:34.556 --> 00:45:36.186
I'm going to go ahead and enter

00:45:36.186 --> 00:45:37.216
my username and password.

00:45:43.056 --> 00:45:45.206
And click sign in.

00:45:45.586 --> 00:45:47.276
Great. Now we're signed in.

00:45:47.666 --> 00:45:48.926
So, let's go back and look at

00:45:48.926 --> 00:45:49.576
the menu extra.

00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:52.516
You'll notice in the menu extra,

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:53.786
we're now displaying some useful

00:45:53.786 --> 00:45:55.156
status information to the user,

00:45:55.906 --> 00:45:57.056
like the user that we're signed

00:45:57.056 --> 00:45:58.396
in as and when our password

00:45:58.396 --> 00:45:58.956
expires.

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:00.706
We also exposed some useful

00:46:00.706 --> 00:46:01.996
functionality, like the ability

00:46:01.996 --> 00:46:03.336
to change your password and sign

00:46:03.336 --> 00:46:03.526
out.

00:46:04.946 --> 00:46:06.466
But now that we're signed into

00:46:06.466 --> 00:46:08.136
the Single Sign-On extension, we

00:46:08.136 --> 00:46:09.746
can use Single Sign-On to access

00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:10.786
websites and apps.

00:46:10.966 --> 00:46:12.176
So, let's go ahead and try a

00:46:12.176 --> 00:46:13.516
sample website that we've built.

00:46:14.456 --> 00:46:16.616
Let's go ahead and, well, load

00:46:16.616 --> 00:46:17.416
the sample website.

00:46:17.416 --> 00:46:20.246
And, excellent.

00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:21.766
You've seen that we've just used

00:46:21.766 --> 00:46:23.046
Single Sign-On to access this

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:24.116
website, and you'll notice, I

00:46:24.116 --> 00:46:25.506
wasn't prompted to authenticate.

00:46:25.986 --> 00:46:26.936
We can see that I'm

00:46:26.936 --> 00:46:28.456
authenticated as the same user

00:46:28.456 --> 00:46:30.896
that I used to sign into the

00:46:30.896 --> 00:46:31.656
extension earlier.

00:46:32.766 --> 00:46:35.136
Let's go ahead and quit Safari,

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:36.626
and let's show you how this

00:46:36.626 --> 00:46:37.936
works from an app.

00:46:38.096 --> 00:46:39.626
I'm going to go ahead and launch

00:46:39.626 --> 00:46:40.956
an app called Image Retriever

00:46:40.956 --> 00:46:41.986
that we wrote for this demo.

00:46:42.556 --> 00:46:43.756
This app is really simple.

00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:46.036
All that it does is connect to a

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:47.376
web server that typically

00:46:47.376 --> 00:46:48.566
requires authentication,

00:46:48.846 --> 00:46:50.696
download an image, and displays

00:46:50.696 --> 00:46:51.096
it.

00:46:52.236 --> 00:46:54.466
Now normally, you'd have to

00:46:54.466 --> 00:46:55.366
implement some sort of

00:46:55.366 --> 00:46:56.656
authentication for this app to

00:46:56.656 --> 00:46:57.986
work, but since we have Single

00:46:57.986 --> 00:46:59.086
Sign-On and in place, we don't

00:46:59.086 --> 00:46:59.236
need to.

00:46:59.236 --> 00:46:59.776
Let me go ahead and click

00:46:59.776 --> 00:46:59.976
display.

00:47:03.326 --> 00:47:03.756
Excellent.

00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:05.556
As you might guess, based on my

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.876
last name, I have something of a

00:47:06.876 --> 00:47:07.846
soft spot for lemons.

00:47:07.846 --> 00:47:09.316
So, our app has gone out,

00:47:09.386 --> 00:47:10.656
connected to a web server,

00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:12.256
authenticated using our Single

00:47:12.256 --> 00:47:13.586
Sign-On extension, and

00:47:13.586 --> 00:47:14.706
downloaded this super-sweet

00:47:14.706 --> 00:47:15.866
image of lemons.

00:47:17.031 --> 00:47:19.031
[ Applause ]

00:47:19.046 --> 00:47:19.246
Thank you.

00:47:20.121 --> 00:47:22.121
[ Applause ]

00:47:22.226 --> 00:47:24.366
So, let me quit Image Retriever

00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:25.516
now, and I'm going to show you

00:47:25.516 --> 00:47:26.826
guys some ways that

00:47:26.826 --> 00:47:28.306
authentication to the extension

00:47:28.306 --> 00:47:28.966
can be triggered.

00:47:30.026 --> 00:47:31.456
To do that, I'll need to sign

00:47:31.456 --> 00:47:32.616
out of the extension, which I'll

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:33.866
do here in the menu extra.

00:47:33.866 --> 00:47:36.506
Now just a note, your users, if

00:47:36.506 --> 00:47:38.366
you make an extension, will need

00:47:38.366 --> 00:47:40.316
to sign out of the extension.

00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:41.676
We're just doing this purely for

00:47:41.676 --> 00:47:42.776
demonstration purposes.

00:47:43.586 --> 00:47:45.836
So, now that I signed out, let's

00:47:45.836 --> 00:47:47.136
go ahead and launch Safari.

00:47:48.716 --> 00:47:49.826
I'll go ahead and click on our

00:47:49.826 --> 00:47:50.336
website.

00:47:51.266 --> 00:47:52.626
You'll notice I was immediately

00:47:52.626 --> 00:47:54.006
prompted to authenticate, which

00:47:54.006 --> 00:47:54.766
I'll go ahead and do.

00:47:59.446 --> 00:48:00.746
And we'll click sign in.

00:48:02.126 --> 00:48:02.526
Excellent.

00:48:02.926 --> 00:48:03.996
You'll notice that as soon as I

00:48:03.996 --> 00:48:05.486
signed in, Safari was able to

00:48:05.486 --> 00:48:06.916
seamlessly authenticate and load

00:48:06.916 --> 00:48:07.496
my website.

00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:09.186
So, I'll go ahead and quit

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:09.636
Safari.

00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:12.186
I will sign out of the

00:48:12.186 --> 00:48:13.706
extension, and we'll try the

00:48:13.706 --> 00:48:14.766
image retriever app again.

00:48:16.106 --> 00:48:17.516
Let's go ahead and click display

00:48:17.636 --> 00:48:18.526
to make the image load.

00:48:19.536 --> 00:48:20.486
You'll notice I'm prompted

00:48:20.486 --> 00:48:20.766
again.

00:48:26.396 --> 00:48:27.026
We'll sign in.

00:48:28.816 --> 00:48:29.746
Excellent.

00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:30.926
Our image of lemons downloaded

00:48:30.926 --> 00:48:31.166
again.

00:48:31.236 --> 00:48:31.976
Thank you.

00:48:32.508 --> 00:48:34.508
[ Applause ]

00:48:38.796 --> 00:48:40.016
Great. So, let's talk a little

00:48:40.016 --> 00:48:41.386
bit more about this particular

00:48:41.386 --> 00:48:41.836
extension.

00:48:42.346 --> 00:48:44.156
So, some of you might see this

00:48:44.156 --> 00:48:45.636
extension and say, you know

00:48:45.636 --> 00:48:46.116
what?

00:48:46.116 --> 00:48:47.426
This could be useful in my own

00:48:47.426 --> 00:48:48.116
organization.

00:48:48.616 --> 00:48:50.216
Well, we agree with you.

00:48:50.706 --> 00:48:51.966
One thing that we haven't told

00:48:51.966 --> 00:48:53.436
you yet is that this extension,

00:48:53.436 --> 00:48:54.706
behind the scenes, is using

00:48:54.706 --> 00:48:56.246
Kerberos and Active Directory.

00:48:57.386 --> 00:48:58.956
And so, we're thrilled to

00:48:58.956 --> 00:49:02.046
announce that this extension

00:49:02.046 --> 00:49:03.506
will be included with macOS

00:49:03.506 --> 00:49:05.866
Catalina, iOS13, and iPadOS.

00:49:06.516 --> 00:49:12.866
[ Applause ]

00:49:13.366 --> 00:49:13.986
Thank you.

00:49:14.156 --> 00:49:15.776
This extension is based on

00:49:15.776 --> 00:49:17.376
Enterprise Connect, an Active

00:49:17.376 --> 00:49:18.846
Directory integration solution

00:49:18.846 --> 00:49:20.066
that some of you may already be

00:49:20.176 --> 00:49:20.466
using.

00:49:20.766 --> 00:49:22.496
It provides an easy way to

00:49:22.496 --> 00:49:23.576
integrate your devices with

00:49:23.576 --> 00:49:24.366
Active Directory.

00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:26.716
On top of providing Kerberos

00:49:26.716 --> 00:49:28.316
support, it helps you manage

00:49:28.316 --> 00:49:30.046
your Active Directory password,

00:49:30.276 --> 00:49:32.076
and on macOS, helps you keep

00:49:32.076 --> 00:49:33.356
your local and active directory

00:49:33.356 --> 00:49:34.326
passwords in sync.

00:49:35.086 --> 00:49:37.036
Also, on top of authenticating

00:49:37.036 --> 00:49:37.946
through the extension with the

00:49:37.946 --> 00:49:39.726
username and password, you can

00:49:39.726 --> 00:49:40.836
use the certificate-based

00:49:40.836 --> 00:49:42.756
identity, or on macOS, you can

00:49:42.756 --> 00:49:43.496
use a smart card.

00:49:44.286 --> 00:49:45.356
We think this extension will

00:49:45.356 --> 00:49:47.026
help many of you more easily use

00:49:47.056 --> 00:49:48.476
Kerberos and Active Directory in

00:49:48.476 --> 00:49:49.486
your organizations.

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:52.636
And that concludes

00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:53.766
credential-based Single Sign-On

00:49:53.766 --> 00:49:54.386
extensions.

00:49:55.866 --> 00:49:57.376
So, let's summarize.

00:49:57.946 --> 00:49:59.196
We're really looking forward to

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:00.446
seeing what kind of extensions

00:50:00.446 --> 00:50:02.236
you built, out the Single

00:50:02.236 --> 00:50:03.996
Sign-On session for additional

00:50:03.996 --> 00:50:05.206
detail on making your own

00:50:05.206 --> 00:50:05.786
extensions.

00:50:05.886 --> 00:50:07.926
It will be posted to the WWDC

00:50:07.926 --> 00:50:09.396
site after the conference, and

00:50:09.396 --> 00:50:10.436
now I'll hand it back to Todd.

Thank you very much, Matt and

00:50:19.656 --> 00:50:19.766
Rick.

00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:20.836
Just have a few more words about

00:50:20.836 --> 00:50:22.696
associated domains, which, as

00:50:22.696 --> 00:50:24.426
Matt explained, can be managed

00:50:24.426 --> 00:50:25.986
via MDM, but they're not just

00:50:25.986 --> 00:50:26.956
for Single Sign On.

00:50:27.726 --> 00:50:30.006
Other service types, such as

00:50:30.246 --> 00:50:31.906
universal links and password

00:50:31.906 --> 00:50:33.556
autofill, are also supported by

00:50:33.556 --> 00:50:35.796
associated domains, and they're

00:50:35.796 --> 00:50:37.436
now also supported by custom

00:50:37.566 --> 00:50:39.246
apps, not just App Store apps.

00:50:39.976 --> 00:50:41.196
So again, if you'd like to learn

00:50:41.196 --> 00:50:42.626
more about them, check out the

00:50:42.626 --> 00:50:43.866
Universal Links session from

00:50:43.866 --> 00:50:44.656
earlier this week.

00:50:45.266 --> 00:50:47.836
Now I mentioned federated

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:49.086
authentication earlier in the

00:50:49.086 --> 00:50:50.246
session, but I wanted to

00:50:50.246 --> 00:50:51.636
highlight it here again, because

00:50:51.836 --> 00:50:53.156
it, along with a number of the

00:50:53.156 --> 00:50:54.296

00:50:57.946 --> 00:50:59.776
enable Apple devices to fit in

while standing out in your

00:51:00.826 --> 00:51:01.536

Managed Apple IDs coming to ABM

00:51:06.106 --> 00:51:07.726
and User Enrollment requiring

00:51:07.726 --> 00:51:10.506
Managed Apple ID means that

00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:11.736
we've made it really easy for

00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:13.016
you to take advantage of user

00:51:13.016 --> 00:51:14.306
enrollment with the identities

00:51:14.306 --> 00:51:15.486
that you're already using.

00:51:17.456 --> 00:51:19.136
Now we've spent a lot of time

00:51:19.136 --> 00:51:20.476
today talking about the new, hot

00:51:20.656 --> 00:51:21.696
user enrollment, and that's

00:51:21.696 --> 00:51:22.986
great, but of course, we haven't

00:51:22.986 --> 00:51:24.306
stopped improving device

00:51:24.306 --> 00:51:25.156
enrollment either.

00:51:26.106 --> 00:51:27.376
So, I want to talk about a great

00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:28.406
new feature that allows

00:51:28.406 --> 00:51:30.066

right inside of Setup Assistant

00:51:33.096 --> 00:51:33.886
as they're enrolling their

00:51:58.846 --> 00:52:00.166
right in Setup Assistant,

00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:01.266
whether it's your privacy

00:52:01.266 --> 00:52:03.846
policy, additional consent text,

00:52:03.846 --> 00:52:05.476
or your acceptable use policy.

00:52:06.046 --> 00:52:07.196
And just to give you an idea,

00:52:07.196 --> 00:52:08.186
again, this should look very

00:52:08.186 --> 00:52:10.736
familiar, but instead of seeing

00:52:10.736 --> 00:52:13.016
our off UI on the next pane in

00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:14.706
Setup Assistant, you can see

00:52:14.706 --> 00:52:15.496
your UI.

00:52:16.556 --> 00:52:18.146
Here's an example on the Mac of

00:52:18.146 --> 00:52:19.056
authentication.

00:52:20.116 --> 00:52:21.116
This is really exciting.

00:52:23.726 --> 00:52:25.676
And in the iPhone, an example,

00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:26.876
Acceptable Use Policy.

00:52:26.946 --> 00:52:28.496
Basically, this just gives you a

00:52:28.496 --> 00:52:30.806
way to give your users the exact

00:52:30.806 --> 00:52:32.346
right experience for them in

00:52:32.346 --> 00:52:33.476
your organization.

00:52:35.836 --> 00:52:37.296
I mentioned content caching

00:52:37.296 --> 00:52:37.856
earlier.

00:52:37.856 --> 00:52:39.356
This is a great way to optimize

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:40.746
how your organization uses its

00:52:40.786 --> 00:52:43.766
bandwidth, and to date, it's

00:52:43.856 --> 00:52:45.856
been a best-effort optimization.

00:52:46.126 --> 00:52:47.446
But now it's possible to

00:52:47.446 --> 00:52:48.716
configure it, as required

00:52:48.716 --> 00:52:50.256
infrastructure for all devices

00:52:50.256 --> 00:52:51.616
on your network, if that's what

00:52:51.616 --> 00:52:52.906
works for your organization.

00:52:53.576 --> 00:52:54.806
And you can also configure

00:52:54.806 --> 00:52:56.846
devices to prefer specific

00:52:56.846 --> 00:52:57.986
client caches.

00:52:59.496 --> 00:53:01.626
Now, of course, there's lots of

00:53:01.626 --> 00:53:02.546
other things we've added this

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.966
year, just like always, enabling

00:53:03.966 --> 00:53:04.886
you to configure the Setup

00:53:04.886 --> 00:53:06.206
Assistant and lots of other

00:53:06.206 --> 00:53:08.046
settings and restrictions, and

00:53:08.396 --> 00:53:09.716
that's really great, but I think

00:53:09.716 --> 00:53:10.656
we should really read the

00:53:10.656 --> 00:53:12.176
documentation together instead

00:53:12.176 --> 00:53:15.136
of hearing me talk about it.

00:53:15.136 --> 00:53:17.096
Because we are so excited about

00:53:17.186 --> 00:53:18.716
the giant leap forward we made

00:53:18.716 --> 00:53:20.186
in giving you what you deserve,

00:53:20.186 --> 00:53:21.776
comprehensive, up-to-date

00:53:21.776 --> 00:53:24.256
documentation, both because

00:53:24.256 --> 00:53:25.276
we've improved our internal

00:53:25.276 --> 00:53:27.756
processes, allowing us to import

00:53:27.756 --> 00:53:29.566
our new keys and values that we

00:53:29.566 --> 00:53:31.506
add to the profile payloads and

00:53:31.506 --> 00:53:33.196
MDM commands directly from our

00:53:33.196 --> 00:53:35.526
code into the documentation, and

00:53:35.526 --> 00:53:36.796
then showing that documentation

00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:38.476
to you just like all other Apple

00:53:38.476 --> 00:53:40.666
documentation, including a great

00:53:40.666 --> 00:53:42.246
way to highlight the changes

00:53:42.246 --> 00:53:43.726
introduced in a particular OS

00:53:43.726 --> 00:53:44.736
release.

00:53:44.806 --> 00:53:45.856
We think this will make it much

00:53:45.856 --> 00:53:47.046
easier for you to adopt

00:53:47.046 --> 00:53:48.066
everything we've talked about

00:53:48.066 --> 00:53:49.686
today and in the future more

00:53:49.686 --> 00:53:51.326
quickly for all of our joint

00:53:51.326 --> 00:53:52.626
customers to take advantage of.

00:53:53.436 --> 00:53:54.396
But instead of me talking about

00:53:54.396 --> 00:53:55.756
it anymore, I'd like to ask

00:53:55.756 --> 00:53:57.286
Graham McLuhan to come on stage

00:53:57.366 --> 00:53:58.156
and show it to you.

00:53:58.386 --> 00:53:58.726
Graham?

00:54:00.516 --> 00:54:04.500
[ Applause ]

00:54:07.056 --> 00:54:07.746
>> Thank you, Todd.

00:54:07.976 --> 00:54:08.966
I'm really excited to be here

00:54:08.966 --> 00:54:10.076
today to show you the latest

00:54:10.076 --> 00:54:11.646
device management documentation.

00:54:12.776 --> 00:54:13.696
Who's had a chance to check out

00:54:13.696 --> 00:54:14.696
the new documentation?

00:54:15.946 --> 00:54:17.116
Yeah, all right, it's really

00:54:17.116 --> 00:54:17.386
great.

00:54:17.906 --> 00:54:19.036
So, for those of you who haven't

00:54:19.036 --> 00:54:20.016
had a chance to check it out,

00:54:20.016 --> 00:54:21.086
let's take a look.

00:54:22.086 --> 00:54:22.896
So, the first thing that you'll

00:54:22.896 --> 00:54:23.946
notice is that the device

00:54:23.946 --> 00:54:25.586
management documentation has a

00:54:25.586 --> 00:54:27.316
new home alongside the rest of

00:54:27.316 --> 00:54:28.116
the Apple developer

00:54:28.116 --> 00:54:28.936
documentation.

00:54:29.916 --> 00:54:31.266
Clicking in, you'll see all of

00:54:31.266 --> 00:54:32.076
the things that you're used to

00:54:32.076 --> 00:54:33.776
seeing, configuration profiles,

00:54:34.146 --> 00:54:36.106
MDM protocol, and deployment

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:36.646
services.

00:54:37.286 --> 00:54:38.096
So, let's take a look at the

00:54:38.096 --> 00:54:39.356
configuration profiles.

00:54:41.246 --> 00:54:42.146
Here you'll see an

00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:43.896
easy-to-search list of all of

00:54:43.896 --> 00:54:45.056
the different profiles that are

00:54:45.056 --> 00:54:46.026
available on all of our

00:54:46.026 --> 00:54:46.646
platforms.

00:54:47.376 --> 00:54:48.306
Let's take a look at the

00:54:48.306 --> 00:54:50.036
ExchangeActiveSync payload.

00:54:52.016 --> 00:54:52.816
The first thing I'd like to

00:54:52.816 --> 00:54:54.666
point out here is the Show API

00:54:54.836 --> 00:54:56.936
Changes option, where you'll be

00:54:56.936 --> 00:54:58.296
able to see the differences

00:54:58.296 --> 00:54:59.806
between the current OS release

00:55:00.256 --> 00:55:01.356
and the upcoming beta.

00:55:03.206 --> 00:55:03.906
Yes, great.

00:55:04.516 --> 00:55:06.546
[ Applause ]

00:55:07.046 --> 00:55:08.316
On the left-hand side, you can

00:55:08.356 --> 00:55:09.236
see there's been one

00:55:09.236 --> 00:55:10.916
modification to an existing key

00:55:11.286 --> 00:55:12.796
and 12 new keys added.

00:55:13.046 --> 00:55:14.976
As a note, to find out which

00:55:14.976 --> 00:55:16.606
Xcode versions relate to which

00:55:16.606 --> 00:55:18.136
OS releases, you can check the

00:55:18.136 --> 00:55:19.136
Xcode release notes.

00:55:20.446 --> 00:55:21.746
Below that, in the property

00:55:21.746 --> 00:55:23.466
section, you can see all the

00:55:23.466 --> 00:55:25.616
keys, their types, and their

00:55:25.616 --> 00:55:26.946
default values that make up the

00:55:26.946 --> 00:55:27.506
payload.

00:55:28.606 --> 00:55:30.606
As we scroll down, you can see

00:55:30.606 --> 00:55:32.416
that the keys are highlighted

00:55:32.416 --> 00:55:34.576
with purple tildes are modified

00:55:34.576 --> 00:55:36.976
keys, and the new keys that

00:55:36.976 --> 00:55:38.316
we've added are highlighted with

00:55:38.316 --> 00:55:39.386
the green plus sign.

00:55:41.156 --> 00:55:42.876
Below that, we have a profile

00:55:42.876 --> 00:55:44.456
availability table that shows

00:55:44.456 --> 00:55:45.326
you all of the different

00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:46.446
platforms the payload is

00:55:46.446 --> 00:55:48.286
supported on, and below that, we

00:55:48.286 --> 00:55:49.756
have related objects, such as

00:55:49.756 --> 00:55:50.886
dictionaries, that make up the

00:55:50.886 --> 00:55:52.976
payload, as well as other

00:55:52.976 --> 00:55:54.076
related payloads you may be

00:55:54.076 --> 00:55:56.286
interested in.

00:55:57.136 --> 00:55:59.736
So, let's jump back to the

00:55:59.736 --> 00:56:01.226
top-level device management page

00:56:01.226 --> 00:56:02.716
using the breadcrumbs at the top

00:56:02.716 --> 00:56:03.176
of the page.

00:56:04.016 --> 00:56:05.476
Now, with the Show API Changes

00:56:05.476 --> 00:56:07.046
enabled, we can also see that

00:56:07.046 --> 00:56:07.996
there have been some changes to

00:56:07.996 --> 00:56:08.956
the MDM protocol.

00:56:09.196 --> 00:56:09.986
So, let's take a look.

00:56:11.856 --> 00:56:12.816
Here you'll find it

00:56:12.816 --> 00:56:14.296
easy-to-search list of all of

00:56:14.296 --> 00:56:16.026
the different commands and

00:56:16.026 --> 00:56:17.186
queries that are available.

00:56:17.756 --> 00:56:19.056
Let's take a look at the install

00:56:19.056 --> 00:56:19.996
application command.

00:56:20.856 --> 00:56:24.046
On the right-hand side, you'll

00:56:24.046 --> 00:56:25.376
notice that we list all of the

00:56:25.376 --> 00:56:27.166
platforms and the corresponding

00:56:27.166 --> 00:56:28.466
OS releases where this feature

00:56:28.466 --> 00:56:28.966
was added.

00:56:30.236 --> 00:56:31.426
On the left-hand side, you can

00:56:31.426 --> 00:56:32.826
see that we document the command

00:56:32.826 --> 00:56:34.986
itself, as well as the response,

00:56:36.216 --> 00:56:37.876
and below that, on the command

00:56:37.876 --> 00:56:39.266
availability table, that shows

00:56:39.266 --> 00:56:40.426
you all the different ways that

00:56:40.426 --> 00:56:41.786
this command can be implemented.

00:56:42.656 --> 00:56:43.816
So, let's take a look at the

00:56:43.816 --> 00:56:45.246
actual MDM command itself.

00:56:50.766 --> 00:56:51.926
All right, here, you can see a

00:56:51.926 --> 00:56:53.336
list of all of the keys that

00:56:53.336 --> 00:56:54.856
make up the install application

00:56:54.856 --> 00:56:55.286
command.

00:56:55.786 --> 00:56:58.146
So finally, I'd like to talk a

00:56:58.146 --> 00:56:58.986
little bit about how we've

00:56:58.986 --> 00:57:00.286
documented the changes for user

00:57:00.286 --> 00:57:00.776
enrollments.

00:57:01.396 --> 00:57:02.856
The availability tables are a

00:57:02.856 --> 00:57:04.176
great way for you to see if a

00:57:04.476 --> 00:57:05.686
feature is supported in User

00:57:05.686 --> 00:57:07.506
Enrollment, but in some cases,

00:57:07.506 --> 00:57:08.706
we've had to change the way that

00:57:08.706 --> 00:57:10.816
specific keys behave, and the

00:57:10.816 --> 00:57:12.216
restrictions payload is a great

00:57:12.216 --> 00:57:13.296
example of this.

00:57:14.746 --> 00:57:15.896
So here, you can see that we've

00:57:15.896 --> 00:57:17.756
added help text to each key to

00:57:17.756 --> 00:57:18.976
tell you how it can be used.

00:57:19.276 --> 00:57:20.946
The Allow Account Modification

00:57:20.946 --> 00:57:22.576
restriction, for example, can be

00:57:22.576 --> 00:57:24.646
used on a supervised device and

00:57:24.646 --> 00:57:26.586
is available on iOS 7 or later.

00:57:27.596 --> 00:57:28.746
We know that for BYOD

00:57:28.746 --> 00:57:30.566
enrollments, Managed Open In is

00:57:30.566 --> 00:57:31.706
one of our most important

00:57:31.706 --> 00:57:32.266
restrictions.

00:57:32.776 --> 00:57:33.966
So, let's take a look how that's

00:57:33.996 --> 00:57:34.886
been implemented.

00:57:35.616 --> 00:57:37.096
Here you can see that this is

00:57:37.096 --> 00:57:39.966
available for iOS 7 or later and

00:57:40.276 --> 00:57:41.576
also available for user

00:57:41.576 --> 00:57:42.036
enrollments.

00:57:42.466 --> 00:57:44.086
Well, we're really excited for

00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:45.056
you take a look at all this new

00:57:45.056 --> 00:57:46.746
documentation, and with that, a

00:57:46.746 --> 00:57:47.656
hand it back to you, Todd.

00:57:48.516 --> 00:57:51.126
[ Applause ]

00:57:51.626 --> 00:57:52.636
Thank you very much, Graham.

00:57:53.926 --> 00:57:55.196
Again, we're really excited for

00:57:55.196 --> 00:57:56.746
this and hope you will go check

00:57:56.746 --> 00:57:57.836
it out if you haven't already.

00:57:57.836 --> 00:57:59.046
It's been live since Monday.

00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:01.836
All right, will that brings us

00:58:01.836 --> 00:58:03.236
to the end of our content.

00:58:03.296 --> 00:58:04.896
So again, we hope that new

00:58:04.896 --> 00:58:06.086
documentation makes it much

00:58:06.086 --> 00:58:07.076
easier for you to support

00:58:07.076 --> 00:58:08.196
everything new, which of course,

00:58:08.196 --> 00:58:10.026
we want you to do, and stop

00:58:10.026 --> 00:58:12.186
relying on UserAgent string or

00:58:12.186 --> 00:58:13.126
installing supervised

00:58:13.126 --> 00:58:14.816
restrictions on unsupervised

00:58:14.816 --> 00:58:15.496
devices.

00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:18.706
There's a lot of helpful links

00:58:18.706 --> 00:58:20.176
to that documentation, as well

00:58:20.176 --> 00:58:21.596
as many other resources at the

00:58:21.596 --> 00:58:23.736
session URL on-screen.

00:58:23.996 --> 00:58:25.176
Come see us in the lab after

00:58:25.176 --> 00:58:26.896
lunch, and check out those

00:58:26.896 --> 00:58:27.886
sessions that we referred to

00:58:27.886 --> 00:58:29.176
during the session on universal

00:58:29.176 --> 00:58:31.186
links and desktop browsing on

00:58:31.436 --> 00:58:32.976
iPad.

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:33.846
I want to thank all of you for

00:58:33.846 --> 00:58:34.846
coming out this morning.

00:58:34.846 --> 00:58:35.936
I hope you enjoy the rest of

00:58:35.936 --> 00:58:38.626
this final day of WW2019.

00:58:38.946 --> 00:58:39.556
Thank you very much.
