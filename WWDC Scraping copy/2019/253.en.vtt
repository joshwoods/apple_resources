[ Music ]

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.326
>> Hi. My name is Jared McGann.

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:10.586
I'm an engineering manager in

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:11.286
watchOS.

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.556
In watchOS 5, Apple released the

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.175
new Infograph clock faces with

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:17.466
graphic complications.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.526
In watchOS 6, we've enhanced

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:22.226
graphic complications with a new

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:22.816
tinted mode.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.136
Any clock face with graphic

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:27.616
complications supports tinted

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:28.456
complications.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.606
Here's some more examples from

00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:32.086
our new watch faces in watchOS

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:32.516
6.

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:34.976
These graphic complications are

00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:36.546
composed of three data types;

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:38.406
gauges, text, and images.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:40.626
The system alters the appearance

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:42.076
of each into contexts.

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:43.576
Let's walk through each one.

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.876
In tinted context, gauges are

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:48.266
displayed as a solid color

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:49.596
rather than a color gradient.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:52.816
The color of the gauge is

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:54.306
determined by the system, as

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:55.626
informed by the customer's color

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:56.156
selection.

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.406
If your complication relies on

00:00:58.406 --> 00:00:59.796
color to communicate information

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.256
within the gauge, you may need

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:02.616
to reconsider how you display

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:03.726
that information in your

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:04.396
complication.

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:08.286
Text is also displayed with a

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:10.056
single color in tinted contexts.

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:11.816
Again, the color is determined

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:12.876
by the system, based on the

00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:14.016
customer's color choice.

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:16.576
Multicolor text providers are

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.626
reduced to a single color, as

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:19.996
seen in the activity rings

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:20.746
complication.

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:25.116
Lastly, images are desaturated

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:26.866
by default in tinted contexts,

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.536
but we also have new API to

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:31.086
provide alternate images in this

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:31.366
mode.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:35.356
Before we dive into the new API,

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:36.966
I'd like to take a step back and

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.056
talk about data providers

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:38.596
generally.

00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:40.886
ClockKit includes a number of

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:41.756
data providers for

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:42.646
complications.

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:44.786
These providers manage the data

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:46.066
you supply to ClockKit for

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.446
display within a complication.

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:51.276
Let's take a look at the full

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:52.456
color image provider.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.056
The image property specifies a

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.666
full-color image to be displayed

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.666
by a complication.

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.486
Then there's an accessibility

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:02.846
label property, which is a

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.496
succinct label that identifies

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:05.596
the purpose of the image.

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:07.596
So how do you provide an

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:08.866
alternate image for tinted

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:09.556
contexts?

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:12.436
In watchOS 6 there's a new

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:13.146
property in

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.646
CLKFullColorImageProvider called

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:16.616
tintedImageProvider.

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:18.866
It's an optional property where

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.316
you can provide a separate image

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:21.966
for tinted contexts if you don't

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.266
want the full color image to be

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:23.986
desaturated.

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:26.466
This property is of the type

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:28.196
CLKImageProvider.

00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:30.266
We chose this class because it

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.406
allows you to provide both

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.926
one-piece and two-piece template

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:34.516
images for tinted contexts.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.506
Let's take a closer look at

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:40.426
CLKImageProvider, which has been

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.726
around since watchOS 2.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.316
The first thing to note is that

00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:46.436
CLKFullColorImageProvider is not

00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:48.356
derived from CLKImageProvider.

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.516
These are two distinct classes.

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:53.596
This class, CLKImageProvider,

00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:55.316
manages template images for

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:56.536
display in a complication.

00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:58.326
The clock face displaying the

00:02:58.326 --> 00:02:59.686
complication determines how to

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.396
display the image and what tint

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:02.146
color to apply.

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:05.606
The first property is one-piece

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:06.956
image, which is a single

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:07.806
template image.

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:09.386
This is the only required

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:10.186
property.

00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:12.906
Next up is tint color.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:14.946
In some classic complication

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:16.806
contexts, this color is applied

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:17.906
to the template image within a

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:18.676
complication.

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:21.396
In graphic complications, tint

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:22.906
color is ignored because color

00:03:22.906 --> 00:03:24.516
is determined by the system as

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:25.766
influenced by the customer's

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:26.556
color selection.

00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:29.266
Then, there are two-piece

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.996
images, which are composed of

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:32.576
the two-piece image background

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.366
and two-piece image foreground

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:34.926
properties.

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:39.636
Classic complications use

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.306
two-piece images in multicolor

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:42.836
contexts, as seen here.

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:45.026
Graphic complications use

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.656
two-piece images in some tinted

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:47.406
contexts.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.606
When applicable, two-piece

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:51.066
images take priority over

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:52.016
one-piece images.

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:54.856
A two-piece image consists of a

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:56.456
foreground image layered on top

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:57.466
of a background image.

00:03:58.146 --> 00:03:59.906
Both images are template images.

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:01.966
In classic complications, the

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:02.976
color and the tint color

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.416
property is applied to the

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:06.026
background image and white to

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:06.936
the foreground image.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.536
In tinted graphic complications,

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:11.306
as previously mentioned, tint

00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:12.156
color is ignored.

00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:13.936
The system will determine the

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:15.686
foreground and background colors

00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:17.236
as informed by the customer's

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:17.995
color selection.

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:21.776
Let's walk through a few

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:23.536
scenarios for displaying images

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:24.656
within a tinted graphic

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:25.316
complication.

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:27.706
The first is for the full color

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:29.276
image to appear desaturated in

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:30.236
tinted contexts.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.036
Here, we see the full color

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:33.936
image desaturated, more or less

00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:35.066
gray scale on the right.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:39.236
To achieve this in code, merely

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:39.906
initialize a

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:41.796
CLKFullColorImageProvider

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:43.696
without a tintedImageProvider,

00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:44.676
as seen here.

00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:46.816
When the tintedImageProvider

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:48.656
property is nil, the system

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:50.316
displays a desaturated version

00:04:50.316 --> 00:04:51.426
of the full color image.

00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:55.406
In other scenarios, you may want

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:56.666
to display an alternate template

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.126
image in tinted contexts.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:00.086
Perhaps your full color image

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:01.816
doesn't desaturate well, or

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:02.686
maybe you're concerned about a

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:03.796
logo being displayed in

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:04.816
undesirable colors.

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.586
To do this in code, create a

00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:10.406
CLKImageProvider with the

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:11.866
desired one-piece template

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:12.266
image.

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.086
Then supply that in the

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:16.086
CLKFullColorImageProvider

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:18.096
initializer alongside the full

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:18.796
color image.

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.456
In full color context, ClockKit

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:22.716
will utilize the full color

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:23.106
image.

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:24.946
In tinted contexts, the

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:25.896
one-piece image from the

00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:27.356
CLKImageProvider will be

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:27.996
utilized.

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:32.226
It's worth noting that you can

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:33.936
also provide the same full color

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:34.646
image within the

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:36.596
tintedImageProvider, and that

00:05:36.596 --> 00:05:37.926
image will be templatized

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:39.076
instead of desaturated.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.246
We use this technique in many of

00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:42.266
the standard watchOS

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:43.126
complications.

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:47.846
Lastly, you may want to provide

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.176
an alternate two-piece image in

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:50.146
tinted contexts.

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:54.776
To achieve this, create a

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:56.626
CLKImageProvider with both

00:05:56.626 --> 00:05:58.246
one-piece and two-piece template

00:05:58.246 --> 00:05:58.776
images.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.866
Then supply this object in the

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:02.896
CLKFullColorImageProvider

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:05.006
initializer alongside the full

00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:05.836
color image.

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:08.256
In tinted contexts, ClockKit

00:06:08.256 --> 00:06:09.866
will determine if the one-piece

00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:11.136
or two-piece image should be

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:11.766
utilized.

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:15.126
Here's a chart from the Human

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:16.296
Interface Guidelines with

00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:17.746
various graphic complication

00:06:17.746 --> 00:06:18.266
layouts.

00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:22.076
And here you can see the same

00:06:22.076 --> 00:06:23.616
layouts in a tinted environment.

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:28.076
Remember that ClockKit will

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:28.986
alter the appearance of

00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:30.246
complications in tinted

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:30.986
contexts.

00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:33.416
Tint color in tinted graphic

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:34.926
complications is determined by

00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:36.656
the system, as informed by the

00:06:36.656 --> 00:06:37.936
customer's color selection.
