[ Applause ]

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:13.676
>> Hey, everyone.

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:14.886
My name is Lauren.

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:15.606
>> And I'm Doug.

00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:16.996
>> And we're on the Design

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.076
Evangelism Team.

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:20.566
On Monday night, we hosted the

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.506
Apple Design Awards and we

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:23.856
honored some of the best apps

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.656
and games that we saw this year.

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:27.506
>> Each year we're really

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:28.946
inspired by the work the

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:30.396
developer community does on our

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:31.176
platforms.

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:33.466
And we're excited to show you

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.676
the apps and games tonight.

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:38.686
So we almost called this

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:40.856
session, How to Win an Apple

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:42.606
Design Award, because we get

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:43.676
asked about it a lot.

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:45.316
>> Yeah, and we totally

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:46.796
understand why people would ask

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:47.836
this question, right?

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:51.316
>> Totally makes sense to wonder

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:52.936
what goes into the selection of

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.556
just a few apps and games.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.746
>> So are there any criteria

00:00:57.746 --> 00:00:59.316
behind the apps and games that

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.236
we selected?

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:02.656
>> Sure. Are we going to talk

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:04.096
about those criteria today?

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.916
>> Well, we're actually going to

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:07.936
talk about something that is

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:09.826
much more compelling and useful

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:10.216
to you.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.156
>> So we're going to talk about

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:15.436
the values that are behind these

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:16.236
apps and games.

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.976
>> Each app and game really

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:20.936
delivers elements of all of

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:21.366
these.

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:23.316
But we're going to take you on a

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:25.716
journey behind the scenes of the

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:27.186
award-winning apps and games.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.896
>> And we're going to tell you

00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:31.886
short stories about the design

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:34.036
processes and methods that went

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:34.896
into each one.

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:38.486
In each story we're going to

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.406
tease out some lessons.

00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:42.616
>> So let's dive right in.

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:44.926
>> Innovation.

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:47.826
>> It's sort of an obvious place

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.566
to start maybe, but there were

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.286
some really innovative apps and

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:52.366
games this year.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:54.636
So each of these apps that we're

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:55.926
going to talk about brings out a

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:56.956
different dimension of

00:01:56.956 --> 00:01:57.596
innovation.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:01:59.646
>> All right, so let's start

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:01.516
with Asphalt 9.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.536
Asphalt 9 is a racing game with

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:06.496
an innovative new control scheme

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.705
and to best explain it, I just

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:09.765
think we should check it out.

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:17.976
Three, two, one.

00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:21.696
In Asphalt 9, you focus on item

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:23.366
and path selection with swipes,

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:25.286
just like this.

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:28.156
And you tap and hold that gives

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:29.836
you nitro and boost action.

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.096
Now drifts and nitro are the

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.186
main actions of acceleration and

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:35.006
braking in this game.

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:37.146
Now this is not a

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:38.166
driving-assisted.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.046
It's an entirely new way to

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:40.366
play.

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:43.296
And this new control scheme is

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.666
called TouchDrive.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.426
But what makes TouchDrive so

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:48.976
innovative?

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:51.856
Because it subverts our

00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:53.566
expectations of racing game

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:54.066
controls.

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:56.436
To do this, the developer

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:58.556
questioned basic assumptions

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.436
that we all have taken for

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:00.926
granted.

00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:03.276
They questioned the assumption

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:05.016
that driving controls required

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:07.476
acceleration, braking and

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:07.786
turning.

00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:10.126
So they started completely from

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:10.626
scratch.

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:13.896
This led to an exciting idea.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:16.526
After being challenged to figure

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.026
out a simplified and more

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:19.546
accessible control scheme for

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:21.706
iOS, the developer tried this

00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:23.856
crazy idea that moves the main

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:25.886
controls away from acceleration

00:03:25.886 --> 00:03:28.376
and braking to nitro and drift

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:28.856
actions.

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.326
They quickly realized there was

00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:32.716
something special there because

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:34.376
it helped players get into the

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:36.446
fun so much faster.

00:03:37.336 --> 00:03:38.566
But they were not done shaking

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:39.116
things up yet.

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:42.206
Asphalt 9 knew that traditional

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:44.486
turning as a player control was

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:47.236
very prone to player error.

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:50.086
So after rounds of testing and

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:52.076
feedback, they replaced

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:53.966
traditional path -- excuse me,

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.146
they replaced turning with path

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:58.226
and item selection through swipe

00:03:58.226 --> 00:03:58.716
gestures.

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:01.246
And this made people less

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.306
frustrated, because it helped

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:04.556
people focus on learning the

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.536
very elaborate tracks and play

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:07.476
more strategically.

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:10.756
So TouchDrive has now become the

00:04:10.756 --> 00:04:12.386
default control scheme for

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:14.646
strategic racing, fine-tuning

00:04:14.816 --> 00:04:15.826
and level recon.

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:18.106
Now full manual controls are a

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.596
matter of surgical precision and

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:20.776
are still available.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.506
But what I love is that this

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:25.526
developer took an informed risk.

00:04:26.186 --> 00:04:28.466
After iterating, testing and

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.496
getting feedback, the design

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:32.336
decision to diverge from

00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:34.716
traditional driving controls has

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.506
allowed for an entirely new

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:37.966
experience to emerge.

00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:40.596
And the innovation of TouchDrive

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.856
has revealed an entirely new way

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:43.846
to play the game.

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:48.786
So during your app design or

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:51.886
game design process, question

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:53.226
assumptions from the start.

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:55.166
Ask questions.

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:57.346
Ask, "Why are we doing it this

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:57.676
way?"

00:04:58.116 --> 00:04:59.636
Is it because we've just always

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.456
done it this way?

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:03.456
And convert problems into ideas,

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:05.466
just like the problem of

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:07.886
error-prone turning led to new

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:09.606
path selection in Asphalt 9.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.206
Because when you do, you can

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:14.566
create something that has never

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:15.756
been done before.

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:18.576
This game is so much fun.

00:05:19.676 --> 00:05:21.626
And that is truly innovative.

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:27.146
>> Okay. Let's stay on the theme

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.816
of crazy car stunts.

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:30.546
No, actually, let's stay on the

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.866
theme of simplification, making

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:33.636
things easier.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:35.116
>> What could be simpler than

00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:36.176
jumping over the Golden Gate

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:37.166
Bridge with a single swipe?

00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:39.676
>> Oh my God, wait till I show

00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:40.026
you this.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.696
>> All right.

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:42.626
>> So I want to talk about

00:05:42.706 --> 00:05:43.246
HomeCourt.

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:45.156
HomeCourt is an app that uses

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:47.946
your iPhone camera and ML models

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:49.276
to help you become a better

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:50.256
basketball player.

00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:53.306
The app works so naturally and

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:55.186
so effortlessly because the

00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:56.986
HomeCourt team focused on

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.646
removing obstacles to getting

00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.556
started with each of your drills

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:01.296
and workouts.

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:02.366
And I want to show you how they

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:02.696
did it.

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.126
So here's the HomeCourt app.

00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:07.656
Like I said, it uses the camera

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:10.426
and machine learning to chart my

00:06:10.426 --> 00:06:11.896
shots on a basketball court.

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:14.086
Before this app came along,

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:15.766
people just didn't have access

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:16.906
to this information.

00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:18.856
You really needed someone to

00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:22.006
manually chart it, each make and

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:22.486
miss.

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:25.646
You could also install an entire

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:28.116
system in your gym to do it, but

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:29.536
you couldn't really do it as

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:31.786
easily as HomeCourt makes it.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:34.256
So how do you get this

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:36.446
information just by using your

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:36.906
iPhone?

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:40.216
When I tried it, it feels like

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:40.676
magic.

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:42.426
And I wanted to know how they

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:43.016
got there.

00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:45.256
So I asked them to tell me where

00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:47.386
they started and where this all

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:48.086
came from.

00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:50.336
And the founder actually started

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:51.986
out by saying, "When we first

00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:53.606
launched, the experience was

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:55.546
actually not magical."

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:59.486
So to get information from

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:01.196
HomeCourt you had to go through

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:02.406
a series of steps.

00:07:02.906 --> 00:07:04.776
The first one was to put your

00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:06.066
phone in a tripod.

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:08.176
I don't know how many basketball

00:07:08.426 --> 00:07:10.056
players are here, but if you

00:07:10.056 --> 00:07:11.286
play basketball, I'm guessing

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.236
you don't go to play basketball

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:17.476
with a tripod in your gym bag.

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:19.626
So you know, it's clear that

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:21.036
bringing the tripod is an

00:07:21.036 --> 00:07:22.076
obstacle, right?

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:22.746
It's something you had to

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:24.876
remember to bring and set up.

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:26.436
And that wasn't the only

00:07:26.436 --> 00:07:27.096
obstacle.

00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:28.816
You needed equipment and you

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.156
needed to do manual work to set

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:32.986
up the app.

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:35.156
Two of the requirements early on

00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:36.566
related to lighting.

00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:39.856
The app worked best when the sun

00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:43.626
was directly overhead on a super

00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:44.266
sunny day.

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.266
You know, but other than that.

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:49.426
So the HomeCourt team went to

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:51.046
work and they tried to automate

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:52.946
as much as possible using the

00:07:52.946 --> 00:07:54.876
camera and machine learning

00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:55.356
models.

00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:57.686
The first thing they did was

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.876
find a way to detect the hoop.

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:02.726
And then they were able to

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:04.176
detect the three-point line.

00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:05.886
So this line is in different

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.086
places in different kinds of

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:09.446
courts, so this allowed them to

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:11.546
better detect courts in

00:08:11.546 --> 00:08:12.506
different countries.

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:14.806
So more and more people were

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:16.266
able to use it at this point.

00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:18.196
And this also allowed them to

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:19.816
begin to locate the shot a

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:21.106
little more precisely.

00:08:22.596 --> 00:08:23.706
So they've removed some of the

00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:24.586
manual work.

00:08:24.586 --> 00:08:26.356
You didn't have to tap on the

00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:27.866
screen to identify the hoop

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:29.056
anymore and you didn't have to

00:08:29.056 --> 00:08:31.846
draw a rectangle around the

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:32.285
lane.

00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:35.895
Next, they found a way to detect

00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:36.576
legs.

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:38.556
This allowed people to use the

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:40.376
app in almost any lighting

00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:41.066
conditions.

00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:43.686
So you could use HomeCourt on a

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:45.646
cloudy day.

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:47.676
Soon after that, they kind of

00:08:47.676 --> 00:08:49.546
upgraded to full pose

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:50.426
estimation.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:51.946
So this is detecting all the key

00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:53.766
body joints, and this helped

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:56.096
them even more accurately map

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:57.676
where the shot originated.

00:08:58.756 --> 00:08:59.976
So they're making progress,

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:00.266
right?

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:01.446
They're simplifying it, but you

00:09:01.446 --> 00:09:02.906
still had to bring the tripod.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:06.486
Until they created a mode that

00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:08.606
allowed you to set the phone on

00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:08.956
the ground.

00:09:11.136 --> 00:09:12.926
So this removed the final

00:09:12.926 --> 00:09:13.996
obstacles, and I want to show

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:16.326
you how that last part happens.

00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:18.606
So now you can start tracking

00:09:18.606 --> 00:09:21.036
your shots just by propping your

00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:23.306
phone up against a water bottle,

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:25.706
walking to the free throw line.

00:09:29.206 --> 00:09:30.296
And shooting a free throw.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:30.903
Aw.

00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:32.743
>> Aw.

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:34.656
>> Never could get one.

00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:36.376
[ Laughter ]

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:37.206
So it might not have been

00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:38.846
magical at first, but when you

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:40.986
do it now, it feels like magic.

00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:43.236
And there's tons of machine

00:09:43.236 --> 00:09:45.906
learning at work, but you don't

00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:46.546
see it.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.266
You're not -- it's not right in

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:48.996
your face.

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:50.726
It doesn't feel that way.

00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:52.596
And with HomeCourt you get

00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:54.046
access to information you've

00:09:54.046 --> 00:09:55.006
never had before.

00:09:56.086 --> 00:09:57.326
And the app feels like an

00:09:57.326 --> 00:09:59.116
extension of what you already

00:09:59.116 --> 00:09:59.486
do.

00:10:00.136 --> 00:10:01.246
But it's been taken to another

00:10:01.246 --> 00:10:01.726
level.

00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:04.466
So it fits in the flow of your

00:10:04.466 --> 00:10:05.866
shooting practice, but gives you

00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:06.266
more.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.586
So the innovation here is

00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:10.806
probably obvious.

00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:12.336
It's a matter of simplifying

00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:15.066
down to what people want to do,

00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:16.596
fitting into the natural flow of

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:18.496
their real life.

00:10:18.496 --> 00:10:19.816
And providing value without

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:20.726
getting in the way.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.876
>> That's so awesome, Doug.

00:10:23.316 --> 00:10:25.076
I actually want to go play some

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:25.886
basketball later.

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:29.006
>> Let's go do some shooting.

00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:33.256
So these apps and games really

00:10:33.256 --> 00:10:34.336
pushed the boundaries.

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:35.696
>> And the best kind of

00:10:35.696 --> 00:10:36.956
innovation is the kind that you

00:10:36.956 --> 00:10:37.976
don't even notice, right?

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:40.096
>> Exactly, when they just make

00:10:40.126 --> 00:10:41.896
the experience simple and

00:10:41.896 --> 00:10:42.226
better.

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:44.386
>> And truly, anything that

00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:45.826
helps a person feel more

00:10:45.826 --> 00:10:49.446
confident in using it is great.

00:10:49.646 --> 00:10:51.766
>> Speaking of confidence, let's

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:53.096
go on to the next one, Trust.

00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:55.176
And I want to talk about how an

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.896
app or a game can establish

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:58.296
trust with the people who use

00:10:58.296 --> 00:10:58.476
it.

00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:00.216
And I'm going to use Pixelmator

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:01.936
Photo as an example of this.

00:11:02.256 --> 00:11:03.536
So this is a photo editor

00:11:03.536 --> 00:11:05.386
designed specifically for iPad

00:11:05.796 --> 00:11:07.196
and it also uses machine

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:09.976
learning, but it's doing it

00:11:09.976 --> 00:11:12.086
trained on millions, literally

00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:14.166
millions of professional photos

00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:16.336
to make photo editing awesome

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.036
and easy.

00:11:17.206 --> 00:11:18.076
And I want to show you how they

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:18.446
do it.

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:21.966
So I want to start by saying

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:23.386
machine learning is popping up

00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:27.066
everywhere, but user experiences

00:11:27.066 --> 00:11:28.556
that are informed by machine

00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:30.626
learning can sometimes feel a

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:32.306
bit like black boxes.

00:11:32.996 --> 00:11:34.976
You might often wonder, you

00:11:35.436 --> 00:11:36.716
might sometimes wonder, maybe

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:38.286
often, "Why am I seeing this

00:11:38.326 --> 00:11:38.916
content?

00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:40.986
What forces are at work?

00:11:41.186 --> 00:11:43.316
Why is the app showing me this?"

00:11:43.846 --> 00:11:46.706
And there are also controls that

00:11:46.866 --> 00:11:49.706
claim to do magic things, but

00:11:49.706 --> 00:11:51.776
these can feel unpredictable and

00:11:51.776 --> 00:11:52.346
random.

00:11:52.606 --> 00:11:54.516
And so when things are hard to

00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:56.626
understand or hard to predict,

00:11:57.136 --> 00:11:58.956
it can be hard to trust them.

00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:01.846
So I want to show you Pixelmator

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.976
Photo and how they handle it.

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:07.716
I'm going to take a walk on the

00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:08.346
beach here.

00:12:11.046 --> 00:12:12.916
So on the surface, the UI is

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:13.886
pretty conventional.

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:15.306
There are tools in the

00:12:15.306 --> 00:12:17.646
navigation bar and there are

00:12:17.646 --> 00:12:19.326
base photo adjustments in the

00:12:19.326 --> 00:12:21.366
inspector and presets along the

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:21.826
bottom.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.836
The core of any kind of power

00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:27.126
tool is the inspector, and in

00:12:27.126 --> 00:12:28.766
Pixelmator Photo this is where

00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:30.066
the base adjustments live.

00:12:30.796 --> 00:12:32.796
So these will be familiar to

00:12:32.796 --> 00:12:35.156
photo geeks and experts, but

00:12:35.156 --> 00:12:37.186
most people don't really know

00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:38.746
what any of those do, and they

00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:39.816
can frankly be a little

00:12:39.816 --> 00:12:40.616
intimidating.

00:12:42.076 --> 00:12:43.906
But the magic of Pixelmator

00:12:43.906 --> 00:12:46.306
Photo is a single button, and it

00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:47.656
allows you to apply the

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:49.246
expertise of thousands of

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:50.706
professional photographers to

00:12:50.706 --> 00:12:52.226
your photo with one button.

00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:53.976
There, I did it.

00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:56.526
You'll see it again.

00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.496
So when you tap that button,

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:00.116
Pixelmator Photo is actually

00:13:00.116 --> 00:13:01.316
adjusting your photo with a

00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:03.846
model that's been trained on 20

00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:05.816
million professional photos.

00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:10.106
So the work behind the button is

00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:11.906
astounding and the results are

00:13:11.906 --> 00:13:12.816
pretty incredible.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.386
In the UI, they're using a

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:17.226
familiar control you might have

00:13:17.226 --> 00:13:19.416
seen before, the Magic Wand.

00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:22.306
And Magic Wands in UIs typically

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:25.316
mean don't worry about it, we

00:13:25.316 --> 00:13:26.226
know what we're doing.

00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:27.866
It's going to be awesome.

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:30.126
But from a user point of view,

00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:31.486
you're not exactly sure what's

00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:32.866
happening when you tap that

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:33.306
button.

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:36.276
So when I ask the developers

00:13:36.276 --> 00:13:37.756
about this, about their choice

00:13:37.756 --> 00:13:40.236
of icon here, they kind of

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.906
agreed that Magic Wands were

00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:44.116
often underwhelming, right?

00:13:44.206 --> 00:13:46.586
The results felt simplistic or

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:47.396
cookie-cutter.

00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:50.686
So in order for this control to

00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:52.756
work and to be trusted by

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:55.216
people, they wanted to make sure

00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:56.266
that the adjustments in the

00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:58.396
photo were clearly reflected in

00:13:58.396 --> 00:13:58.906
the UI.

00:14:00.496 --> 00:14:03.046
So what's happening kind of

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:04.466
behind the scenes is that their

00:14:04.466 --> 00:14:06.486
models are identifying segments

00:14:06.486 --> 00:14:08.136
of content inside the frame.

00:14:08.356 --> 00:14:10.886
Water, sand and sky are detected

00:14:10.886 --> 00:14:12.836
and treated independently, and

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:14.446
skin tone is as well.

00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:17.466
But what makes this experience

00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:19.946
so much different in my opinion

00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:22.236
is how clearly the parameters

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.246
animate when the control is

00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:25.856
activated, and the ease with

00:14:25.856 --> 00:14:27.756
which I can go in and

00:14:27.756 --> 00:14:29.136
independently adjust any of

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:29.446
them.

00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:32.096
So check out how it's increased

00:14:32.096 --> 00:14:33.896
the exposure of the landscape

00:14:34.216 --> 00:14:35.916
while leaving the skin tone

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:36.446
alone.

00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:39.646
And I can flip the switch to

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:42.696
deactivate them and then when I

00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:44.326
reactivate it, my adjustments

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:45.076
are still there.

00:14:45.646 --> 00:14:48.476
So it seems simple but it's

00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:50.396
pretty remarkable when you use

00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:52.376
it and you feel the sense of

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:55.696
confidence as you begin to

00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:58.996
adjust and edit the photo.

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:01.486
So being able to see this as I

00:15:01.486 --> 00:15:03.246
do it provides a sense of

00:15:03.246 --> 00:15:03.736
comfort.

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:05.836
I can see what's happening when

00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:08.136
I tap the Magic Wand and I can

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.216
go in and make my own

00:15:09.216 --> 00:15:10.036
adjustments.

00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:12.606
So there's a fancy word kind of

00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:15.206
for this in user experience

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.876
terms and it's attribution.

00:15:17.026 --> 00:15:18.856
I can see cause and effect.

00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:20.896
I can visually connect the

00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:23.166
effect of tapping the Magic Wand

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:25.066
to the series of independent

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:27.656
adjustments that's happening as

00:15:27.656 --> 00:15:28.426
a result of it.

00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:31.566
And this is empowering, right?

00:15:32.006 --> 00:15:33.666
Pixelmator Photo is revealing

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.936
its intelligence to me and also

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:37.616
offering levers to adjust it

00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:37.966
myself.

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:42.086
So you can trust an app when the

00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:43.706
way that it works feels

00:15:43.706 --> 00:15:45.126
transparent and when you can

00:15:45.126 --> 00:15:47.606
establish a simple understanding

00:15:47.776 --> 00:15:48.666
of what's happening.

00:15:51.046 --> 00:15:52.906
So if I can understand or even

00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:54.626
better visualize what's

00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:56.576
happening, I'm much more likely

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.746
to trust it and to take

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.506
ownership over those results.

00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:02.146
So you want to reveal what's

00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:04.096
behind a recommendation and

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:06.976
offer ways to adjust it.

00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:12.146
So that pretty much wraps up

00:16:12.176 --> 00:16:12.556
trust.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.906
>> Okay. Sounds good.

00:16:15.276 --> 00:16:16.576
On to refinement.

00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:19.716
Now refinement is more than just

00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:20.726
working out problems.

00:16:21.476 --> 00:16:23.406
Refining something means that

00:16:23.406 --> 00:16:24.596
you're going to fine-tune it,

00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:26.986
hone it and make it more

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:27.486
precise.

00:16:28.626 --> 00:16:30.336
Refining something means you're

00:16:30.336 --> 00:16:31.236
going to make it better.

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:34.596
The Gardens Between is a game

00:16:34.726 --> 00:16:36.886
with dream-like levels, soothing

00:16:36.886 --> 00:16:38.686
art style and a heartwarming

00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:39.146
story.

00:16:40.356 --> 00:16:41.636
You have the power to go

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:44.036
forwards and backwards in time,

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:46.056
and you relive these experiences

00:16:46.056 --> 00:16:47.426
of these two main characters

00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:48.546
while solving puzzles.

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:52.346
I am blown away by the artistry

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:53.536
and cleverness in this game.

00:16:54.496 --> 00:16:56.456
And I've always just been really

00:16:56.456 --> 00:16:57.956
curious in how the developers

00:16:57.956 --> 00:16:59.686
arrived at this truly unique

00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:00.246
concept.

00:17:01.926 --> 00:17:05.246
So I asked the developers and I

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:06.455
hoped that they would be willing

00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:08.415
to share a few design artifacts

00:17:08.646 --> 00:17:10.266
that they created along the way

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:11.096
while making The Gardens

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:11.616
Between.

00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:13.526
And I expected to see a few

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:14.976
familiar things that reminded me

00:17:14.976 --> 00:17:15.445
of the game.

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:17.976
But I didn't.

00:17:19.046 --> 00:17:20.646
I was shocked to see that the

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:22.445
design artifacts didn't look

00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:23.675
like the game at all.

00:17:24.266 --> 00:17:25.836
These images reveal that The

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.336
Gardens Between started in a

00:17:27.336 --> 00:17:29.886
very different place, in a place

00:17:29.886 --> 00:17:32.596
of fairy tales with moments

00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:34.716
showing Snow White about to eat

00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:35.566
the poisoned apple.

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:38.056
Or Sleeping Beauty right as

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.426
she's about to fall into a curse

00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:40.686
of deep sleep.

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.316
Other design artifacts showed

00:17:43.356 --> 00:17:46.306
lost characters and some very

00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:47.706
different appearances of the two

00:17:47.706 --> 00:17:49.466
main characters named Arina and

00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:49.836
Frendt.

00:17:50.796 --> 00:17:52.646
And various iterations on

00:17:52.646 --> 00:17:55.376
concepts for blocked paths and

00:17:55.376 --> 00:17:56.556
experiments with onscreen

00:17:56.556 --> 00:17:57.026
controls.

00:17:57.756 --> 00:18:00.016
As I flipped through all of

00:18:00.016 --> 00:18:01.896
these design artifacts, it

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:04.056
became really clear to me the

00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:06.076
creative exploration that these

00:18:06.076 --> 00:18:07.946
developers put into making the

00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:09.456
game that we love today.

00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:11.816
There are tons of different

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:14.596
styles and tones and directions

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:15.896
and perspectives that were all

00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:16.446
considered.

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:18.856
Now I know this is a game

00:18:18.856 --> 00:18:21.106
example but exploring ideas in

00:18:21.106 --> 00:18:22.746
your designs applies to apps

00:18:22.746 --> 00:18:22.956
too.

00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:25.156
All of these amazing design

00:18:25.156 --> 00:18:27.406
artifacts really show the power

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:30.136
of refinement, what can happen

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.286
when you take the time to truly

00:18:32.286 --> 00:18:33.326
explore your ideas.

00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:36.136
To stretch them, to think them

00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:38.126
through over time and to distill

00:18:38.126 --> 00:18:40.036
them down to their very essence.

00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:43.586
Now I love this quote by Carlton

00:18:43.586 --> 00:18:43.946
Cuse.

00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:45.406
I'm going to paraphrase it a

00:18:45.406 --> 00:18:47.976
bit, but it's basically saying

00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:49.946
that the creative process is not

00:18:49.946 --> 00:18:50.736
like getting struck by

00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:51.196
lightning.

00:18:52.036 --> 00:18:53.666
Along the way you must allow

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.896
yourself room for ideas to

00:18:55.896 --> 00:19:00.376
blossom, take root and grow.

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:02.986
So when you take the time to

00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:04.426
fully think through your ideas,

00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:07.246
you may discover new ones and

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.906
then you can validate designs by

00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:11.146
refining them and in turn this

00:19:11.146 --> 00:19:12.756
gives people a sense of depth.

00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:14.856
And that really shines through

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.406
the final experience in your app

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:16.976
or game.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:21.046
Refined designs feel considered

00:19:21.046 --> 00:19:22.986
and they also feel thoughtful.

00:19:23.886 --> 00:19:25.586
But this all takes time.

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:26.896
You can't rush this.

00:19:28.246 --> 00:19:31.676
And iteration is really helpful

00:19:31.676 --> 00:19:33.616
and also it's helpful for you to

00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:35.736
explore really wild directions

00:19:36.596 --> 00:19:38.626
in order to discover your

00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:39.286
conclusion.

00:19:40.636 --> 00:19:42.526
Now I really love that these

00:19:42.526 --> 00:19:44.036
developers were so open to

00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:45.196
sharing this incredible

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.916
transformation of this beautiful

00:19:46.916 --> 00:19:48.486
game between two friends.

00:19:49.206 --> 00:19:51.056
And you can feel all of the time

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.536
and effort that they put into

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:53.816
honing this experience.

00:19:54.916 --> 00:19:56.206
And this experience is what we

00:19:56.206 --> 00:19:57.966
feel in the end result.

00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:00.876
Award-winning apps and games

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:02.826
rarely start with the same

00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:03.966
designs they finish with.

00:20:04.796 --> 00:20:06.736
And that's because great designs

00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:08.056
are refined over time.

00:20:08.886 --> 00:20:10.416
And through this process the

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:13.956
very best ideas are surfaced.

00:20:14.086 --> 00:20:17.706
So take your time; explore and

00:20:17.706 --> 00:20:20.186
sit with your ideas because you

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:21.526
may discover new ones through

00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:22.726
the process of doing your own

00:20:22.726 --> 00:20:23.026
work.

00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:25.536
And by refining your designs,

00:20:25.686 --> 00:20:26.506
you're going to be able to

00:20:26.506 --> 00:20:28.646
justify every design decision in

00:20:28.646 --> 00:20:30.766
your app or game, and as soon as

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:32.576
you can justify those decisions,

00:20:33.046 --> 00:20:34.616
you know that you're much closer

00:20:34.616 --> 00:20:36.286
to the final result that you've

00:20:36.286 --> 00:20:37.646
been working towards the entire

00:20:37.646 --> 00:20:37.956
time.

00:20:39.496 --> 00:20:41.906
So all great apps and games go

00:20:41.906 --> 00:20:43.226
through the process of

00:20:43.226 --> 00:20:43.576
refinement.

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:46.206
>> You know, Lauren, we actually

00:20:46.206 --> 00:20:47.856
have another great example of

00:20:47.856 --> 00:20:48.506
refinement.

00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:51.726
I want to talk about Butterfly

00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:52.216
iQ.

00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:54.596
Butterfly iQ is actually more

00:20:54.596 --> 00:20:55.126
than an app.

00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:57.656
It's portable ultrasound system,

00:20:57.976 --> 00:20:59.976
and the system itself is super

00:20:59.976 --> 00:21:00.596
innovative.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:03.436
A handheld ultrasound device and

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:05.436
an app that runs on iPhone,

00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:06.896
that's what makes it up.

00:21:07.506 --> 00:21:08.836
So traditional ultrasound

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:11.486
devices are gigantic.

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:12.686
Really big.

00:21:12.986 --> 00:21:13.716
They're big.

00:21:13.716 --> 00:21:15.366
They have to be wheeled around

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:16.966
on a cart and plugged in.

00:21:17.116 --> 00:21:19.706
They have dozens of knobs and

00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:22.106
dials and buttons on them.

00:21:22.986 --> 00:21:24.746
So you can really see in

00:21:24.746 --> 00:21:27.306
Butterfly iQ how the portability

00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:29.946
of their system can create a

00:21:30.036 --> 00:21:32.236
whole new way for doctors to use

00:21:32.236 --> 00:21:32.566
them.

00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:34.606
And I want to show you how the

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:36.616
Butterfly iQ team refined their

00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:38.506
ideas to get to something that

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.096
really works for doctors.

00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:42.906
So when a doctor is using the

00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:44.276
system, their attention is

00:21:44.276 --> 00:21:45.206
actually split.

00:21:45.316 --> 00:21:48.386
In one hand they have the device

00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:49.996
that they're orienting on the

00:21:49.996 --> 00:21:51.926
patient, and at the same time

00:21:52.266 --> 00:21:53.436
they're referring to the phone

00:21:53.436 --> 00:21:53.946
screen.

00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:55.406
So they need to be able to

00:21:55.406 --> 00:21:57.296
operate both one-handed.

00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:00.896
The app serves as kind of a

00:22:00.896 --> 00:22:02.276
visual stethoscope.

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:04.586
And the doctor needs to be able

00:22:04.586 --> 00:22:06.786
to quickly refer to and adjust

00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:08.676
the imagery and then to also

00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:11.616
access contextual tools to make

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:12.976
measurements and notes.

00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:16.446
In their early demos, they

00:22:16.446 --> 00:22:18.676
created controls that mirrored

00:22:18.676 --> 00:22:20.276
the controls from the ultrasound

00:22:20.276 --> 00:22:22.196
cart with the idea that this

00:22:22.196 --> 00:22:24.206
would feel familiar to doctors.

00:22:25.206 --> 00:22:28.836
So the two values on the right

00:22:29.666 --> 00:22:30.656
tell you how deep you're

00:22:30.656 --> 00:22:31.206
looking.

00:22:31.346 --> 00:22:32.756
That's the depth.

00:22:32.946 --> 00:22:34.526
And the amount of contrast

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:36.256
you're applying, that's the

00:22:36.256 --> 00:22:36.786
gain.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.086
And they borrowed the behavior

00:22:39.086 --> 00:22:40.676
of these buttons from the knobs

00:22:40.896 --> 00:22:42.336
on the cart when doctors would

00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:43.196
interact with them.

00:22:44.046 --> 00:22:45.556
So in the early version, the

00:22:45.556 --> 00:22:48.246
doctor would spin these controls

00:22:48.246 --> 00:22:50.656
like the dial in a cart and the

00:22:50.656 --> 00:22:53.866
dials in the phone in doing this

00:22:53.866 --> 00:22:55.556
kind of matched the behavior

00:22:55.556 --> 00:22:56.996
that the Butterfly iQ team

00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:58.726
thought would be very familiar

00:22:58.726 --> 00:22:59.666
and very comfortable.

00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:03.626
So in UI terms, they're kind of

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:05.106
implementing a metaphorical

00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:05.606
dial.

00:23:05.876 --> 00:23:07.316
And metaphors like this can be

00:23:07.316 --> 00:23:09.566
super useful when you want to

00:23:09.686 --> 00:23:11.776
help the person using the device

00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:14.066
create a connection with a

00:23:14.066 --> 00:23:15.106
real-world object.

00:23:15.326 --> 00:23:17.036
And metaphors are all over the

00:23:17.036 --> 00:23:19.106
place in UI's, right?

00:23:19.176 --> 00:23:21.096
This is a metaphorical

00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:22.786
calculator with metaphorical

00:23:23.016 --> 00:23:23.776
buttons.

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:28.016
And our expectations of using

00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:29.766
that calculator come from the

00:23:30.046 --> 00:23:32.576
behavior that we've built up in

00:23:32.576 --> 00:23:34.596
the real world using real-world

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:35.806
buttons like these.

00:23:36.466 --> 00:23:39.536
But as the Butterfly iQ team

00:23:39.536 --> 00:23:42.486
tested that demo, that 2016

00:23:42.486 --> 00:23:44.436
demo, they found that a direct

00:23:44.436 --> 00:23:46.426
translation of the dial didn't

00:23:46.496 --> 00:23:48.186
feel right at all to doctors

00:23:48.546 --> 00:23:50.426
because those values were taking

00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.726
up valuable real estate.

00:23:53.436 --> 00:23:55.696
So they refined it on this

00:23:55.696 --> 00:23:56.096
theme.

00:23:56.256 --> 00:23:58.656
They started by looking at other

00:23:58.656 --> 00:24:00.656
apps and solved the problem --

00:24:00.896 --> 00:24:02.296
how other apps had solved the

00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:04.446
problem of viewing and editing

00:24:04.446 --> 00:24:04.996
imagery.

00:24:05.356 --> 00:24:07.116
And they drew inspiration from

00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:08.776
the iOS Camera app.

00:24:09.576 --> 00:24:11.926
So they considered the ways that

00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:13.676
people expect to interact with

00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:15.076
objects in the camera view and

00:24:15.076 --> 00:24:17.396
the ways that controls can be

00:24:17.396 --> 00:24:19.026
accessed via gestures.

00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:20.646
The way that those controls

00:24:20.646 --> 00:24:22.466
animate in and then the way that

00:24:22.466 --> 00:24:24.056
they recede when they're not in

00:24:24.056 --> 00:24:24.476
use.

00:24:25.696 --> 00:24:28.126
So now in the Butterfly iQ app,

00:24:28.566 --> 00:24:30.286
panning left and right changes

00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:33.646
the contrast and swiping up and

00:24:33.646 --> 00:24:35.336
down changes the depth.

00:24:35.886 --> 00:24:37.976
So they moved the information

00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:40.226
out of the UI and allowed it to

00:24:40.226 --> 00:24:41.806
be accessed via gestures.

00:24:42.706 --> 00:24:43.886
And you can notice the ruler

00:24:43.886 --> 00:24:45.286
down the right-hand side.

00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:47.396
So as the doctor swipes down,

00:24:47.396 --> 00:24:49.056
that ruler extends and allows

00:24:49.056 --> 00:24:50.396
them to have a little bit more

00:24:50.396 --> 00:24:52.756
out-of-the-way persistent look

00:24:52.756 --> 00:24:54.686
at the depth.

00:24:54.886 --> 00:24:56.316
So transferring the persistent

00:24:56.316 --> 00:24:58.596
dials from the ultrasound cart

00:24:58.596 --> 00:25:00.326
to the app seemed like it would

00:25:00.326 --> 00:25:02.866
establish trust and comfort.

00:25:03.326 --> 00:25:04.666
But instead it turned out that

00:25:04.776 --> 00:25:06.616
that information and those dials

00:25:06.616 --> 00:25:08.196
were occupying valuable real

00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:09.686
estate and doctors didn't need

00:25:09.686 --> 00:25:11.196
that persistence in order to

00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:12.636
feel confident.

00:25:14.136 --> 00:25:17.126
So creating those metaphorical

00:25:17.126 --> 00:25:18.486
connections can be helpful, but

00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:21.036
there's no copy and paste when

00:25:21.036 --> 00:25:22.136
nailing a behavior.

00:25:22.296 --> 00:25:23.306
You have to be willing to throw

00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:26.466
out ideas that might have seemed

00:25:26.636 --> 00:25:28.146
like a slam dunk -- that's a

00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:29.526
HomeCourt reference, by the way.

00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:31.796
And you need to keep refining.

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:35.826
So the process of refinement

00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:36.746
never ends.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:38.926
You want to draw inspiration

00:25:38.926 --> 00:25:40.246
from the real world, but make

00:25:40.246 --> 00:25:41.796
sure it doesn't conflict with

00:25:41.796 --> 00:25:43.506
the expectations that people

00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:44.826
have in a digital UI.

00:25:45.486 --> 00:25:47.356
And don't be afraid to throw

00:25:47.356 --> 00:25:47.946
stuff out.

00:25:51.296 --> 00:25:52.596
>> That's really inspiring.

00:25:53.186 --> 00:25:53.976
>> So inspiring.

[ Laughter ]

00:25:57.196 --> 00:25:58.166
>> But it really shows how

00:25:58.166 --> 00:25:59.786
difficult it can be to, you

00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:00.716
know, make something that makes

00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:01.406
sense to people.

00:26:01.556 --> 00:26:02.036
>> It's true.

00:26:02.146 --> 00:26:03.726
Moving the information off the

00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:05.706
image I think really helped

00:26:05.706 --> 00:26:06.946
people see the image more.

00:26:07.716 --> 00:26:08.206
>> That's awesome.

00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:10.356
>> So having the information you

00:26:10.356 --> 00:26:12.206
need just a quick touch away is

00:26:12.506 --> 00:26:12.956
beautiful.

00:26:13.526 --> 00:26:14.666
>> That's a really good segue,

00:26:14.666 --> 00:26:15.026
Doug.

00:26:15.026 --> 00:26:15.876
You want to switch sides?

00:26:16.686 --> 00:26:17.486
>> Okay, perfect.

00:26:17.986 --> 00:26:20.606
Awesome. So let's talk about

00:26:20.786 --> 00:26:21.186
beauty.

00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:24.696
Beauty in aesthetics reflects an

00:26:24.696 --> 00:26:27.806
attitude, a perspective and

00:26:27.806 --> 00:26:30.006
those are apparent immediately

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:30.716
when you see it.

00:26:33.336 --> 00:26:34.176

00:26:39.456 --> 00:26:40.336
Yeah, only games.

>> Right. So style,

00:26:42.846 --> 00:26:44.816
practicality, immersion and

00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:46.536
cohesion in design all work to

00:26:46.536 --> 00:26:48.456
support an app's or game's

00:26:48.456 --> 00:26:49.066

something to learn from each

one.

00:26:54.856 --> 00:26:56.116

Now this game is inspired by

00:27:00.796 --> 00:27:01.966
Pinball and a little bit of

00:27:01.966 --> 00:27:02.816
psychedelic rock.

00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:05.146
It immerses you into this retro

00:27:05.146 --> 00:27:06.696
game world with modern game

00:27:06.696 --> 00:27:07.096
mechanics.

00:27:08.186 --> 00:27:09.926
As we walk through this example,

00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:11.676
I want you to pay special

00:27:11.676 --> 00:27:12.746
attention to the overall

00:27:12.746 --> 00:27:14.566
simplicity of the game UI.

00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:16.986
And that is what's going to give

00:27:17.056 --> 00:27:18.696
Thumper its immersive aesthetic.

00:27:19.516 --> 00:27:21.566
[ Music ]

So right from first launch, you

00:27:23.606 --> 00:27:25.996
are greeted with this epic title

00:27:25.996 --> 00:27:26.416
sequence.

00:27:26.416 --> 00:27:28.266
And it's reminiscent of classic

00:27:28.266 --> 00:27:29.046
arcade games.

00:27:29.696 --> 00:27:31.126
Now classic arcade title

00:27:31.186 --> 00:27:33.236
sequences were designed to get

00:27:33.236 --> 00:27:35.906
and keep your attention, to draw

00:27:35.906 --> 00:27:38.026
you right in and draw you in and

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:39.316
not pay attention to the other

00:27:39.316 --> 00:27:40.626
arcade screens that might be

00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:41.956
distracting right next door.

00:27:41.956 --> 00:27:43.536
And I want to quote the

00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:44.556
developers for a moment.

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:47.356
They said, "The best ones tended

00:27:47.356 --> 00:27:50.596
to be simple, powerful and set

00:27:50.596 --> 00:27:51.786

Nothing competes with these

00:27:57.876 --> 00:27:59.356
graphics and nothing should

00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:00.526
because they're absolutely

00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:01.986
beautiful and captivating.

00:28:02.646 --> 00:28:03.626
Now check out the upper

00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:04.386
right-hand corner.

00:28:04.796 --> 00:28:06.506
I absolutely love how the pause

00:28:06.506 --> 00:28:08.416
button fades away into a slash

00:28:08.446 --> 00:28:09.336
that communicates the

00:28:09.376 --> 00:28:10.746
affordance, and then it just

00:28:10.746 --> 00:28:13.876
completely gets out of the way.

00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:16.316

00:28:24.146 --> 00:28:25.606
animation before you even have

00:28:25.706 --> 00:28:27.276
time to ask.

00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:29.146
And to reinforce that gesture, a

00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:31.636
subtle arrow swipes up in the

00:28:31.636 --> 00:28:33.396
direction only when the player

00:28:33.396 --> 00:28:34.326
should actually swipe.

00:28:35.456 --> 00:28:37.336
And also the sound design

00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:38.716
informs you when to swipe too.

00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:39.976
So let's listen.

00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:43.596
[ Game sounds ]

00:28:44.096 --> 00:28:45.716
Awesome. All of this together

00:28:45.806 --> 00:28:47.006
makes for a really great

00:28:47.006 --> 00:28:48.616
onboarding experience that's

00:28:48.716 --> 00:28:50.516
effective, unobtrusive and

00:28:50.676 --> 00:28:51.406
immersive.

00:28:52.146 --> 00:28:53.616
So let's turn it down and focus

00:28:53.616 --> 00:28:54.546
on the visuals again.

00:28:55.906 --> 00:28:57.526
Now to keep you in this deeply

00:28:57.526 --> 00:28:59.496
engaging experience, scores and

00:28:59.496 --> 00:29:00.796
metadata are only shown at

00:29:00.796 --> 00:29:01.306
checkpoints.

00:29:02.136 --> 00:29:03.496
If you're planning to create an

00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:05.246
immersive app or game, avoid

00:29:05.246 --> 00:29:07.826
having too much text onscreen or

00:29:07.826 --> 00:29:08.876
different buttons that could

00:29:08.876 --> 00:29:09.726
clutter the interface.

00:29:10.656 --> 00:29:11.716
The goal with the immersive

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.006
experience is to help people

00:29:14.396 --> 00:29:16.746
stay concentrated and present in

00:29:16.746 --> 00:29:18.086
the current moment.

00:29:18.776 --> 00:29:20.686
Now I love that these developers

00:29:20.876 --> 00:29:23.066
kept it really simple and they

00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:24.106
created this beautifully

00:29:24.106 --> 00:29:25.116
immersive experience.

00:29:25.766 --> 00:29:28.016
In Thumper, vitality is not in a

00:29:28.106 --> 00:29:28.416
HUD.

00:29:28.796 --> 00:29:30.156
Instead, it's on the actual

00:29:30.156 --> 00:29:32.166
beetle itself which shows full

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:34.796
wings at full health, no wings

00:29:34.876 --> 00:29:38.876
at half health, and that's it.

00:29:39.066 --> 00:29:41.016
Now you feel the consequences so

00:29:41.016 --> 00:29:42.086
much more deeply with this

00:29:42.086 --> 00:29:42.406
effect.

00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:44.866
And this design decision also

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:46.256
helps you stay focused on the

00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:47.626
beetle in the track, which is a

00:29:47.626 --> 00:29:48.396
part of the game.

00:29:49.546 --> 00:29:51.786
This game also has a great feel,

00:29:51.816 --> 00:29:53.106
and that's because the

00:29:53.106 --> 00:29:54.716
developers designed the controls

00:29:54.776 --> 00:29:56.606
from the ground up for iOS.

00:29:58.016 --> 00:29:59.496
It's approachable for beginners

00:29:59.676 --> 00:30:01.196
but it's also challenging enough

00:30:01.196 --> 00:30:02.916
for the most dedicated mobile

00:30:02.916 --> 00:30:03.156
gamer.

00:30:04.056 --> 00:30:04.976
Just watch for a few seconds.

00:30:05.516 --> 00:30:08.386
[ Game sounds ]

00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:10.146
Okay. Wow.

00:30:10.736 --> 00:30:12.016
So what is the benefit to

00:30:12.016 --> 00:30:12.536
immersion?

00:30:13.326 --> 00:30:15.126
Well, the benefit is that you

00:30:15.126 --> 00:30:16.796
don't have to second-guess your

00:30:16.796 --> 00:30:18.746
swipe, tap or hold.

00:30:19.376 --> 00:30:20.556
You know if you make a mistake,

00:30:20.846 --> 00:30:22.876
well, it's on you.

00:30:23.796 --> 00:30:26.196
Thumper Pocket Edition captures

00:30:26.276 --> 00:30:27.076
your attention.

00:30:27.266 --> 00:30:29.586
It captivates your senses and it

00:30:29.586 --> 00:30:31.746
lures you in through its unique

00:30:31.746 --> 00:30:33.656
aesthetic to create an

00:30:33.886 --> 00:30:35.106
absolutely beautiful and

00:30:35.106 --> 00:30:36.176
immersive experience.

00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:38.876
>> So aesthetics can be

00:30:38.876 --> 00:30:40.786
captivating and immersive, but I

00:30:40.786 --> 00:30:42.706
want to highlight the practical

00:30:42.706 --> 00:30:44.106
benefits that they can have as

00:30:44.106 --> 00:30:44.456
well.

00:30:44.596 --> 00:30:46.056
And I want to show you a game

00:30:46.056 --> 00:30:46.896
called ELOH.

00:30:47.376 --> 00:30:51.126
ELOH uses unique visual style in

00:30:51.126 --> 00:30:52.716
a couple of really practical

00:30:52.716 --> 00:30:53.296
ways.

00:30:54.316 --> 00:30:56.956
So it's a casual puzzle game and

00:30:57.066 --> 00:30:59.616
it combines some familiar game

00:30:59.616 --> 00:31:01.756
elements like the bouncing balls

00:31:01.756 --> 00:31:03.226
and the movable obstacles.

00:31:03.766 --> 00:31:06.886
And this looks and feels very

00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:08.836
complete, so I want to show you

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:10.566
where they started and how they

00:31:10.566 --> 00:31:11.156
got here.

00:31:12.776 --> 00:31:14.576
So this is an alpha version of

00:31:14.576 --> 00:31:14.946
ELOH.

00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:17.466
So you can see that the puzzle

00:31:17.466 --> 00:31:18.406
elements are there.

00:31:18.936 --> 00:31:21.416
The essential mechanic is there,

00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:23.076
the sounds, and it's even got

00:31:23.516 --> 00:31:25.336
kind of a notion of the style

00:31:25.336 --> 00:31:28.606
with the anthropomorphic face on

00:31:28.606 --> 00:31:29.746
the obstacle.

00:31:30.216 --> 00:31:31.646
And this is an example of a

00:31:31.646 --> 00:31:33.306
higher level in that alpha.

00:31:33.776 --> 00:31:36.846
Neither of these really resemble

00:31:36.846 --> 00:31:38.736
the first screen that I showed

00:31:38.736 --> 00:31:39.056
you.

00:31:39.116 --> 00:31:40.986
But it's clear that they've got

00:31:40.986 --> 00:31:43.686
kind of the mechanic nailed in

00:31:44.016 --> 00:31:45.596
these early versions.

00:31:45.896 --> 00:31:46.846
So I want to walk you through

00:31:46.846 --> 00:31:48.086
the journey that they took from

00:31:48.186 --> 00:31:51.746
here to arrive at the game

00:31:51.746 --> 00:31:53.166
that's on the App Store.

00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:55.136
So the first step that the game

00:31:55.136 --> 00:31:56.846
designer took was to hire an

00:31:56.846 --> 00:31:57.576
illustrator.

00:31:57.856 --> 00:32:01.036
And the illustrator explored a

00:32:01.036 --> 00:32:03.426
color system and a graphic style

00:32:03.836 --> 00:32:05.206
and just in looking at those

00:32:05.246 --> 00:32:07.186
three examples, you could see

00:32:07.186 --> 00:32:10.086
how different the game could

00:32:10.086 --> 00:32:11.996
have been given the different

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:13.466
tones and styles that he

00:32:13.466 --> 00:32:13.826
explored.

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:18.886
So an app or game can be

00:32:18.976 --> 00:32:20.966
functional without being

00:32:20.966 --> 00:32:23.256
beautiful, but the beauty that

00:32:23.256 --> 00:32:24.576
ELOH's designer brought into the

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:26.506
game does more than make it look

00:32:26.506 --> 00:32:26.846
good.

00:32:27.826 --> 00:32:29.706
It enhances the gameplay and

00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:31.716
brings visibility and life to

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:32.966
the interactive elements.

00:32:33.506 --> 00:32:35.126
There aren't many interactive

00:32:35.126 --> 00:32:36.226
elements in the game, so they

00:32:36.226 --> 00:32:37.886
took care with each one, like

00:32:37.886 --> 00:32:39.376
this button that appears when

00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:40.766
you solve a puzzle.

00:32:42.096 --> 00:32:43.746
And the visual detail allowed

00:32:43.746 --> 00:32:45.106
the characters to really come

00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:45.636
alive.

00:32:46.126 --> 00:32:48.286
These little guys have so much

00:32:48.286 --> 00:32:49.196
personality.

00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:51.186
When you drag an obstacle from

00:32:51.186 --> 00:32:53.606
place to place or when a ball

00:32:53.606 --> 00:32:54.956
hits it, it responds.

00:32:55.496 --> 00:32:57.396
And those small moments were

00:32:57.396 --> 00:32:58.976
really carefully considered.

00:32:59.466 --> 00:33:00.366
You could just tell that the

00:33:00.366 --> 00:33:02.236
animators were thinking about

00:33:02.236 --> 00:33:03.966
what the face should look like

00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:06.346
when the ball hits it or when a

00:33:06.346 --> 00:33:08.726
finger pushes down on it.

00:33:09.296 --> 00:33:09.976
Pretty amazing.

00:33:12.046 --> 00:33:13.426
And the team brought in a sound

00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:13.986
designer.

00:33:14.276 --> 00:33:16.076
The sounds feel natural.

00:33:16.556 --> 00:33:18.686
When you succeed, the sounds are

00:33:18.686 --> 00:33:20.686
rhythmic, and the sound adapts

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:23.446
to build drama and suspense

00:33:23.676 --> 00:33:25.106
within each level and between

00:33:25.106 --> 00:33:25.526
levels.

00:33:26.946 --> 00:33:28.726
So ELOH's aesthetics also deepen

00:33:28.726 --> 00:33:29.546
the experience.

00:33:29.686 --> 00:33:31.466
They connect emotionally with

00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:33.656
people while also reinforcing

00:33:33.656 --> 00:33:34.946
the intent of the game.

00:33:36.356 --> 00:33:37.786
So I want to make one more

00:33:37.786 --> 00:33:38.926
subtle point on this.

00:33:39.136 --> 00:33:40.906
The people that came together to

00:33:40.906 --> 00:33:43.556
create ELOH put so much work

00:33:43.556 --> 00:33:44.796
into the game, and I want to

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:45.936
talk about a subtle thing that

00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:48.346
they did to give people a chance

00:33:48.486 --> 00:33:50.356
to enjoy the gameplay and the

00:33:50.356 --> 00:33:50.976
game's beauty.

00:33:53.326 --> 00:33:54.186
So they mentioned something

00:33:54.186 --> 00:33:55.326
interesting when I asked where

00:33:55.326 --> 00:33:56.426
the game came from.

00:33:56.946 --> 00:33:58.136
They said that modern puzzle

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.486
games often fail to create

00:34:00.486 --> 00:34:02.906
long-lasting excitement because

00:34:02.906 --> 00:34:04.346
the only thing that happens is

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:05.546
that the puzzles just get harder

00:34:05.546 --> 00:34:06.086
and harder.

00:34:07.516 --> 00:34:09.346
What's fun about that?

00:34:10.136 --> 00:34:11.696
Every puzzle game gets

00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:13.156
annoyingly difficult at some

00:34:13.156 --> 00:34:15.235
point and it's easy to just want

00:34:15.235 --> 00:34:15.565
to quit.

00:34:15.926 --> 00:34:17.746
But in ELOH, every once in a

00:34:17.746 --> 00:34:18.946
while when you finish an

00:34:18.946 --> 00:34:21.005
especially hard level, you find

00:34:21.005 --> 00:34:23.085
out that the next one is much

00:34:23.085 --> 00:34:23.726
simpler.

00:34:24.386 --> 00:34:26.956
And the aesthetics rise to the

00:34:26.956 --> 00:34:29.676
surface again and you can notice

00:34:29.775 --> 00:34:31.596
the craft of the characters and

00:34:31.596 --> 00:34:32.876
appreciate the rhythm of the

00:34:32.876 --> 00:34:33.525
soundtrack.

00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:35.346
Or turning the page.

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:36.536
Ah.

00:34:36.976 --> 00:34:37.335
>> So nice.

00:34:37.726 --> 00:34:38.406
>> Simpler.

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:41.696
So that's what I mean by the

00:34:41.696 --> 00:34:42.956
aesthetics having a practical

00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:43.485
benefit.

00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:45.275
The design matches the intent of

00:34:45.275 --> 00:34:47.565
the game, and the casual fun

00:34:47.616 --> 00:34:49.505
resurfaces every so often as you

00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:51.795
progress through 99 levels.

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:56.076
So we expect aesthetics to be

00:34:56.076 --> 00:34:58.426
embodied in every element of the

00:34:58.426 --> 00:34:59.776
app, and I want to show you one

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:01.936
more quick thing that I think is

00:35:01.936 --> 00:35:02.556
awesome.

00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:05.606
The HomeCourt team really

00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:07.216
sweated the details with their

00:35:07.216 --> 00:35:08.116
app icon.

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:11.156
The shapes in the icon clearly

00:35:11.156 --> 00:35:12.436
draw inspiration from the

00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:15.006
elements of a basketball court.

00:35:15.596 --> 00:35:17.306
So a great app icon allows

00:35:17.306 --> 00:35:18.836
people to quickly scan their

00:35:18.836 --> 00:35:21.016
home screen and map what they

00:35:21.016 --> 00:35:22.856
want to do to the intent of the

00:35:22.856 --> 00:35:23.136
app.

00:35:24.246 --> 00:35:26.376
The H and the C of HomeCourt

00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.936
emerge from the boundary lines

00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:28.976
of the basketball court.

00:35:28.976 --> 00:35:31.546
And the background is a clear

00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:32.976
call-out to the orange of a

00:35:32.976 --> 00:35:33.616
basketball.

00:35:33.616 --> 00:35:34.976
>> That's pretty cool, Doug.

00:35:35.456 --> 00:35:35.766
>> Right?

00:35:36.216 --> 00:35:37.946
>> Yeah. But I don't remember

00:35:37.946 --> 00:35:39.336
HomeCourt being in our agenda to

00:35:39.336 --> 00:35:40.516
be talking about aesthetics.

00:35:40.936 --> 00:35:41.016
>> Yeah.

00:35:41.206 --> 00:35:42.426
>> We were supposed to be

00:35:42.426 --> 00:35:45.286
talking about Thumper, ELOH and

00:35:45.286 --> 00:35:45.616
Ordia.

00:35:47.476 --> 00:35:48.496
>> What more is there to say?

00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:48.686
[Laughs]

00:35:48.686 --> 00:35:50.796
>> Well, I just want to make

00:35:50.796 --> 00:35:52.026
sure we have time to talk about

00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:53.986
how aesthetics can create

00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:55.196
something that feels really

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:55.676
cohesive.

00:35:55.676 --> 00:35:57.846
And that aesthetics can give an

00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:00.186
app a perception of quality

00:36:00.526 --> 00:36:01.816
through a really clear and

00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:03.136
consistent design language.

00:36:03.866 --> 00:36:05.906
Now Ordia is a game that tells a

00:36:05.906 --> 00:36:07.256
story about the struggles of

00:36:07.376 --> 00:36:08.756
early primordial life.

00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:11.296
And I just love the organic

00:36:11.296 --> 00:36:13.136
blobbiness of everything in

00:36:13.136 --> 00:36:15.386
Ordia, from the menus to the

00:36:15.386 --> 00:36:18.376
transitions, levels, characters.

00:36:18.686 --> 00:36:19.946
I mean, this blobby theme is

00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:21.486
carried through everything in

00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:22.846
the entire game experience.

00:36:23.576 --> 00:36:25.036
There's also clever sound design

00:36:25.036 --> 00:36:26.406
and haptics to create a really

00:36:26.406 --> 00:36:28.526
rich atmosphere to enhance this

00:36:28.526 --> 00:36:30.056
incredibly sticky world.

00:36:30.926 --> 00:36:32.936
And every screen sticks

00:36:32.966 --> 00:36:33.406
together.

00:36:33.946 --> 00:36:35.396
They family really well.

00:36:36.226 --> 00:36:37.776
Ordia's design language is

00:36:37.776 --> 00:36:38.596
meaningful.

00:36:38.876 --> 00:36:40.306
It helps communicate to people

00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:42.866
what's interactive, what isn't,

00:36:43.096 --> 00:36:44.836
and also the colors help people

00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:46.136
know what's friendly when it's

00:36:46.136 --> 00:36:46.816
in the game.

00:36:48.226 --> 00:36:50.366
So to quote the developer, they

00:36:50.366 --> 00:36:52.066
wanted to have the player always

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:53.346
feel like they were in the same

00:36:53.346 --> 00:36:53.976
environment.

00:36:55.086 --> 00:36:56.706
The same environment.

00:36:56.706 --> 00:36:58.236
I think that's a great goal for

00:36:58.236 --> 00:36:59.336
your app or game.

00:36:59.996 --> 00:37:01.716
To create cohesion and

00:37:01.716 --> 00:37:03.776
consistency between every aspect

00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:04.536
of your design.

00:37:05.816 --> 00:37:07.726
So your app or game also needs

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:09.076
to feel connected to the

00:37:09.076 --> 00:37:10.726
platform to be truly cohesive.

00:37:11.346 --> 00:37:12.936
So you can tell that Ordia was

00:37:12.966 --> 00:37:14.916
designed for iOS just by taking

00:37:14.916 --> 00:37:16.386
a look at the Share icon.

00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:18.886
This seemingly simple design

00:37:18.886 --> 00:37:20.726
decision makes a really big

00:37:20.726 --> 00:37:22.306
difference in helping people

00:37:22.646 --> 00:37:24.446
understand your app and also

00:37:24.446 --> 00:37:26.046
making it feel at home in the

00:37:26.046 --> 00:37:27.206
platform it runs on.

00:37:28.426 --> 00:37:30.006
Now I know it's really hard work

00:37:30.376 --> 00:37:32.766
to create designs that stick

00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:34.726
together, especially when it

00:37:34.756 --> 00:37:36.496
feels like creating an app or

00:37:36.496 --> 00:37:39.406
game can be an endless upwards

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:39.886
climb.

00:37:41.236 --> 00:37:43.036
But by creating a cohesive

00:37:43.036 --> 00:37:45.106
design, it raises the overall

00:37:45.106 --> 00:37:46.436
quality of your experience.

00:37:47.186 --> 00:37:49.096
So to make your app or game

00:37:49.096 --> 00:37:51.416
cohesive, create a consistent

00:37:51.416 --> 00:37:52.296
design language.

00:37:53.316 --> 00:37:55.386
Lay out every single screen

00:37:55.386 --> 00:37:57.486
side-by-side and ask yourself,

00:37:58.076 --> 00:37:59.986
does anything feel out of place?

00:38:00.726 --> 00:38:02.076
And if it does, replace it with

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:03.346
something that families better.

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:05.886
And finally, cohesiveness

00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:08.046
applies to how your app or game

00:38:08.046 --> 00:38:09.136
runs on the platform.

00:38:09.906 --> 00:38:11.396
And just to tie this all back to

00:38:11.496 --> 00:38:13.986
aesthetics, in Thumper aesthetic

00:38:13.986 --> 00:38:15.986
beauty helped create immersion.

00:38:17.206 --> 00:38:18.226
>> ELOH shows how these

00:38:18.226 --> 00:38:19.856
aesthetics support the intended

00:38:19.856 --> 00:38:21.516
behavior or experience.

00:38:22.296 --> 00:38:23.826
And aesthetics are embodied in

00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:25.456
every element of the app, down

00:38:25.456 --> 00:38:26.286
to its icon.

00:38:26.876 --> 00:38:27.176
>> Nice.

00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:30.786
And creating consistent

00:38:30.786 --> 00:38:32.806
experience is really important

00:38:32.976 --> 00:38:34.926
with a cohesive design language.

00:38:35.066 --> 00:38:35.156
>> Okay.

00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:36.776
>> And that's aesthetics.

00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:39.536
>> Yeah. So let's go on to the

00:38:39.536 --> 00:38:41.096
next subtle theme running

00:38:41.096 --> 00:38:43.096
through all great apps, and

00:38:43.096 --> 00:38:44.546
that's that they're inclusive.

00:38:45.606 --> 00:38:47.156
So when we talk about inclusion

00:38:47.156 --> 00:38:48.406
in design, we mean that

00:38:48.406 --> 00:38:50.246
interfaces are usable by

00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:50.896
everyone.

00:38:51.816 --> 00:38:52.996
So let's go back to Pixelmator

00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:54.776
Photo for just a moment and look

00:38:54.776 --> 00:38:56.266
at one of the benefits of using

00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:58.146
native components to ensure as

00:38:58.146 --> 00:38:59.906
many people as possible can use

00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:00.346
your app.

00:39:01.456 --> 00:39:03.006
I want to focus on one element:

00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:04.706
the native UI switch.

00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:06.816
Here it works nicely as a way of

00:39:06.816 --> 00:39:08.576
activating or deactivating

00:39:08.576 --> 00:39:09.396
parameters.

00:39:10.356 --> 00:39:11.866
It clearly communicates the

00:39:11.866 --> 00:39:13.516
state of each parameter and

00:39:13.516 --> 00:39:15.736
provides a way to remove it and

00:39:15.736 --> 00:39:17.306
add it again without losing

00:39:17.306 --> 00:39:17.546
work.

00:39:18.786 --> 00:39:20.796
When I asked the Pixelmator team

00:39:20.836 --> 00:39:22.766
about this, they said originally

00:39:23.016 --> 00:39:23.976
they were going to bring over

00:39:23.976 --> 00:39:28.116
the controls from their Mac app.

00:39:28.176 --> 00:39:29.666
And while the appearance is

00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:31.416
similar, the checkboxes don't

00:39:31.416 --> 00:39:34.386
pop or communicate as clearly as

00:39:34.746 --> 00:39:35.366
the switch.

00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:39.276
And not only is the switch a

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:42.716
familiar iOS element, it's also

00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:43.496
accessible.

00:39:43.886 --> 00:39:45.506
In the Accessibility section of

00:39:45.506 --> 00:39:47.016
the Settings app, people can

00:39:47.016 --> 00:39:48.656
turn on labels that allow these

00:39:48.656 --> 00:39:50.176
switches to be even more

00:39:50.366 --> 00:39:50.856
legible.

00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:54.646
So using standard components

00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.186
creates consistency,

00:39:56.186 --> 00:39:58.086
predictability and legibility

00:39:58.876 --> 00:40:00.716
across apps and devices.

00:40:02.186 --> 00:40:03.246
So Lauren, I know you have an

00:40:03.246 --> 00:40:04.796
awesome example of inclusion as

00:40:04.796 --> 00:40:05.086
well.

00:40:05.456 --> 00:40:06.246
>> Yeah, totally.

00:40:06.246 --> 00:40:08.226
I want to go back to Ordia.

00:40:09.446 --> 00:40:11.626
Now in Ordia, every creature has

00:40:11.626 --> 00:40:13.186
a color that communicates to the

00:40:13.246 --> 00:40:15.646
player whether it's good, bad or

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.306
meant to aid in navigation.

00:40:17.966 --> 00:40:19.056
The developer didn't want to

00:40:19.056 --> 00:40:20.706
exclude anyone from being able

00:40:20.706 --> 00:40:22.326
to understand the game, so they

00:40:22.326 --> 00:40:23.936
support a colorblind mode for

00:40:23.936 --> 00:40:24.806
people with partial

00:40:24.806 --> 00:40:25.576
colorblindness.

00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:27.866
To create this, the developers

00:40:27.866 --> 00:40:29.146
took screenshots of the game,

00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:31.256
applied filters to stimulate

00:40:31.256 --> 00:40:31.956
different types of

00:40:31.956 --> 00:40:33.806
colorblindness and then worked

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:35.616
on rebalancing those colors to

00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:36.546
make them more distinct.

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:39.916
And they made every single

00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:41.666
design element distinctive to

00:40:41.666 --> 00:40:43.156
include people with full

00:40:43.156 --> 00:40:44.056
colorblindness.

00:40:44.406 --> 00:40:46.266
So they also tested the game in

00:40:46.266 --> 00:40:47.326
pure monochrome.

00:40:48.356 --> 00:40:50.366
With over 300 million people

00:40:50.366 --> 00:40:52.316
worldwide with some form of

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:54.216
colorblindness, Ordia is

00:40:54.316 --> 00:40:55.486
wonderfully inclusive.

00:40:56.416 --> 00:40:59.186
So to get started, design for

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.416
everyone and investigate if your

00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:03.276
app or game is inclusive and

00:41:03.276 --> 00:41:03.796
accessible.

00:41:04.476 --> 00:41:05.486
>> More and more Apple

00:41:05.486 --> 00:41:06.716
frameworks and elements are made

00:41:06.716 --> 00:41:08.856
accessible with each release, so

00:41:08.936 --> 00:41:10.316
the more you use native

00:41:10.316 --> 00:41:11.946
frameworks, the more people will

00:41:11.946 --> 00:41:13.416
be able to use your app.

00:41:14.196 --> 00:41:15.186
>> All right, we're in the home

00:41:15.186 --> 00:41:15.636
stretch.

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:16.336
Hang tight.

00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:17.986
We're going to move on to

00:41:17.986 --> 00:41:19.346
attention to detail.

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:21.396
>> Attention to detail is a core

00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.366
value at Apple.

00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:23.866
It's something we strive to do

00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:25.276
in everything we do.

00:41:25.806 --> 00:41:27.386
>> Meticulous and deliberately

00:41:27.386 --> 00:41:29.356
designed apps and games are the

00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:31.676
outcome of hard work, the desire

00:41:31.676 --> 00:41:34.176
for perfection, and it's also a

00:41:34.346 --> 00:41:36.306
telltale sign that the people

00:41:36.306 --> 00:41:37.836
that created the app or game

00:41:38.136 --> 00:41:39.886
cared about every single aspect

00:41:39.886 --> 00:41:42.046
of the experience down to the

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.536
last pixel.

00:41:43.656 --> 00:41:45.966
So let's talk about Flow by

00:41:45.966 --> 00:41:46.586
Moleskine.

00:41:47.456 --> 00:41:49.016
This is a drawing app that has a

00:41:49.016 --> 00:41:51.206
continual horizontal canvas with

00:41:51.206 --> 00:41:52.806
a fully customizable set of

00:41:52.886 --> 00:41:53.206
tools.

00:41:54.016 --> 00:41:56.316
This app has one goal and it's

00:41:56.316 --> 00:41:58.316
to help you stay in a state of

00:41:58.316 --> 00:41:59.316
creative flow.

00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:01.096
Now we're just going to focus in

00:42:01.096 --> 00:42:02.676
on one element of this app that

00:42:02.676 --> 00:42:04.676
showcases a tremendous amount of

00:42:04.676 --> 00:42:05.696
attention to detail.

00:42:06.896 --> 00:42:08.786
Flow's tool and color selector

00:42:08.786 --> 00:42:10.366
is one of the most comprehensive

00:42:10.366 --> 00:42:11.876
and easy to use that we have

00:42:12.076 --> 00:42:12.726
ever seen.

00:42:13.506 --> 00:42:14.736
Now you can tell how much the

00:42:14.736 --> 00:42:16.186
developer cared about every

00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:17.416
aspect of this experience,

00:42:18.316 --> 00:42:20.076
because the number of colors

00:42:20.226 --> 00:42:21.036
feel endless.

00:42:21.676 --> 00:42:22.786
And the interaction from

00:42:22.786 --> 00:42:24.516
changing the hue, brightness and

00:42:24.516 --> 00:42:26.286
saturation provides immediate

00:42:26.286 --> 00:42:26.596
feedback.

00:42:27.766 --> 00:42:29.216
To create this experience, the

00:42:29.216 --> 00:42:30.986
developer spent countless hours

00:42:31.056 --> 00:42:31.886
prototyping.

00:42:32.406 --> 00:42:33.446
Now here's an example of a

00:42:33.446 --> 00:42:35.286
prototype that was designed to

00:42:35.316 --> 00:42:36.336
check the interaction

00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:37.506
fundamentals first.

00:42:38.486 --> 00:42:40.076
They used pure text buttons so

00:42:40.076 --> 00:42:41.106
they wouldn't get distracted by

00:42:41.106 --> 00:42:42.336
high-fidelity designs.

00:42:42.866 --> 00:42:44.876
That way they could focus on the

00:42:44.876 --> 00:42:46.646
detail of perfecting each

00:42:46.646 --> 00:42:48.436
interaction of the tool editor.

00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:51.676
Only after the interactions felt

00:42:51.716 --> 00:42:53.496
good did the developers at Flow

00:42:53.496 --> 00:42:55.036
move on to visual design.

00:42:55.586 --> 00:42:58.446
Then they iterated to perfect

00:42:58.536 --> 00:43:00.036
the details of each individual

00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:01.386
tool over time.

00:43:02.176 --> 00:43:04.006
And they simplified how unique

00:43:04.076 --> 00:43:05.286
properties of the tool were

00:43:05.286 --> 00:43:07.396
displayed from the nibs, colors

00:43:07.456 --> 00:43:08.076
and labels.

00:43:09.146 --> 00:43:10.526
And finally, I just want to call

00:43:10.526 --> 00:43:12.146
out how animation brings this

00:43:12.146 --> 00:43:13.756
entire experience together.

00:43:14.576 --> 00:43:16.276
In the real world, things

00:43:16.276 --> 00:43:17.866
transition smoothly from one

00:43:17.946 --> 00:43:18.946
state to another.

00:43:19.506 --> 00:43:21.326
And it's reflected beautifully

00:43:21.326 --> 00:43:22.466
in the Tool Editor here.

00:43:23.466 --> 00:43:25.506
Animation is so much more than a

00:43:25.506 --> 00:43:26.986
series of screens connected by

00:43:26.986 --> 00:43:27.696
transitions.

00:43:28.436 --> 00:43:30.396
Really good animation reminds

00:43:30.466 --> 00:43:32.376
people how to use your UI.

00:43:32.756 --> 00:43:34.396
And it provides feedback and

00:43:34.396 --> 00:43:35.606
also draws your attention

00:43:35.606 --> 00:43:36.296
onscreen.

00:43:37.776 --> 00:43:38.906
But that's not all.

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:42.856
There are over 1,400 unique

00:43:42.856 --> 00:43:43.906
color names in this app.

00:43:44.586 --> 00:43:45.786
And when I asked the developer

00:43:45.786 --> 00:43:49.676
how long it took, they said, "A

00:43:49.676 --> 00:43:49.976
while."

00:43:52.166 --> 00:43:53.786
In addition to collecting and

00:43:53.786 --> 00:43:55.496
sourcing these color names, the

00:43:55.496 --> 00:43:57.306
developer sweated the details to

00:43:57.306 --> 00:44:00.546
determine what the rules were

00:44:00.546 --> 00:44:02.496
for each color and how it mapped

00:44:02.826 --> 00:44:04.156
to each color value.

00:44:05.486 --> 00:44:06.856
The tool palette with an

00:44:06.856 --> 00:44:08.446
expansive color selection

00:44:08.526 --> 00:44:10.456
enables creative expression.

00:44:10.456 --> 00:44:12.386
And that stays true to the app's

00:44:12.666 --> 00:44:14.866
goal of helping you stay in a

00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:15.866
creative mindset.

00:44:17.146 --> 00:44:19.156
The developer absolutely nailed

00:44:19.236 --> 00:44:21.876
the purpose, expanse and joy of

00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:23.756
this experience all through the

00:44:23.756 --> 00:44:25.566
details that come together.

00:44:27.136 --> 00:44:28.696
Now attention to detail helps

00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:30.986
your app or game stand out.

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:34.016
It's all about taking the time

00:44:34.256 --> 00:44:35.666
and being comfortable staying in

00:44:35.666 --> 00:44:37.136
the process of designing.

00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:39.176
And you don't want to settle for

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.786
your first idea or your first

00:44:40.786 --> 00:44:41.276
design.

00:44:42.556 --> 00:44:43.836
It's about being methodical.

00:44:44.386 --> 00:44:45.716
Solve the really big problems

00:44:45.786 --> 00:44:47.396
first, just like Flow did with

00:44:47.396 --> 00:44:48.996
interaction in that prototype we

00:44:49.056 --> 00:44:50.866
saw, before you move on to

00:44:50.866 --> 00:44:52.166
adding further detail like

00:44:52.166 --> 00:44:53.856
visual design animation.

00:44:54.416 --> 00:44:56.976
And I love this statement from a

00:44:56.976 --> 00:44:58.096
really good friend of mine.

00:44:58.556 --> 00:45:00.696
At the end of the day, when

00:45:00.696 --> 00:45:02.286
someone experiences your app or

00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:04.196
game, they should be able to see

00:45:04.196 --> 00:45:04.976
the developer's sweat.

00:45:08.116 --> 00:45:09.786
>> That is kind of gross.

00:45:09.786 --> 00:45:10.806
>> Oh come on, it's not that

00:45:10.806 --> 00:45:10.976
gross.

00:45:10.976 --> 00:45:11.816
>> But I think I know what you

00:45:11.816 --> 00:45:12.226
mean.

00:45:13.046 --> 00:45:14.706
>> Yeah, I think what they mean

00:45:14.706 --> 00:45:16.316
is it shows that the developer

00:45:16.316 --> 00:45:19.136
totally cared about every aspect

00:45:19.136 --> 00:45:21.166
of the experience down to the

00:45:21.166 --> 00:45:23.816
very last pixel.

00:45:24.186 --> 00:45:25.976
>> So we talked about immersion,

00:45:26.136 --> 00:45:28.516
trust -- sorry -- innovation,

00:45:28.516 --> 00:45:30.556
trust, refinement, aesthetics,

00:45:30.696 --> 00:45:32.176
inclusion and attention to

00:45:32.176 --> 00:45:34.626
detail with a single example

00:45:35.216 --> 00:45:36.946
with each award-winning app and

00:45:37.506 --> 00:45:37.596
game.

00:45:38.516 --> 00:45:40.236
>> But all of these apps and

00:45:40.236 --> 00:45:42.506
games embody these qualities of

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.286
great design.

00:45:44.026 --> 00:45:45.996
>> These developers sweated the

00:45:45.996 --> 00:45:48.466
details and created memorable

00:45:48.466 --> 00:45:49.356
experiences.

00:45:49.876 --> 00:45:51.606
>> Those experiences are totally

00:45:51.606 --> 00:45:52.876
immersive and fun.

00:45:53.716 --> 00:45:56.436
>> And everyone, by taking risks

00:45:56.436 --> 00:45:57.866
and staying true to a vision,

00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:00.266
they provided access to things

00:46:00.266 --> 00:46:02.146
that people didn't have before.

00:46:02.866 --> 00:46:04.096
>> And all of these apps and

00:46:04.096 --> 00:46:05.896
games are original.

00:46:06.406 --> 00:46:07.956
There's no copy and paste in the

00:46:07.956 --> 00:46:10.536
world of great design.

00:46:10.686 --> 00:46:11.856
>> These innovations extended

00:46:11.856 --> 00:46:13.296
the reach of care to millions of

00:46:13.296 --> 00:46:14.506
people around the world.

00:46:15.226 --> 00:46:16.726
So we want to thank the

00:46:16.726 --> 00:46:17.926
developers who shared their

00:46:17.926 --> 00:46:18.956
stories with us.

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:20.636
>> It was an honor to get a peek

00:46:20.636 --> 00:46:21.896
behind the curtain at how you

00:46:21.896 --> 00:46:23.126
designed your award-winning apps

00:46:23.296 --> 00:46:23.856
and games.

00:46:25.006 --> 00:46:25.956
>> [Together] Thank you so much

00:46:25.956 --> 00:46:27.536
and have a great WWDC.

00:46:28.241 --> 00:46:30.241
[ Applause ]

00:46:30.466 --> 00:46:30.676
>> All right.

00:46:31.516 --> 00:46:35.500
[ Applause ]
