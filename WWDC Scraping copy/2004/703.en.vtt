00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.100
Today we're going to talk about encoding,
everything from A to Z,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.320
what you need to know from the
pre-production side all the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.890
way to the finished target.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.550
Let me see if this is working here.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.410
Skip that.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.150
I already self-introduced myself.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.260
Encoding means a lot of different
things to a lot of different people.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.140
I imagine we have a gamut of people here,
a lot of beginners and also

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.920
maybe some expert encoders.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.840
But, you know, the workflow is always
going to be the same.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.620
Sometimes some people come
in halfway into the workflow.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.780
They already have it captured.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.070
Other times, you know,
you want to start from the camera

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.060
perspective all the way to capturing,
encoding, delivering,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.670
and then archiving for later repurposing.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.360
Most of the things you need to know
about encoding is to really figure

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.900
out what your target is going to be.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.940
You want to focus your attention on who
you're going to be delivering it to,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.960
so you can pick the appropriate format,
and also so you don't

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.500
waste any resources.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.620
If you're just going to be doing web
content only and never repurpose it,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.680
and you know you're never
going to repurpose it,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.610
there's no point in
shooting on an HD cam.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.910
Obviously,
if you're going to repurpose it,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.270
you want to shoot on an HD cam,
so one day you can put it on an HD DVD,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.250
you want to put it on an HD broadcast,
stuff like that.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.000
You've got to know what to do
for your target with your budget,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.570
etc.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.830
Here are some of the common
encoding targets we have.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.320
Nowadays, they want to make DVDs,
they want to make CD-ROMs.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.700
They want to put stuff on the web,
or with the new whole mobile

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.860
device craze that might be hitting
the wave in the US this year,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.260
you might see a lot of 3GPP or PP2
stuff like you see in Europe and Japan.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.060
You want to take advantage
of all these targets.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.650
The target is going
to define your format.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.530
If you go on a DVD or DVD-ROM,
you're going to encode in a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.530
proper format for that target,
MPEG-2, MPEG-1,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.090
depending on what you're looking to do,
how much material you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.650
want to fit on a DVD,
etc.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.130
If you're offlining
video for later on use,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.680
you want to always offline in
the highest possible format

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.180
for what your purposes are.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.400
Be that HD uncompressed, DVCAM, DVC Pro,
etc.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.140
Always one offline in the
highest possible video.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:02.080
Then you have a variety of formats you
can use for CD-ROMs or the Internet.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.240
You guys know what all
those are on the Internet.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.050
You'll see anything from Windows Media to
QuickTime to Reel to MPEG Layer 3

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.990
for audio and a variety of others.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.320
Flash video.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.320
If you want to call that video.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.320
And CD, you know,
all kinds of other stuff.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.320
So, we'll talk about, you know,
most of the stuff here.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.530
I don't know if most of you
guys are looking here as far as

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.740
encoding to manufacture DVDs or
author DVDs or if everybody's

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.290
really focused more on the Web.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.320
Who's really here interested more in
like Web and mobile device delivery?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.090
That kind of gives me a clue to like,
I don't want to focus on

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.310
DVDs when people are like,
don't care.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.080
But, you know, basically,
if you're interested in, like,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.080
mobile device delivery,
you're going to want to focus on that.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.650
So, basically, if you're doing DVD,
I think the holy grail

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.080
is really the editor.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.320
You know, the beauty about QuickTime and
Apple is that you have one of

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.080
the best editing platforms,
you know, in the world.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.080
You have Final Cut HD.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.070
You want to edit your piece.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.770
You want to just finish
it and then just create,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.080
you know,
different versions to multiple targets.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.390
So, in order to do that,
you define your targets and you

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.080
want to do that in one quick,
easy step.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.050
Well, the question is, can you do that?

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.840
And what tools?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.760
What tools to use to get to your target?

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.840
So, if you're doing a DVD,
it's pretty easy nowadays.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840
I mean, you have Compressor.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.830
It comes with Final Cut HD.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.840
You just create your settings,
stuff like that.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.070
You create a droplet and
I'll show you later in,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.840
you know, through the process how
to create a droplet,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.840
how to create a droplet.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.840
You can attach it to a watch
folder with an Apple script.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.840
So, you can just drag it into a
folder that's on a server.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840
It'll encode itself.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.740
You come in later after
you're doing other stuff.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.840
You can just drink a coffee
and it's all done for you.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.160
Compressor's hands down the most
effective tool right now and the

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.840
cheapest tool if you want to,
you know, do stuff.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.120
Unless you're running a DVD encoding
house where you need to encode

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.000
three times faster in real time,
then, you know, there are other tools,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.830
but you can talk to me about that later.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.690
Then,
if you're trying to do MPEG-4 type of

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.600
format encoding because you want to
maybe do stuff for CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.600
or the web, you know,
it kind of covers that gamut.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.600
And hopefully,
once the H.264 codec comes out,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.600
you'll be able to just cover a
variety of targets with that container

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.600
as far as MPEG-4 is concerned.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.600
Then, you want, you have other tools.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.810
And, you know, it kind of,
and the tool is going to kind

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.600
of be decided upon based on
the codec you decide on using.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.450
So, you'll see that for MPEG-4, you know,
compressor, squeeze, cleaner,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.600
I also didn't mention here,
but there's a product called, you know,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.600
the MPEG-4.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.530
But there's a product by
Totally Hip called the HipFlix.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.530
And there's a couple
other products out there,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.600
I'm sure, you know,
that I don't know about.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600
But the main ones are like
QuickTime Pro for one-offs.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.600
If you want to do batch jobs, cleaner,
squeeze and compressor will do them.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.620
If you're using Sorensen,
you really want to use cleaner

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.600
because it's the only one
that lets you do two-pass VBR.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.850
And I'll be talking about
reverse telecine in a little bit,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.600
so I'll tell you other
reasons to use cleaner.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.950
However,
compressing to a QuickTime movie,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.290
Compressor,
and you're doing it from Final Cut here.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.300
A lot of assumptions here are
that we're using Final Cut.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.540
Why?

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.300
Because it's the best
editing platform out there.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.280
If you're using iMovie,
you can just do the same thing.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.410
Also,
you just create your QuickTime ref movie,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.450
and I'll go through, hopefully,
with Final Cut in my demo on

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.300
how to create your ref movie,
drag it in, and use it.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.290
How many in the crowd use Final Cut?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:08:41.300
[Transcript missing]

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.510
Flash video, if you look at some people,
they're the big craze

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.740
for flash video lately.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.250
I personally don't think the flash
video quality is that great right now.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.590
It's great for tucking heads
and compatibility-wise,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.300
flash is just all over the place.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.530
If you're doing corporate
stuff with tucking heads,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.350
I say use it.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.330
It's fantastic.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.710
You don't have to worry about plug-ins,
etc.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.800
But if you're doing a
lot of high-motion stuff,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.040
it's really not at par
versus other videos as far as

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.400
color saturation and motion.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.500
compensation type of stuff, so.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.290
That's just my opinion on that.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.970
Windows Media, want it or not,
you're going to have to

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.900
encode to Windows Media.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.120
You're going to have clients that
want to encode to Windows Media.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.420
And how do you do that on the Mac when
Microsoft doesn't really have a

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.860
Windows Media SDK to let Mac users
author Windows Media content?

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.260
And there's not much you
can really do about it.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.090
You really have to use a PC if
you want to achieve that.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.650
So, you know, I have techniques.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.590
So you can export to an AVI file,
obviously as a one-off from any,

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.760
you know,
QuickTime Player Pro or from Final Cut.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.860
Or if you don't, you know,
depending on what your source footage,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.340
you know, what your end-use footage is,
you can also just use Compressor

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.230
and do it into MPEG-1 and
a Windows Media Encoder

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.130
will also take that.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.090
And you can have a script,
maybe share a Windows Drive and

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.070
have it just dump in there
and automatically encode.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.040
Now, obviously,
you know that if you encode to MPEG-1 as

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.430
your source for your Windows Media files,
you're going to start losing

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.150
some of those chroma values
and stuff because it's not,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.590
you know, 422.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.740
And you might introduce other artifacts.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.560
But, like I said,
if your footage is coming

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.680
off of a DV camera,
doing something like that is

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.780
not really going to take away
too much of the source for it.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.680
So it all depends.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.230
You know, if I was making a DVD,
I wouldn't do, you know,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.300
I wouldn't do that.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:33.600
But this is all for Windows Media.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.060
So, you know,
I'm going to have to do that.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.720
So it doesn't matter.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.250
Real.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.720
Now, you can, from what I understand,
and I don't know if any

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.600
of you guys have seen it,
but I heard there was going

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.630
to be an export plugin for
Final Cut coming out that's in

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.920
beta right now that will let you,
from Final Cut Project,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.270
just export to real.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.060
I don't know.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.990
It's a rumor.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.930
There's a lot of rumors going on.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.690
But you could have a real encoder,
real producer for Linux running

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.590
or something on a separate box.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.910
I usually run encoders on a separate box.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.540
I can just copy my, you know, files over.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.000
And you could do the same thing that I do
for the AVI files and stuff like that.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.210
Unfortunately, you know,
a PC or Linux box is your

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.300
best bet for real right now.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.100
And hopefully once the
export component comes out,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.260
it'll make it so you
don't have to export,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.690
you know, a large file.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.570
You can just do it from a
ref movie from Final Cut.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.320
And if you guys know of any of that,
just come and talk to me.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.740
Somebody's out there asking me?

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.110
So Compression Master,
I really don't have much to say

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.120
about them because I was trying
to get a hold of the guys and

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.840
they never sent me any info.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.600
But I have, you know, it's,
from what I've heard, it's, you know,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.090
they do a lot of stuff that
you can do with Cleaner,

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.540
but it's like two,
three times harder to use.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.430
So I don't know personal experience,
but it's another app that you could

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.420
use to encode anything in QuickTime and
MP4 files and stuff like that.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.220
It's called Compression
Master by Popwire.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.570
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to get my hands on

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.110
a true release one before this.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.280
So, since most of us here are coming
from Final Cut and we really are

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:20.000
interested in delivering for the web or,
you know, some sort of broadband,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.940
you know, modem, whatever, phones, etc.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.880
Or a non-DVD, I'm going to say.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.230
There's always the debate of
streaming versus download.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.180
So a lot of people say QuickTime and
they always just don't know,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.240
well, is it streaming or is it download?

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.820
They don't know what the difference is,
right?

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.130
So the difference between streaming
and a download movie is two things.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.800
One,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.260
You know,
there's a difference in protocols.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.440
Usually streaming is actually,
and I should have switched this,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.600
streaming is,
true streaming is over RTSP, transport,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.970
and the download or progressive
download QuickTime movies,

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.140
which is like, I like to call them
to differentiate them,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.370
are usually over a web server, HTTP.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.200
So a download movie is
all the QuickTime movie

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.950
trailers you see out there,
extremely high-quality.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.690
What's the difference?

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.970
Well,
a download movie guarantees you every

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.900
single frame gets to your end user.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.640
So for somebody delivering a trailer,
for somebody delivering a

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.260
daily or something like that,
it could be, you know,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.590
it's the proper way of doing it
because you don't miss a frame.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.290
However, you know,
in a progressive download situation,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.550
the way it works with the
QuickTime player is it starts

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.940
playing as soon as it knows
that it will finish playing,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.490
you know, but it'll finish downloading
before it finishes playing.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.170
So, you know, the longer the movie is,
and depending on the data rate,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.220
it'll still be playing.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.960
The bigger the file is going
to be for you to download,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.450
and the longer the latency
to start playing is.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.100
So you've really got to kind
of do some testing as to,

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.670
well, if I want to have a 300K movie,
you know, for download,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.830
and my movies are going to be
on the average of 30 minutes,

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.510
and my users have a connection speed of,
you know, 400K, well,

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.700
that means that my latency on, you know,
by the time they start

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.860
watching it is going to be,
I don't know, two minutes or something.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.300
And I'm just putting numbers out there.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.540
I'm not showing you the numbers.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.280
But I can,
if you have questions about that later,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.030
I can tell you how to calculate that.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.580
So really, HTTP download movies
are not recommended for,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.900
in my opinion, anything over 10 minutes
is really pushing it.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.790
I usually say about seven minutes.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.720
That's why trailers are the
best thing in the world.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.420
Another thing is because when you
have a 30-minute program and somebody

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.060
wants to watch the last five minutes,
they can't start watching that until

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.300
that portion's been downloaded.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.900
Whereas streaming, on the other hand,
is made just for that.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.360
You know, for a two-hour show,
for a three-hour show,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.380
you can get to any point in time,
and you'll get that, you know,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.340
just the part of the
video you want to see.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.740
However, you know,
the con on that is that you don't

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.420
guarantee the delivery of those packets.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.110
If you're doing RTSP,
you can force your player,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.360
and if you're in a situation
where you want to force your

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.650
player to HTTP protocol,
you can do that.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.020
So if you're in a situation
where you want to do quick

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.250
time streaming over HTTP,
then you would be guaranteeing a

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.660
higher rate of packets to the player.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.840
And therefore, you know,
if you're in a situation where

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.600
you have a corporate environment,
you want to make sure they

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.170
get every single frame,
you might want to force that.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.240
But usually, streaming is for
something over 10 minutes,

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.420
and download is for something under
10 minutes if you want to guarantee

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.490
the quality and stuff like that.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.700
That's what I recommend.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.010
So now let's look at some
production techniques.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.010
You guys are familiar with Final Cut.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.900
So, you know,
I don't really have to tell you that if

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.360
you've been editing for a while that,
you know, garbage in, garbage out.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.820
Everybody who edits knows that,
hopefully, by now.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.460
So, you know,
you're not going to take crappy video

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.100
and suddenly make it like HD quality
just by putting it in a computer.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.010
You know,
there's only so much massaging you can

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.120
do in the post and stuff like that.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.000
So, the key is to have a good camera,
you know,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.660
the higher-quality camera you can get,
three CCDs if you're doing DV,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.800
HD cameras, beta cams, digi-beta cams,
you know, better lenses.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.540
All that stuff is going to
just give you that much more.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.940
And you have to balance
that with your budget,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.780
obviously.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.270
and then so how do you when you edit
I'm really talking about compression

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.160
here but when you edit obviously
you want to keep everything in the

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.420
original source format if possible.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.480
So where possible if you can edit in
HD and you capture it and you shot

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.350
in HD that's the best way to go.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.470
If for some reason you can't do that
and you have to go to a lesser format,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.240
well you know I don't recommend that but
you know you got to do what you got to

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.910
do for your budget and really if you're
shooting on HD and you're going to cut

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.390
it for a CD-ROM or something well maybe
it's not that big of a deal if you're

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.890
just going down to DV stuff like that.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.710
So you know when we think of
compression what compression does

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.430
is obviously it reduces the amount
of data of your original source.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.320
You know back in the day when if you
have some type of storage constraint or

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:36.820
something like that obviously you might
want to capture it in a more compressed

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.850
format so you can do all your editing
you know and once you have that in

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.240
Final Cut I don't know if you're familiar
with the feature but you can trim your

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.720
project so that then you can go ahead
and recapture it at a higher data rate

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.190
and then just take advantage of the space
you have on your drive stuff like that.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:18:11.160
Compression is a container of the movie.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.880
Codecs are compressor-decompressors.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:20.780
They usually define just how much
you're going to compress video or audio,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.370
and they have many different properties.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.730
If you went through that session,
you probably would have learned

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:32.020
something on what codec to
pick for what type of target.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.760
Now I'm going to proceed
to hopefully my demo.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.980
This isn't really going to be a big demo.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.140
Like I said before,
if you're thinking of doing...one

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.980
of the big things that people
do is... Is it working?

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:49.980
Yeah, they're all working, all three.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:50.980
Okay.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.660
So one of the big things is that
people don't understand that a

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.980
lot of footage is shot on film.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.980
And obviously all the movie trailers,
that's all shot on film.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.910
So that footage is all
24 frames per second,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.980
and when you compress it and
you're taking footage that's 29.97,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.980
you're automatically compressing it.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.650
So you're automatically taking almost six
extra frames and putting those through

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:20.980
your compressor and increasing the amount
of data and therefore your end target.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.980
And so you're still encoding
all these phantom frames.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.150
So what you want to do is you
want to reverse telecine it,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.510
bring it back to a 24-frame
source so that when you encode it,

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.690
you get the purest encode because
it's just using the necessary data.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:42.450
Cinema Tools lets you do this, however,
there's a big "if." The big "if"

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.490
is that you actually have to know
and understand what the process

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.430
of inserting Phantom Frames
is and all that good stuff.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.150
I've been working in the
video field for a long time.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.180
and it's still kind of tricky to me.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.810
So if you did have your footage,
and you know, maybe you're a post-house

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.940
or something like that,
and you know the sequence,

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.780
and I'll show you what
I mean by sequence.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.900
Let's open up a clip.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:22.190
I'm going to get Britney Spears or R.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.190
Kelly.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.190
I'll open that.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.400
So let's just open up a clip,
and we want to do what's

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.700
called a reverse telecine.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.700
We want to remove all the phantom frames.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.920
This is originally a film clip,
and we want to take out those

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.580
six frames per second out.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.250
So we can go ahead and
click on Reverse Telecine,

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.100
and it's going to ask us what
the options of the pulldown is.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.060
So you have four options here.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.170
The problem here is usually that
people don't know which option to use.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.640
Also, when you do a reverse telecine,
you have to start, well,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.880
as far as Cinema Tools is concerned,
because it just assumes that the

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.840
first frame is always an A-frame.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.490
And I'm not going to
explain to you what that is,

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.480
but, you know, basically, like I said,
you have source 24 fips per second.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.400
When you change it over to 2997,
you're basically just introducing

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.160
a duplicate frame every so often.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.160
So, you know, you say, okay,
at third frame, introduce, you know,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.540
the same one,
so the eye doesn't see it because

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.460
they're two of the same in a row.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.630
You don't notice it.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.240
You want to strip those out.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.070
So if you don't know what an A-frame is,
or you already captured this,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.120
and you didn't capture an A-frame,
you won't be able to use this at all.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.190
But if you are in a pinch,
what you can do is you can take, like,

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:45.360
10 seconds of footage, pick one of these,
and then go ahead and say, okay,

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.580
I'm going to pick, you know, this one.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.720
And if you see here, this is the sequence
that we're going for.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.840
So if you don't know,
you would have to go through,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:00.640
create the iterations, pick them,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.460
and then go ahead and
reverse-tele-synch it.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.620
This is going to go on for a little bit.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.820
So you can see how
painful this process is.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.860
Well,
that's because Cinema Tools is really

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:17.160
made for the post house that gives you
the 2997 with the burnt-in sequence.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.690
So you can just-- oh, well,
the sequence is AABB_B.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.750
Then I pick that, and boom, it does it.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.110
And usually,
you would do this before importing

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.450
your source into Final Cut.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.230
Therefore, for encoding,
this isn't always really helpful unless,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.630
one, you know what you're doing.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.060
Two, you do some testing.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.680
So that now-- I'll show you what-- just
so you know what would end up being here.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.820
What I didn't see is
where it put my file.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.250
I think in here.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.600
Okay,
so just so you can see what something

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:00.300
that was telecine-ed and possibly wrong.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.370
When you see it play back,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.200
Actually, I picked the right one.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.950
You want to look for frames
that are like stuttering,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.260
any part where it stutters.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.810
So, unfortunately,
I picked the right setting and

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.600
actually did that on purpose
because I'd used that one before.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.600
But you would have to
go through each frame,

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.090
and when you see a duplicate
frame where it's stutter,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.590
that means you picked the
wrong pull-down method.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:30.960
So, if you want to use this, you can,
but you have to test it a lot.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.550
Now, if you look at the size of the
file that I just telecineated

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.690
versus the original Brittany Club,

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.080
You can see that this
is the one we telecine.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.390
It's 143 megs.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.340
The original clip is 180 almost.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.030
So, you know,
you're saving almost 40 megs,

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.860
and that's 40 megs less
of data you're encoding,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.340
and it can drastically increase
the quality of your video.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.770
This is only an 11-second file.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.090
That's why using any type of
tool that's going to do a reverse

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.880
telecine is going to be very,
very valuable.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.190
Like I said,
I don't recommend using cinema tools

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.400
unless you know what you're doing,
and even then, it's tricky.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.180
You have to do some tests.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.550
But if you use Cleaner,
and you're using Source that

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.070
you know comes from film,
but it's now 2997,

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.040
use the telecine feature.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.980
And what it does is it
actually goes through,

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.700
reads a bunch of frames,
and then it calculates.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.740
It's a lot of work to figure out
what sequence is the right one.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:38.270
Now, some people make the mistake
of just telecining everything,

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.570
because they figure, you know,
but if your content is

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.920
not all coming from film,
you should never do that.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.860
Otherwise,
you will end up with stuttering

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.890
or frames where you have bad
interlacing and stuff like that.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:55.950
So this is just to show you
about the reverse telecine in...

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:13.200
[Transcript missing]

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.450
So, we're talking, you know,
a lot of people say, well,

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.300
on the Internet, what am I going to do?

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.120
What's, you know,
what's our targets nowadays?

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.860
I mean, it's always changing.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.320
What's 200 KB?

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.860
What's 300 KB?

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.960
Or why is it that the
Apple trailers look so good,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.340
those large ones, you know,
but how do they do it?

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.570
You know, well, they do it, you know,
they're usually like 25 megs,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.540
and that's why they look so good.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.770
And on a broadband connection, well,
you'll start seeing it, and because,

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:47.570
like I said, it's only five minutes,
you know, people think, oh, it's great,

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.790
but, you know, when you try to do that
to a 30-minute clip,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.940
it's not as great.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:56.330
So,
if you're doing encoding for streaming,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.330
you're

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.870
You really gotta pick
your targets accordingly.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.290
People are still dealing with modems.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.380
I mean, the US is really the only
country that has their modems.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:12.230
Everybody gets like a 56K connection,
gets like 38K or higher, but even then.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.600
But outside the US,
a lot of people are still getting

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.720
20K connections or 30K connections.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.200
So when you think of a 28K modem,
you really want to

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.250
encode for 20 kilobits.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.560
Now, why is this?

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.790
Because people don't
understand that on modems,

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.370
you have header packets that
are in the modem packets.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.880
So you're losing already information.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.690
So you can't get any closer than 20K,
and that's for your

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.150
combined video and audio.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.800
So if you're aiming at a 56K modem, well,
nobody ever gets 56K.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.680
It's physically impossible, you know,
unless you're like in a lab at Rockwell.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.570
53K over a POTS line is probably
as good as it will ever get,

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.360
and rarely do people get that.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.020
So I think the average right now
in the US is right around 40.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:26:59.980
That's pretty high.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.430
It's gone up.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.460
But outside of the US,
rarely do people get 40KB.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.710
So you want to, you know,
you have to kind of pick

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.300
that target accordingly.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.400
If I was only encoding content
for modem users in the US,

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.500
I could probably do 38K, 40K.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.940
If I was doing it global,
I would probably do 32K with QuickTime,

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.010
you know.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:24.340
Now, you can also use
multiple bitrate targets.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.740
With QuickTime, so you could encode,
you know, you encode your 20K, your 38K,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.930
and then you, you know,
you create a ref movie, stuff like that.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.220
But so we'll go on ISDN.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.580
I don't even know people
that have ISDN anymore,

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.180
but people still want kind
of that middle of the road,

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.740
100K, 80K.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.030
It's a good target for corporate
small business for a lot of people.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:50.740
If you do a lot of corporate work,
anywhere from 100 to 150K,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.320
it might not be bad,
unless they have a lot of bandwidth.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.160
For their users,
then you can go up to 300K.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.990
But obviously, if people are watching,
you know,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:07.180
if there's 50 users watching 300K
in a company and they only got a T1,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.400
well, it's going to look pretty bad.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.560
So broadband users, you know,
I've seen people right now

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.120
go anywhere from 300 to 500K.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.650
It all depends what your target is,
again.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.570
But with broadband,
because it's a single pipe,

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:24.300
you can get away with going 500,
even 700 on a lot of cable stuff.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.170
So it all depends.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:30.740
And then we're going to talk about how
the data rate really lets you choose

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.610
what your window size is going to be.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.550
So,
based on the data rate and your content,

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.290
you're going to have to choose a codec,
right?

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.750
If you're going to be encoding
in a standards-based format,

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.110
such as MP4 or something like that,
you're going to want to use

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.530
probably the MPEG-4 codec,
or hopefully the 264 codec,

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.610
when it comes out.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.800
If you're going to be
doing a QuickTime movie,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:09.280
you might want to either choose the
MPEG-4 codec for a lot of compatibility,

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.000
for a lot more standards-based stuff,
so you have that choice,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.580
or the Sorenson Pro Video codec.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.540
If you use the Sorenson codec,
always use the Pro version.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:23.160
Never use the regular one,
unless you really, really,

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.890
really have to, because the quality is
not going to be there,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.650
and it takes even longer to encode.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.780
Now,
the drawback with Sorenson Pro is that

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:35.940
it takes two to three times longer
to encode than an MP4 codec video.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.090
However,
Sorenson Pro has better color saturation,

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.840
and I think it deals better
with motion than MP4.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.170
But if you know what
you're doing with MP4,

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.880
and you do a couple tests,
you can take an MP4 encoded

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.950
clip and adjust a little bit
color correction in Cleaner,

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.810
using some of those things,
and you could actually

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.640
match Sorenson saturation.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.400
You're going to have to tweak that.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.780
People that automatically
off the bat say,

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.770
well, MP4 just doesn't match the
quality of Sorenson Pro,

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.670
have never done that tweaking.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.860
At first glance,
you'd say right away Sorenson wins.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.550
But for the compressionists out there,
doing a little color correction tweaking,

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.940
a little gamma,
a little brightness contrast adjustment,

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.760
99% of people will never be
able to tell which one's better.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.740
So then, audio.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.620
So then you have audio codecs like,
you know, AAC, QDesign Pro,

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.380
Qualcomm PureVoice,
which I don't even know if

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.810
people use it that much anymore.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:41.390
But it all depends.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.760
If you're doing stuff for modems,
corporate stuff, headshots,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.180
you want to use PureVoice,
because it's super low, low bandwidth.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:55.520
If bandwidth is not an object,
then you want to use AAC, you know,

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.850
because it's just hands down
the best codec there is for,

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.690
you know,
for music and voice or a combination of

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.980
both when bandwidth is not an object.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.160
Some people want to use MP3s
because it's more of a standard,

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.080
stuff like that.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.010
It's not a bad deal, but MP3,
MP layer 3 tends to not have

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.580
as high quality and I think
also use a little bit.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:25.060
Sometimes you see more sync issues when
you're using video with an MP3 type of.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:30.110
So I talked about Sorenson Pro Video,
just to go over this a little bit.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.300
It lets you deliver probably the highest
quality video without any tweaking,

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:40.300
but also you have to use most of your
encoding time compared to other videos.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.660
If you're using VBR encoding, 2Pass VBR,
you will only be able to

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.820
use Cleaner to do this.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.150
and it has excellent,
excellent scaling capabilities.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.920
However, it's also pretty CPU intensive
if you're aiming at like G3s

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.630
or stuff like that by any,
you know.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.510
Standard codecs.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:07.070
If you were here for the codecs session,
there's just a gazillion

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:08.500
codecs that QuickTime handles.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.840
Some people have probably
never heard of some of them,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.970
and they have all a variety of uses.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.130
So I'm not going to rehash on that,
but mostly for Internet delivery,

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.460
you're going to use the
ones that I was mentioning.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.080
For instance,
you could possibly use MPEG-1

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:31.040
if you're doing IPTV stuff,
any of the H.263, H.264 codecs,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:38.230
and obviously MP4 or any
of the 3GPP or GPP2 codecs.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:44.310
If you're offlining stuff,
you might use a JPEG for

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:50.970
offlining stuff to get lossless,
or DV or MPEG-2.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.700
Like I said before,
always use the pro versions of the codecs

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:01.270
if you're using QDesign or Sorensen Pro.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.760
You know,
a faster... I don't agree with that.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.380
So, let's talk about some web
video production techniques.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.250
I don't know how many of you
folks out there do any of the

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:19.880
actual production for shooting,
but if you are doing any production,

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.380
you want to remember a lot of basic
things are going to go a long,

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.690
long way when it comes to encoding,
especially when you're encoding

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.270
for CD-ROM or lower target.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.180
These are techniques that
people just don't think of,

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.270
but they actually, you know,
they just make a really big difference.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.120
I said before,
use the highest quality camera

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.720
you can get your hands on.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.120
When it comes to audio,
use the best quality mic

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.620
you can get your hands on.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:51.240
Use a lav mic if you can, use a boom,
or if you're using a camera mic,

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.680
just make sure you have
the camera well in there,

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.770
make sure you're monitoring the audio,
stuff like that.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.810
Make sure you are,
if you're shooting something

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.260
for a talking head,
for example,

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.640
and there's a piece of the backdrop
that's moving because of the wind,

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.730
don't shoot it there.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.850
Make sure you can shoot it
with a static background.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:17.240
The more movement there is,
the more the codec is going to

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:21.340
have to work on the whole scene,
instead of just working on the

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:23.710
little pieces that are changing.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.820
The less movement you have in a frame,
that means the higher quality

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.790
video you'll be able to
get at a lower data rate,

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.020
with any codec.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.520
You always want to look for solid color,
stuff like that.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.060
Poor shading is going to bring
in artifacts if you have a

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.150
background that's not well lit,
stuff like that.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.510
Also, if this is going to be only
for encoding at CD-ROM or lower

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.970
rates and stuff like that,
and you're looking at

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:55.360
something corporate,
something not too fancy, do all cuts.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:35:00.160
Don't do crazy long fades,
because when you're going through a fade,

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.560
every frame in that fade is a pixel
that's changing in a dissolve,

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.660
for example.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.470
Well, that's going to encode a lot worse
than if it was just a straight cut.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.350
Now, you know,
you've got to take production value

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:21.000
versus the value of your encode and weigh
it out and see what you really want.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.980
But if you're going for broadband,
chances are nowadays you

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.260
won't need to do that.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.330
Another thing is,
anytime you have a handheld camera

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.420
versus a locked-down stationary camera,
you're going to be 10

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.990
million times better,
because what we don't notice sometimes

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.550
is where the frame is moving.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.040
Even if it just moves one pixel,
that is going to change.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.940
It's not going to be that
much harder to encode.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.110
So always make sure you have
locked-down and well-lit cameras.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.950
So now we're going to talk about
more of the interesting stuff,

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.680
not the Cinema Tools demo,
which I wish I had cleaner also

00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:01.140
so I could show you what I was
talking about in Telecine.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.440
Oh, it is right here.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.940
Well, we might talk about it
later if we have time.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.340
This is more important, Compressor.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.700
There's some cool stuff in Compressor.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.160
I mean,
I really think Compressor is kind of

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:22.950
at its baby stage right now because
it's only a 1.2 or 1.0.2 version,

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:28.710
but with a little bit of help,
it can really blow up

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.290
into something that...

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:40.020
Compressor is a simple, easy,
and fast way to create a time-saving

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.840
workflow that works for you.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:52.370
You can also use it to create a
time-saving code that works for you.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.700
What I have in my workflow is I have
a server that does all the encoding.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:02.200
And I set up Compressor there,
and I set up a shared drive.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.290
And on that shared drive,
I have in an area just different folders.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.250
And in those folders,
I'll have a little droplet

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.560
that I created with Compressor.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:21.070
"What you really want to make sure is you
want to make sure you go to Compressor

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.760
and you want to make sure you've got 1.2.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:30.270
If you don't have 1.2, you might not see
everything you see here.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:34.040
So make sure you update your copy to 1.2.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.530
You can create a destination,
and we'll go ahead and create

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.140
some custom destination here.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.620
Say local.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.300
Spin it around.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:54.400
Okay, I'm just gonna do it.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.840
In my Raul folder.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:11.500
So you create a destination,
you can name it here.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:16.090
Okay.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.690
You can make it a default if you want,
but we're not.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:27.280
So, in Compressor here, you have Presets,
Destinations,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.280
I showed you how to make a destination.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:34.700
[Transcript missing]

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.600
Let's open up.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:49.550
So, what you usually want to have is...
Let's take one of our sample movies here.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:55.780
Kelly.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.200
It's a little bit too big.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:03.800
So, we can go ahead and now
when you hit Preview,

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.890
so you can like adjust any
settings you might have.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.890
This is especially good
for adjusting filters.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.630
You want to keep this window open.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.000
Pick a good frame that has like a
lot of changes or a lot of... Oh,

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.300
this is not good.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.390
Maybe this one because
there's a lot more.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.090
There's not a lot of color
in this whole video clip.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.000
So, but here you got the skin tones.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.550
You want to make sure the skin
tones of both people come out fine.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:38.600
[Transcript missing]

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.460
So let's say we were going
to create an MPEG-4 clip.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.930
Let's say actually,
because we were going to use our

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:56.410
24 frame-per-second footage that
we reversed telecine in here.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.200
I'm going to use this one.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.490
This one I'm going to remove.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.840
Go ahead and create a preset for that.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.290
I'm just actually going to use
one of these presets already here.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.750
Seems like there's a bow.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.860
So, a bunch here.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.890
We're going to use it,
we're going to make it for broadband.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:21.060
So I want large progressive
because it's a small clip.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.780
I can look at all the specs here,
down here.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.600
Shows you what specs of that setting is.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.790
I can see, you know, if I want to adjust.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.380
One of the things I was
talking about earlier is that,

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.700
you know, unfortunately what you don't
have here is an AVI export.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.600
If you did, you could get to your,
you know,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:43.920
have it export to AVI and put it on some
type of Windows box or Linux box with

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.140
Real Producer or Windows Media Encoder,
and then you could get to those

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.550
clients that need that type.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.950
If you don't have to worry
about Windows Media or Real,

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.900
then, you know, your job is done here.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.620
Yes?

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.840
No, not MPEG Layer 3 audio,
MPEG-1 Layer 3 audio.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.530
You're talking about audio?

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.800
Well, here, this is just,
this is the container format.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:15.260
So, for example, if you, you know,
wanted the actual...

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.160
So no, not if you want to do-- yeah,
you're right.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:29.790
It only lets you do their standard audio.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.370
Eric Wright.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.510
But here you should be
able to set MPEG audio.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:45.300
[Transcript missing]

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.440
I really, if I was making an MPEG,
if I was making a .mov file,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.860
I would never use MP3 audio.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.290
I mean, there's really no point,
especially when you have AAC and

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.540
stuff like that for MP4 files.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.870
I don't see the advantage of using it.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.840
MPEG-1 Layer 3 audio is
really only good for,

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.500
in my opinion,
for audio because of such the, you know,

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.430
acceptance over the amount
of players out there.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.630
It has that advantage,
but when it comes to video and audio,

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.110
I don't see the advantage of
putting them both together at all.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.990
So,
let's go back to just making a standard,

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:24.170
you know, MP4 file,
which is what we're looking to do here.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.480
A lot of things, you know,
like I said before, you have to pick.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.250
You know, what your data rate is.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.920
Now, what is constant versus VBR?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.960
Well, when you're doing a
constant bitrate movie,

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.670
you're looking for consistency.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:46.060
Constant bitrate movies are great for,
if you're, for some reason,

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.240
if you were encoding
MP4 files for hardware.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:55.900
Hardware specs usually are a lot
less lenient than specs for software.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.700
So, people don't realize a good
example is when you make DVDs.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.380
Some people, you know,
they're making a DVD for a client.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.480
It's a 20 minute video.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.880
They figure they got 4.7 gigs on the DVD.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.070
You know what?

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.400
I'm going to pick this
one thing that says,

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.430
"Give me 60 minutes
highest quality." Well,

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:18.470
they don't notice they're making
like this DVD MPEG-2 file that's

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.500
running at like 9 megabits.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.910
Well, most of your players out there,
when the person puts the DVD in there,

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.230
they're just going to barf
and they're going to call you

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.380
up and they're going to say,
"What's it?

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.420
Well, I made it the highest quality.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:29.420
Look at it.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.420
It's not bad." "High quality?

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.010
Look around my computer." Well, yeah,
but, you know, hardware,

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:36.500
if you ever looked at a real DVD,
you know, high quality production DVDs,

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.930
you pick up a Spider-Man DVD or some,
it's one of the latest really hot ones.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.680
And you change your display on your,
on your VCR at home until

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.050
you hit like most Pioneer,
Sony's they'll have.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.860
They'll have a data rate tracking.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.760
And just watch that.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:52.110
The sweet spot for encoding
DVDs is really anywhere between

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.300
5.5 and 6 megabits per second.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.840
Sometimes you'll see stuff go up there,
but you don't realize that anytime

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:04.180
you go above 6 megabits per second,
you're shortening the

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.440
compatibility window.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.890
And so that's where you're
going to run into issues.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.900
So you've got to be aware
of what your targets are.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.220
And when it comes to DVDs,
you deal a lot with hardware.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:18.970
Now that we have MPEG-4,
there's a lot of people that are

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:21.320
dealing with MPEG-4 hardware,
so you've got to be aware of that if

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.900
you are dealing with any of those.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.540
If you're just dealing for the Internet,
chances are you've just got to know

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.000
what your end-user's broadband is.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.580
So we're going to say, well, 300K.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:38.000
And actually, I want it to be medium VBR,
just so it less...

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.800
I can't select it there,
so...

00:44:43.300 --> 00:45:00.600
[Transcript missing]

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:05.360
Well, we're going to keep stereo.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:10.190
64 KB is pretty good for audio,
for music.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:11.690
And I'm not going to stream it.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.300
This is progressive download,
so I don't need any

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.420
streaming hints at all.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:20.430
Hinting is strictly for streaming,
so it has all the packetizer information

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:24.440
so that the streaming server can chop
it up into little bits and pieces.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.090
You don't need that.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.730
Don't select it.

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.650
And then the beauty about Compressor,
it's got all the filters

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.840
for QuickTime stuff.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.950
So if you wanted to, for example,
deinterlace something,

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:39.410
do gamma correction,
which comes in really handy because,

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.600
well, what am I going to gamma correct?

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.000
Well,
I've got to see what I'm doing here.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.660
Now,
some things people don't realize is that,

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.470
you know,
we encode a lot on Macs and stuff,

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.200
but a lot of your users
are going to be on a PC,

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:59.180
and the PC graphic cards have
a totally different gamma.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.540
And a lot of times you'll
encode this and you'll say,

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.020
like, well, you know,
this looks pretty good.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:04.920
It looks well lit here.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.880
And then you see on a
PC monitor it's all dark.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.480
So you have to adjust for that,
and depending on the tool you're using,

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:17.600
you know, usually what you want
to do is you want to,

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.990
if you're encoding on a Mac,

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:28.890
You want to go under 1.0 and
make it a little bit lighter.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.140
Sometimes it's depending on the content,
but in this case I'm going to go at 0.8.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.230
I'm actually going to go 0.9 not only.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:39.330
Just a tad lighter in the gamma
correction is going to make the

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.050
content on the PC be that much better.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.870
If I was encoding on a PC,
I'd do it the opposite direction.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:50.740
I would make the content just a
little bit darker so that I would

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.590
get the best quality overall.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.700
There's a lot of filters
you can use here.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.540
There's noise removal.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.030
There's all kinds of stuff.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.410
You know,
the reason of shooting the footage

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.200
in the best possible way is so
you can avoid using any of these.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.190
But the ones you might use
would be deinterlacing,

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:14.090
if you wanted to deinterlace your
files so you can have a progressive

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.200
frame so it compresses better.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.450
Also, you know,
if you wanted to letterbox

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.190
stuff just to make it look cool.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.380
or just to give it that feel for
what your website is all about.

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.510
You can also do cropping here,
all that stuff.

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.950
We're just going to leave it default,
stuff like that, just for the purpose of

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:35.220
showing how to use this.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.220
So in summary,
you can look at this once again,

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.800
see what your preset's all about,
and then you can save it as a

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.960
droplet by clicking on here,
on the save selection as droplet.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.810
It's going to say, okay,
where do you want to save this droplet?

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.840
What do you want to name it?

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.840
Well, I'm going to call it WWDC.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.280
Thank you.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:48:02.200
And put it in my... I don't
want the source folder.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:37.300

[Transcript missing]

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.570
Now, where does this become automation?

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:13.170
Well, if you only have one machine
and you're not really,

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.630
like I said,
doing this in a server environment,

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:18.410
you're done there.

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:23.380
Now, if for some reason,
let's say you had something in here,

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.220
and we'll just call this folder.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:35.530
Here, we'll call this My Server.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:38.100
Let's say that was a folder on My Server.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:42.310
Then what I would do is-- and
I don't know if you guys want to

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:47.880
write some of my stuff down here.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.910
This is the wrong one.

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:00.880
So what we do is,
you see this little script here is

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.540
really for a watch folder script.

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:08.760
And if you guys want the script,
just leave me a card or something.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:13.160
I'll send you guys an email with
the script and all that good stuff,

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.980
put it on our website or something.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:23.490
And basically the way to use it is
what you're going to want to do.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.280
This is not what you're wanting to do.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.700
Can't find my cheat sheet.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.420
Okay,
so what you're going to want to do is

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:46.750
you're going to want to take the script,
put it into your scripts under Library,

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.250
Apple.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.870
I don't have it in here.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:56.690
"I'm not actually going
to go over it then.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:02.200
But what you want to do is I'll send
you the exact stuff you need to do.

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:05.140
You basically take the script
that I'm going to give you.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:11.880
You can change a couple things.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:11.880
At least I like to change
the name in the script.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:15.550
In the script,
you see the droplet needs to

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:22.210
be named CompressorDroplet.

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:22.210
So my droplet was named
CompressorDroplet.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:25.030
My Droplet was named WWDC Drop.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:32.390
You would change this
name here to WWDC Drop.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:41.480
and then you would go ahead and
put it in your scripts folder.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:46.710
Once it's in the scripts folder,
whatever you decide to

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.200
use as your standard,
you can just create

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.100
this whatever you want.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.440
And then what you do is you create
a folder for every different preset,

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:58.200
and I would create a folder
in my server that says,

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:05.470
"Okay, this is going to be just for
MPEG-4 24p content." You know,

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.480
that's going to cable targets.

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:12.550
And then what you do is when you're done,

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:17.700
You can just go ahead and create,
you know, take your stuff, your files,

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:23.190
drag them into the folder, and boom,
and then the watch script

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:26.070
will just go ahead,
force that droplet onto that

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.470
folder when new content comes in,
move it into a done

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.510
folder when it's done,
and leave the encoded

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:33.830
content there already.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.270
Because I'm not here in
a server environment,

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.660
I can't really show you
guys how to do that.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:46.600
Yeah, the droplet.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:55.930
So the script would really
only be so that your machine,

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:59.780
in a case, like,
if you wanted to offload the

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.440
CPU usage so that another
machine is just cranking all the,

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.480
you know, doing all the encoding while
you're doing stuff here,

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.450
you can go ahead, copy that to a folder
that's going to do that.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.490
If you only have one machine,
then you just use the droplet

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:16.750
like it is right there,
and then we would just take, you know,

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:20.110
this file here, drag it onto the droplet,
and we're done.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.620
You see?

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.970
Yeah, you never make it roll.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.370
You can have a droplet for each
one and drag your ref movie there.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:34.440
You can have a destination for each .
You can have-- or the same destination,

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.860
so that all your files get done in one.

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:38.180
Yeah.

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:43.980
The script is only good so that
this-- if I had another server,

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.470
I would have the scripts-- oh.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.750
What you need to do in order to
make the droplet work is tell it

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.120
not to show that and then save it.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:56.190
So let's quit the droplet.

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:03.140
Let me just get this running.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.440
I'll answer your question.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.600
So when you're in an
automated environment,

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:10.630
you're going to be doing maybe 10,
20 clips at a time and stuff like that.

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:14.880
You don't want this, you know,
you don't want... Why is

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.710
it not submitting my file?

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.100
This is strange.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.790
You don't want everything
hogging this machine.

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:29.380
So you create it on a server so that
that server can do all the compression.

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:36.220
Now, the droplet would go in
the folder on the server,

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:36.280
right?

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:40.540
And then the script would go on
the folder on the server also.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.690
The only thing that's on your
machine is the ref movie you create,

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:45.520
and you drag it on to that folder.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:51.020
That's if, like I said before,
if you're using a server

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.020
automated workflow environment.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:57.040
If you don't want to offload
any CPU encoding to your server,

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.460
you basically just, you know,
you would be done here and

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.870
you would just drag it on.

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.220
There's no script involved.

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.350
There's no nothing.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:08.120
Now why this droplet is not working is,
I'm trying to figure out.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:20.270
One thing I find using
this sometimes is that...

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:34.100
[Transcript missing]

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.160
It also comes with DVD Studio.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.220
So it comes with both.

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.970
And you can't get it separate right now.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:45.110
Yeah, go ahead.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:19.390
It also works, but the thing is,
if you had, this is really set up like,

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.640
basically what you would do is
you'd set up your server to do that,

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.860
and then when people are editing,
all they've got to do is drag it.

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.120
So let's say you had like
three capture stations,

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.680
you'd want to set it up this way.

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:34.010
That way you don't have somebody have to
set up all the queue and stuff like that.

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.130
Yeah.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:02.390
And that's what you would
use here in that environment.

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.020
Because then, I mean,
you could still show them if you wanted,

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:09.040
I mean, if you have a class environment,
you could show them

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.720
how to use the batcher,
you know, and maybe just,

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.210
but the problem is that then, you know,
they've got to know how to set

00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:17.120
up a preset and all that stuff.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.330
Yeah.

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:23.260
If they could import the presets,
you could just say, "Okay,

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.400
here are all the presets.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.000
They're going to come from you,"
and you just give it to them.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.520
They drop it in their folder,
and then they could just use

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:31.070
the batcher like he's saying.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.830
Oh, they're not video editors
or anything like that.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.400
They're journalists.

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.970
Yeah, in that case,
you might want to just set it

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.160
up in a server environment.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.780
Stuff like that.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.640
So, there's just a couple things to do.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.880
One is you have to create the droplets.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.440
And obviously,
with a little bit more Apple scripting,

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:56.100
you could probably create a
little bit better interface,

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.740
something where somebody can
pick a droplet out of maybe,

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:03.380
you could have the Apple script,
like look through a main,

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.480
folder that has all your droplets,
and then the journalist

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.930
just needs to say,
oh, well, this is for modem,

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.870
or this is for this.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:19.580
No, you wouldn't see the droplets.

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.190
There would just be folders.

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:24.520
So what happens is the
droplets in the folder.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.740
You know, that's besides the point.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:32.040
And then the journalist, your student,
would just drag it to the folder.

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.340
And what you would do is you would
put the Apple script on the server

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.350
and just attach it to that folder.

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.780
So they just got to know, oh,
for cable here,

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:44.230
for-- so they drag it once,
drag it for this one,

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.400
drag it for that one.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.570
And then they leave.

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:48.580
And then it's just doing its thing.

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:48.580
So then the server is
doing all the encoding.

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:54.590
This script would be reading
the data from the Ref Movie,

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:59.090
and the Ref Movie would be pointing it
to all the sources and stuff like that,

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:00.460
and then encoding.

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:03.610
And, you know, depending, well,
what kind of network do you have?

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:07.280
Because then, if you have 300 students,
then you run into other problems.

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:08.580
Well, I have a...

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.770
You could also have a
script that would basically,

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.050
when something appears in the done file,
check for status,

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.640
and once you see that it
hasn't been written to in a

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.730
certain amount of seconds,
it could send them,

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:39.830
or if that was already your web server,
your QuickTime server,

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.570
it would already send them
the URL for the ref movie.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.120
You could do something like that.

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:45.250
I've seen that done.

00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.620
I mean...

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:50.530
Which one?

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.760
I used to work for Media 100.

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.340
The watch folder.

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.860
Yeah, the watch folder is tricky.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:16.140
Well, you know,
if you guys have questions,

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.670
please come up to the mic.

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.670
We're pretty much

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.420
This was my last demo to end with.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.400
If we can switch it to the slides.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:34.400
[Transcript missing]

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:38.890
Email and please send me an email saying,
give me that script,

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:41.190
and I'll put detailed instructions.

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.610
I'll walk you through it, I promise.

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.740
A little flowchart or something.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.610
Because, yeah,
it's easier when you're doing

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:50.250
it than me explaining it.

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:54.540
You really kind of have to have the
stuff on your end and do it and all that.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.070
And once you see it work, you're like,
oh, okay, I understand now how it works.
