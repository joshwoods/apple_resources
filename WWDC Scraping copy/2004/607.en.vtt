00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.480
Good morning and welcome.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.400
The topic today for our first session is
Third Party Client Management Solutions:

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.900
Managing Mac OS X in the Enterprise.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.900
Presenting is Senior Consulting
Engineer John DeTroye.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.810
Good morning, the dedicated few,
the ones who survived the party,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.810
survived the week.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.810
We're whistling the tune to
the longest day this morning.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.600
Client management lifecycle.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.240
Some of you have attended the desktop
management session yesterday and over

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.060
the last year or so you've seen this.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:35.900

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.300
[Transcript missing]

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:17.730
Remote Control, Help Desk,
Training Center, and Teaching Lab.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.000
Usage Management,
Keeping the Users on Track.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.820
This doesn't necessarily mean
you can't launch something,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.520
although it does,
but it also means keeping the

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.120
systems more in tune with what
the policies and procedures are,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.250
the acceptable use stuff, you know,
not putting software on

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.900
systems you shouldn't have,
being able to use the software you want

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.130
in a teaching environment and education.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.230
It comes down to if you sit down in front
of a computer and the instructor wants

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.100
you to use a certain piece of software,
that's what they want you to use.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.860
They don't want you off
here doing something else.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.740
License management, key thing.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.170
Okay.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.100
In fact, it's tapered off a bit now,
but just think of all of the articles

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.840
we saw in all the IT magazines
and InfoWorld and so forth,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.820
with everybody talking about
all the lawsuits flying around.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.540
You know, Company A bought one copy
of such and such software,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.190
and they deployed it 11,000 times and
thought they could get away with it,

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.660
you know, or didn't know.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.450
They just got a copy in for evaluation,
and somebody left it on their desk,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.440
and next thing you know, it's everywhere.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.740
Patch and upgrade.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.420
We're back to that.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.500
I did the image,
but now I need to upgrade my systems.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.640
I need to do lots of them.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.320
And then the help desk management,
which is the call for help.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.750
I need something.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.810
Take a look at this for me.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.100
Talk to me.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.740
My favorite one is the email message
you get that says the internet is down.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.950
Do you respond to them by email
telling them that you don't think so?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.090
Or do you just call them
on the phone and go,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.510
"Really?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.640
Is it?" There are days when we
wish it actually just would go

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.100
down and stay there for a while.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.890
Well, let's take a look at all
the different players.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.300
Alphabetically, I'm going to go through
them except for Apple.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.280
I get away with that.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.440
Apple Client Management Solutions.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.620
We have three primary
pieces that we play within.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.140
Apple Remote Desktop,
the NetBoot NetInstall technologies,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.100
and Managed Client for Mac OS X.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:46.700
Apple Remote Desktop is designed
to support software distribution,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.870
asset management,
some remote administrative tools,

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.860
and the remote assistance
or the help desk stuff.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.810
In a nutshell,
we handle distribution and updates

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.970
by the way of copying files,
packages, and so forth out across the

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.560
network doing remote installs.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.080
We can do asset tracking through reports,
and we can do remote administration.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.840
We can control and observe workstations,
one or many.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.200
We can also copy and
delete files on a system,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.880
and one of the ones that
everybody likes to brag about

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.460
is the sending Unix commands.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.920
That can be done out to
a whole lot of systems.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.460
So, yes,
you can send one of that RMDIR-R,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.600
you know.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.390
Yes, you can.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:09:02.900
[Transcript missing]

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.770
We can support Mac OS X and Mac OS 9
images with Netboot technology.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.320
And the images can be anything.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.040
I can have complete image sets.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.240
I can have departmental image sets,
you know, the staff versus the technical

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.980
support people versus the people
in the library versus the people in

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.320
the research department can all have
completely different Netboot sets.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.990
I can have a diagnostic set.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.150
So instead of me running around with a
bunch of CDs or a bunch of floppy disks

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.820
or FireWire drives or whatever I need,
I can actually Netboot to a

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.770
complete set of diagnostic tools
and then work on the system.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.180
I can do installers,
automated installers.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.120
The automated installer is
what we call the unintentional

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.280
install where the system,
you boot to it,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.400
it automatically erases your drive,
installs the operating

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.900
system and everything.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.470
And it's really fun to have
somebody who has a good system

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.300
sit down and accidentally do that.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.480
That could be really fun.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.250
Now erasing hard drive.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.760
And you can do upgrade sets so that
you can also store packages and so

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.540
forth out on the net and have them
available so you can do an upgrade.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.460
A single image can span multiple
servers or you can have multiple

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.720
servers supporting a single image
for throughput so that you can have

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.060
this single Netboot image sitting
on a whole cluster of X servers.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:18.940
We like to see that.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.910
Netbooting a whole bunch of machines.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.290
And the pictures you've seen this week.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.450
Of the University of Tokyo Netboot lab,
that's what they're doing.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.300
They use a single image but a whole
cluster of servers and it load balances.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.760
Managed Client for Mac OS X is,
in a nutshell,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.820
the ability to set up a defined
experience for the end user.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.680
And it can be done by user level,
group level, work group level,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.380
or by computer level.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.080
So I can define the settings
for different machines.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.640
It's network-based preference management.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:12:03.500
[Transcript missing]

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.540
So that was Apple.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.460
AltiriS.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.180
AltiriS has some really,
really fascinating stuff that

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.090
they brought to the IT lifecycle
management for the Mac.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.340
They have a completely heterogeneous
cross-platform environment,

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:25.120
and here's some of the tools that come
with the AltiriS client management

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.850
suite in that they support Mac,
Windows, the Unix platforms, Linux,

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.350
and some of the handheld OSs.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:13:40.800
[Transcript missing]

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.590
Server-side components.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.520
It is Windows server-based.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.920
It uses a web-based admin console.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.740
Everybody talks about how they
want a lot of things web-based.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.550
Very, very good for that.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.440
Role in scope-based security to
make sure that you stay within

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.600
the limits that you're allowed
and encrypting the transport.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.200
We don't want all the asset
management information to move

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.620
across the net in the clear.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.650
Plus, things like adaptive display
technology so that you can handle that.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.870
I don't know if they handle
the spoken interface stuff

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.240
that we've just introduced,
but that is definitely something that a

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.720
lot of people look at for qualification
when they bring their software into play.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.180
The shortcuts and wizards,
obviously something to help you get up

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.010
to speed really quickly so that we're
not spending a lot of time learning

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.200
how to use all the different pieces.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.870
And extensible is obviously a
requirement in that we want to be

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.830
able to take the architecture and say,
you know,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.060
I always need the one more thing.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.640
And it's really good not to have
everything boiler-plated for me.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.680
Another idea of a report from
them is going out and looking at

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.270
all my systems on the network and
getting a pretty decent report of,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.250
you know, what's there.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And you notice that doing it as a
web-based report makes it really simple.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.640
You know,
pick your browser and go for it.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.390
The Mac agent,
important to the Mac community,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.740
is the fact that it looks
like it's a Macintosh piece.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.170
It does follow the look
and feel of the Mac.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.800
Some of the features that I like in
this are the ability to be able to

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.540
do blockout periods where I can say,
you know, at this time I don't want

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.020
things being brought to me.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.320
You know, there's a period in which work
gets done versus updates get done.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.690
Checkpoint recovery,
the idea of being able to say, you know,

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.890
what if we get an interruption during the
update process or during the reporting

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.520
process and we want to be able to say,
you know, resume at a later time.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.130
And then things like scheduled
wake-ups for the systems,

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.300
you know, nighttime we want to do
the updates at 2 a.m.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.270
so we wake the systems up, handle,
take care of the reports, the inventory,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.080
and so forth.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.010
And then being able to do client-side
logging so that we can keep track

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.640
of everything on there and see
what's been happening with it.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.680
The roadmap for Altiri,
the inventory solution for the Mac,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.230
and the software delivery solution,
second half of 2004.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.160
The deployment solution
with patch management.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.180
And the remote control
portions are slated for 2005.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.350
And here are some of the customers
that will definitely crow about

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.860
what Altiri has been up to.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.540
This is the first of many reminders that
the Enterprise IT Lab from noon to 3

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.240
today is going to have these companies.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.930
All these people are going to be
over there to be able to answer

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.630
questions and talk to you about
stuff and get a chance to take a

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.380
look at some of their solutions.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.560
FileWave.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:59.120
FileWave is software distribution
and asset management for the Mac.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:05.370
They're a cross-platform desktop and
portable management solution provider,

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.600
and they provide their solution
fully native to the Mac OS.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.090
That's both client and server
are native to the Mac OS.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.440
The FileWave products,
they have software distribution.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.090
The software distribution is

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.690
uses a Mac OS X-based server,
captures all the asset information

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.510
from the clients cross-platform,
and provides you with a series of

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.840
reports and information that I need
to be able to do my job from an

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.150
asset management point of view.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.280
uses a Mac OS X-based server,
captures all the asset information

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.280
from the clients cross-platform,
and provides you with a series of

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.280
reports and information that I need
to be able to do my job from an

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.280
asset management point of view.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:15.160
the clients will pull information
from the system and then provide

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.270
the reports back to the databases.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.870
The server itself runs
as a Unix-based daemon.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.260
It has an admin process and a file
server process for the client requests.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.440
Very scalable using this booster
technology so that instead of having

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.250
just one server to worry about,
I can deploy multiple

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.330
servers out on the network.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.900
The administrator-driven model
is the idea of you define as the

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:46.760
administrator who gets what packages,
who gets what parts in the distribution,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.380
and at what time.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.620
I can also...

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.280
Under FileWave,
I can drag and drop install.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.500
So for instance, Office as an example is
a drag and drop install.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.630
So I can take Office and I can drag it
into a FileWave set and it'll just deploy

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.990
it to the machines that are in that set.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.950
I can also do customized installs
where I can take snapshots of systems.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.550
I can build a known good system,
take a snapshot,

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.600
then install a bunch of components on it,
and then take another snapshot,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.340
and then I can install that new
snapshot onto my systems across there,

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.880
across the network.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.340
Very easy to use.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.250
Here's an idea of the admin screen
with some of the things it brings up.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.220
We have file sets, the clients and groups
that you can manage.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.080
Very simple.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.730
The FileWave client,
Unix daemon under Mac OS X,

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.180
a service under Windows.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.280
It basically,
the client just pings the server

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.190
for an update when it's time for it,
grabs the manifest from the

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.520
server if there's an update,
and then pulls the solution

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.980
down from the storage,
from storage.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.630
So, we have a, this, in this case,
it's a, when the client needs

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.670
to go get something,
it goes and gets it.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.010
It's not a push,
it's a pull system at that point.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.220
And here are what some people have had
to say about our friends at FileWave.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.190
I like the extra plug for Netboot.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.640
Netboot is cool.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.750
If you want to visit FileWave,
you can either stay here in

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.640
San Francisco or you can go to

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.400
I think my boss is around here somewhere.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.380
I have to go visit FileWave,
but they keep asking me.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.290
It's a short trip, right?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.010
: LANDesk used to be part of Intel.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.820
LANDesk is its own entity now.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.580
They're out in the client
management space fully.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.340
Cross-platform,
very good client management suites.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.020
Here's a look at some of their products.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.700
The solution, you know,
and one of the things I really

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.210
like is I love grabbing graphics
from everybody for this stuff.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.260
I mean, this is my client management.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:29.310
Asset management, remote control,
problem resolution, patch management,

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.060
software license monitoring,
and software distribution

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.850
across Mac OS 9,
10, Linux, Unix, and Windows.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:44.030
From a server side,
they use a PC server-based environment to

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:50.470
host the core of the management process.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:56.600
[Transcript missing]

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.340
What it comes down to is that the admins
see exactly the same thing regardless

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.940
of whether they're managing Macs or PCs.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.100
Very scalable.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:22.300
[Transcript missing]

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.540
Here's an idea of some of the
pieces on the LANDesk side.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.230
As an example, we have an update.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:37.020
The policy manager found a
new update for the system.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:54.100
[Transcript missing]

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.200
So we support Mac OS X 2, X 3,
and Mac OS 9.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.480
Directory integration is key.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.300
Directory integration is an
important piece with policy-based

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:14.990
management and the ability to do both
hardware and software inventories.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.940
Remote control management,
taking charge of systems remotely,

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.870
and doing distribution with multicast.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.080
Multicast is a key item in the fact
that when you do unicast broadcasts

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.020
versus multicast broadcasts,
you're talking about bandwidth

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.260
and the cost of network usage.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:38.680
And having it localized into the
various languages makes deployment for

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.670
multinationals definitely a bonus here.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.590
And here's the everything I can do slide.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.690
And if you look at this,
we're actually looking at all the

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.920
devices that are out on a system,
looking at the computer.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.830
You can spot the computers
that are sitting there,

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.490
looking at the tasks that are scheduled,
looking at the patches

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.260
that are set up to run,
looking at all of the different inventory

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.620
information that's available up here.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.700
And at the same time,
and this is something that

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.290
always makes me just kind of...

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.830
You wonder, every time I see a PC window
with a Mac screen on it,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.050
it's just, it's always,
that's fascinating to me.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.760
But then it's, you know,
it's kind of like the same thing that

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.050
when we did the ARD demo and we were
showing the Windows screen on that.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.940
You know,
when you go back and forth between

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.710
that with all the different products,
I think that's so cool that

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.320
we can go back and forth,
you know, and share screens and look

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.540
at everybody else's stuff.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.780
And it ought to be that way.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.880
You ought to be able to just do it,
right?

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.000
And here's some comments on
Landesk from the customers.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.110
The resources for LANDesk
and this information will be

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.580
available again at the end of
the session and over in the IT,

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.280
over in the Enterprise IT Lab.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.960
Once again, from noon to three,
make sure you stop in and

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.800
take a look at these guys.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.020
Marimba, another significant player in
the client management space.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.740
Change in configuration
management across platform,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.680
Unix, Windows, Mac, right?

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.740
Very key.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.730
Desktops, portables, and servers,
the whole gamut.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:43.160
Software delivery,
getting the software out to the systems,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.000
installing the software,
providing updates when needed,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.300
being able to get information,
inventory management, asset management,

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.110
checking on the status
of that deployment,

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.060
what's happening, you know,
has everybody been upgraded,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.220
where are they in the process?

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.910
From a client management perspective,
we're talking about

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.640
managing software change.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.550
We have known good systems that go out.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.800
You need to modify that.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.770
You get new software.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:13.590
You get updates.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.140
You want to be able to
manage that entire lifecycle.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.690
So being able to package applications,
being able to target the distribution

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.780
to specific systems that need it,
and being able to follow

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.540
compliance of that.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.440
We don't want to turn around and say,
well, we bought 30 licenses of this,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.070
but oops, we accidentally installed
it on 3,000 computers.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:42.010
You know,
we've heard the term unattended installs.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:52.200
[Transcript missing]

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.000
Well,
we also have the unintended installs.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.290
And that's when the, "Oh,
I really only meant to

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.800
put 10 copies of that out,
not 10,000."

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:16.400
[Transcript missing]

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.040
Ongoing management, obviously we want to
track what's going on.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.440
We want our assets tracked.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.220
We want to know what's on every system.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.310
You know, if somebody comes in and brings
the Walmart CD in over the weekend

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.740
and sticks it on their computer,
we want to get a report back and

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.000
say that isn't supposed to be there.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.830
And collecting inventory information.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:45.340
Here's an idea of looking at some of the
information and seeing what's out there.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.740
This is the tuner to be
able to go out and say,

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.500
"Here's the information that
I want to subscribe to with the

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.270
updates for various packages."

00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:01.290
So the administrator can set up what
they want made available to the users.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.800
And we do it from a
centralized point of view.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.520
So what we can do is there's
obviously a range of common tasks

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.920
that we want so that the users get
guided through the normal stuff.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.890
You know,
the users being the administrators get

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.940
guided through the normal stuff of what
they want to be able to put together.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.600
And then the idea of
centralized administration.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.770
We're back to that.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.590
I have thousands of workstations or
tens of thousands of workstations

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.620
and I don't want to have to
run around every single site,

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.590
department,
or group and make this stuff happen.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.680
Okay.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.680
Setting up policies based
on users and machines.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.680
We want to ensure
policy-based management.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.820
What we have to have here is the
ability to work with the directory

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.040
architecture that exists so that we can
develop the architecture that exists.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.650
To define who gets what when based
on a directory that's already in

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.540
place and to be able to do updates.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.650
The versionless update idea is
doing patch update management

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.640
based on the parts that are
common without worrying about,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.140
you know, which version of the software
we have versus also being

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:15.510
able to do patch updates,
you know, from 1.1 to 1.11 and so forth.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.280
and then being able to verify.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.240
Verification is absolutely essential.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.460
All too often I've seen cases
where we've put out updates

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.260
and stuff to 100 machines,
but you get no feedback that

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.100
all 100 machines got it.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.320
And getting verification
back is absolutely essential.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.650
Policy compliance.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.910
Notice the graphic up here.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.710
I like this that we're looking at.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:46.330
It's saying that how much of the package,
the green, shows that they're compliant

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:51.380
either at 80%, 70%. In red,
they're showing how much

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.920
they're non-compliant,
how much they're outside of policy.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.230
And then the blue is they haven't
reported in about that stuff.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:02.760
But you look at that and you go, oh.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.200
Okay.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.160
You know, green is good.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:09.080
I mean, as an administrator, you know,
we all think, yeah, you know,

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.430
I can complicate my life a certain way,
but green is good.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.620
I can just, you know,
look at a report and go, oh, yeah, okay,

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.000
cool.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.560
We're set.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.680
Everything's nice.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.870
Inventory discovery,
predefined reports help set up

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.670
your environment for you so that
we can turn around using a browser

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.090
and we can get the reports.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.520
We can graph these out and say, you know,
here's how much stuff I have

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.200
and get the charts out.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.590
I can also scan.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:58.300

Client detail, designed for mobility,
designed for offline use.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.740
The key things here are
the checkpoint restart.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.850
That's number one in that
I want to be able to,

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.740
if I'm busy doing a check,
if I'm busy doing a report,

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.430
if it breaks from the network,
it'll come back and restart

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:20.760
right at the checkpoint.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.850
And the fact that it's
multi-platform is very important.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.810
Now, marimba's been acquired.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.120
and they are adding in the remedy.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.780
You know, the remedy is being added in,
or Marimba's adding remedy to the--

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.840
Yeah, BMC software is requiring them,
so they're going to be using remedies

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.800
coming in over top of Marimba to add
functionality to the environment.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.650
And what we're looking at here is
to be able to expand the capability

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:02.240
to be able to do repositories,
dynamic discovery of systems, okay,

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.120
being able to dynamically capture
systems when they show up,

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.630
to be able to support literally
everything for applications,

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.800
code changes in the system.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.340
and once again policy based

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:42.700
[Transcript missing]

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.940
All right, Harley-Davidson and NASA.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.720
Now, there's a meeting.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.380
And they will be in the lab,
the enterprise lab,

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.320
so you can take a look at their stuff.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.320
Okay?

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:09.780
Netopia, another key provider in the
Macintosh client management space.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:15.110
Netopia,
easy to manage client administrations,

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:20.390
remote support, admin,
absolutely fully cross-platform.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.380
Timbuk2 Pro.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.560
Timbuk2 Pro has been
around for quite a while.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.210
A lot of people have been using
Timbuk2 Pro to do remote control,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.740
observe, and so forth.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.440
File transfers, copies, one to many.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.180
Chatting, instant messaging,
and so forth.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.720
And NetOctopus for reporting,
asset management,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.720
checking on your hardware,
checking on your software,

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.880
doing remote setup,
setting system settings remotely,

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:53.120
being able to grab and install software.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.730
Data, files, folders,
packages across the network.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.800
Here's some of the stuff
within the NetOctopus admin.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.120
Gathering font information,
transferring file folders,

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.880
virus scanning, restarting, put to sleep.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.940
Doesn't apply to the users.

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.180
Oh, that Bill over in accounting.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.550
Let's just put him to sleep.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.820
For the administrators,
you can also run this peer-to-peer,

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.160
so you can do point-to-point.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.320
You don't need the
server to get in there.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.450
You can just go point-to-point and
do one machine to another machine,

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:41.400
control, manage,
and do asset management from a

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.520
point-to-point point of view.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:48.220
And you can use the internal
database within NetOctopus,

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:52.510
or you can point it out to
an external database such as

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.960
Oracle or any of the SQL stuff,
DB2.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.540
And the software delivery system,
we put one distribution server in place,

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.960
and then you can set
additional staging servers out.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.390
It is a poll-based
environment from the clients.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.320
Once the clients have been told
that there is a manifest available

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.500
or a load set available for them,
then they will go and get it based on

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.120
the schedules that are established.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.820
And you can also create
sub-administrators and limit

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.770
which tasks the sub-admins can do.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.270
So we can say, you know,
I want people to only be able

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.560
to do this small component.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.500
of all of the administration.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.790
Here's a couple more screenshots.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.500
For instance, the software package setup.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:34.890
What do I want to install?

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.570
What parts do I want to go out?

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:41.790
And then the log coming back from
the distribution center saying,

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:42.420
what happened?

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.480
What was I doing?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.940
For the end users, use Timbuk2.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.690
The idea is--

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.700
The chatting, the text messaging,
and so forth between systems,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.760
but it also has the opt-in
capability where I can say as a user,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.320
no,
I don't want to be bothered right now.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.830
Don't, you know, go away.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.360
I don't want to talk to you.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.420
Okay.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.940
and NetOctopus agent
includes a smart monitoring,

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.900
same stuff that we use on the XSERV,
okay, to be able to give you a warning

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.820
when the hard drive is going
to get weird or something,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.420
you know, when we want to react to that.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.100
A couple more screenshots.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:29.390
This is the Timbuk2 chat, sending files,
exchanging files, and screen sharing.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.990
The roadmap for NetOctopus,
some of the things they're planning

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:35.300
in the second half of 2004.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.880
They're talking about adding in patch
management for Mac and PC clients,

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.500
putting in a software license manager,
putting in a web-based UI for NetOctopus.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.380
Integrating with Rendezvous and
integrating with Active Directory.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.700
All key things to watch for.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:58.700
10 million computers worldwide.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:06.310
And once again,
Netopia will also be in the lab,

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.710
and they'll be up here as part of
the Q&A at the end of the session.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.800
Sassafras software.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.960
K2, highest mountain in the world.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.480
That depends on, you know,
where the laser bounces.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:41.000

[Transcript missing]

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.900
Cross-platform support
including thin client support,

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.120
Mac, PC, Linux.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:40.900
[Transcript missing]

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.510
Key server itself.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:39:01.460
Active control of all license types.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.010
This not only includes the generic,
you know, I want to control an app

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:02.010
that doesn't have a license,
I just own software license copies,

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:02.010
but even as granular as saying
I have Mac address-based software.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:11.800
[Transcript missing]

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:18.040
And if you have multiple licenses
out in a client and you realize

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.950
that in your reports you can go back
and I can reallocate and reclaim

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.620
licenses that don't get used.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.680
I look at a machine and found out I put
a bunch of software on there that for

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.520
the last six months they never launched.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.810
And I can go back and I can say, no,
I don't need that anymore.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.780
And I can pull the license for
those people and they can't

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.560
use that software anymore.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.940
The reports and databases, very intense.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.840
Bunch of built-in reports,
detailed audits.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.820
These are just some of the reports
that come up under the menu.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.780
Pick a few.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:58.300
The daily license report,
the hardware report,

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:03.440
what kind of logins have we seen,
what kind of usage are we seeing

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.180
from user versus application,
you know, how many licenses times how

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.530
many users are out there.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:15.480
Give me a weekly program report of what
applications have been used this week.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.470
You think about the end of
the year comes around and some

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:21.760
company sends you a bill and says,
oh, it's time to renew your $27,000

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.280
license for the software you bought,
and you go back and you find

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.980
out you used it for 11 hours.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.740
And you go, ooh, that's expensive.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.200
Right?

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:37.050
And then, you know, you do your audit,
but obviously you've got to follow up,

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.320
so you need to do software
compliance with that.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.720
Okay,
and this is actually where I told John,

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.190
I said, this is where the unintended
incremental software audit came in.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.380
This is the IRS shows up and checks you.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.550
The unattended,
because the system itself will actually

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:56.080
perform its audits in the background,
doesn't involve any admin

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.250
or user interaction.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.340
Okay, new computers and applications
that show up on the net are

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.920
automatically discovered.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.960
And you can establish automatic policies.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.070
You know, if I only want 30 copies of
this software to be used,

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:13.580
user 31 launching the software will
be stopped in their tracks being told,

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.540
no, you can't do this.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.800
The admin console, cross-platform.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.440
We can configure literally from anywhere.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.250
You cart your PowerBook around,
launch the admin console, plug in,

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.680
start making changes.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.810
Organizing things by organizational unit,
where it says separate divisions,

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.440
you think of organizational units
that you do for your management.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.350
And I can create license
records that I track for

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.070
every single different system.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:42.500
[Transcript missing]

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:02.610
For more information, once again,
the lab, noon to 3.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.300
Go grab a bag lunch?

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.120
Go there.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.740
You will definitely,
definitely benefit from the experience.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.150
I just plugged that in in
the middle of everything.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.160
Additional resources for tracking
down stuff for Sasfras software.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.040
Okay.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.860
They're up in New Hampshire.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.490
Go visit them.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.380
Nice country.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:33.060
That white paper,
you want to download that

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.570
and take a look at it.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.130
Good information there.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:47.300
[Transcript missing]

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.200
Those are the key players that
I'm going to have up here for

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.930
Q&A here in a couple minutes.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.210
I also wanted to let you
know that in the Mac space,

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.350
there are a whole lot of
other players out there that

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:58.340
are doing client management.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.650
And just as a real brief mention is
an idea of Jamf Software with Casper

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.660
for software imaging and updates.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.730
For ONNX Deep Freeze for management
and control of the systems,

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:11.360
basically locking a system
down that the user uses it,

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.580
logs in, does their thing,
and when they log out,

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:16.710
it returns it back to its known state.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.280
Autonomic with the
ANSA Patch Management solution and

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.620
Integrity Software with SoftTrack.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:28.120
There's a lot of client
management people who are very,

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:32.060
very much investing in
Macintosh and Mac OS X.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.100
It's not the, oh yeah,
those things just go in the

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.050
graphics department anymore,
you know?

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.840
Now they go into graphics department and
you can keep track of them and not feel,

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.710
you know,
like you're doing something strange or...

00:44:47.100 --> 00:45:08.300
[Transcript missing]

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.730
And here's my esteemed panel group.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.590
If you guys want to go
ahead and come on up,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:18.000
and we'll-- I promise not to
bang the microphone on the table.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.280
They told me not to do that.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.500
You guys, just line up as if the
firing squad was right here.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.240
Yeah.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.680
Put your toes on the line.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.940
There you go.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:31.780
Okay.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.080
Thumbs along the seam of your trousers.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.590
They don't know me.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.940
Okay, we won't do basic training,
but I'll have you guys go

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.040
ahead and introduce yourselves.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:44.860
What company?

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:54.000
Sound up over here.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.070
My name is Martin Bestman from Netopia,
and I am the R&D Director for

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.380
NetOctopus development.

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.460
Hi, I'm Jeanne Moraine from Marimba.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.400
I'm a senior product manager over
their client desktop management suite.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.310
Hello, my name is Steve Workman,
and I'm the Director of

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.160
Product Management for LANDesk Software.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.910
Good morning, I'm Jerome Brookhausen.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.700
I'm the development manager at
Altiri for Macintosh products.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.430
Ben Forsythe Hi, my name is Ben Forsythe.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.660
I'm the technical manager at FileWave.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.950
John Tominey Hi, I'm John Tominey.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:28.490
I'm the director of marketing
with Sassafras Software.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:29.700
Cool.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.360
So we get people lined up.

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:34.310
The microphones are on center.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.990
And we have a question
right in the middle.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.370
Aaron Krimble from Gannett.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:45.280
Does anybody support router or
switch auditing and discovery?

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.500
Or is it just machine-based?

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:58.790
In NetOctopus we have a SNMP council
and it does discovery of all devices

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:02.240
out there network that can talk SNMP.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:07.010
We also support a whole range
of special MIPS and if there's a

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:10.480
MIP that you need to be looking at,
we can compile it and

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.210
put it into the product.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.230
That's not a problem.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.800
As part of the LANDesk Management Suite,
we also have a component called

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.000
Unmanaged Device Discovery that will
discover those types of devices,

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.800
anything with an
IP address we can pick up.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:33.000
With our Asset Trustee product,
we have an SNMP scanner that will scan

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.390
the network for any SNMP talking device.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.550
Thank you.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.800
After July 15th,
we'll have a network discovery product.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.730
Remedy actually has something that
does asset discovery in those elements.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.630
Marimba handles more of the
actual systems themselves.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.000
Thank you.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:55.100
Cool.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.440
Joel Nation, St.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:47:59.750
Mariners Club Restaurants.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.120
I just want to know,
we have complex installations,

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.230
so things that aren't normal,
and I want to be able to do

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.760
them on my clients without them
actually seeing it going on.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.710
Does any of the software that
you guys produce do that?

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.280
So with FileWave,
there's no user interaction

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.170
available or needed.

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:22.490
The administrator sets up the complex
install and captures those files and

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:27.050
places them in the FileWave server
and associates them with the groups

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.360
of clients that will download those.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.740
Then the clients check with the
FileWave server for that software.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.410
They download it and
automatically install it.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:45.140
So, yeah,
the same is true for an ad octopus.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.370
You can build really complex
installation packages you want

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.450
with dependencies whatsoever.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:54.160
And you can even also specify
how much user interaction

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.440
you want on the client end.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:59.160
And clients can even defer package
installation for a later time during

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.920
the day or a couple of days later.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:05.020
And you get full reporting of what the
user chooses to do with the package.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.350
We have various modes of installation,
so you can either do silent, semi-silent,

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:13.180
or a full custom install.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.830
So it really depends on your
environment and how you want to set up.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:19.060
And then our packaging is all based on,
you can do it based on policies.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.990
You can set what users get what type of
installs on their machines and remotely

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.260
deploy it out to their systems that way.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.960
We have a lot of the same functionality
as well that you can set up in a

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.570
policy base or a push base for either
transparent client installation

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:38.180
or request client input as well.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.500
Oh, it's over here first.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.420
Sorry.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.500
Scott Lim, University of Michigan.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.220
I want to bring up a topic we
don't normally get to discuss

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.100
at conferences like this,
and that's the actual cost of licensing.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.180
I think Apple's got it right,
licensing by administrator.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.280
Licensing by the number of
computers or computer access

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.010
licenses are not the way to go.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.920
It gets prohibitively expensive.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.440
I can say no to an administrator license.

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.200
I can't say no to a new computer.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.340
I would prefer to see more
licensing based on administrators

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.070
than based on number of computers.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.570
I just want to ask you to clarify what
you mean by licensing by administrator.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.050
I'm sure that some people
understand your intention,

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:29.890
but others may not.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.040
Aside from Sassafras,
because I love you guys.

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.260
Pardon me?

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.240
Aside from Sassafras,
because I love you guys.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.960
The way ARD is licensed right now,
we license it by the

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.200
number of administrators.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.650
So I buy a copy for each administrator
that's going to use the system.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.830
Where I buy Netopia,
I license by how many computers I have,

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.660
and my computers go up exponentially.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.860
The other problem I have is when you
have those ghost computers that seem

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.950
to get in the way of true count,
I'm being licensed for that now,

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.200
and I don't even know which ones
are real and which ones aren't.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.810
So you're asking for our
products to be licensed that way?

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.040
Correct.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.600
I'll begin.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.050
I guess a lot of other people
have things to say then.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:16.130
By the way, K2 from Sassafras Software is
licensed both by individual node,

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.070
which most of you are familiar with,
many of you are.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.940
But we have a new licensing program
that we've introduced in the last year

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.600
that allows floating client licensing.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.760
And it doesn't sound exactly
the way that the name implies,

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:34.730
but it's very, very useful,
especially in higher eds

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.720
and K-12 education sites.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.100
Maybe I'd just add for FileWave,
for higher ed especially,

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:48.300
we have special licensing where
we offer low-cost licensing,

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.510
still based on the number of clients,
but it's good feedback.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.020
Low cost is relative.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.280
Excuse me?

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.920
Low cost is relative.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.490
Yeah, well...

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:03.760
That's interesting feedback.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.960
We'll take that into consideration.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.810
There are parts of our product offering
that we do license per administrator

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.820
or per console on a concurrent basis.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.900
So we are seeing the
need for some of that.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.650
And like I said,
we'll take that feedback and take that

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.860
into consideration as we look forward.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.550
One thing to note,
we do license by our endpoint clients,

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:28.420
but we also have
enterprise-wide packages.

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.730
Part of the reason why we do that is
because we have some customers that have

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.420
millions of endpoints like Music Match.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.360
So it really depends on your environment.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.320
And so the complexity that
you're asking for in the

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.740
endpoint to change the licensing,
it also goes back into the support.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.210
What does it take to support the
number of endpoints users and the

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.900
expectation for quality of service?

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.280
So you've got to put that into
the licensing mix as well.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.330
But my purchase is going
to be based on the cost,

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:51.020
not based on your cost.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.160
And you always get what you pay for,
right?

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.040
That's the key thing.

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:01.880
In certain environments,
we also do a global company-wide or

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:08.260
university-wide licensing schemes where
we do not count each individual computer,

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:11.880
but you get just a company-wide license,
and that may work for you.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.720
So you should talk to us if
you have a scenario like this.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.170
Cool.

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.620
Okay.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.450
Guys, hang on to it for a second.

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.200
Richard.

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:20.980
Richard Glaser with
the University of Utah,

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:21.820
Microsoft Labs.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.060
First, I want to make a comment.

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.870
You didn't mention the open source
tools that a lot of people are

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.660
using in enterprise deployments.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.140
So, example, Radmine.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.700
A lot of big companies are using it.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.720
So, people in the audience,
it's open source, free.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.740
You might really consider looking at
that before you pay for a solution.

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.460
You might not need to.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:47.440
Second, what type of installers
do you guys support?

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.100
Do you support package installers?

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.180
Richard Glaser:
Do you have to repackage installers

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.820
to use it with your solutions,
distribute applications?

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.240
We support a wide variety of
package installation formats.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.720
The key thing is we do have,
with a lot of the installer products

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.880
out there out there in the market today,
if you want to use various

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.890
ones that are available,
they can put a wrapper on it and

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.420
push it out through our technology.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.270
We have different agents that
are available that you can

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.510
create custom installers for
if that's what you want to do.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:20.130
We also support third-party
package installers and can provide,

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.680
once they're packaged up,
we can then do the software distribution,

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:25.950
either push or pull base,
but it's just a broad

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:28.220
third-party application support.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.000
We have a similar story at Altiriis.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.590
If you have something that's
been packaged through one of

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:42.140
the third-party solutions,
like device or Aladdin or any of them,

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.160
we'll be able to push those out.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.300
Similarly,
on the Windows side of the fence,

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.690
we have recently acquired
Wise Solutions and have

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:54.720
installer technology available
through that as well.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.200
With FileWave,
the paradigm is a little bit different,

00:54:59.200 --> 00:54:59.580
let me say.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.740
So we actually don't deliver
installers necessarily.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.590
We deliver the files that get installed.

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:08.840
So we'll support any installation,
essentially.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.740
K2 from Sassafras has several rapid
deployment technologies available

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:21.370
both on Windows and Macintosh
and our tech support people can

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.570
tell you a lot more about that.

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:32.720
NetOcupus fully supports all kind of
installers including Apple PKGs and PKGs.

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:38.070
We even teamed up with MindVision
Software and we ship a special version

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.780
of MindVision Software installer-wise
that allows you to repackage

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:45.070
software and we have a snapshot
utility also in the product.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.700
On the Windows front,
we fully support MSI installations and

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.840
all of the other installers out there.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.340
Full integration with reporting, etc.

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.170
With regards to distributing
your software to both

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.660
desktop and portable clients,
how many of you support

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.600
interrupted and then resumed
downloads through your software?

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.900
That's the checkpoint restart
component that we had talked about.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.640
And we actually, even for our own client,
we have remote deployment of the

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.900
agent out to the endpoints as well.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:21.060
So after you've discovered it
through our discovery component,

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.190
you can push it out.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.380
Yeah,
we also support resume installations when

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:32.880
mobile users move to a different spot or
get from the wire to the wireless network

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.450
that's fully automatic behind the scenes.

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:40.670
We also support installing our initial
agent throughout the network fully

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:46.260
automatically so you don't have to do a
sneaker net to install our own agents.

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.410
And with the next version,
we will also support that for

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:53.240
Mac OS X where you can get the agent out
to Mac OS X even though there's nothing

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.740
on that machine besides Mac OS X.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:02.570
Support for mobile devices is
paramount for the LANDesk product.

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:05.760
We also provide the checkpoint restart,
dynamic bandwidth throttling,

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:11.860
those type of functions to support
interrupted distribution of software.

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:17.930
At Altiriis, we also support what we're
calling Checkpoint Recovery,

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:21.820
and we also have a bandwidth
throttling mode so that if the

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.670
bandwidth isn't sufficiently high,
we'll either not send it or we'll

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:31.420
send it slowly so that we can
better manage network traffic.

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:34.900
With FileWave,
the client is not necessarily

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.060
connected to the server at any time,
so laptops can be away

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.350
for weeks or months,
and when they get an active

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.740
network connection and they
can see the FileWave server,

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.980
they'll log in and
download their software.

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.770
If for some reason that's,
I guess you guys call it the checkpoint,

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:53.970
so if for some reason that
network connection is severed,

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:57.260
the client will pick
up where it left off.

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:01.440
Key Server Key Auditor works in concert
with other software deployment tools,

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.350
so we're not deploying
software ourselves,

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.940
but rather we're deploying licenses
through a very unique approach

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:11.040
that manages not only shared use,
concurrent use licenses,

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.480
but also manages node-locked
single computer licenses.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.100
Will Jorgensen,
Pacific Northwest National Laboratories.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:24.960
So for those of us who are
considering client management

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.300
solutions that are out there,
a lot of you have very similar features,

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:32.010
central management, patch management,
asset management.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.690
And could each of you take a second
to give us the one distinguishing

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:41.730
feature or whatever you think makes
your particular product better

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.790
than others so that we can help?

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.580
John, do we have 30 seconds?

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.580
Yeah, keep it short, please.

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:52.360
I told them they could do that,
but they get 30 seconds apiece.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.440
It's the elevator pitch.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.990
So, yeah, go ahead, guys.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.400
We've got plenty of time.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:00.780
Key Server has been in the
marketplace since 1989.

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.650
We are one of the pioneers
in software asset management,

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:08.430
focused towards software license
management for many years.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:11.700
A number of years ago,
we introduced software auditing,

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:15.960
hardware auditing, and integrated those
two products into K2.

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:23.440
Our unique point of advantage is that we
manage any type of a software license,

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:27.740
not just shared use licenses,
where many products will resort to

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:32.090
auditing to figure out how to manage
single user node-like licenses.

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.610
We actually manage them
in an active process,

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:40.240
and we integrate all of that together
into a web-based management council.

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:47.040
With FileWave and Asset Trustee,
we're a Macintosh-centric solution,

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.440
let's say.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.880
So our servers are
running on the Macintosh,

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:54.790
and I think what distinguishes us is
we're a mass deployment technology

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:56.560
and a mass collection technology.

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.450
So where computers are coming
and going on and off networks,

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:06.750
FileWave can handle those situations
and be able to deploy from one location,

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:11.270
say, in the U.S., and you can deploy
to clients throughout the world.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.000
When you buy an Altiri solution,
you're buying a rich history

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.040
that started on another platform.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:28.040
But we have tremendous web
reporting and that makes it easier,

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:34.620
saves time,
and I think we have a depth in our

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:40.610
reporting capabilities that may
not be found in other solutions.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.340
I think the biggest value
proposition for LANDESK software

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.980
is our rapid time to value.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.620
What I mean by that is you can
actually take our solution and get

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:54.060
it installed and using it and getting
the payback from our feature set,

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.900
which is highly integrated,
all driven from a single console.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.240
Again,
the value proposition for an IT manager

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:05.090
is that you can manage all devices,
regardless of the platform, the same way.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.960
We're also very committed
to the Macintosh platform,

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.360
as you can see in the pie
chart that was put up earlier.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.820
We nearly have all of those
pieces filled through inventory,

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.660
software distribution, patch management,
software license monitoring,

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.720
remote control.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:25.170
We're going to continue to
innovate on the Macintosh platform

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:28.600
from that point going forward.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.120
Our key differentiator is experience
and scalability and heterogeneity.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.600
We have customers that range
from 500 to 15 million endpoints.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.130
So if you look at like music match
that you've seen on your iPods,

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.520
we've been running on those
for since their inception.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.930
Other things that when you look
at our particular products,

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.760
you think about policy orchestration.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.440
We give you the choice push versus
pull based on policies that you set

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.170
up for users or machines so you can
formulate how you do your targeting

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:56.980
and distribution from one single
console based on your company or your

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.540
business versus based on our technology.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.990
So it's flexibility, scalability,
and policy based orchestration.

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:10.720
Okay, for the Netopia products,
I can say that we are probably

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.210
the longest time on the Macintosh
platform starting in the late 80s.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:19.980
And we are fully cross-platform
with the council and the client.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.280
We are most parts using
the same source code base.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.560
So you get really all the
features on both platforms,

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.330
can manage the clients
from both platforms,

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.760
very transparent.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.720
And we are trying to design
everything for the mobile users.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.550
If you look at our software
distribution system,

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:44.710
it's really designed for
the mobility of the users.

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:50.650
Do any of your products
support post-install actions?

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.400
For example,
Apple's installer includes the

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.840
provision for both a pre-flight
and a post-flight script.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.280
I've been using the post-flight to
do things like repair permissions

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.380
after the installation is completed.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:07.370
Our application packager enables you to
do both post- and pre-install components.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.010
So if you need to do sequencing
of installations versus

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:13.390
actions after the install,
like kick off a particular application,

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.800
run an inventory scan,
report back to the system on compliance.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.790
We have that built
into the product today.

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:23.450
Yeah, we have a similar approach too,
is we can provide chaining so one

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:29.840
event can take place with preconditions
associated before that event is required.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:38.190
So we can do job chaining to accomplish
that question that you asked.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.440
Okay, Altiri's also will deliver
a dependency-based solution,

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.470
and we also have an application
that can be run after installation.

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:54.350
With FileWave, we can schedule actions
at particular times,

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:57.350
so you can schedule a
post-installation action to run

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.790
any kind of script you'd like.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:07.320
Martin keeps giving away the microphone,
so hang on to it this time.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.530
Martin Blaser:
Same is true for NetOctopus.

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:11.760
You can do whatever you want
before installation or after

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.710
installation or part of the package.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:18.750
And as I said, we bundle MindVision,
a version of MindVision installer-wise

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:24.060
where you can also build your own custom
preflight and post-flight shell scripts.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.770
And the software delivery system also
supports executing shell scripts as

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:31.950
part of the installation process.

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:35.530
Richard.

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:39.940
Can you tell me if your products support
a tripwire and what mechanisms you

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.760
use to check the file system objects?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.300
We never know where to begin here.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.090
We do not support Tripwire today.

01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:54.240
That's something that we are
actively looking at on our roadmap.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.940
So if you want to stop
by our lab afterwards,

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.500
we'd be more than happy to talk
to you about your requirements.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:01.180
How do you check your files
that something's not been

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.500
corrupted or modified compared
to what you're distributing?

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.970
Right, okay, so that's different.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
We do do what we call an MD5 checksum.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.680
We use open source descriptor
technology that we co-developed

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.450
with Microsoft back in '98.

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:17.100
In that particular piece,
what we do is we do a checksum,

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.920
an MD5 checksum on the file base
to see if anything's changed

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.500
in that digital fingerprint.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.850
If it's changed on that
digital fingerprint,

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:27.640
then you can either do an automated
repair based on a backup that's stored in

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.500
the workspace or versus something you can
go to the head point of the server to do.

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:32.500
You set that up in your
installation piece.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500
Or you can do a backup.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.550
You can do other things like do a help
desk or remote admin to the machine to

01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:41.500
fix some of those elements to see if
there's any corruption for versioning.

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:48.600
With FileWave,
we have a self-healing mechanism

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.970
that works on a checksum,
essentially, that every day or every time

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:55.470
the computer's restarted,
it checks the integrity of the

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:59.030
delivery that you've made and
any files that are not matching

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.100
the checksum are automatically
downloaded and activated again.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.280
Chris Mattia, St.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.720
Mary's College of Maryland.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.830
We have-- we've had a slight problem
over the last year with users bringing

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:21.320
their own laptops on the campus
and not having all of their updates

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.400
and virus protection up to date.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.240
What sort of enforcement policies
or procedures do you all have in

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:32.530
any of your software to ensure that
those users get either moved to a

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:37.900
DMZ or locked out until they're in
compliance with all their updates?

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.330
Well,
with FileWave we don't have something

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.940
that specifically does that.

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:47.630
The best I could offer is that when the
client does have access to the network,

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:51.700
it will automatically get into
sync with what you've configured

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.930
on the FileWave server for it to
have as the appropriate software.

01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:00.070
With the LANDesk product,
we have the capability to run a

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:04.480
vulnerability scan on the device
to determine if it's in compliance

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.700
or up to date with patches.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.510
But one of the things that we're
looking at going forward is

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:11.800
concept around IP quarantining,
to where when you first

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.960
log onto the network,
you will be checked to make sure

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.700
that you're at a level before you're
allowed onto the rest of the network.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.920
So that's plans that we
have moving forward in 2005.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.610
So there's a couple things that we do.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.790
Out of the box, we have policy compliance
component that I talked about.

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:31.920
So you can test the system
based on their policies.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.810
It'll check the manifest and say,
are they in policy?

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:35.820
If they're not in policy,
it'll force them to do an update,

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.850
uninstall,
install things they're supposed to have.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:41.380
The other thing that we have as part
of our field service resource kit is

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:45.300
something called an action reaction
engine that allows you to state specific

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.040
actions that you want the system to
take based on your company policy.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.140
So if it's quarantine,
maybe you want them to

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.360
check and be at DMC first.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.310
You can do that.

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:54.480
Or if there's other elements
that you want them to do,

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:54.480
you can do that.

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.400
Maybe they're already connected to the
LAN that you want to be able to check

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.910
in because maybe it's not a mobile user.

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:00.710
There's different things that
you can do in your system.

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:10.880
Of course,
the other option too is to make sure

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:10.910
if it doesn't have an Apple logo on it,
you take it away from them.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.860
Hey, John.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.070
Back to the MD5.

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:26.690
Do you use your own MD5 or are you
using the one that's built into OS X?

01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:30.030
We have our own,
like the MD5 checksum that we do

01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:32.440
were based off Java technologies.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.760
Whether or not it's the same
one that's built in OS X,

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.560
unfortunately I don't know that,
but you can ask.

01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:38.060
I brought one of my
engineers with me today.

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.560
Okay.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.400
So stop by our lab and he'll
be able to tell you that.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:40.800
Thanks.

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.960
Sorry.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.280
I had a question.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.880
Everybody mentioned package management.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.840
Do you guys support
uninstalling the package?

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.220
Do you support OS updates
and OS installs?

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:03.220
Yes, we have an OS migration product
that we call Migration Manager.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.980
So it'll help you migrate
your operating system.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.940
Right now, it's currently primarily
targeted towards Windows.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.780
We are planning Mac support
early next year.

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.780
The other thing that we have
as well as far as uninstalling

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.150
packages on the system,
we can do that as part

01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:18.840
of our native tool today.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.980
Can you downgrade OS?

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:22.740
So let's say you go to 10.2,
can you go back down to

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.780
10.1 if you wanted to,
let's say, for example?

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:28.560
We have rollback on the
application components.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:31.180
Unfortunately,
I don't know the answer to that question,

01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:34.320
but we can, you know, that's something,
like I said, we're planning for the Q1,

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.800
like early next year timeframe.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.230
We'll be able to give you
more information then.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:44.840
You can uninstall software if
you know what got installed.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:51.120
We do not check the PKG receipts
because it's a little bit dangerous.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.790
If you're running a MindVision
installer for installation,

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.380
yes, you can do the uninstall.

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:57.660
You can trigger that.

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.200
Regarding the software update, yes,
we do support all software upgrades.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.230
With the exception,
we cannot do right now 10.1

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:10.760
to 10.2 or 10.2 to 10.3,
but we are currently looking into

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:13.930
possibilities to do that at least
then when Tiger comes out so that

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:16.360
we can migrate from 10.3 to Tiger.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:21.580
In regards to the uninstall,
does the installer have to support that

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:24.530
or does your software support that?

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.860
The installer has to support that,
but you can also write your own.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.840
We have a small installer that
would remove the various parts.

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:38.270
One comment:
Uninstalling is a very dangerous

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:42.340
thing because you do not know what
the installer really installed.

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:45.540
There's a way with NetOccupy to
find out what got installed using

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:51.560
FileScripter to get the snapshots
before and after the installation.

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:57.760
But you don't know if another software
requires the same framework or library.

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.030
And that makes it very
dangerous doing uninstalls.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.840
You're referring primarily
to the operating system,

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.290
right?

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:04.900
Not packages?

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.580
Both.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:06.040
Okay.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.340
So for packages,
it's all based on the digital

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.360
fingerprint for the MD5 checksum.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.880
So they'll do the uninstall and
look at interdependencies between

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.040
the packages on the file system and
then remove the components that are

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:17.430
associated with that given package.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:23.140
And we have roaming user element support
coming in the later Q3 timeframe.

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.860
They'll be able to do it user-based.

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.910
So if you have multiple users
roaming users on a machine that

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:29.580
are leveraging the same package,
it'll look before it uninstalls

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:30.910
on the base system itself.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.540
Just in reference to your operating
system deployment question,

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:41.050
we have a very robust migration,
profile migration,

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:43.200
OS deployment migration
as part of LANDesk,

01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:46.220
primarily on the Windows side,
but we are looking at adding

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.400
that functionality for the
Mac platform in the near future.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.570
With FileWave,
we can install OS updates as

01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:57.670
well as application updates.

01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.960
And since we're installing the files,
they can be deactivated and new

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.190
versions can be swapped in or out.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.710
Does FileWave check for dependencies?

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:09.930
So if I want to remove one package,
but it's used by another package?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.160
No, we don't check for
dependencies explicitly.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.180
We leave that up to the administrator
to make those decisions.

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.020
Pretty powerful tools.

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.860
Can you speak to the robustness of
the granularity you have available

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.490
for different levels of admins?

01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:35.370
Yes, part of LANDesk Management Suite,
we've added a feature component

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:38.340
called User Management,
which is really role-based

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.580
administration for each of the
components inside of our product.

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.760
We also provide the ability to set
a certain scope level so you can

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.640
have certain LANDesk administrators
access to certain functions and

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.440
manage certain people or devices.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.540
The same is true for NetOctopus.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.750
You can limit the administrator's
view to just view certain data,

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:08.630
and you can also limit administrators
to only administer certain client

01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:11.620
workstations fully across platform.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.400
There are no limits.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.340
Whatever you want to do,
you can limit for your

01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:18.000
sub-administrators.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.390
For ours,
we have two roles-based administration

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.790
and delegation of roles,
and we actually bring it down to

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:30.200
the granular level in the sense
that it's do you want to target,

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.330
do you want to limit who has access to
set and what distribution deployments out

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.100
to what specific systems and machines.

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.240
We can have more granularity there.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.610
We also have a roles-based targeting for
granularity on keychain objects as well

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:45.950
if you're doing more of a server-based
type of deployment to server systems.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.540
So there's different levels of
roles-based administration and

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.190
granularity within our product set.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.860
With K2, KeyServer, and KeyAuditor,
we have unlimited number of

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:03.320
administrator accounts that can be
created by the master administrator.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.690
Each of those accounts can serve
any number of different roles.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:13.570
There is a very expanded menu that
I can show you in the session later

01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:18.120
on today between noon and three,
where you can pick and choose

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.680
whatever roles you want any one of
the administrators to have access to,

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.270
so that you can limit down to
just report viewing on up to full

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:30.060
access to the administration.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:30.720
Cool.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.830
Last question.

01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:32.240
Hi.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.590
I'm Mike Potter from
Calgary Board of Education.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:41.480
I just wanted to reiterate about
the cost of client licensing.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.270
We have about 12,000 Macs,
so most of the products

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:48.920
on a client-based license,
we can't afford your products.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:55.760
My questions were in regard to...
We do custom images that have special

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.880
permissions on files and stuff.

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:03.920
When we're doing updates and pushes,
do you have any control over

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.140
permissions of the files that
are going on to the systems?

01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:16.350
I'll speak to that client licensing
issue quickly just by adding that the

01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:22.040
floating client option available in
K2 was developed in particular for

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.610
organizations that have very large
installations of computers and possibly

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:30.870
a small group of specialized programs
that you want to distribute to them.

01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:34.180
It's a very affordable licensing option.

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.490
Since we don't do software distribution,
we'll go to the next.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.240
Ten second answers, guys.

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:40.260
Okay.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.010
So again,
we're FileWave for educational licensing.

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:48.950
We have a very good scheme
where we give you the software

01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:50.180
and you just pay for support.

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.040
So I'd suggest we could
talk about that offline.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.080
Regarding permissions,
every file that we control,

01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:01.270
we can manage their permissions,
the bits and the groups

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:03.230
on them and the owner.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.510
Just in the interest of time,
I'd love to talk more

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:10.840
about this with you.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.890
We've got our engineering
development team here from LANDesk,

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.980
and if you want to stop
by a little bit later,

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:19.020
we can go into more detail
on that dependency question.

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:22.570
Ours is through the policy-based
orchestration I talked about earlier.

01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:25.200
We do it both by machine-based
versus a user-based.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.710
So for roaming users,
if you have multiple users on a machine,

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:31.030
but they may not necessarily have
permission for a particular application.
