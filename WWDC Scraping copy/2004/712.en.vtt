WEBVTT

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.140
Well, it's a strange title.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.210
Popwire has actually
been around since 2000.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.610
We were previously owned by Ericsson,
and so we've been doing encoding

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.460
R&D for wireless networks since then.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.800
As I speak, we are being acquired by
the company called Teleka,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.960
which of course has
Ericsson as a customer.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.040
They used to be a customer
to us as well as a partner.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.290
And what Teleka does is, for instance,
their largest product is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.330
something called Obigo,
which is a software platform

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.030
that goes into their cell phones.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.040
And there's over 60 million units
that ship with that platform in it.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.040
They also do end-to-end
solutions for operators,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.440
operational maintenance systems, etc.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.580
And with the acquire of Popwire,
it means that they will strengthen

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.900
the multimedia side of our
cell phones and also move into

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.430
media and to the broadcast side,
which is a product that we do as well.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.910
So that's just a brief example.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.950
National.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.400
[Transcript missing]

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.390
So, they're running down here right now.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.590
What we'll talk about is content.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.210
What is good content?

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.340
I will talk about source content,
how you get it,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.640
what are the key issues with
getting good source content.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.270
So, I will show some tools,
I will talk about workflow,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.840
I will also talk about
some live services,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.490
which actually means live
broadcasting into wireless networks.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.470
And I will of course make
a summary out of this.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.080
So, I will go between technology side
and a bit on the market side as well.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.510
So, first of all, content.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.020
One of the major problems for operators
is to get content because it's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.840
actually not the operator's business.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.900
The operator's business
carriers is about having voice,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.290
cell phones, it's about having networks,
etc.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.020
So this is completely new to them.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600
So usually, when they ask for content,
they ask the wrong questions.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.130
And I've seen this so many times.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.400
And I assume a lot of
you are content creators.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.460
The operator comes and says,
we want to stream something.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.800
And you think, well,
I have something that's streamable.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.900
And you give it to them.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.580
But actually,
what I ask about is not really

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.450
about streamable content.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.380
They're asking about content, period.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.850
And usually, if they go,
especially to a broadcaster and ask this,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.300
they think, hmm, well,
we have something that you can stream.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.920
And they stream on the internet,
and they give them that.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.910
And of course,
they can't use that because

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.280
they have to repurpose that.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.880
So what they should ask for is,
of course, maybe the MPEG-2 files,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.380
which they have on the video servers,
which they use in their

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.870
original productions,
the things that comes out direct

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.300
from the editing stations.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.420
But usually,
it's a mismatch of what you ask

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.320
for and what you're giving them.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.150
So that is one of the key issues.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.430
And of course, this is that internet...

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.900
Content isn't adapted for wireless.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.450
No matter what people say,
it's not really adapted for it.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.500
Then, of course, productions.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.320
I've seen so many productions
being made for wireless,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.280
where they made all the
errors you can think about.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.110
You have people running around,
you have camera movements,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.380
things that if you do for internet,
you know,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.730
you shouldn't do this for internet
sign because the codex won't be able

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.520
to encode this in a very good way.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.350
And they make, you know,
shows where they stand up,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.500
they have this chroma key behind them,
and everything is moving around,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.900
and on the internet, at least,
you have maybe an image

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.630
which is like this.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.880
On a cell phone, it's like this,
and it could be 30

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.180
kilobits audio and video.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.790
So that's another thing.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.750
Productions usually isn't
made for cell phones,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.700
and when they are done for cell phones,
they still think in a large format,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.160
the people who's actually doing that.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.360
So that's one of the things that is very,
very important,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.820
is to create content that is workable,
cell phones to start with.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.220
Rights issues.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.040
Many times when they
get sports especially,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.590
they might get the rights for the images,
for the video, but they might not get the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.900
rights for the commentators.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.230
So that means that they
have to put on new speech,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.900
which means they have to go
into the process of editing.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.900
And of course, that is not something that
an operator usually has.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.900
They don't have an editorial room,
they don't have all the editors,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.900
they don't have that kind of equipment.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.810
And also today,
the other issue for them is of

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.310
course that they need to drive
business into the wireless networks,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.680
which means that they many times
have to act as a content creator,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.000
and that's what's causing the issues.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So you have two kind of operators,
carriers today.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.730
You have one who only
thinks of them as bit pipes,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.370
which takes content from someone else,
and you have the second ones which

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.250
believes that we should create content,
and that usually creates

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.320
a mess on every side.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.580
And the thing is that what they really
need to do is to make sure that you

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.420
can migrate the content creation from
the operator to the actual content

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.980
creator who knows what they're doing,
so you or those people can create

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.110
the content which is adapted
from wireless to start with.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.500
So, source content.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.870
What is good source content?

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.820
Well, of course,
it's the highest possible quality.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.330
I think most of you who's
working with QuickTime tools and

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.210
is in this kind of community,
you know this,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.370
that the more you should compress it,
the smaller frame size, whatever it is,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.590
the higher quality you should have.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.120
This is not really what an
operator carrier knows about.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.030
So usually, same thing back,
they take something from

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.460
the internet and they say,
well, we can probably adapt this.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.820
So usually, I'm saying the lower
the bitrate you have,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.590
the higher the quality you need
to have on the source content.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.400
So what is good source content?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.270
Of course it's uncompressed video,
motion JPEG, that kind of things,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.900
but also MPEG-1 and MPEG-2.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.900
And maybe we might argue
about MPEG-2 or MPEG-1,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.810
but if you think about how
much is MPEG-2 that is produced

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.000
on the broadcasting side,
that is a key format as an input,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.900
whatever it is.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.840
You should,
and you can of course use semi-compressed

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.990
formats and where you've done,
you know, SIFT sizes,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.710
but you should of course not do
a thing like you have a smaller

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.900
size than the actual output size.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.900
I've seen that as well.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.460
And many times you do errors
with you taking a movie and

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.690
you actually resizing it,
but you don't think about you need to

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.900
crop it to get it out of certain areas.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.490
So what you're actually doing is a
resize anyway when you do the cropping.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.300
So,
bad source content is of course anything

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.440
that is compressed to start with.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.380
Many times you can't live by this rule,
but the idea is of course that you

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.000
shouldn't use compressed content.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.300
And all this kind of internet
formats isn't made to be source

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.130
content for this kind of encoding
or for this kind of production.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.120
Of course if you use extremely high
bit rates it will work as well,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.280
but usually when we talk about it,
same thing, they think they can use

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.000
something from the internet.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.800
Noisy VHS captures,
I've seen that many times,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.880
well it's just going to
be this big so who cares?

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.510
Same thing again,
the lower the bit rate you have,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.000
the higher the quality of
the source you need to have.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.030
And as I said before,
smaller size and output size,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.910
and many times,
well it's produced for TV and you

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.950
just adapt it to put on a cell phone
and that's not really workable.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.580
So, let's get into the real stuff about
talking about the encoding for 3G.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.860
3G is of course third generation,
GPRS is 2.5G.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.790
In U.S.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.400
you have Edge, which is also 2.5G.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.780
Usually GPRS or Edge or something
like that is about 30 kilobits,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.320
20 kilobits,
even if the specifications allow

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.100
you for much higher bit rates.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.880
But in practice,
we talk about 30 kilobits.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.170
3G today is about 64 kilobits.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.880
In theory, it's 384,
but we're not really there yet.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.380
So, the difference is there are
certain kind of standards.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.100
You have the 3GPP standard and
you have the 3GPP2 standard.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.600
And then as comparison, we have ISMA,
which is basically what you would

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.260
use in QuickDOM when you do MPEG-4
streaming or MPEG-4 download.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.920
And as you can see,
there are many similarities

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.780
between 3GPP and 3GPP2.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.110
The H.263 codec is the
mandatory codec in both.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.970
Then you have the AMR as a speech codec,
which is mandatory in 3GPP,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.650
but in 3GPP2 is QSELP,
which is the mandatory speech codec.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.240
So, that's basically the main difference.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.520
You have AMR on the 3GPP2 side as an
optional codec if you like to use it.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.400
And then we have MPEG-4
simple visual profile level 0.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.730
And that is basically
the same as level 1,

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.680
which is what you would use
on ISMA specifications 0 or 1.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.570
The difference is from a technical
point of view is that on level 1,

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.930
you're allowed to have four objects.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.310
And in level 0,
you're only allowed to have one object.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.450
But this is more of a theoretical
problem than a practical problem

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.480
because no one really makes MPEG-4 with
several objects anyway at this point.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.890
So, you have this simple
visual profile level 0.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.160
You have AAC,
and that is also similar with ISMA,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.840
which also have MPEG-4,
but they have level 1 to 3,

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.080
and they have AAC as well.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.670
Streaming isn't defined for 3GPP2 yet,
but they are working on this as we speak.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.780
And there is a huge difference on
when you do streaming is that in 3GPP,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.030
you use LATM packetizing.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.750
In ISMA, you use generic packetizing.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.360
So many people sit down
and do basic hinting,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.380
whatever it is,
with their click-time player,

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.650
and they don't get it to work in old
phones because many phones only support

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.040
according to 3DP standardization.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.580
So that means that if you're
doing streaming for wireless,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.450
you need to be aware of this.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.070
On radio network level,
it's a bunch of differences.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.320
For us people sitting here, it's IP.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.600
And that is the crucial thing.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.980
It's IMP we're talking about.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.320
We're just talking about another
sort of carrier or bearer

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.550
of that kind of material,
if it's internet or whatever it is.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.890
But its own radio network
is very much different.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.480
So, encoding for 3G or GPS.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.200
First of all,
we're talking about low bandwidth,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.190
typically below 64 kilobits.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.780
That's what we're talking about,
and that's the total IP level.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.200
So that means usually we're
talking about media level,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.710
maybe 54, 56, if we're lucky, basically.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.880
So, same thing again.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.100
You need high quality
content to start with.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.400
You need to have good quality codecs,
of course.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.260
This is very important when
you're working on low bandwidths.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.040
You need to be able to do pre-processing,
like deinterlacing,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.400
maybe do gamma correction,
that kind of thing needs to be

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.380
done as well for cell phones.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.730
Typical thing is to reduce frame rate.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.500
And I usually get arguments saying, well,
then you get this stuttering video.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.330
But the thing is that the
screen on a cell phone is pretty

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.360
slow compared to a computer.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.210
So the best thing to do is to reduce
frame rate to get down to bit rate.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.360
And you do that by dropping frames
if that's possible in the encoder.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.990
And also using natural key frames.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.360
You don't add key frames unless
you actually need to do it.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.520
So you try to actually get
down the amount of key frames.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.350
Of course there's a risk with this
because if you lose a key frame and

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.400
it's too long until the next one,
you can't recover the video.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.270
So it always is a way of going
out how often should I have

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.510
actually a key frame or not.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:13:29.500
[Transcript missing]

00:13:30.400 --> 00:15:42.100
[Transcript missing]

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.200
For as long as there's
a new user coming in,

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.940
then they will lower it.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.470
And this is just logistics
of how the system works.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.960
So that also means that 30
seconds is a good span because

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.140
usually 30 seconds or minutes,
you usually have the bit rate,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.300
the highest bit you
have when you entered.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.660
So that's another thing to think about.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.720
And always,
speech has priority over data.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.960
And you heard in some
presentations before,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.760
it's still, I mean,
the operator is making more money

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.710
out of speech than they're making
out of video services today.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.800
So that means if you have a lot
of speech going on in that cell,

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.710
it would be prioritized.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.220
So, streaming versus download.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.150
Well, there are some some pros
and some cons about it.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.390
Of course, one thing is that memory is
limited in the cell phones,

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:35.120
so therefore streaming is good
because you're not relying on how

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.940
much memory you have in your phone.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.040
You also actually have less overhead
in RTP packets and in HTTP packets,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.930
so that means you can
actually send more media data.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.500
and the other two are
available on the U.S.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.590
and abroad.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.600
The next slide is a
little bit about the DLM.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.590
DLM is a mobile phone that you
can use to do a live streaming.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.600
It's a lightweight DRM in itself.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.110
It's not that many people that I know
of in the world who can actually

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.600
hijack a stream on a cell phone.

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.600
And if you know them,
you should give them my number

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.600
because that is extremely hard to do.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.680
And it's viewable in about, you know,
two to four seconds.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.450
That's the major problem when some of you
have tested doing streaming on wireless

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.850
networks and you can't get it to work.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.740
It's because the firewalls
is locked for RTP traffic.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.900
But if the operator
wants to have streaming,

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.840
they need to open up the firewalls and
that's what's happening more and more,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.290
especially in Europe and
Asia at this point.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.530
It's not really supported by
old phones at present streaming,

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:43.720
so also something to think about
which phones can accept streaming.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:54.240
Needs to load storage on the phone.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:54.240
This is actually for the download side,
but I think it's been popped

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:54.240
up on the wrong slide,
so let's move on.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:01.000
So, download,
the proof for it is of course

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.540
that it's supported by all phones.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.770
All phones can do a download.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:10.320
The drawbacks is of course it's very few
phones that can do progressive download.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.650
And I think most of you believe that
they can do this progressive download,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.810
but they actually can't,
so you need to download

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.920
the complete file.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.670
So, that is one drawback of it.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.080
And then, this is the right place
for argument is it needs,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.640
as I say,
large stores on the cell phones.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.110
Compared to computers,
it doesn't need anything

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.660
because it's very small files,
but cell phone thinking,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.700
it is really a large file.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.700
And, okay,
what about the quality of download files?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.200
Usually, I hear this,
that you're not constrained to bandwidth

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:50.610
limitations when you do a download
file because you're doing a download.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.370
And that is of course true,
but it's not really good

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.950
experience to wait five,
ten minutes for breaking

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.100
news in your cell phones.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.800
And it's really annoying me
even on the Internet today

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.160
that you usually have this,
you know,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.620
56K for more than download and it
takes half an hour to download.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.170
So I would argue and say, well,
that's not really the way

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.330
to use the Internet either.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.510
But in this case,
it's very important because you pay

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.750
per packet on a wireless network.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.790
Then if there are some
carriers or operators here,

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.660
they will argue and say, no, no, no, no,
we have a unity price.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.640
And that's true.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.170
Some operators do have a
unity price per content,

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.720
but some use the model of that
they're actually paying per packet.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.480
But the most important things which
usually they don't think about,

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.330
which U.S.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.600
content creators should be
extremely aware of is it's a cost

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.800
for every packet for the operator.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.630
So, if you do a download file
and it has twice the bits,

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.340
twice the size as you're
downloading towards the stream,

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:59.040
that means that you might
be able to serve two people.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.030
instead of one if you do stream.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.920
So therefore,
you should handle all downloads as

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.580
streams when we talk about encoding
and bit rates and things like that.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.640
Because the content creators that can
create files that has a good quality but

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.320
has as small files as possible is the
one that the operators want to go with.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.710
It might not be true that
they think about this,

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.140
but this is what's costing them.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.730
This is the capacity to download things.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.750
So even if they don't have
a unit price per packet,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.490
it still is a cost per packet
when they're downloading it.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.270
So, let's talk about some tools then.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.470
Of course,
this is the obvious one with QuickTime.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.120
And as I said, for small operations,
and of course some of you

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.890
probably argue with that as well,
but first of all, I mean,

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.070
what you do is that you
acquire the content.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.400
Many times you edit it, as I said,
many operators do edit this,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.880
they shorten it, they adopt it for a
different kind of cell phone,

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.420
so it's easier to have it,
so it's better viewed in the cell phones,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.090
etc.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.490
And then you encode it
and you distribute it.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.000
And then you distribute it as a
3GP or 3GPP2 file or something.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.440
And in this case, QuickTime is,
of course, a perfect tool.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.940
It's one of the few tools
on the market today,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.480
mass market,
that actually supports 3GPP2 and 3GPP.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.260
So, this is a perfect tool.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.520
But, of course, when you're growing,
when your business is growing,

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.950
you need more larger systems.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.940
And this is one of the things,
for instance, that we do at Popper,

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.080
is a product called Compression Master.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.520
So, you need several stations where you
need to have an encoding workflow,

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.090
you need to have a larger operation,
you need to be able to do pre-processing,

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:42.620
etc.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.490
So, let's switch to this machine.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.060
Okay, maybe.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.680
So, first of all,
I'm not going to get into every piece

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.130
of how you do encoding because there's
been sessions about this probably all day

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.720
long and tomorrow and there's something
about pre-processing afterwards.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.200
I'm going to talk more about the
specific things about wireless.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:16.030
So, let's start with this is a file,
Swedish artist, I think actually,

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.690
I don't know, Patricia McNeil.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.060
So, this is a file,
this is a motion JPEG file.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.550
And this is, of course,
a perfect file to make for a cell phone

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.970
because this is very good produced.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.870
It actually isn't produced for a
cell phone as you can see because

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.000
you have all the things that I said,
movements, whatever it is.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.000
But it's a rock video.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.950
And I would love to see the person
who can go back and watch it.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.190
I can go back to the producer and say,
"Can you make a video for my cell phone?"

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.980
That's not going to happen either.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.860
But at least this is as good source
content as you're able to get.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.980
So, using QuickTime is extremely simple.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.400
So, what I do right now is this,
of course, I go down to my options

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.320
and in this I choose 3GPP.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.380
And in here,
I have the 3GPP specs we talked about

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.800
before where I can choose MPEG-4,
H.263.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.960
On the audio side, I can choose AMR, AAC.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.830
If I switch this to 3GPP2,
I add it on Q-SELP.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:25.800
So this is a typical example of how this
kind of 3GPP2 and 3GPP is differing.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.030
So, and you also have,
if you move over here for instance,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.020
you can do text of course.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.240
If the telephone supports you,
you can create text tracks as well.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.030
You can do streaming,
and here is a small pointer,

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.480
ISMA support for streaming,
which means not all phones

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.470
are 100% compatible if you
do streaming with this one.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.870
But I'm pretty sure that Apple will
release LAP packetizing for 3GPP as well,

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:52.110
so.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:56.370
On the advanced features,
you have some things like on 3GPP2,

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.900
for instance,
you can do fragment and movie.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.270
I'm not going to go into that too much,
but you add on headers in the stream,

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.060
actually.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.050
So if you lose some packets
or if you lose something else,

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.260
you can recapture much, much easier.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:17.140
You also have things on the advanced side
for different kind of versions of 3GPP,

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.750
where you do have different
kind of restriction or DRM,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.260
etc.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.340
So you can do this.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.110
But let's move on to the 3GPP side.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.090
So, in this case,
my input file is a PAL file,

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.720
because I'm from Sweden and we use PAL.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:40.120
So I'm going to put in 12.5 as well,
and you do keyframes every 25 seconds.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.500
The other thing is that you only
have two sizes to choose from,

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:52.210
which is 176 times 144, which is QSIF,
and 128 times 96, which is subQSIF.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.260
Those are the sizes that you're
allowed to use in 3GPP and 3GPP2.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.210
In theory, you're allowed to use SIF,
which is 352 times 288,

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.260
but there's not really any phones
that's that large at this point.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.260
So you can use it,
but you won't be able to play it anyway.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:09.690
So in theory, you're allowed to use SIF,
which is 352 times 288,

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:10.260
but there's not really any phones
that's that large at this point.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.250
In this case, we're using QSIF.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:16.520
And let's say I'm going to
do this for a 64K bearer,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:22.410
I would go down something like
48 or 45 or something like that.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:28.780
In this case I would use AAC,
16 kilobits per second,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:34.160
and as you see QuickTime automatically
switches to allowed or

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.980
best used sample rates,
which is a really good feature.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:46.020
So now I set up my encoding, hit OK,
and do save,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.840
and hopefully this should work.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.360
So now I'm exporting a 3GP
file directly from QuickTime.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.820
But this also means that all tools
that actually work on top of QuickTime,

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.220
of course, can create 3GP files because
it's in the core of QuickTime.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.900
So this is my movie I just did.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.000
And this will actually
fit in a cell phone.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Right now it looks extremely large,
but it will actually work.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.090
So this is how easy it is to do this
kind of encoding with QuickTime.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.990
So let's move this to the trash.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.700
So, let's take a look at
the Compression Master.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.500
This is another kind of tool.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.580
You have your settings windows,
I'll go through this.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.330
You have your batch windows
where you put in your files,

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.180
your settings to
actually do the encoding.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.100
So, in this case,
I have for instance over here,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.080
I have bookmarks.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.260
I can bookmark files, whatever it is,
files, sources,

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.760
folders where I have my content.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.870
Let's start with taking
the same kind of file here.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.200
So this is my file I'm
going to encode right now.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.440
So let's start with
some of the templates.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:12.240
So I of course get into 3DPP and
PAL input because that's what I'm using.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.460
And I'm going to do an extreme one.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.030
I'm going to use this template which
is for JPRS which says three slots.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:25.590
And how it works is that
one slot is 12 kilobits.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.790
In theory,
but you usually calculate with 10.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.430
And what you can get in GPS networks
with phones today is that you

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.350
usually can get three time slots,
which means 30 kilobits.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.100
But in theory, that means probably 20 or
something when we talk media level.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.790
So this is an extreme low
bandwidth we're talking about.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.360
And this is a download file.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.000
Of course,
this is I can do more things in 3D PIP.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
I can do a bunch of other things
like MP2 or whatever it is,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.490
but that's not why I'm here.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.470
And I have my codecs,
which I'm allowed to do.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.670
And in this case, it's an AMR codec,
the speech codec,

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.540
because when you download
this low bit rate,

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:06.780
you don't really have bit
rate enough to use ASC.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:12.020
So, now I'm opening the same
file but for streaming.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.610
You see it's the same thing,
now I can switch between those two,

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.100
so it looks pretty much the same.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.980
But let's switch to this one.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.220
Same kind of thing, same kind of codecs.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.900
But now when we start looking at this,
of course you have all

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.240
this pre-processing,
you know, like deinterlacing,

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.100
all that stuff.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.210
I don't need to do this right now
because the movie I have is already

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.100
deinterlaced in motion jpeg file.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.900
But otherwise you have all kind
of pre-processing you need to do.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.850
Science as well.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:29:00.400
[Transcript missing]

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:06.790
and I'm not really
living by my rules fully.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.830
If we switch to the
streaming file right now,

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.080
we see that on the streaming
file I actually put the

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.350
bitrate to 18 kilobits.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.880
and I use on the audio
side I use 4.75 kilobits.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:27.000
So that means I have something like
23 kilobits in total and that would

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.300
probably be possible to get through
on a stream on three time slots.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.020
On the download side,
I haven't really lived by the

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.860
rules as I said before because
I actually put it in 48 kilobits and

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.050
on the audio it's the same as 4.75,
but that means that I'm setting

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.040
the level at 64 kilobits or 56
at this point to make sure that

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.110
I get a file which is not that big.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.220
The main difference here
is this buffer size,

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.130
the VBV size.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.190
On a download file I put
this to 10 seconds,

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.770
which means that the sliding
windows is 10 seconds,

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.610
which means that I can
fluctuate much more.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.130
Because it's not a stream,
it's downloading,

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.310
so you don't really have to
think about if you have peaks,

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:14.440
you more have to think about
the total size of the file.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:19.680
If I move to the stream file,
you will see it's very much constrained.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.240
It's 0.6 seconds.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.280
To get this through.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.410
And of course this is
templates which you can then,

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.810
you can of course change for yourself,
you need to fine tune this,

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.120
but these are maybe some areas
people say we are extreme,

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.100
but we are also seeing this on
wireless networks how hard it

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.500
is to get the stream through.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.300
I also have frame skip probability of
55%, which means that I'm telling the

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.100
codec that you are allowed to really
drop frames to maintain data rate.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.090
On the download side,

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.410
I have none because I don't
need to maintain the data rate.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.470
I just need to have the
overall bitrate actually.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:00.000
So I'm using natural keyframes on both.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.780
I could add in a distance if I like to.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.610
So if I'm afraid that it's content isn't
moving that much and I don't want to

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:14.400
make sure that I can recover the video,
I can put in a max distance

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.300
in the keyframes as well.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.740
But I don't need to do this.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:19.310
I do two paths on both.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:23.510
And then we come into this thing is
that different kind of MP4 profiles.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:29.500
This case it's simple profile,
same thing as you would use in ISMA,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.300
but this is the important thing,
it's level zero.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:38.480
Since when you're doing an encoder,
even if we do our own encoder,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.640
the encoder don't see the difference
between choosing level one or level zero.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.740
So that's why it's a manual
thing that you have to do.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.220
You have to press to say,
you have to write this

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.730
down as level zero.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.900
So that's the reason why.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:59.140
And then we put in all the sizes,
all the other things that we did.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.320
So let's do some encoding now.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:03.980
So now this is my source file.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.500
I can even,
I can double click or I can drag it in.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.720
So right now I'm putting in

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:10.920
Let's see.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.830
Save those.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.750
So let's do these two.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:22.620
I'm adding those and of course now
I'm encoding those and they are ending

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:28.020
up in my very Swedish name Klara,
which means ready in Swedish.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.010
It means that's where the
files are going to end.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.120
During this process of course
I can add on more files,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:39.380
so I can add on for 3D like 64 kilobits
or I can actually do on the fly,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.490
I can prioritize whatever
should be encoded.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:56.100
[Transcript missing]

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:01.570
The three time slots,
and as you can see right now,

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.760
play all movies,
you see there is a difference

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:09.640
between what's happening on the
download versus the stream file.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.810
As you see, it's very,
very highly constrained,

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:16.250
the stream file to the left side,
because I really need to

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.120
get the bandwidth through.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.060
That's the important thing.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.260
Then of course on top of this,
you can do a bunch of different kind of,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.420
you know, pre-processing,
but usually the error people do is that

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.830
they add on too much pre-processing.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.390
And I'm using all the time
QuickTime to verify if it works,

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.460
because QuickTime, as we said before,
is one of the few players out

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.990
there that can actually play 3D
people content on a Mac or PC.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:50.480
The thing is that
QuickTime is a great player.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.020
It can process.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.210
It can play pretty much whatever,
and if it looks crap,

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.400
it will make it look good.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.680
So on sort of a positive/negative way,
I'm telling you,

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.160
you must verify it in your
cell phone how it looks.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.360
Do not verify it and think, oh,
this looks great, because in QuickTime,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.030
everything will actually look great.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.270
So that is one of the key
things is that really check it.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.470
So after a while,
you've learned to see that if

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.930
it looks like this in QuickTime,
this is how it will

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.780
look in the cell phone.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.360
And then you can go back to
the Mac and try to fix it.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.400
So that's one of the key things.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.330
And then you can go back to
the Mac and try to fix it.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.240
So that's one of the key
things is that really check it.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.310
So after a while, you've learned to see
that if it looks great,

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.310
because in QuickTime,
everything will actually look great.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.180
which is for 3G then.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.540
So let's do play all movies.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:37.520
And you have the same thing here you see
on the stream thing you have it dropping

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.910
more frames than on the download.

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:45.560
But basically it's the same approach
but I'm giving some more bits on the

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.340
download side than on the streaming
side and it's all due to this that

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:54.110
trying to get the file size down is
very very important because that means

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.340
that the operator can serve more users.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:08.480
So let's move away from the demo side.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:38:04.800
[Transcript missing]

00:38:06.100 --> 00:39:58.600
[Transcript missing]

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:04.480
So, the service offering from Free,
which is the brand name for the operator,

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.090
but in this case it's the Hutchison,
it's the company,

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:12.530
which has its base in Hong Kong,
but which is visible in Italy, UK,

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:16.660
Sweden, Norway, Denmark.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.860
I don't know, Japan, but Hong Kong, etc.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:25.520
So in this case, they have six live feeds
you can get in on 24/7.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.640
You can connect to those live
feeds and see what's happening.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.160
Of course, the shower cam has been
the most popular one.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.890
But they also have, as you see,
20 to 30 news items daily.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.770
So it's like ordinary news.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.860
Five, six video news as well.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.840
Weekly diaries from participants.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.170
And they blend this in with SMS,
which is what you would call,

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:54.240
I think you would say messaging
or text messaging in your phone,

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.370
but that's SMS for me.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.690
And they bring this with
ringtones and images,

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:58.600
whatever it is.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.860
And on top of this, of course,
they have all the other

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.600
offerings like videos,
whatever it is,

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.040
from MTV and stuff like that.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.440
So the pricing for this
is sold as subscriptions.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.880
So what you do is that you buy
a Big Brother subscription.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.680
And you pay $1,000.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.610
You pay $2 for 24 hours
to be able to watch that.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.280
Or $5 for seven days, etc.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.240
And downloads to your phones were
sold separately as a unity price

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.670
if you wanted to download some very
interesting clips from what happened in

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.510
different cameras for the shower cam.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.520
But anyway.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.670
And you have 24/7 publicity.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:39.710
Every newspaper is talking about this.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.700
And this was reproduced,
it was the same kind of

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.520
concept in Italy as well.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.460
Every newspaper was writing about it.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.130
And then something happened.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.510
The booster,
which the person called Olga,

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.720
which is a woman.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.920
And what happened was
it got a thing happen.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.510
I'm not going to get into it that much.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.100
But it got all the headlines
and all the tabloids.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.220
Police were involved,
which of course in Sweden means

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.950
that everyone knows about it.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.590
They did banners about, you know,
seeing this blah, blah, blah,

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.520
whatever it is.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.360
And the police came there
and things like that.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.350
And they even used it in commercials.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:20.130
So what happens was after this.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:26.920
6% of the subscribers bought access
immediately as soon as this hit.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:44:54.000
[Transcript missing]

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.590
This kind of product will be
released on the OS X platform very,

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:57.300
very shortly.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:03.430
So we'll be able to do this end-to-end
on an OS X platform and copy pretty

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.380
much their concept if you like to.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.530
Of course, you have to find a
stupid show to broadcast,

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.700
but you can still do this
because of the QuickTime stream

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.000
service for the 3GPP compliance.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.050
So what we're releasing is the
3GPP as we say live and recorded,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.220
according to ISMA as well.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.780
It's fine wire input.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.000
And of course, we built it on the XSource
because of the reliability.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.460
Because you need to have uptime.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.740
It has to run 24/7.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.340
It has to be cost effective.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.940
That's the reason why it actually
ended up on Linux to start with.

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.250
But that's also because we're
developing on Apple machines,

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.010
even if it ends up on Linux.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.540
So for us,
it was just a matter of time before

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.020
we released it on the Apple platform.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.020
We can remote control it as well.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.570
So, the summary.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:53.980
Top 10 key success factors is, of course,
understand the operator's business.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.700
Is it unity price?

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.920
Is it price per packet?

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.980
How is the service position?

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:04.310
It's very, it might sound stupid,
but it's very important for you as

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.770
a content creator to understand that
because that can actually influence you

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.960
on how you need to create the content.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.980
It could be on a very,
very low technical level

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:13.980
that has to be designed.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.210
It could be on a very,
very low technical level

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:15.980
that has to be designed.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.790
It also is very important
that it's integrated towards

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.210
existence system legacy systems.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.980
Especially on the broadcasting
or the media science.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.980
It works with their workflow within
their production environment.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:30.980
That's another key issue.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.650
So you don't have to take your
MPEG-2 and reformat that into an

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.970
AVI file into whatever it is and blah,
blah, put it out and then do it.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.990
It has to be able to take it
directly from the video server,

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.940
push it through a system, get it out.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.850
And of course,
quick time in this is also a

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.930
key thing because it can pretty
much swallow any kind of format.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.890
So it's very, very important to have
that kind of workflow.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.940
Time to show time.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:55.930
Breaking news must be breaking news.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:58.950
If you have a setup, a system,
a way of doing this,

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.940
that breaking news takes three hours,
it's not breaking news.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.940
It has to be there in one minute.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.900
And I can tell you,
if you buy a subscription for

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:12.210
breaking news to your cell phone,
you're pretty much expected to get

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.890
it before everyone else because it's
a cell phone and I'm moving around

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:19.950
and that's the whole idea with being
mobile and getting this kind of news.

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.340
Make sure that the formats are fully
compatible with 3GPP and 3GPP2.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:28.840
I know there are proprietary formats
out there that works in cell phones,

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:35.690
but all cell phones on the market
supports at least 3GPP or 3GPP2.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.100
And the division between 3GPP and
3GPP2 is that 3GPP is basically

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.280
used in Europe and Asia and
3GPP2 on the American continent.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.970
In Japan, you have both operators
which do 3GPP2 and 3GPP,

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:53.260
but in general, 3GPP Europe, Asia,
3GPP2 in the U.S.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.720
But as you've seen,
it's not that much of a difference.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.890
But it's very,
very important to understand that all

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:04.050
phones today do support 3GPP or 3GPP2
and may be a proprietary format as well.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.300
Use high quality source.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.600
I've said this like ten times,
I'm not going to repeat it anymore.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.080
Important to understand the network
constraints because you're not

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.600
really used to this if you're doing
this for internet or whatever it is.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.580
Understand the limitations.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.600
Make sure you know what's
happening on the firewall side.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.590
Do you have X amount of gateways?

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.600
Is there any limitations
in your gateways?

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.600
And really get that
kind of understanding.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:36.400
Usually the operator might not tell you,
but if you can find out,

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.600
see how is things prioritized.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.600
Have you prioritizing scheme for
how someone gets into a cell?

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:48.470
Of course the obvious one is optimize
the compression for distribution

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:52.600
for wireless networks and for
the display in mobile phones.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.600
And always start with using as
little pre-processing as possible.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.600
Only use like D interlacing to start with
and see what's happening in the phone.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:06.080
Because it's a slow screen and many times
I see people use a lot of blur and things

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.600
like that because they also compare it,
as I said, in quick time.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.600
But watch it on the
phone before you do that.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.600
Streaming versus download.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.830
Always treat a download as a
stream when we talk about this.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.320
If you do 64 kilobits,
set it to 64 kilobits,

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.180
but you don't have to be as
constrained as dropping a

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.400
lot of frames and using very,
very low video buffer verifiers.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.090
But you should always treat
it as a download file,

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:36.000
except if your operator says, well,
go ahead, do whatever you like.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.890
But I think that that will be key of
you letting the operator know that,

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:43.280
you know, for a fact,
this will cost you more if I do this.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.400
So, that's kind of a big false.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:51.490
And, of course, be the expert,
because no matter what

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:55.740
you've heard people say here,
probably here and other places,

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.850
is that the operators' carriers,
this is a completely

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:58.760
new business to them.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.480
They are used to handling speech
and having radio networks,

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.340
and they're just barely
starting using IP networks and

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:11.180
being sort of IP bit pipes.

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.260
So, try to be the expert.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.390
Because that's what they really need,
and make sure that they do understand

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:19.210
all the complexity about production.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.830
And, of course, the most, most,
most important is test.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.920
This is new to you as well.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.720
This is new for everyone,
and it's going very,

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.570
very fast at this point,
all developments.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:34.500
So, it's really important to test out,
to see both from technical

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.750
point of view and also to see,
is this a good service?

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:38.490
Did it work out?

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.180
Is it really good to do this music video?

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.520
Maybe we should do something else,
whatever it is.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.380
So,
I think that is... that is the key thing.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.400
So, that's it.
