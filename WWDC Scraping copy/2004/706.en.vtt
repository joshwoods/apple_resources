WEBVTT

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.620
Hello, good morning everybody.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.230
I'm Glenn Bullich,
I work on the QuickTime product

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.600
marketing team.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.780
You are in 7:06,
QuickTime in the Music Industry.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.240
It's pretty clear,
I guess it's stating the obvious,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.920
that there's been quite a bit
of change in the music industry

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.720
in the last several years,
and arguably a huge amount of it has been

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.200
driven by technology and by the internet.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.210
A good deal of it bad,
a good deal of it good

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.200
for the music industry.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.530
We're here today to focus
on some of the really good

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.620
things that have been going on,
and we're very privileged to

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.200
have our two speakers today.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.700
comes to us from New York,
where he's been working

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.460
with independent labels,
delivering a huge amount of

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.200
infrastructure and marketing
for dozens and dozens of labels,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.080
and providing new media access
and exposure for lots and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.150
lots of independent bands.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.540
Our second speaker, Ken Waagner,
comes to us from an incredible history

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.200
over the last several years in new media,
and before that in the music industry,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.200
and we're really privileged to have him
give us an update on the Wilco story,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.200
which is very famous and happy to say
the number one album on iTunes right now.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.960
There's a lot of things we'll cover here,
and certainly these folks are

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.200
available later on for questions.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.200
We'll hold questions until the end,
and then they'll be floating in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
and out of the QuickTime lab,
so they're accessible.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.190
There's a number of other sessions
I just wanted to highlight very quickly.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.200
After lunch in Haight-Ashbury,
there's a session that's going

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.200
to be held in the next few days,
and we're going to be talking

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.200
about the new technology that's
coming out of the new technology.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.600
We're going to be talking about
the new technology that's coming

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.200
out of the new technology that's
coming out of the new technology.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200
After lunch in Haight-Ashbury,
there's a session 734 on H264,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
and it's a really,
really important session.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200
It's a pretty important technology that
we're going to be adding into QuickTime.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
And lastly, at 7:30 tonight,
the Design Awards,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.200
where some of the world's best
QuickTime content will be featured.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.960
It's a pretty exciting event tonight,
so don't miss that.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.200
So without further ado,
I will pass it along to Dick Huey,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.710
and we'll have him speak,
and then I'll come back

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.050
up and introduce Ken,
and then after that we

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.170
can have some questions.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.000
Thanks.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.530
Is this on?

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.780
Now it is.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.600
Great.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.720
So,
Toolshed is an online marketing company.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.170
We provide a number of services
to primarily an independent

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.930
label and artist clientele.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.940
We do online promotion.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.080
We also do a great deal
of digital licensing.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.910
On the digital licensing side,
it's licensing audio and video on behalf

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.560
of our label and artist clients to a
wide variety of digital music services,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.000
such as iTunes.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.260
On the promotion side,
it's audio and video

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.700
promotion to media websites,
America Online, Launch,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.400
Apple in some cases, Reel,
and smaller sites as well.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.810
We also do or help coordinate webcasts.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.700
We work with developers to do those.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.470
We do pre-release album streams.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.680
And sort of provide a new
media department for hire.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.400
New media being the part of a record
company that refers to the online piece.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.130
So, ToolShed was born out of the idea
that independent music is too good

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.780
to be relegated to the backseat with
respect to the overall mix of the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.800
music that's available on the net.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.470
And it was also born out of a
conviction that technology is

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.740
only good and useful within the
sphere if it's wielded correctly.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.790
Sometimes it can get in the way.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800
We try not to let that happen.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.690
I started ToolShed in 2001.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.150
This was after four years as
head of new media for the Beggars

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.800
Group and Matador Records.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.800
These are two seminal
independent record labels—hey,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.800
that works,
look at that— who are responsible for

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.800
the success of the record industry.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.060
Who are responsible for really
shaping the independent music

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.800
sphere in the 80s and the 90s.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.030
Bands like Bauhaus, Prodigy,
Badly Drawn Boy, Pavement, Cat Power.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.800
These are household names in
the independent music world.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.560
And labels such as 4AD, Beggars Banquet,
2Pure,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.390
XL Recordings are all part of this group.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.140
When I started the new
media department at Beggars,

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.360
it was under the presumption that
the promotional landscape would

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.690
be pretty much dictated to me,
and I would slot myself

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.500
into it as best as I could.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.870
Now, seven years down the road,
I take a different approach,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.600
which is that if there's
something that I don't like,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600
I go out and actively try to change it.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.230
And technology is helping me do
that and helping Toolshed do that,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.590
which is where some of you who are
developers come into the picture.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.040
The independent music industry is an
industry that's full of good intentions.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.800
It doesn't have the baggage frequently
associated with the major label,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.360
corporately dictated
new media departments.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.420
It does have way too few staff—staff
who frequently don't have expertise

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.540
in the area of online marketing.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.810
It has plenty of good ideas
and too little affordable

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.640
technology available to it.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.050
This is the niche that
I place Toolshed into.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.620
and among our clients,
besides the Vegas Group and

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.900
Matador Records,
we work with Touch & Go Records.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.710
This is the label that
brought you Urge Overkill and,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.510
more recently,
TV on the Radio and Chick Chick Chick.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.800
and the artists.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.960
Righteous Babe Records,
Ani DiFranco's label.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.620
We work with Kill Rock Stars,
most recently on the Slater-Kinney

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.140
record about a year and a half ago,
and the Decembrists,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.240
and SpinArt and a variety of others.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.760
We also work directly with artists.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.280
Kristen Hirsch, Dan Zanes,
Amy Mann are all clients of Toolshed.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:26.490
So our vision is to marry contacts
and technology with aggregated

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.060
independent music content.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.930
Let me give you some
examples of how we do that.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.960
The Toolshed brand itself we've
been able to make synonymous

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.070
with great independent music,
and that gives us access on behalf of

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.880
our independent label and artist clients.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.900
Our challenge is to take technology
and make that a great partnership.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.880
Allow these little labels who don't
have resources to do things they

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.350
wouldn't be able to do otherwise.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.760
To give them access they wouldn't
be able to have otherwise.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.040
The Internet is a great
equalizer for independent labels.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.890
Unfortunately, the mainstream methods of
distribution for media,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.730
whether they be physical
record distribution or radio,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.930
are almost completely controlled
by the major labels' access

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.420
to huge amounts of money,
among other things,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.750
and/or direct control through ownership.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:34.890
We want to take major label technology
and make it available to independents.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.900
Let me show you an example
of how we're doing this.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.960
This is off the Toolshed website.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.370
It's an example of our media toolkit.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:10:07.500
[Transcript missing]

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.820
The other thing that's exciting
about that is the ability

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.040
for us to provide reporting.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.570
Reporting is one of the areas
where we've never really,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.790
as independent labels or artists,
had very good access to what happens

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.040
with the music once it goes out there.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.730
You might know that a particular
website gets 500,000 hits a month.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.280
You might know that your particular
download was downloaded a thousand times.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.070
You might know that or you might not.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.710
But the kinds of things that we're
starting to be able to tell people

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.920
are—and I'll give you a concrete
example of this in a minute—we

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.700
can look and see everybody that's
linking to the files that we put up,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.120
many of them not people that
we've gotten in touch with.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.280
Newsgroups, for instance,
we get this all the time,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.030
people grabbing our tracks and
putting them up on newsgroups.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.640
So we Google them,
and we Google the IP and then we

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.650
include that in our report to the
record label so they can see what's

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.150
happening virally with their music.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:21.310
We're also able to—and this is the
concrete example I want to give

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.990
you—work with companies to determine
whether the kind of music we put on

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.040
a particular website was of interest.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.160
And the way we do that is by looking at
how long the average download time was.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160
So we can see what the
average download time was.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.370
If we put up a 3.6 megabyte
file—we did this recently with

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.320
one of our content providers,
Abercrombie & Fitch.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.900
The average download
time is 1.6 megabytes,

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.710
which it was in that particular case.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.630
Then most of the people who
are—or majority of the people who

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.070
are listening to this are only
downloading about 30 or 40 seconds

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.590
of the song and then clicking away.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.840
This is the kind of useful
information that helps us gauge

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.900
where we should be putting music.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.720
And we're actively working for ways
that we can increase the kind of

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.160
information that we give to people,
and we're actively looking for ideas

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.110
and working with developers who can
develop products for us that provide

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.960
us with that kind of information.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:23.030
Let me—every time I step over here,
it gets a lot louder.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.430
Ah, because of that.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.250
Got it.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.000
Okay, let's see.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.080
I want to now look
specifically at QuickTime.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:39.700
We work extensively with Apple and
with the promotion department at Apple,

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.000
of which Glenn Bullich is a key part.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.920
And I want to show you how
QuickTime is helping us level the

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.060
playing field for independents.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.060
And now I'm going to go over here.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.380
There's a QuickTime newsletter schedule
that's published online by Apple.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:02.870
We utilize that and push for
promotional album streams,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.870
which appear on

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.090
Thank you.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.460
This website.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.000
We have a place up here right now.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.630
Julian Coriel is one of ours.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:22.220
If you were to click on any one of these,
you would be taken off to the website.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.240
I'll

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:29.810
Let's see, why don't I—should I pick
the Wilco one as an example?

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.810
Is that a—

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.060
Let's see here.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.100
I'm not going to use this one.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.300
I'll use a different one.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.940
Let's see what this one is.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.810
Okay, so this one's going to Rhino.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:48.440
And obviously Rhino is able to control
the interface and what's presented.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.690
If they chose to do so,
they would be able to put links

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.240
to the iTunes Music Store on here,
so that if somebody was listening

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.680
to a full album stream on this page,
they could click through

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.490
and purchase the tracks.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.510
And you can make it as
beautiful as you want.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.110
Plus, you get all the traffic.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.620
So this is a really exciting thing
for independent labels and artists.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.480
They've been very excited to see
what we've been able to do with this.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:21.910
If you could switch back
to the other slide now.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.920
Go back to the other one,
to the slides that I was

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.860
looking at earlier?

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.840
There we go.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:34.940
Thanks.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.560
This tool could be better.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:44.390
We need a very simple way to add drawers
to this for things like QuickTime.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:52.960
If we were able to put all the
assets that are needed for that

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.400
QuickTime promotion that you saw in
one place in a separate little area,

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.470
and maybe even interface it
directly with Apple's FileMaker

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.640
Pro database that they use,
that would be a great,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:11.940
useful thing for us that would cut out
many emails and streamline the process.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:18.910
I'm trying to throw out ideas for
people and encourage you to look at

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.960
these kinds of things and see where
you might come into the picture.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.440
We don't want to be a developer.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:34.000
We support the Mac platform and we want
to utilize it with—by utilizing tools—or

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.870
we want to support it by utilizing
tools that are developed for it that we

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.010
can take to independent record labels.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.750
I'd like to show you now--

00:15:44.700 --> 00:16:01.200
[Transcript missing]

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:16.400
The audiovisual decks that used to
come in with the slide projector

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.400
on it or the film projector,
that's what it was named after.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.400
It's actually right here.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.430
AVDAC was initially just
a QuickTime radio station.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.360
It is developed now in
its third iteration,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:33.370
which I'm going to show you right now,
into a very integrated commerce

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.920
and promotional platform.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.490
I'd like to thank our
two developer partners,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.890
Liquid Rock Studio,
Michael Schaaf's here today for

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.520
coming up with this alpha build,
which you'll forgive us if it

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.040
doesn't work completely correctly,
but I think it probably will.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:57.020
And also Backbone Networks,
who handles the radio

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:03.070
piece of this puzzle.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:03.070
So here we go.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.140
You can probably turn
it down a little bit,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:15.640
maybe.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.030
Do I have to do that?

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.280
There we go.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:28.850
Okay, this is actually—this player will
actually interface with a database

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:34.850
that the Beggars Group maintains,
which contains all of its metadata.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:40.060
Everything from the actual song files
themselves for every piece of music

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.790
that the Beggars Group has ever put out.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:48.910
To all the associated
metadata—the song names,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.130
The first thing we're going to
do is we're going to use the

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.160
Backbone Network software to
create playlists on the fly,

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.320
which we're really excited about.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.440
The idea behind this was,
if you're listening to

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.950
something and you like it,
why not be able to buy it?

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.700
We'll click on the playlist button,
we get this.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.640
Which populates with
the existing playlist.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.930
And from here,
we can do a number of things.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:34.020
If we select something,
we could—actually, let's pick this.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.970
Let's try the preview button.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.940
Is the preview button connected?

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.900
It is.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:45.940
Okay.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:45.940
All right.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:45.940
Let's double-click, maybe.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.300
or maybe not.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.940
Let's try this one instead.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.940
Some of this is hooked up and some isn't.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.970
There we go.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.200
Okay, and there we go.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.850
For that particular release,
right through to the iTunes Music Store.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.300
We're really, really excited about this.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.290
The other thing that you'll
be able to do from here is

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:25.110
you'll be able to buy the CD,
and this will integrate on

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.590
the back end with the Beggar's
Group mail order system.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.540
And many of these tracks will have video.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.420
And clicking on this
pops up our video player.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:47.970
This isn't our video,
but it was a video that we had access to.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.160
And we've tried to
incorporate some nice touches,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:57.910
like in terms of letting the stream fade
out when the radio is playing and you

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.270
switch over to video and vice versa.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.800
So that's what we have for AVDEC.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.780
We're really excited about it.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.860
It's going to launch, we hope,
in a couple weeks.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:13.130
And the future iteration of this,
we hope, will include streaming

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.560
subscription-based video,
where we'd be able to

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.910
develop content for this,
give access to the artist in ways that

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:26.560
we haven't really contemplated yet,
and charge a monthly subscription fee.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.280
So we'd have free content,
and then we'd have pay-for-play

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.130
content that would give
increased access of some kind.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.340
That actually just about
wraps it up for me.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.530
The two areas that I just wanted
to talk real briefly about are

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:49.330
what I would consider to be
opportunities and maybe challenges.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:59.260
Thank you, Glenn.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.400
I think there's a couple of
things I'd like to add to

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:00.400
developers in the audience.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:00.400
The first one is,
I guess I'd loosely title it DRM versus

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:00.400
cross-platform compatibility.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:00.400
There's

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:06.340
I'm sure everybody's aware there
are a wide variety of format wars

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.400
that are on at the moment between,
for instance, Windows Media and AAC.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.070
This creates problems and opportunities.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:20.900
Windows Media 7.3 supported
WMA with DRM version 1.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.760
Windows Media 9 doesn't.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.040
This is a problem for somebody
on the promotional side of

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.710
things because anytime a client
wants a secure download that,

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.990
for instance,
collects emails as part of the

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.640
license procurement process,
we have to use Windows Media,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.300
which cuts out our Mac users.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.900
I'm throwing that out there to
the powers that be that that's a

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.760
problem for us that I would certainly
love to see addressed by whoever

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.270
feels capable of addressing it.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.950
And on the iTunes end,
we're keen to get the ability to

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:05.610
determine what music we've submitted
to iTunes and what stage it is in

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.310
terms of placement into the cart.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:17.290
I think any record label I've talked
to is interested in that kind of thing.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.880
There are probably a hundred other
areas that we're interested in,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.110
but I think the most important
thing is that we're interested

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.300
in the music that we're playing.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.300
Yeah.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.970
And I think that's the kind
of thing that I would love to

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.190
talk to you individually about,
and I will.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.300
I'll be around afterwards.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.260
I'm going to turn it
over now to Ken Waagner.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.170
And thanks very much for your time.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.300
I appreciate it.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.200
Thanks, Dick.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.500
So, you know,
it seems like there's a good start here.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.540
You know,
there's a whole sort of big leveling

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.130
effect happening for independent artists,
and we're seeing not only companies

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.720
like Toolshed and others provide new
media marketing for independent labels,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.000
plenty of websites that are available
out there that are genre-specific,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.560
so it's not all about Clear Channel and
radio and MTV anymore.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.470
So there's a lot of opportunities,
and we're seeing that sort of

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.180
really start to blossom and grow.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.390
With that, there's sort of a whole bunch
of new challenges and things

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.500
that we need to address,
and clearly the sort of movement by

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.410
lots and lots of companies towards
standards and choice and differentiation

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.150
in a competitive marketplace based
on standards allows a lot of folks to,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.550
you know,
use different tools and choose tools

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.650
that are based on these standards and
apply them interoperably out there.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:30.060
If you're interested in internet
radio and specifically the product

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.770
Backbone Networks has created,
and it is tremendous.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.240
It's a complete internet radio set
up in a box with all the reporting

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.120
that's necessary for really
generating a complete and robust

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.460
internet radio in a box solution.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.320
That session is 725.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.060
It's 2 o'clock on
Friday in Haight-Ashbury.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.870
So our next speaker, Ken Waagner,
I've known for quite a while, and,

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.310
you know,
as far as success stories go and probably

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:02.780
some of the most interesting anecdotes
and performance on what's happened,

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.220
I'm sure you've heard of
the beginning of the sort of

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.900
peer-to-peer decline of major labels,
the effect that had on the

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.770
non-A-list bands or whatever,
and some of the initiative and some of

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.960
the tools that bands like Wilco through
Ken Waagner have taken have kind of

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.040
dispelled a lot of the myths about,
you know, what the web can or doesn't

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.380
do for bands and how it works.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.760
So I won't steal any of Ken's thunder.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.280
I'll introduce him, and here you go.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.940
Okay, my name is Ken Waagner.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.690
I have a company called
Smartly Done Solutions,

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.530
and I started Smartly Done in
1999 as I was putting my

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.950
record company out of business,
and then have set out to try to

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.050
put every other record company
out of business in the process.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:06.080
I'm just kind of kidding, but... Anyhow,
I had an independent label from 1994

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.350
to 1999 called Hit It Recordings.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:17.550
Put out 25 records with varying success,
and through the whole process,

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:21.360
tried to take advantage of
as much Internet opportunity

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.610
as there was out there,
because coming from an independent label

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.550
background—I've been in the independent
record business my entire life,

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.380
about 20 years—I was always faced
with the idea that I was going to be

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:32.380
able to do something that was going
to be a little bit different than

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:32.380
what I was going to be able to do.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:38.720
wall of available opportunity because
of the limits of just resources,

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.560
really.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.310
Trying to get on the radio,
trying to get on TV,

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.800
trying to get in the press,
everything like that.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.890
And I just really saw the Internet as
an opportunity to reach an audience,

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.950
and especially a direct audience.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.520
If somebody was interested
in my band or in my label,

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.990
they could come directly to me and
I could give them the content instead

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.390
of spending all my money and all my
resources trying to get it out there

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:02.660
and hoping that someone would hear it,
hoping someone would not resell

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.800
it in a record store or whatever.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.460
And so with what I really started Smartly
Done To Do was to really help bands

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.200
and help independent record companies
and independent businesses reach their

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.050
audience more effectively via the web.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.940
And one of my first clients ironically
ended up being this band Wilco,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.130
which I'm not sure if all
of you are familiar with,

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.570
but they're a band from
Chicago who had at the time,

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:32.750
for three records out on
Reprise Records and grew out

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.200
of the band Uncle Tupelo.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.800
And around the time that
I started working with them,

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:44.190
they had their third record out on
Reprise and had just delivered a

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:49.570
live record to Warner Brothers that
Warner Brothers had said that they

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.580
didn't think it was the right time
for the band to release a live record.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.900
So I started working with the
band to try to help them find a

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.480
way to put the record out online.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.280
This was back in the boom of '99, 2000,
so there were great

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.580
opportunities out there,
but then as the

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.730
AOL/Time Warner merger happened,
moratorium got put on anything,

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:13.810
so we ended up having to
shelve the live record.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:13.810
And then,
I think it was in the early '90s,

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:13.810
I think it was in

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.080
Right after that all kind of went down,
we started to shift focus to

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:24.130
setting up the band's new record,
which was this album called

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.740
Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:31.120
And I'll kind of go through the
story and talk to you about the

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.350
process of that record and then
leading up to the new record,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.600
which just came out last Tuesday.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:32:03.000
[Transcript missing]

00:32:03.100 --> 00:36:21.400
[Transcript missing]

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.460
So if you can go to computer three here.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.350
First thing is we're
prominently featured,

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.780
and I would chalk our success
in the iTunes Music Store,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.700
as Glenn said, we're the number one
record in iTunes right now.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.340
The record's been out for a week.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:44.410
And again, as Dick was saying,
being featured on the...

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:56.290
Being featured on the QuickTime site
has proven to be of massive

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.720
promotional value to us,
both in the QuickTime newsletter

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.100
that goes out every other week
on Fridays and on the site.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.930
It just drives massive
traffic to our site,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:12.670
has crashed our server a couple times,
and it again goes directly

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.930
to the destination.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:23.840
What we did here is, again,
we ended up with the dilemma,

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.840
but we figured it was going to happen.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.920
It was inevitable.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.340
The record leaked onto the network,
onto P2P.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.240
In the end of March, beginning of April,
the record was originally

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.380
slated to come out in June.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.900
We had already built,
based on the success of the first record,

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.620
we had already planned on doing
the preview of the second record,

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.860
but as soon as it leaked on P2P,
our grandiose plan of building a player

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.240
got bum-rushed into three days of work,
which I couldn't have done again without

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.100
the help of Michael Schaff over there.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.970
So this is just a—that's not it.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.970
That's later.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:16.060
This is a full album preview,
which is launching multiple times

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.400
because I keep clicking on stuff.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.010
Oh, no, it's not waiting here.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.990
It's slightly easier if you
look down at the screen.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.120
So this is—we did three rates on this.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:35.880
We did a 56, a 100 kilobit,
and a 300 kilobit stream to give

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.030
people the full stereo experience.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.130
And again,
we allowed people to kind of track

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.700
through the record song by song
and really preview the record

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.300
and satisfy their curiosity.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.570
I personally don't believe that
there's anything to fear about

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.180
letting people hear your music online.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.200
And I think that I've been befuddled by
the record company's approach for the

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.360
last ten years that they've fought this
opportunity when they spend millions of

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.510
dollars on radio promotion and hundreds
of thousands of dollars on videos to

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.520
try to get their music heard by people,
and then they have this golden

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.340
opportunity to put their music in front
of people and they constantly fight it.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.620
And you have this thing where you've
got this new media department at one

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:21.030
end of the hall spending thousands of
dollars trying to get the records played,

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.960
and you've got the lawyers at the other
end of the hall spending millions of

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.140
dollars to stop people from hearing them,
and it just seems to not be

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.850
a really good business model.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:33.520
I think I could probably answer
why they're having some problems,

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.550
but anyhow.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.840
So this is the skin player
that we did for the record,

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:41.750
and it's been up since April,
beginning of April,

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.250
leading up to the record
coming out last week.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.230
I don't have all the numbers
on the record right now,

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.110
but they're estimating that we're
going to do somewhere between 80 and

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.170
90 thousand copies first week out,
and definitely going to debut

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.880
top ten with the record.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.800
I'd say thank you,
but it had nothing to do with me.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.800
But I'll thank you on behalf of the band.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.780
So that's the player.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.350
From the site,
we kind of do the same thing,

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.800
where we just really make
it available to people.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:17.140
Again, I grew up in an era where my whole
awareness of bands came from finding

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.360
out about bands and reading the papers
and reading magazines and finding out

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.240
about bands and going to the record
store and dropping $20 or $30 on every

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.800
import record and just really doing it.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.290
Again, just from the opportunity out
here where it's like you've got

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.520
somebody's curiosity and they come,
I think the thing that makes the

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.800
most sense is to make it as easy as
possible for them to hear your music.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.800
And I really have found QuickTime to
just really deliver on that.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.780
So that's, again,
why we use it and why I think

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.800
we've had so much success.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.930
So some of the things that
we did with the Wilco site,

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:57.890
as I was talking about the movie before,
Um...

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:04.120
There was this movie,
we included the trailer in the enhanced

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:10.220
CD content for the first Wilco,
for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.860
but as we were finishing
the enhanced content,

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:17.180
excuse me, the trailer wasn't
ready for the movie yet.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.800
So we did include some content.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.100
We had a four or five minute clip
of the band playing a song live

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.860
that we included on the CD itself,
but then we brought people off the

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.450
site to the trailer for the film.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.400
And this way we were kind of
able to like update the content

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.000
and maintain the content.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.680
I had grander ambitions,
but I also had three days to develop

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.820
the enhanced content for the CD,
so I didn't really make everything

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.900
that I wanted to happen on this record.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.550
But again, just the ability,
the ease of... of embedding

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:51.660
the video in the website and
everything just was a no-brainer.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:56.200
And so it was very easy
to do and very effective.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.660
The movie ended up doing really well,
both on DVD and in the theaters,

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:06.190
and was quite successful.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.840
Now,
the other thing that I was talking about

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:18.010
having done with these guys is that
we've been doing a lot of live webcasts.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.750
Originally,
when I first started doing them,

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:27.670
we were just doing a really basic
embedding the player in a page,

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:31.400
promoting it off the site,
and just trying to get people to come.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.280
And we did a couple of them really
just to kind of test the waters.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.140
I think we may have been one of
the—probably the first band to really do

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.880
a webcast using Broadcaster and stuff,
Glenn, I think, yeah.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.050
So we just really jumped on it first.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:49.720
Again, I worked with this company,
and we had done 1,500 live

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:53.020
shows and live DJ sets,
all available online.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.750
And a lot of them we had
done as live content,

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.000
and I was really enamored
with that whole process.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.640
And once I saw QuickTime Broadcaster,
I was just like, I'm in.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.330
So since then, we've worked—since,
I guess, the first one we did

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.820
was September of 2002,
and we've just kind of continued

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.620
to refine that process.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.600
And after we had done
a couple of Wilco ones,

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:19.330
Wilco went on tour with REM last fall,
and we kind of pitched REM about

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.200
doing some webcasts from their tour.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:27.260
And they were into the idea,
and we ended up getting to work with

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:33.550
Warner Brothers and working with REM to
do this player for REM's last tour.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.690
And what we did is we kind of
pitched them on really building

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.870
it as a promotional device.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.550
They had this Greatest
Hits record coming.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:47.490
And they had this Greatest Hits tour that
they were doing where they were—the band

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:53.040
don't really go out and play their—I'm
going to just pause it for a second.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.900
The band don't really go out and
play their hits all the time,

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.290
and they've got this vast
library of hits that they've

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.020
built over their 20-year career.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.250
And as they were going to
go out and do this tour,

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.090
we kind of pitched them on the
idea of doing a player that was

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.960
basically—the Ref movie is only 144K.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.500
Or is it smaller, Michael?

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.480
I saw you shake your head.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:21.830
So the concept being that this is a
completely viral item that was able to

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:28.800
be provided to radio stations and to
be popped off the Warner Brothers site,

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.080
popped off the REM site.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.740
And all of the content we were
able to update dynamically.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.820
And it's essentially
an emailable website,

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.770
really, if you look at it.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:43.150
What they wanted to do was they wanted
to— not only promote themselves,

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.520
but they wanted to promote the
other bands that were on the tour.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.990
Over the four legs of the tour,
they took four different bands.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.420
And what we did is we built in
bio information for each of the

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.300
bands that were on the tour.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.730
And then in addition,
we built this little jukebox.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.320
Which is going to show 404
because we killed the content,

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:11.090
but what this was was just a sampler
of all the bands on the tour,

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:12.000
and again, this was up.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.320
The plan when we
originally did the pitch,

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.410
again, was 90 days out,
and we got a green light eight

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.000
days before the first show.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.760
But the plan was to offer fans an
opportunity to hear not only R.E.M.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.150
and some of the songs from the
forthcoming Greatest Hits album,

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.990
but to also show people the
other bands that are on the tour.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.740
I believe the dates,

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.410
Yeah, this was the whole tour here.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:41.120
And again, we pitched them originally,
we were going to build ticketing

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.140
and everything into it,
but just due to development time,

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.000
we didn't have the opportunity.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.750
But again, you kind of see how the whole
thing is really a website,

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.360
basically, that was able to kind
of be put out there.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:54.500
Then what we did was,
this was the first time that we,

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.990
having worked with streaming
video and webcasting video,

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:01.360
despite the fact that I had
a TS3 in Missoula and I could

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.380
have done full-frame video,
I didn't have source content.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.480
So on the previous tour,
REM had carried a three-camera

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.150
crew and were doing video on
Jumbotrons and everything like that,

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.000
so the original pitch
was to do video content.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.900
But since there was no video content,
we came up with the idea of doing

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.120
live images and shooting photos.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.310
During the show,
to kind of give people a visual

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.960
experience with no video.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:30.250
And Michael helped us build this player,
which when we first told the

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.670
QuickTime guys that we wanted to do it,
they were like, "You want a what?" But we

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:39.310
ultimately ended up pulling it off,
and I might ask Michael to step up here

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.080
for a second and tell me how we did it,
since I have no idea.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:47.760
But anyhow,
what we did is the live element.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:53.900
The full two-hour show streamed live.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.160
We did two shows from the tour.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:00.300
We did Missoula, Montana,
and we did Toronto, Canada.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:04.810
It's the full recording,
and the band gave us unlimited access.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.930
Normally,
when you're shooting a big band,

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:12.600
they'll limit you to shooting three songs
because after that they get all sweaty

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.840
and they don't want anyone to see them.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.210
But they gave us unlimited access.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:20.760
We were able to go anywhere on the stage,
and we shot the entire time.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.000
We were dumping the picture.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.900
We basically had three
power books set up.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.700
We had one power book on stage
at the monitor position and two

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.970
power books at front of house,
one doing audio and one doing images.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.580
And we did—what we were doing was
shooting the images digitally,

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.050
dumping them into iPhoto,
selecting them really quick,

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.100
batching them,
and then I was putting them

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.480
from the stage back to my
partner at front of house,

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.280
who was in turn putting them onto
the server and updating the script.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.940
All the images are all
served from an XML file,

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:57.180
so we're able to update the script
on the fly and add new photos.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.220
So as you're watching the show
occur and as the time's elapsing,

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.500
the photos are constantly fresh
and kind of keep you in the loop.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.660
We have the ability to
control the transitions,

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.780
how long the photos display,
how long the transitions take,

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.460
and all the transition, you know,
if it's a wipe or a fade

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.180
or anything like that.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.920
So this worked pretty well.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.540
And then what we did is we did
the live event and then in turn

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.950
just turned it around right away,
edited the photos,

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.660
and put the live stream up on demand.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.430
And the band used it, Warner's used it,
to really kind of like let people

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:36.560
hear the band and let people
like see what the tour was like.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.520
So that's the REM player.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.280
From there, we

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:51.640
We crossed over with the Wilco tour—well,
actually, not even with the tour,

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.830
but with this new record, again,
due to development time,

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.440
which always seems to
be the trouble here.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.640
And it's like I always put these
things out there so far in advance.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.350
I put this pitch out there in
February and basically got the

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:08.030
green light on June 7th for a record
that was coming out June 22nd.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.580
So we had 15 days to really kind
of pull the whole thing together.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.280
And I came up with the
brilliant idea that—well,

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.920
the band changed members.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.600
The band added two new members
right before the—right as they

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.740
finished recording this record.

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.940
And what we really wanted to do was
to kind of satisfy people's curiosity

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:33.050
that the new lineup was going to be
up to snuff and let people hear it.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.090
And then also, again,
because of the record

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.040
that had been on P2P,
we were looking for a way to add value.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:42.540
And so what we did is we
allowed ourselves the ability

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.480
to update the content.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:50.210
So on the actual disc itself is only a
ref movie that comes to the server and

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.840
gets whatever content that we give them.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.230
So by doing that,
we were able to record the band's show in

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:04.060
their hometown Chicago on June 12th and
have the archive of the show and photos

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:08.680
all built into a player and available
to anyone that bought the record.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.230
So in essence,
buying the new studio album,

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.560
you basically get a free live
record that goes with it.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.770
And as the band are just
in the process—they're in

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:20.620
Europe right now touring.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.780
They'll be back in the States touring
all for the next year or so,

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.100
starting in the fall.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.390
And what we really wanted to do was
kind of satisfy people's curiosity.

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:34.910
So we built this player that—

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.540
Well, here we go.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.340
This is sort of an image of the disc.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:44.140
This is the front end that
you get from the disc,

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.120
and it just tells you
that you need QuickTime,

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.640
and then it tells you to click
through to get the content.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.020
Once you click through,
we built in this really nifty little

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.970
thing that kind of comes back and
looks to verify that the person's

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.920
got the CD in their computer,
and then gives them the enhanced content.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.810
If they move the movie off of
the disc and they try to do it,

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.300
it will look back.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.440
It won't see the file on the disc,
and it won't give them

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.340
the enhanced content.

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.160
It will basically lock them out.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.480
Now, we did have one minor problem,
which is a good one to watch out for,

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.000
but the plant actually took
the liberties of adding a space

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.920
to the end of our directory.

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.690
So, on Tuesday morning
after the midnight sale,

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:27.210
the record went on sale,
and I woke up to 71

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:30.570
emails from people saying,
"Your content says that I need to have

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:32.910
the CD in my computer." And I said,
"Well, I don't have the CD in my drive,

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.390
and the CD's in my drive,
and it's telling me I don't

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:38.560
have the CD." And so,
the other thing was that neither

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.100
Michael or I had received a copy
of the actual CD for testing due

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.920
to our limited development time.

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:51.910
But within an hour or so,
we were able to figure out,

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.920
Michael was able to figure out the
issue was that they added the space,

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.870
and we were again able to fix the content
on the server side and solve the issue.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.920
So, that's the first thing.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.520
Now, from there,
the person clicks through,

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.190
and they're given this player here.

00:52:08.700 --> 00:54:28.400
[Transcript missing]

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.960
If I can remember the URL of it,
but I think this is it.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.580
Yeah.

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:49.260
So this was a destination
page from the player.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:51.590
And what we did,
because we didn't have any sort of

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:55.030
like sophisticated check back system,
we did something really simple,

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:57.630
which was we asked people
to enter a five-digit code,

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:00.680
and the five-digit code was the
barcode number off the back of the CD.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.170
And if you had that code,
then it allowed you access

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:05.560
to the download of the song.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.680
You could get the player
and hear the stream,

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.250
but you couldn't get to the
download section without,

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.960
in theory, entering the thing.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.360
One of the really neat things about
Wilco is just that they've been

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.920
very generous with their content.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.590
They just see this as
a great opportunity,

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:25.840
and they've been really amazing
about just giving it to the fans.

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.610
They spend a good amount of money
giving content to their fans,

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.920
and we've really seen the returns.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.210
And I think that's one of
the things that we've done.

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:35.600
We've done a lot of things on it.

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:38.910
Prior to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot coming out,
the highest the band had ever been in

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:40.720
the Billboard charts was number 70.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:43.420
The most records the band
had sold was 220,000.

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:47.000
Yankee Hotel Foxtrot's at
470,000 copies sold right now.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.130
And this record, like I said,
has done somewhere around 80,000 or

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:53.770
90,000 copies in its first week out.

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:55.790
So what we did here
was we did the free EP,

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.700
three covers.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.360
You could download the cover.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.400
We did PDFs of the cover so
fans could print them out.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.870
And basically make their own bonus CD,
and we just gave it to people in

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.420
exchange for buying the record.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.110
And that's really the kind of
stuff we've done to try to,

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:15.990
again, use QuickTime as much as we can,
because, again, I just really love it.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:20.370
And we've had a really great working
relationship with Glenn and the team

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:24.380
support from me calling him on three
days' notice and telling him I'm

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:28.280
going to be doing a webcast from
the moon to just me getting killed

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.940
bandwidth-wise and them helping out.

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.540
It's just been a great
working relationship,

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.250
and I think that pretty much covers it.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.300
So I'll be happy to
answer your questions.

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:42.030
I'll be around all week,
so if anybody wants to talk.
