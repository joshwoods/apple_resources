WEBVTT

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.360
Thank you for coming to our session.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.600
My name is John Montbriand.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.160
I work in
Apple Developer Technical Support.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.430
Part of what I do is I take care of the
sample code collections and the technical

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.200
note and technical Q&A collections.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.070
And of course, doing that,
I have plenty of opportunity

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.080
to work with web servers and
prototyping stuff on the web.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.830
And that's what I'm here
to talk to you about today.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.330
So first of all,
let's set the context for what

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.270
we're talking about here today.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.610
We're talking about building
your website on Mac OS X.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.850
So what does that mean?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.380
A website has many components,
and you look at your website

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.750
through web browsers.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.540
So we're going to talk in this
talk about all the different

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.300
components of a website.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.330
And... Sorry.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.890
We're going to talk about all
the parts that make up a website,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.960
which include server software,
scripting languages, HTTP software,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.370
and databases.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.740
Now, when you're developing a website,
what are the things that you do?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.860
The first thing that you do is,
of course, you upload it to a server,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.200
and then you look at the
website with your browser.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.590
Now, that whole activity,
there's only one thing that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.850
takes a lot of time there,
and that's the network.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.630
Because you have to make
your pages on your machine,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.160
upload them to a server,
and then view them with your browser.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.610
So the feedback loop
you have going on there,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.300
it's really slow,
and it can take a lot of time to develop

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.870
the website that you're working on.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.430
So what I'm going to talk to you
about today is putting this all

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.130
onto one computer and getting
your computer configured so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.500
you can preview your website,
and you can edit your website.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.460
So you have a really close feedback loop
when you're working on your website.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.260
And going through that,
we're going to talk about

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.020
the server software,
setting up that to bend HTTP pages.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.840
Of course, on your machine,
you have Apache built in,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.840
and I'm going to show you how to
configure that to do things like

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.020
PHP and server-side includes,
and it's very easy to do.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.170
The next thing I'm going to
talk about is database software,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.590
where you can get that,
how you can download it and install it.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.380
There's some really easy-to-install
packages available on the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.680
Internet that you can use.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.630
And we'll be showing you where to
get those and how to install them.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500
The next thing we're going to
talk about is scripting languages.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.080
There's a whole bunch of
really good scripting languages

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.170
installed on Mac OS X.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.200
You can extend those languages,
you can add packages,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.020
and you can install extra ones as well,
and we'll be showing

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.200
you where to get those.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.880
Then I have two special guests coming
in to talk to you about server-side

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.200
Java and how you can install that on your
machine and do your prototyping locally.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.490
Now, of course,
I should point out that none of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.200
this requires Mac OS X server.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.200
You can do all of this with your client.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200
You can do all of this with
your client version of Mac OS X.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.280
All the things that
I'm showing here today,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.630
you can do these on Panther, Jaguar,
and I think all the way back to 10.0,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.810
as far as I know.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.120
So let's start talking
about HTTP server software.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.510
We have Apache installed on Mac OS X,
and of course, on Mac OS X server,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.450
it's also installed.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.540
It's installed with a few more
options already set up for you,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.410
and of course,
there's some really nice configuration

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.440
software available on X server.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.620
But we're not talking about that today.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.560
We're just talking about the client
version and how you can turn that on.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.410
Now, basically,
if you want to turn on Apache,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.930
all you do is you go into the server
settings or the sharing settings,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.040
and you turn it on using a checkbox.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.960
And for those of you who are
more savvy on the command line,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.830
you can use that to turn it on
and off using the Apache control

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.870
statement shown there.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.960
Now, I'm going to show today how to
set up three different websites.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.720
The first two are going to be
in your sites folder inside

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.840
of your home directory.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.710
And the first site I'm going to show,
I'm going to show how to set this up.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.240
This is the basic kind of
layout of how we access these.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.560
We're going to show how to access
websites through your local

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.100
host address and then through
URLs with the tilde username.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.840
And then I'm going to call one folder
site one and one folder site two.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.740
And we access all this through the
user configure or through the local

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.520
host URL with the tilde username.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.140
So the first thing we need to keep
in mind is all the configuration

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.070
globally on your system is stored
in the HTTP configuration file.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.410
And I'm going to show you how
to set that up to turn on PHP.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.470
But we don't actually have to
do anything to that file beyond

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.250
turning on different options.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.590
You can turn on PHP.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.980
You can turn on Mod Perl if you want.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.100
And those things are all there.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.180
And you just need to turn them on.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.050
So I'll show you how to do that.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.100
Now, for each one of the
sites we're going to do,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.450
there's different URLs that
you access those through.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.790
There's going to be
tilde username site one,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.280
tilde username site two.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.960
And these are all referring
to folders that are installed

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.860
in your user sites folder.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.250
Now the configuration for those
specific folders are stored inside of...

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.660
This is a normal thing to do
if you've developed on any web

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.880
servers and you want to prototype.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.560
You'd use the htaccess files and
you just place those on your servers

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.980
with your various options like
turning on server-side includes,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.240
for example,
or turning on PHP inside of plain

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.780
HTML files instead of requiring people
to type PHP at the end of their URLs,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.490
which some people might not
be very comfortable with.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.360
So the first thing we're going to go,
this is how you turn on Apache and

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.680
how you set it up so it will actually
look at HT access files in your...

00:05:33.100 --> 00:06:16.100
[Transcript missing]

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.870
Now for site one,
I'm going to show how to turn on

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.380
server-side includes for HTML files.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.360
What those are is basically,
they're a special kind of HTML comment,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.290
and you put some contents in there,
and what that'll do is when

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.680
the server is vending out the
file to various web browsers,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.460
it'll look on the disk to
find a file by that name,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.260
and it'll replace the comment
with the contents of that file.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.500
A lot of people use this for standard
headers and footers on their websites,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.130
so this is kind of an
interesting option to turn on,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.190
because then you can have standard
headers and footers for all your pages,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.980
of course.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.840
Now in site two,
we're just going to turn on,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.490
we're going to use these commands to turn

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.990
PHP processing inside
of plain HTML files.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.000
So now you, instead of having .php at
the end of all your files,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.590
you have .html.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.700
And for some people,
they can't really tell how

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.170
you're automating your site then,
because you're just using HTML as

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.670
far as the world is concerned.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.700
Behind the scenes, of course,
you can have PHP running,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.990
processing your pages.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.320
So here's a small demo.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.630
I'm going to switch
over to Demo Machine 2.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.540
First of all,
here's the HTTP configuration

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.900
file that I'm using.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.960
And inside of there,
I've enabled the PHP commands.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.490
So here's the first line.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:45.290
And all I did was I took the comment
symbol off the front of that.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.290
And here's the second one.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.700
So searching from the top,
there's the load module statement.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.570
We uncommented that.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.570
And then we uncommented that.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.300
And that's turned on PHP on your system.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.330
And you can use PHP in all your files.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.840
And after that,
you probably don't want to do any more

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.100
changes to the HTTP configuration file.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.140
Now, in here,
this is my Apple user configuration file.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.940
And that's located inside of, well,
you can see it up here.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.640
It's etc.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.890
HTTP users, Apple configuration.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.190
And this is the important statement here,
is just allow for HTTP config,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.120
HT access files to be used.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.250
And that governs the access over,
you provide an absolute

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.900
path name up here,
the user's Apple sites directory.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.030
So everything in the
Apple sites directory,

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.210
now if there's an HT access
file in the folder,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.070
it'll be used to determine the
options for that folder and all

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.750
the subfolders of that folder.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.240
So these are standard
Apache configuration things.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:54.880
So I have site one set up here,
so we can say, local host, local host.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.000
Site 1.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:06.100
So that's my site with server-side
includes turned on inside of it.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.300
And if we look on the disk here,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.350
As far as zooming in the finder windows,
I could try doing that.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.690
Is there a--oh, hold on, yeah.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.460
Give me a second to do that.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.050
It's on?

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.980
Turn on soon.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.820
Thank you.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.290
Thank you.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.900
Okay.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.790
I guess when I'm in front
of people and nervous,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.530
I'm not looking at the
thing in front of my face.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.130
Okay.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:51.010
So anyway, here's site one,
and here's my HTML file, and of course,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.520
here's my include file.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.840
Now,
inside of there is a control option plus.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.350
Okay.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.670
Okay.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.790
Okay.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.690
I guess when I'm in front
of people and nervous,

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.440
I'm not looking at the
thing in front of my face.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.030
Okay.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.930
So anyway, here's site one,
and here's my HTML file, and of course,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.610
here's my include file.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Okay.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.900
I guess when I'm in front
of people and nervous,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.640
I'm not looking at the
thing in front of my face.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.220
Okay.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:26.020
So anyway, here's site one,
and here's my HTML file, and of course,

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.620
here's my include file.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.010
Now,
inside of there is a control option plus.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.340
brought up the help for me.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.140
It knew I needed help.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.060
OK.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.490
Now, inside of Site 2,
I'm doing PHP processing

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.950
inside of an HTML file.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.640
So if I make this more obvious--

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.760
So here's all the content that
you can see inside of this page.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.680
And this is all generated from the PHP.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.600
Those of you familiar
with PHP will be familiar.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.500
This is the PHP information command.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.150
I'll show you the contents
of that file as well,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.580
if I can get back to the finder.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:13.330
So I'm not actually using the
header include file there.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.340
So here's all the PHP that's
being generated here.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.140
That's the PHP command.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.810
And of course,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.410
This is all the content
that's being generated there.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.680
So that's my little demo.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.190
It's not that exciting.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.420
If you're expecting some
flashy web stuff going on,

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.590
then, well, that's not there.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.210
But we'll switch back to the next slide.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:13:28.800
[Transcript missing]

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.320
I'm going to build this
on the computer here.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.120
So the first thing we bring up,
here's our configuration

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.680
file for my Apple user.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.940
And I'm going to add in--

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.620
So the first thing we bring up,
here's our configuration

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.240
file for my Apple user.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.440
And I'm going to add in--

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.210
So the first thing we bring up,
here's our configuration

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.840
file for my Apple user.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.040
And I'm going to add in--

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.720
And then I'm setting
up a virtual host here.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.930
And the document root is going
to be site three inside of

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.620
my sites folder for my user.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.440
And I'm going to log errors and
accesses in these two files here.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.560
So once I save these, I'm going

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.130
Then we'll be able to go into--
we need to go into the terminal so

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.840
it reads in our new configuration.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:46.830
And I'm doing the Apache Control graceful
method to restart the server.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:46.830
And then I can go into--

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.730
You can see the site name
that I'm typing in there.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:05.420
Okay, there's my exciting demo.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.730
But what's going on in the
background here is this is reading

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.110
in the configuration for that site.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.700
And I've set up site 3 here,
and that just has a service site include.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.540
And I've done the normal thing here.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.760
Now,
htaccess files are in all these folders,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.310
and we can open those up
inside of the terminal here.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.410
I'll go.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.110
So here's our htaccess file right here.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:54.590
And there's basically the
commands that I have inside of it.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.060
Service side include, parsing, turned on.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.720
So that's a very simple way to set up
a virtual host inside of your machine.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.350
And that way you can basically
emulate the same functionality as

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:10.420
you have on most websites to install
whatever software you need on those.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.780
Now, for more information about
Apache configuration options,

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.040
and stuff,
there's a really good book by O'Reilly.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.960
And there's also the Apache website
here that you can go to.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.620
And I also mentioned Darwin Ports,
because if you're interested

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.050
in installing other server
software other than Apache,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.400
you can go there,
and they have a whole bunch of

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.980
different servers that you can
install on your machine that are

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.510
kind of interesting to play with.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.880
Or if you have special servers
that you're developing for,

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.740
then that's a good place to go and get
the server software that you can install.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.260
So in our next session,
I'm just going to go over the different

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.440
databases you can install in your system.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.910
And I'm not really going
to do any demos here,

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.720
because while databases,
that's even less visually

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.350
interesting than my last demos.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:03.060
So what you can install,
I'm going to go over mySQL 4.02,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.720
PostgreSQL, and Berkeley DB.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.990
And of course,
there's some others that we have

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.830
available on the platform as well.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.450
These are the free ones,
but there's other ones like Oracle and

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.800
Sybase that you can get as well.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.150
So I'm going to talk about...

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.590
MySQL, where you can get it,
there's a really good double-clickable

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:26.970
install system style package that
you can install from their site.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.440
You can go to their mysql.org.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.100
It's a fast, popular database.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.930
It's used in almost every web
server seems to have it these days.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.510
I think a lot of people are using it.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.480
So that's a very popular package
that you might want to look at.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:47.030
PostgreSQL supports more advanced
SQL queries that you can use.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.700
It's more interesting if you want
to do some advanced programming.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.080
They do have an install on
their website at postgreSQL.org,

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.040
but there's also a really easy to
use install on Darwin Ports that

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.520
you might want to install instead
because that's all pre-configured

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.620
and there's no hassle installing it.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.610
It's very easy to do.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.500
If you do install the Darwin ports,
Darwin ports have variants.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.290
So if you want it to run as a server
on your machine instead of just

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.600
installing the libraries and software
that is not launched by default

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.110
when you restart your computer,
then you'd want to use the plus

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.810
server option that I've shown there
in the Darwin ports install command.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.470
Berkeley Database.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.150
I've seen some people use this with Perl.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.860
Some people do that.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.460
And I've included reference
to their website here.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.100
It's also available as an install
package from Darwin Ports.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.340
And that's why I provided
a reference there.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.590
Now, there's some high-level
SQL tools that we can use.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.050
And...

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.320
There's the Cocoa MySQL,
which is really easy to do,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.290
and that's kind of for
looking at MySQL databases.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.330
It's a high-level viewer engine that
lets you do SQL queries and lets you

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.660
look at SQL data and that sort of thing.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.830
The second one is MacSQL,
and that's kind of a generic

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.390
database product that you can
use for viewing databases,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.930
and you can download
that from Runtime Labs.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.310
What that provides is a UI on one end,
and then you have various drivers

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.150
for different databases that hook up,
and then you have a database in

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.080
between there that you can use,
and then, of course,

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.860
there's your database running
on your other machine.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.910
PHP My Admin is another
tool that runs in PHP,

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.110
of course,
and I began this session saying

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.980
I wasn't going to do a demo,
but I do have a demo of this,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.270
so I'm just going to give a
quick demo of using PHP My Admin.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.660
So if you go to their website,
and that's what I've done here,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.540
we can download it.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.190
There's a gzip package.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.380
And I'll just download that.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.220
And hopefully it will
appear on my desktop.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.950
So basically the demo here is I'm
just going to download the-- oh.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.260
I'm going to have to cancel this demo.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:32.790
I'm very sorry.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.000
What happened was originally I had
mySQL installed on this machine,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.760
and I forgot to do that
just before our session.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.450
And it was really neat,
because what I do is

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.510
I download PHP MyAdmin,
just drop it into the site,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.670
and then it would work.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.320
But we'll just move on to the next slide,
I'm afraid.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:46.920
Sorry.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.510
I just got here before,
and I completely forgot

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.220
to install that last one.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.030
So anyway,
here's the database software references.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.300
And we have mySQL,
and there are various websites.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.060
And also you might want
to look at Darwin ports,

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:03.400
because if you're using things
like Python or Perl or PHP,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.690
there's a whole bunch of plug-in
modules for various different

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.980
database accessing drivers that
you can get from Darwin ports.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.890
Of course,
the Perl ones you can get from CPAN.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.660
We're going to talk about
scripting languages next.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.540
There's a whole bunch that are
installed on Mac OS X by default.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.120
You get PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.740
There's all the old Unix favorites,
the command line tools and whatnot,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.720
but you don't really use
those for scripting web pages,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.280
but you might use them
building web pages,

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.980
of course.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.290
I'm going to start by talking about
PHP because I think that's one of the

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.940
most popular ones for web developers.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:46.090
Of course, you need to turn that on,
and here's the commands that you can use.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.030
I showed how to turn it on before,
but these are basically the two

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.860
lines that you uncomment to turn on
PHP for running in your programs.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.350
All you have to do is take out the
sharp symbols at the beginning of

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.820
these lines and restart your Apache,
and that'll get it going.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.350
Now, for PHP configuration,
the default configuration, I found,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.820
I didn't really like it.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.980
So these are the two things that
really bothered me about the

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.230
default configuration for PHP.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.770
And you can, of course,
go and change those.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.240
We provide all the defaults in a file
that you can make a duplicate of using

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.140
the command that I've shown here.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.660
And what you'd want to do, like,
for example, the magic quotes thing,

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.700
that kind of caught me by surprise,
because what it does is in the

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.560
GPC stands for get post cookies.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.400
And in all the get post cookie data,
it's on by default,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.640
and it puts little backslashes in front
of all your quotes and things like that.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.770
So you might want to turn that off.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.050
The other one,
if you want to upload files larger

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.310
than two megabytes or have post data,
which is tied to the upload,

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.270
the maximum file size,
greater than two or eight megabytes,

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.920
then you might want to
adjust those parameters.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.270
So you'd go in and make a duplicate
copy of the default initialization

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:56.450
value variables for PHP that we provide,
and then go fiddle with the preferences

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.670
so they're the way you like them.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.320
Perl is installed, 5.81.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.440
We have Perl 5.81 installed
on Panther right now.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.440
And if you want to upgrade that,
you can go to Darwin Ports,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.210
and of course, you can download that.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:15.300
That installs in a separate directory,
and it doesn't overwrite

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.330
the systems Perl.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.520
That's a good thing.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.560
And you can talk to me after
if you want to know about ways

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.220
to go about aligning that.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.210
Of course, once you install Perl and you
have the latest Perl installed,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.440
you can go and use all the CPAN modules
and the DB database accessing modules

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.430
and database accessing drivers for
various databases and stuff like that.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.110
Mod Perl is available,
and you can turn it on in the same way

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:46.420
that you can turn on the PHP inside
of the Apache configuration file.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.530
I'm not really going to go over that,
but if you know about Mod Perl,

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.630
then you know how to turn it on.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.540
Python is installed.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.490
There's a whole bunch of Python updates
and modules from OpenDarwin.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.860
That's a really good
place to look for that.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.760
Of course, here's the Python website.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.460
I was really impressed by how
many different Python modules were

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.320
available on the Darwin port site.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.610
You might want to take a look at that.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.530
It's kind of a neat language.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.070
Ruby,
it's more of an object-oriented version

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.540
of scripting languages for people
that like object-oriented programming.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.280
It might be something really worthwhile
for you to investigate if you do

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.570
a lot of object-oriented stuff.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.060
And here's their website.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.200
You can upgrade Ruby,
and there's a whole bunch of

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.600
Ruby modules for accessing databases
and whatnot on the Darwin Ports website.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.140
So that's the scripting
languages section.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.720
We talked about Darwin Ports,
and that's a really good place to go.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.300
It's one of my favorite sites,
if you haven't noticed.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.100
And there's lots of add-on
scripting modules there.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.520
Other languages you can get.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.760
If you're building your web pages
dynamically or using different

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.510
languages to create them,
there's a whole bunch of other

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.700
languages you can go get there.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.610
And if you're running C programs
that do image manipulation or

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.560
automatic image generation for,
like,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.990
raster titles or something like that,
there's a whole bunch of different

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.650
libraries you can get there as well.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.220
So here's some information
about different places you

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.440
can go to find information.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.340
There's a lot of different ways
to find information about these

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.820
different scripting languages,
of course.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.510
There's the man pages and the
pro doc pages and stuff like that

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.820
built into the system as well.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.690
So the last section,
we're going to talk about

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.460
server-side Java implementations
available on Mac OS X.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.340
The first section is Java servlets.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.430
For those of you who don't know,
Java servlets are little Java programs

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.460
that run inside of Apache.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.460
You can actually run them as a
server inside of Apache as well.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.050
We're going to show you some of
the tools that we have available on

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.180
Mac OS X for developing servlets.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.170
You can develop them inside of Xcode.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.460
We have Ted Jucevic here to
give us a demo of what they are

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.010
and let you see how they work.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.520
I'm not sure if they can hear you.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.500
I assume that people can hear me.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.400
So let's actually go to, I guess, yeah,
that's the right machine.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.810
So the only thing I've really done for
this machine is I've downloaded and

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.520
installed the application server preview.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.940
You can get that from connect.apple.com.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.070
It says it's a preview,
but it actually has final

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:30.720
candidate implementations,
releases of JBoss, Tomcat, Ant, xDoclet.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.430
It also includes templates
for Xcode for doing,

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.920
let's see, servlets,
enterprise Java beans,

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.990
and enterprise applications.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.030
Now, what I'm going to show you here,
I've actually got the

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.580
server up and running.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.710
Where is that mouse thing?

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.700
There it is.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.920
Don't worry about the text.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.280
I don't need to zoom it in.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.580
But this is just the log file.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.020
This is the file that comes
that when you start up JBoss,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.360
this is what it generates.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.760
The only thing I've done
is after you install it,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:09.360
you can actually start it up by
going into CDing into library,

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.410
JBoss, 3.2, bin,
and then there's a run.sh

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.280
script that you can run,
and then you're up and running with it.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:22.090
So the next step is let's go
and actually launch Xcode.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.630
Now servlets, yes,
it's Java and stuff like that,

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.320
but it's not complicated.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:33.880
Even if you really don't know Java,
to do a very simple servlet is very easy.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.810
One of the key things is
even though I'm doing the

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:41.690
development for this on Mac OS X,
you can deploy this to any

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:46.820
other server that does servlets,
any other server that has Tomcat

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:55.600
or the JBoss with the Tomcat,
Windows, Linux, Solaris, of course,

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.740
XServe.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:10.010
And so I'll just put this in my
home and let's call it helloWODCSF.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.410
So it creates a project.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.820
This is actually an AMP build
script that it uses.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:20.040
So if you want to-- say you're working
on this project with other people

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:25.760
and they're using some other tool,
say like NetBeans

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:47.400
[Transcript missing]

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.800
Let's see, that's the title,
and then this is the content.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.790
The template comes up with Hello World.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.590
And let me see if I can zoom
in on this a little bit.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.490
Let me get the text.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.800
Let me set it to, let's see, like 18.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.610
There we go.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.720
So let's go down to here.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.330
And the do get, this is when you send a
get command to the server.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.360
This is where it comes in.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.480
It actually sends in the request.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:30:02.500
[Transcript missing]

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.580
And let's go ahead and do the build.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.210
Now, one thing about this AMP project
is it actually does both the

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.170
build and then also installs it.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:21.720
So you notice that the terminal
over there just kind of kicked up.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.940
What that was is the AMP build actually
copied it into the directory for you.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.410
So you notice that the terminal
over there just kind of kicked up.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:38.510
What that was is the AMP build actually
copied it into the directory for you.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:44.530
You could always go to another machine,
but you're on that machine.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:48.150
And actually, I changed it a little bit
from what I had before.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:55.440
So the first part of the URL is
actually the name of the project,

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.170
sf.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.380
And then the second half of the URL,
the server hello world,

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.760
actually comes from inside the sources.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:08.480
There's the xdoclet comment right here,
the server hello world.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:21.800
[Transcript missing]

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:27.470
With any luck, I should get low WWDC.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.590
So, of course,
your servlets would be much more

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.210
dynamic and stuff like that.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.830
But, you know,
the entry level for servlets

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:41.250
is very low on Mac OS X,
and it makes it very easy to develop

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.160
and then deploy to any other platform.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.900
So thank you very much.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.180
So, of course,
your servlets would be much more

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.850
dynamic and stuff like that.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.900
But, you know,
the entry level for servlets

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:02.900
is very low on Mac OS X,

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.490
So, of course,
your servlets would be much more

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.160
dynamic and stuff like that.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.760
But, you know,
the entry level for servlets

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.140
is very low on Mac OS X,
and it makes it very easy to develop

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.060
and then deploy to any other platform.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.800
So thank you very much.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.300
And that's kind of interesting in itself.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.650
Now, to do that, I have Daryl Lee,
who is a senior engineer from

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.880
the WebObjects team who's come
to give us a talk and give us a

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.630
demonstration of how to do that.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.600
So here's Daryl.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.560
All right.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.140
Thank you, John.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.390
So how many people out there
know what WebObjects is or

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:51.530
have heard of WebObjects?

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.820
Great.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.600
How many have worked with
J2E technologies before,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.840
EJB, servlets, et cetera, et cetera?

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.240
Okay.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.230
Great.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.930
So what I'm going to tell you about
is how WebObjects and J2E kind

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:03.960
of integrate well together.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.510
So what is WebObjects?

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.700
It's a Java application
server that Apple builds.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.280
It's a development and
deployment environment.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.150
So we think it's probably one
of the best ways to build large

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:22.560
enterprise-level applications that
have a lot of enterprise needs.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.530
And some of the vertical customers or
solutions that people have deployed have

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:34.960
been for online banking institutions,
travel agencies, e-learning solutions.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.310
We use it for our iTunes Music Store,
our .Mac services,

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.560
our online Apple Store also.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.680
So there are many other
solutions that are out there,

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.370
but that just gives you an idea
of what people have done with it.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.000
So at its core, what is WebObjects about?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.830
I think the power of WebObjects
is in our core frameworks.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.800
And we have frameworks,
if you've heard of EOF,

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:05.700
that allow you to model the data,
in your database, or other data sources,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.900
and connect to that easily,
and map that to your application.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.280
Then we have a bunch of frameworks
that allow you to publish your data,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.300
either to HTML,
or maybe a desktop application,

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.980
a Java desktop application,
or maybe build a web service.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.610
On top of those frameworks,
we have a bunch of tools and assistance

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:35.670
that help you configure your UI and
build your applications rapidly.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.490
So if you're familiar with WebObjects,
a lot of people have done what

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:44.320
we call a .woa deployment,
or the application bundles

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.890
are bundled in .woas.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.070
We also have a different option
for deploying in J2E containers,

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.180
and that's the .war bundle.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:35:00.110
And .war bundles or web archives
are a J2E-specified way of

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:06.360
deploying an application bundle
to any J2E-compliant server.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.900
So if you have something like JBoss,
you can take a .war bundle

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.690
and deploy it into that,
and also take that same .war bundle and

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:20.180
deploy into WebSphere or WebLogic or
whatever J2E container that you'd like.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:28.150
So let's dig a little deeper into
the functionality within WebObjects.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:32.680
So the first thing you want to do is
get some connectivity to your data.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.830
The standard way in
Java is to go through JDBC,

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.040
the JDBC interfaces.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.220
So if somebody writes a JDBC driver,
then we can connect to

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.730
that kind of data source.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.260
So today we've talked
about mySQL or Postgre.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.080
There are JDBC drivers for that.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.410
There are a lot of commercial
drivers for like Oracle,

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.370
Sybase, and you name it.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.180
So if you're connecting
to relational databases,

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.840
we can support that.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.130
And in the same token,
if you're connecting

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:12.060
to directory services,
Java has a standard interface for that.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.160
So the JNDI interface is the way to go.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:20.090
And things like... Open LDAP and iPlanet,
we can support that kind of

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.970
connectivity as long as they
have a JConnector for that.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.520
So when you're trying to map
your data from your database,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.340
we do this thing called
object relational mapping.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:35.290
So we're mapping the actual tables and
rows in your database to actual objects

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.650
so that your app can access that.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.690
And we have an EOModeler tool
that I'll show you a little bit

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.550
later and how to use that tool.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.190
So the next thing after you've kind
of modeled your data is... You'd

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.060
want to figure out what mediums or
where you'd want to publish that to.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.770
When you hear the name WebObject,
you think, "Oh, okay,

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:01.040
so that's a web client." So we
obviously vend HTML as one option.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.530
But some other things I want
to make you aware of is that if

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.980
you want a richer experience,
we also help you build

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.780
Java clients for the desktop.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.680
These are kind of
three-tiered applications.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:16.580
So they would be a Java client,
which would talk to a WebObject server.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.740
Which would then talk to your database.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.900
And then we also support web services.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.800
So web services are a very
popular buzzword lately.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.660
And so if you hear Microsoft is
pushing .NET services,

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.010
and basically they're just
sending out soap structures,

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.700
if people are familiar with soap.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:43.220
So web services kind of encompass SOAP,
XMLRPC, and WSDL.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.340
I'm not going to go
into all those acronyms.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:51.890
But... We have assistance that allow
you to take your data with your

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:57.540
model data and actually configure a
service so that you can interconnect

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.560
with other computers or applications
that can talk web services also.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.360
So after we've done that...

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.660
I want to just tell you about
our rapid development tools.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.990
And these assistants really allow
you to rapidly prototype your

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.940
applications within minutes.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.530
So later in a demo, I'm going to show you
that within five minutes,

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.640
I can build an application without
writing even a drop of code,

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.070
and customize the UI,
and get it up and running.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:35.140
So it's definitely a powerful tool
to use in our WebRx distribution.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.940
So getting started,
what do I need to get on

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.620
my disk to download on my
laptop today and get running?

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.380
Well, first you're going to want to
pick a nice IDE to work in.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.460
We're Apple,
so we encourage you to use Xcode.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.410
It's a great environment for
building Java applications

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.160
and WebObjects applications.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.510
So definitely check that out.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.420
If you are more partial to
an open source solution,

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.240
grab Eclipse and download that.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.080
And then we have a couple
of open source projects that

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.240
support WebObjects development.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.710
So if you have heard of
WoeLips and WoeProject,

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.110
if you download those and install them,
then you can use Eclipse to

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.910
build WebObjects applications.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.470
The next thing you want to do if
you don't have WebObjects on your

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:25.590
disk is to go to our website,
www.apple.com/webobjects,

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.500
and download a free trial
version of WebObjects.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.410
It's their full feature
development tools there.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:37.580
The only thing you need is
a 30-day free trial license.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.760
So that'll get you up and running,
and you can play with

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.830
everything that we've got.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.160
So if you're interested in the
.war bundling that I was talking

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.990
about and deploying that way,
I would suggest that you download

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:56.460
the application server update or
preview that Ted was demoing earlier,

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.480
and that has Tomcat and JBoss.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.640
So those are all pre-configured
to run on Mac OS X,

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.500
so it saves you from downloading the
binaries from JBoss.org or Tomcat.org

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.840
and getting all that installed
correctly and configured correctly.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.390
Okay, so without,
I would like to jump into a demo,

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.270
and if we can go to laptop,
laptop over here.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:26.600
Okay, so this is kind of like the end
product of what I'm going to show you.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.000
And what you can see is that
this is a very full-featured app.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.700
I can add records over here.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.260
I can edit records.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.590
I can delete them, and I can sort them.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.400
And hopefully my session
hasn't timed out yet,

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.700
so it's still interactive.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:45.970
So this is what we're going to try
to get to by the end of my demo.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.410
One other thing I want
to point out to you,

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:56.790
just because it looks cooler,
is a more fuller model that I've built.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.600
and Michael Eumodler.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.820
OK, there we go.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.890
So let's resize that.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:40.500
[Transcript missing]

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.950
So I want to build a
simpler model for you.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.070
One other thing I'll point out is that
you also can see the relationships

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.570
between the various tables,
the foreign keys and the primary keys,

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.180
and how they relate with each other.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:59.300
Okay, so let's build a simpler model and
reverse engineer this from our database.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:07.730
And the first thing we want to do is I'm
going to connect to a JDBC data source.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.700
connect to it with a JDBC connection URL.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.080
Hopefully that pasted in correctly.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.160
The next thing it's going to do is
ask me all kinds of questions about do

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.340
I want to be queried about relationships
or stored procedures or other things.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.830
And we'll just take some very
simple options and say we're

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.060
going to ask about primary keys.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.720
The next thing it's asking me is, okay,
what tables do I want to work with?

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.920
And I just,
for the simplicity of this demo,

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.790
I just want to pick one table,
and I'll pick listing address.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.430
Let's finish.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.470
So here is our model,
and it's really simple,

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:05.020
and like I pointed out to you before,
here's our table, and there are columns.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.220
And one other thing I'll
just point out to you,

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:15.040
say I want to change something or if
I was just modeling this on my own

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.290
and I didn't have any database or any
of the tables set up in the database,

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.860
we can generate the SQL for
actually creating those tables

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.270
and those relationships,
the primary keys,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.240
the foreign key bindings,
and stuff like that.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.920
And you can execute that script
or save it off as a script.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.590
OK, so let's just save that model.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.630
Let's put that on our desktop.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.230
Okay, so what I'd like to show you
next is how in Xcode we'd

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.860
build a direct web application.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:57.180
And what that does is allow me to
rapidly prototype a web application.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.640
And as you can see,
we have a bunch of other

00:43:58.650 --> 00:43:59.820
templates for web objects.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.170
So if you're building a
Java client or if you're building

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:07.090
a web service application,
and there are variations thereof.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.000
But I'm going to do a
web application today.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:16.500
Let's just call this test
and put it on the desktop.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.440
So we want to eventually
deploy this as a WAR bundle,

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.260
so I'm going to select that option.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.980
This is a standalone one where it
beds all the jars and necessary

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.660
resources that we'll need.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.770
And this is where we'd put
our little trial license in.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.020
If I wanted to add web services support,
either vending web services

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:44.390
or consuming web services,
I would select these options.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:50.880
And what this is asking me for is
whether I want to use JDBC type of

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.780
access or if I need JNDI types of access.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:59.990
And I will take just the standard
frameworks that's added there,

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.200
and let me just add our
little listing model.

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:08.330
Now, what this pane is asking me is, OK,
what kind of default template look

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.090
that I want to start off with?

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:13.600
I'm not forced to stick with this,
but I will be configuring

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.060
this a little bit later.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:20.100
So let's just go with a neutral look
and then build and run our project.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.590
So there's not a real lot of
Java code in this project.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:30.070
As you can see,
there's like three Java files,

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:34.900
and there are a few components in here,
and then there's our model file

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.220
that we were just talking about.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.100
This will launch and pull
up my web browser here.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.370
And this is my application
without any configuration.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.410
And as you can see,
it's fully functional out of the box.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.820
So if I wanted to query on it,
there's no problems.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:58.170
I can sort right away.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.180
and I can add and do other kinds
of operations on the table.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.480
So as you can notice,
some of it's not so pretty.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:13.900
I don't like this apartment number
string that it's previewing for me here.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.250
And I don't particularly like
how it's presenting the zip code

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.620
string or something like that.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.520
So I'm going to show you how you
can customize this without even

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.730
having to recompile your code.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.680
And what I would do is I would
select the assistant and log in.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:43.600
[Transcript missing]

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.000
So, okay, here's our assistant.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.400
Hopefully that's large
enough for everybody to see,

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:51.400
but...

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:59.720
What I want to do is I want to change
this apartment num attribute name to

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.300
something that's more displayable.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.800
And I'll just call this apartment.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:22.900
[Transcript missing]

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.300
I can do the same thing.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.500
Let's do it for zip code again.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.140
And let's just call this postal code.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:34.910
And we can update that, and boom,
it immediately updates.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.700
So we can save our changes.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:43.960
And let me just show you how
the deployment in JBoss works.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.290
Okay, so we want to go to Xcode.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:53.200
And let me just point out one
thing in our targets over here.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.650
And let's select that.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:08.960
Now I can tell Xcode where to
drop my WAR bundle by configuring

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:14.690
this one property here,
which is the servlet_webapps directory.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:22.410
And it's telling it to put into the JBoss
deployment directory in /JBoss3.2 deploy.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.720
So I just wanted to
point that out to you.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.590
If you had installed your application
server in a different location,

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.660
that would be good to know.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:37.990
Okay,
so let's build our and deploy our server.

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:42.840
Once it finishes building,
it will automatically put it

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.380
into the /library/jboss folder.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:51.080
And while it's building and stuff,
I'll just show you one other thing,

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:55.240
a way you can tell that the JBoss
server is up without having to look at

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.470
your terminal or something like that.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:02.800
If you go to localhost 8080 on
the 8080 port and you hit that,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.740
you'll get this welcoming page.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:09.930
So it's a quick way that I use all the
time just to check if my server's up.

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:13.020
So let's try connecting
to our application.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.330
I'm pretty sure it's deployed.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.320
Let's just try.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:25.900
So it's at tests, web objects,

00:49:29.400 --> 00:50:11.800
[Transcript missing]

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.440
- So thank you very much, Daryl.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:27.660
Here's some reference materials for
doing server-side Java applications.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.590
Now, okay, I'm going to sum up,
and what we've talked about today

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.940
is basically doing all your web
development locally on your computer.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.320
Like, for example,
you're all carrying around laptops,

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.360
so let's say you wanted
to do website development,

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.030
testing,
prototyping on your laptop without

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:41.900
being connected to the Internet.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.920
This is what we've been
talking about today.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.530
We talked about server software
and how to set up Apache so you

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:50.950
can do local serving off of pages,
and so you can emulate all the

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.980
server-side options that you'd have
on a regular server on the Internet,

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.770
such as server-side includes
doing PHP and virtual hosting.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.400
We talked about databases,
where you can go to get

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.940
them to install them,
where you can find them on the web,

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.460
some installation options for Postgre,
for example,

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:12.000
and where you can get modules to access
them from various scripting languages.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.870
And we talked about some
scripting languages that are

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.350
pre-installed on Mac OS X,
and how you can turn on PHP,

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.180
and that sort of thing.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.200
We also had two demonstrations
of different options for doing

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.280
server-side Java on Mac OS X.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.220
And these were all running
locally on a local machine,

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:33.590
so you can do your development, testing,
prototyping, all on the same machine.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.340
And, of course, we had servlets,
which are the simple ones,

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:39.160
and we had J2E application
development with WebObjects,

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:42.560
which, of course, as you noticed,
that was our flashy graphics demo.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.710
So, now, in the end,
here's the reference library information.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:52.180
We have a connect.apple.com DMG that you
can download at the end of the day today.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.650
And, of course,
Dorm and Ports is a good place

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.940
to go look for information and
downloads for software that you

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.810
can install to do web development
and prototyping on your machine.
