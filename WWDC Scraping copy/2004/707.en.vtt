WEBVTT

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.450
Greetings.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.000
Welcome to session 707,
QuickTime for the Web.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.000
Nice to see you all here this afternoon.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.910
Let's see if we can get this guy to go.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.280
Rhonda Straatton is here.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.170
I'm Steve Gulie,
senior technical writer and multimedia

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.390
web monkey for Apple Computer,
and this is what I do for a living.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.900
It's great, I've got to tell you.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.600
So we're going to be talking about
QuickTime over the Internet here.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.060
And I can't actually see
the monitor from here,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.490
so I'm going to move over here.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.040
I'll be showing you how to use
QuickTime over the Internet,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.600
primarily putting
QuickTime content on your website.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.860
And mostly we'll be
talking about HTML today,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.880
but also we'll be showing you some
movie tricks to get the most out

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.740
of putting movies on your websites.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.530
And we'll show you a little bit of
XML and ways to work that into the mix,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560
and just a tiny bit of JavaScript.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.360
So what we're mainly learning to do today
is how to put QuickTime on a web page

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.920
in a way that lets everybody see it,
whether they're using Explorer or

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.720
Safari or any operating system.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.060
If they don't have QuickTime installed,
they get a good message

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.040
to get it installed.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.350
How to put live and pre-recorded
streams on a web page,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.350
as well as

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.900
and I will be talking about the most
advanced and most effective ways to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600
embed QuickTime on your web pages.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.690
We will be talking about how to
use QuickTime on your web pages,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.700
how to use QuickTime on your web pages,
how to use QuickTime on your web pages,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.370
how to use QuickTime on your web pages,
how to use QuickTime on your web pages,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.010
how to use QuickTime on your web pages,
how to use QuickTime on your web pages,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.330
how to use QuickTime on your web pages,
how to use of stuff.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.590
Everything that's in this
session today is also available

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.920
on our website at Apple.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.990
It's a really nice website.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.510
It's the
www.apple.com/quicktimetools-tips

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.860
under bar dash,
and it's got a lot of

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.700
great tutorials there,
and it's also available in this book,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.910
QuickTime for the Web,
which you can get at Amazon,

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.690
or if you go over to the QuickTime Lab,
the Morgan Kaufman

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.290
Publishers has a form there.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.520
You can get it, and it's right-handy.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.570
it'll cover all this stuff
and quite a bit more.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.220
So, just before we go too far,
I want to give you some

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.840
idea of what QuickTime is,
because you're probably as a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.400
website developer thinking,
well, streaming video, should I use Reel,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.720
should I use Windows Media,
should I use QuickTime?

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.610
QuickTime is a lot more
than just streaming video,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.340
and I want to give you
some sense of what it is.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.310
Speech, music, slideshows, animation,
movies, of course, QuickTime VR,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.880
3D models, interactivity.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.220
Let me switch you over to Demo 1 here,
and I'll just give you a quick

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.510
run-through of some of the things that
you can do with QuickTime on the web.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.060
If we can switch you over to Demo 1.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.470
Computer 2, I think you're calling it.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.100
Here we go.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.820
The role of the dark in motion pictures.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.380
Recall the ratchet and flutter
of grade school projectors.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.980
Sprocket teeth sank
into slots in the film,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.360
feeding into a loop,
slack enough not to tear.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.610
This will run over a dial-up modem.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.310
You can have a website
that talks in good,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.150
rich speech automatically
over a dial-up modem.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.170
This is a different kind of multimedia.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.220
It's rich not because you've
got a zillion things going on,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.820
but because the content is exciting.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.650
And people just really,
really react to a website that

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.580
starts talking when they show up.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.180
Here's some music,
a little bit of something from Wilco.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.840
As you can see,
this is a custom player that

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.770
launches from your web page.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.050
And you can move it around,
drag it around, close it,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.220
and it plays streaming music.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.510
Here's a slide show.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.860
Here's a web page that launches
a movie in QuickTime Player.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.300
And slideshows have a particular
value on the internet,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.480
because QuickTime is unusual as a media.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.370
It doesn't have necessarily a frame rate.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.880
You've got 24 FPS video.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.880
You've got 30 FPS video.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.030
With QuickTime,
you can have one image that lasts for 10,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.180
15 seconds,
and then 30 FPS video mixed in with it.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.440
So on the internet,
it allows you to send very

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.100
high resolution images that
last for a long time without

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.210
straining your bandwidth budget.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.860
It looks like this is just a tremendous

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.940
Pretty high-resolution image,
but if you look at the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.850
actual video track,
it's got

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.600
Let's see, what's the frame rate here?

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.340
0.15 frames roughly per second.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.260
And of course that changes.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:22.260
But if we look at the size, let's see,
I want to get the general look out here.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.260
There we go.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.000
We're looking at 8.7 kilobytes per
second for pretty high-res video.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.080
Animation, of course.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.360
It's fairly flashy.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.590
That's 40K.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.920
That's the size of a small JPEG because
we're using Flash within QuickTime along

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.580
with audio and QuickTime effects.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.460
And of course, virtual reality,
which is something that no

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.480
other technology will offer you.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.420
You can look around inside of places,
you can zoom in and just kind

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.420
of stick your head inside
places and museums love this.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.870
It's wonderful for architecture,
for visiting places that

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.990
you've never been before,
real estate.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.410
And here we go,
one of my favorite websites these days,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.380
Panorama's DK.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.600
One thing you'll notice if you look
down here in the lower right corner

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.400
is that little image is moving around.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.300
That's a QuickTime movie.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.720
And when you click it,
it launches a full-screen

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.350
QuickTime movie of the same thing.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.830
This is a virtual reality.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.330
It's very high bandwidth,
so we're looking at a background

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.600
that fills in as it comes along.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.520
You can look around.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.120
This is a kind of immersive technology
that you don't necessarily think of

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.580
when you're thinking of streaming video.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.200
It's like, wow,
I can really... What's through that door?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.120
Let's go see.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.120
Oh.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.450
And it just reveals whole worlds.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:15.120
Here we've got this incredible medieval
fortress right in the middle of a...

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.370
and I are going to take a moment to
show you a picture of a modern city.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.110
And again, we can zoom in and look at
things more closely or zoom out.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.590
And it's pretty cool.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.310
In addition,
there are things like 3D models,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.020
which are available.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.700
This is Axle playing in QuickTime.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.580
This is a component download,
and what's going to happen here

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.470
is I didn't have that component,
so it offers to get it for me,

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.090
and it'll just download it
and install it automatically.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.640
This is the Apple component
download program,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.860
so that you can include
media in your movies that not

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.040
everybody has a player for.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.110
If it's a component that
plugs into QuickTime,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.990
QuickTime sees that it needs it,
offers to get it, downloads it,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.420
installs it automatically,
and it's a pretty seamless

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.930
experience for your users.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:10.770
That lets you do things that go beyond,
okay, and we'll just reload the frame,

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.690
and suddenly there we are.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.460
So here again is something quite
a bit beyond streaming video.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.880
We've got an interactive 3D
model that we can look at.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.600
And we can turn on and
off the exterior views.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.180
They fade in and out, the interiors.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.820
And it's, again,
it's just a lot of different

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.500
kinds of media involved here that
go far beyond what we normally

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.070
think of as streaming movies.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.510
And if we can go back to slides, please.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.090
Okay.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.290
Oh, there's one more thing.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.880
Interactive mini-applications.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.890
I wanted to show you some of those.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.500
If we can come back to Demo Computer 2.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.700
And bring those up.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.200
And you already saw some of that already.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.760
You saw that there was a skinned player,
that there were interactive

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.340
VRs you could drag around.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.200
But there's really a lot of
other neat stuff you can do.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.940
Here's a calculator.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.940
Which isn't working.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.740
Here we go.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.980
Scientific calculator
as a QuickTime movie.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.660
There's something cute.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.210
K-A-T-Y.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:30.940
Katie.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.780
Katie.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.760
Katie.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.020
Guy wrote that in a few minutes
to entertain his granddaughter.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.790
You can just do things that are not...

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.420
Thank you for joining us.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.440
I'm going to go back
to the slides because,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:10:00.290
of course, streaming audio and streaming
video are important.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.440
With QuickTime,
there are really two kinds

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:05.440
of what you think of or might
think of as streaming video.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:05.440
Ordinarily,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.760
When you think of streaming video,
what you're thinking of is a movie

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.350
that plays while you watch it.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.000
You click the link and
it plays in real time.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.220
You don't wait for it to
download and then watch it.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.600
But QuickTime actually has two ways
to accomplish much the same thing.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.070
One is called Fast Start and the
other is called Real-Time Streaming.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.840
Now, Fast Start Movie works on
pre-recorded material only,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.140
but it sends the movie from
start to finish just as you would

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.440
during a normal file download,
and it sends the movie as fast as it can.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.800
So, in other words,
if you have a one-minute movie,

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.150
but it's one megabyte and you've got
a one megabyte per second connection,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.870
it sends it in one second and
then it plays it as it can.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.640
And you can play as much of the
movie as has downloaded already.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.150
So the movie downloads
while you're playing it.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.740
And if you've got a slower connection,
you can only watch the parts

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.500
that have come already.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.330
But if bandwidth permits,
if you've got enough bandwidth

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.040
to see the movie in real time,
you do, and it's just like streaming.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.680
Let me go back to demos here
and kind of show you some of

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.010
what I'm talking about here.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.480
Let's go to Writing Giants here.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.530
This is,
you can see that little bar at the

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.430
bottom of the movie zipping along?

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.270
That's the movie downloading.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.250
And it's playing while it downloads,
and we have what looks a

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.840
lot like streaming video,
right?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.920
It's just playing as it
comes in over the Internet.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.740
But it's not streaming, it's Fast Start.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.510
Because I've got the whole movie here.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.220
And the difference now,
let's go ahead and bring up another,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.980
here we go.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.890
Okay.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.340
Let me compare you head-to-head
a streaming video and a

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.060
FastStart video to show you what's
similar and what's different

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.600
because it's easy to get confused.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.080
Here's a FastStart video.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.080
And we'll play that at double size
so you can see it a little better.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.160
And again,
you can see it's downloading and

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.400
it's playing at the same time.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:18.060
So let's look at the streaming
version of the same thing.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.440
Okay, here's a streaming video.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.700
And as you can see,
there really isn't a lot

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.250
of difference to the user.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.750
For the user, streaming video,
fast start video are the same thing.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.720
But...

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.700
There are some differences.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:42.160
One is, in my FastStart video here,
I can't see any more that

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.030
has already downloaded.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.770
Well, now the whole thing is downloaded,
so I needed to move a little

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.400
quicker to show you that.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.640
With a streaming movie,
I'm not downloading anything,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.280
so as I click and move around,
it starts streaming from a new point.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.280
Now, what I'm showing you here,
obviously,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.450
is that there isn't a lot of difference
for the user experience if there's

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.280
enough bandwidth to play the movie.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.280
And if we can go back to slides now...

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.170
So the FastStart movie, as you saw,
you could play it,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.500
the bandwidth was permitted,
so you could see it in real time.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.620
If there hadn't been enough bandwidth
to play that movie in real time,

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.730
you would have just watched
the bar slowly move along,

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.610
and you could have started playing
it as soon as enough had downloaded.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.160
With a streaming movie,
in addition to pre-recorded movies,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.200
it can play live material,
which obviously you can't

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.060
in pre-recorded format,
but it sends little bits

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.930
of the movie in real time.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.580
It doesn't send the movie
from start to finish.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.710
You position your movie
anywhere you want.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.640
So for long material, you've got like a
three-hour lecture series,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.490
streaming is a good way to go because
people can skip around to where

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.710
they need to go without having to
download the intervening material.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.390
The downside of streaming really is
that if there's not enough bandwidth

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.190
to show the movie in real time,
it doesn't play.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.790
You've got a 300 kilobit per second movie
and a 100 kilobit per second connection,

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.700
you cannot stream it
over that connection.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.500
It just won't get through.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.640
The bits will fall on the floor.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.320
But you can play it in Fast Start,
it's just that they'll have to wait

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.920
15 minutes to see a five-minute movie.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.480
And sometimes people are
more than willing to do that.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.140
Other times, that's a problem.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.840
So that's kind of what brings
up the decision process.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.800
So when should you stream and
when should you Fast Start?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.220
Well, as you saw,
they're really comparable

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.860
quality at a given data rate,
and they both start right away

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.300
and play over the Internet.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.610
But streaming can provide live content.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.370
So if you've got a live broadcast,
streaming is the only way to go.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.040
You can skip around in large files,
so that's when you might

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.280
want to use streaming.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.390
And it offers a certain amount
of inherent copy discouragement,

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.970
because you're not downloading a file
to the disk that they might somehow

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.700
find and ferret out of a cache.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.180
You're just sending a stream of
bits that are being displayed.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.710
And then you can send a
stream of bits that are being

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.940
displayed and then discarded.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.370
But if they've got audio hijacked,
they can capture the audio.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.760
If they've got a video buffer hijacker,
they can do that.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.180
So it's not perfect,
but it's kind of built in.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.460
And a lot of people use
streaming just because it is

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.050
inherently difficult to copy.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.470
And you can stream audio
and video and text.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.760
So if that's all you're sending,
that can be a good choice.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.440
Fast Start has the advantage
of being able to deliver high

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.200
quality over any speed connection.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.740
If you want to deliver a 25-megabyte
movie over a dial-up connection and

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.380
people are willing to wait for it,
they'll get the whole thing.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.210
They will not be able
to get it as a stream.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.450
You can make them protected or saveable.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.890
Sometimes you want people to
be able to save your movies.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.250
If your movie is basically a
commercial for your product,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.040
you don't want to copy protect it.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.320
You want it to be passed around.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.970
You want everybody to be looking
at your movie trailer and going,

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.480
"That's great.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.320
I want to see that."

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.300
FastStart movies always get through.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.660
You don't have to worry about firewalls.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.760
You don't have to worry about bandwidth.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.240
It's going to get there sooner or later.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.720
And you can deliver all the
different media types as FastStart.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.510
Sprites, VR,
a lot of those things we were just

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:51.340
looking at that are flash media that are
beyond simple audio and video and text.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.000
Okay,
so why bother to use QuickTime rather

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.800
than one of the other players?

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.340
Obviously,
you've got a much broader palette

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.430
of media to work with than
you do in most other things.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.060
You can use still images as
well as video and get the

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.900
advantage of using still images,
the low bandwidth.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.270
Maybe it's a 40K image,
but it's on the screen for 10 seconds,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.850
so it's only 4K a second.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.100
Lots and lots of media.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.850
The quality,
I think some of you have seen

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.660
the H.264 codec demo today.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.390
We're starting to see some
really beautiful quality here.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.620
And with QuickTime,
you have the ability to

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.960
use a variety of codecs.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.930
So you do your work,
your production at the

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.380
highest possible quality,
archive and save it at the

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.490
highest possible quality,
and then recompress it with a different

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.410
compressor to send out over the web.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.350
But then if you want to
edit or make changes,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.730
you don't have to go back
to that low-quality output.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.220
You can go back to the highest quality
and rework and reuse your material.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.220
You have the durability and reusability.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.920
QuickTime movies that were made for
QuickTime 1.0 still play just fine.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.170
You have the ability to take
things out of QuickTime and

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.360
export them to Reel or Windows or
another form of QuickTime to say,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.260
you know, gee, I put this stuff out
on the web in Sorensen,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.200
but I want to take it
back in and put it back.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.620
I only have the web source.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.590
You can still pick it up and
put a new soundtrack on it or

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.420
put a different text or logo on
it if your corporation changes.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.080
You can reuse your material.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.600
I think you're going to find that
with the other media choices,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.880
it's more of a one-way street.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.020
You put it in and you say, okay,
now I have this kind of media.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.620
I want to take it out and rework it.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.470
Oops, it doesn't come back out.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.580
So this is a much more open standard.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.600
Flexibility streaming and fast start.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.980
Standards-based.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.040
I think we've talked a lot about
standards in other sessions.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.940
I'm not going to go into it
in too great a detail here,

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.330
but we're really committed to
working with standards in QuickTime,

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.000
open standards,
so that our players are interoperable

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.940
with other people's players.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.420
You're not roped into what Apple does.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.900
If Apple decides, well,
we don't want to do that anymore,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.610
you can find somebody else who's
also able to do it or you can

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.790
hire an engineer to work on it
because it's an open standard.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.670
You're not stuck.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.250
Finally, distribution.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.340
We've been running third for a long time,
and sometimes it's a hard

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.780
sell to your clients to say,
well, we want to use QuickTime.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.020
They'd say, well,
isn't ReelPlayer more widely

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.380
distributed or Windows Media Player?

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.040
As of now,
that's really not true anymore.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.780
We've pulled it well ahead of Reel,
and we are neck and

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.660
neck with Windows Media.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.140
We've got over 250 million
copies downloaded of QuickTime 6,

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.680
partly because it comes with iTunes,
partly because it comes

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.590
with digital cameras,
but we're seeing a

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.180
tremendous success there.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.720
So now if your client says, well,
I want the most popular format,

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.240
I think you can honestly say
that QuickTime is the choice.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.100
So let's get down to
some real brass tacks.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.160
How do you put a
QuickTime movie in your website?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.490
There are two ways to embed
a movie in your website,

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.320
the EMBED tag and the OBJECT tag,
and we're going to show

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.490
you how to use both.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.500
What you don't want to do is link
to a QuickTime movie that says just,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.720
hey, href, a typical hypertext
link to this movie file.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.050
And the reason is you can't
really tell the browser what

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.880
kind of MIME type your file is.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.180
You're just giving it a file name.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.610
And if it doesn't have the
right extension or the server

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.210
isn't properly configured,
it will show up as text.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:10.160
You can't tell the browser
to use the QuickTime plug-in.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.180
So if they have an old
version of Windows 95 running

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.890
Windows Media Player 3 that says,
oh, I can play movie files,

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:17.480
that's what they're going to do.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.320
And it won't play the movie file.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.170
It will just show a broken icon.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.230
And you can't really control
the plug-in to the player.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.400
You're just passing a file name.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.740
You don't know what's going to happen.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.230
You can't say,
I want it autoplay or I want it

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.450
volume change or the scale set.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.010
And you can't use QuickTime to
play any other file type.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.650
If you link to an MP3 file, well,
whatever MP3 player they get

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.870
is just going to come up.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:43.880
You can't really use it for MP4
or Smile or Flash or streaming.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.660
And if QuickTime isn't installed,
you just link to something

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.440
that it can't display.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.740
And you just get a broken icon.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.510
That's not the user experience
you want them to have.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.000
So we recommend primarily
using the embed tag.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.190
And that's what we're going to focus on.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.040
And we'll show you the new object tag,
too.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.790
The embed tag works in all browsers.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.770
It works in Safari.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:01.790
It works in Netscape.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.660
It works in Internet Explorer and all
the operating systems that they run in.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.480
It lets you specify a MIME type.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.760
So you can say, in the HTML,
this is a video QuickTime.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.340
It gives you extensive control
of the QuickTime plug-in.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.560
You can control a lot of things.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.480
We'll show you some of the
things you can control.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.520
And if you don't have
QuickTime installed,

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.590
it takes the person gracefully to the
QuickTime plug-ins page to get it,

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.600
which is something you
certainly want to do.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.600
The exception is Internet Explorer for
Windows 5.5 and later,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.600
which ignores the plug-ins page.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:37.330
Here's the EMBED tag.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.260
It's not that complicated.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.140
You specify the height
and width of your movie,

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.830
the file name and path to your movie.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.050
It can be an absolute
path or a relative path.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.600
If it's in the same folder as the HTML,
it's just the file name.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.260
You set the type.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.380
The type is always video
slash QuickTime for movies.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.370
There are also QuickTime image
files you can use for placeholders,

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.870
but that was once needed for QuickTime.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.160
To prevent problems that came
up when certain versions of

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.960
Windows Media Player would register
themselves for the movie file type,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.310
you would say, well,
I'll pass this other file type.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.450
That's no longer a concern because
of the OBJECT tags I'll show you.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.740
This used to be really complicated
and it's gotten simpler lately,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.540
which is nice.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.230
The plug-ins page should always point
to www.applecom/quicktime/download.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.660
That's always the place to get QuickTime.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.030
So a couple of tips:
you should add 16 to the height

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.150
of your movie to allow for the
movie controller on your web page.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.840
The type is always video QuickTime.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.260
The plug-in's page is always the same.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.600
And the source is your file name .mov.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.230
Always use the .mov file extension
because that's universally

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.400
recognized as video QuickTime.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.670
And let's go ahead and show you,
if we'll switch back

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:59.320
to computer two here,
a simple embedded movie,

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.790
just to show you the syntax.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.760
What I've done here is to tell
it to autoplay and set the volume

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.520
down to 25%. There's my EMBED,
240 by 196, because it's really 180 high,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.720
so I add 16 for the controller.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.000
There's my source, type, plug-ins page,
and I can pass some other

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.050
information along to the plug-in,
which is one of the nice

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.990
features of the EMBED tag.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.670
So we can switch back to slides here.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.790
Let's have some slides.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.140
Fun with the EMBED tag.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.640
What are we going to show you here?

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.800
Okay, let's look at QT source.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.750
There are a bunch of
EMBED tag parameters,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.470
attributes you can pass to the
QuickTime plug-in to tell it

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.960
to do things with your movies.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.470
And if you look at that website
I gave you or get the book,

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.940
you'll get a full list of them all,
but I want to show you some

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.500
of the more enjoyable ones,
some of the more important ones.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.180
One is the QT source parameter.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:04.300
Use QTSource... I'm sorry,
can we switch back to computer two?

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.180
QtSource is a parameter
that tells QuickTime,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.340
even though the source file
I gave the browser was a movie

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.910
file or a QuickTime image that
caused it to call QuickTime,

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.670
I really want it to play something else.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:28.910
So here I've got an MP3 playing,
but it plays in QuickTime because

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:28.910
I gave it a source,
which is a QuickTime file.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.830
and a QT source, which was the thing
I really wanted to play.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.360
So you can pass any kind of a movie
or QuickTime file to the browser,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.100
and that will cause it to
load the QuickTime plug-in,

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.900
and then you can tell QuickTime to
play any of the many hundreds of

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.330
types of media that it can play.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.750
And this allows you to control the
plug-in and make it work with QuickTime,

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.880
even though you're playing MP3
or MP4 or something like that.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.260
Here, for example, it's similar,
play an MP4.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:03.240
And this is the same movie we
were looking at a little earlier.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:09.210
And once again,
we've set the source to a QuickTime image

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.180
and the QT source to an MP4.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.090
So now we're forcing the
browser to choose QuickTime,

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.810
then using it to play an MPEG-4.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.600
Here's yet another one.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.310
Here we're using QuickTime to play Smile.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.820
Now, probably if you have
RealPlayer installed,

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.630
it's registered to play Smile files.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.930
But we can cause QuickTime to play
it just by setting the source to a

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:44.140
QuickTime image and the QT source
to what we really want it to play.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:50.690
And I'm not going to go into
great length about Smile.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.700
But I will show you just very briefly
what the smile file looks like.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.570
It's loading a text file.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.460
And the text file is specifying an MP3.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.050
And a bunch of JPEGs.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.760
So here,
what looks like a QuickTime movie

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.410
is really a collection of JPEGs in
an MP3 pile that have been

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.290
knit together by a text file.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.500
The syntax is fairly simple.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.360
It's really easy to write a web
script that will spit these out

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.520
and generate the slideshow of
the day or the movie of the day.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.110
And it's a very lightweight file.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.290
It's only a few lines of text.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.780
It's pretty easy syntax
to learn and master.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.420
And it allows you to
basically make movies out of

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.850
media with a text processor.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.300
So that's using source and QT source.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.480
So the QT source is a wonderful
little attribute you can add.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.270
And let's switch back to slides.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.160
Now let's look at three other parameters,
href, auto-href, and target.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.140
You can set an attribute to your
QuickTime embed tag that says,

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.760
when someone clicks on the movie,
go somewhere.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.240
Activate a URL,
and that URL could be another website,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.220
it could load another
movie in place of itself,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.640
it could be JavaScript to execute.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.120
You can have a number of things happen
when somebody clicks on that movie.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.400
Auto-href tag says,
wherever I said to go when

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.340
they clicked the movie,
go there anyway.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.980
Don't wait for them to click the movie,
just happen.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.750
So as soon as QuickTime loads,
it loads the second URL.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.630
And the third one is the target.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.960
And the target lets you say
where you want this URL to load.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.280
You can load it in a frame to
load a web page in another frame.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.460
You can set the target to be myself,
meaning the QuickTime movie.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.260
So once one clicks the movie,
it turns into another movie.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.140
You can set the target
to QuickTime player,

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.020
so it launches the player application.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.960
And if we'll switch back to demos,
I'll show you that.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.530
And again,
I know I'm going through a lot of

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.150
stuff in a fairly short time here,
but it's not as complicated

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.540
as you might fear.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.080
So let's look at this.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.380
You can do a click through.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.060
We've got a movie that's
embedded in the player.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.090
And if you click on the movie,
it opens the website

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.180
where the movie came from.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:14.180
So that's just a... and it works
whether the movie is playing or not.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.130
Damn, that's a big wave.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.700
And if you look at the source,
it's nothing complicated.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.240
We set the source to the movie,
set the height and width,

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.230
turned on the controller
to make sure it's there,

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.750
give it an autoplay, and we have Ahrefs,
where you want it to go, target,

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.180
in this case, a new window.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.090
Not much to it.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.450
So you can set click-throughs
on your movies.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.520
So if you've got a movie that's
displaying a product or your service,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.270
you can click through to your website.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.080
And that'll work even if the movie
is playing in QuickTime player.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.060
Well, no, not if you put it in HTML.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.400
It's got to be in a website.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:55.400
Sorry.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.250
You can set the target to myself.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.310
In this case,
you get a poster that when you

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.680
click it turns into a movie.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.740
Now, this is nice.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.800
One of the things that you worry
about when you put movies in your

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.090
website is movies typically are large,
and somebody opens your web

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.490
page and suddenly is downloading
a 5 or 6 or 10 megabyte file,

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.400
and they're going,
I didn't sign up for this.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.800
So what you can do is create
a one-frame QuickTime movie,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.900
which is very easy to do.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.840
You just open your movie,
copy one image and save

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.420
it as a separate movie.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.500
Now, I've got a poster movie.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.800
So I can put it in my web page,
and it's only a few K,

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.770
and it's one image from the movie,
but when I click it, it runs the movie,

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.840
and because target is myself,
it just turns into a movie.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.430
And I'm going to reload this
just so you can see it again.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.220
It loads very quickly because
it's a very small image.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.510
And you'll see we've set controller
false because we don't want

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.000
people to try to play the poster.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.200
We want them to click on it.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.740
We don't want them to
think of it as a movie.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.350
We want them to think of it as an image.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.370
But we use a movie because that
way the QuickTime plug-in is

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.160
loaded to display this image.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.940
Now you're going to make sure that
your height is high enough for

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.560
the movie plus the controller.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.460
So we've got a little white space here.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.850
When I click this, if you look at it,
you'll see it just moves down about

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.420
eight pixels because it's centered
to make room for the controller.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.890
Okay, so that's a poster movie,
which is a classic

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:33.910
QuickTime technique for getting a
good experience from your browser.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.580
Okay,
let's look at setting a different target.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.350
In this case, again,
we have the same poster, same href,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.780
we set the target to
QuickTime player instead of myself,

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.160
which means when we click it,
it launches QuickTime player.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.290
And sometimes you might want to do
that because people can do things like,

00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:00.800
oh, look at the movie Double Size or
fast-forward through

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.700
Back up, because I can't quite
believe what they just saw.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.570
Did he really do that?

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:08.580
Jeez.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.180
Completely psycho.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.710
I love it.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:21.460
So those are some pretty good
things you can do with the QTSource,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.400
Ahrefs, AutoAhref, and Target.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:29.060
Now I'm going to show you one
more thing with the AutoAhref.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.910
And this one is going to be, well,
I'll show it to you first,

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.260
but you won't really see much.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.550
So here we go.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.990
Did you like that?

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.110
Let's watch that again.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.330
Oh,
Ahref means click it and it goes there.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.020
AutoAhref means just go there.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.100
So why would you want to do that?

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.920
Well, I'm going to...

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:56.680
I'll show you a different version
of that page called Redirect.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.670
Okay,
this is a different version of the page.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.370
This is the page that was loading,
but because it was an auto-HRF,

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.620
you didn't have to click it,
it just went there.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.690
Back up here.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.250
There's an href to a
page called hasQuickTime.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.700
And if you have QuickTime,
because it's auto href,

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.350
it just goes there.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.700
Well, what if you don't have QuickTime?

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.600
Here's a tag.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.690
This is standard HTML.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.900
This isn't QuickTime.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.770
This is meta HTTP.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.140
content, set a URL and a timeout,
and if nobody does anything

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.330
before the timeout,
it goes to another page.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.120
And I'll go back there again.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:51.220
In this case, if you have QuickTime,
it's going to take you to hasQt.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:51.220
If you don't have QuickTime,
it's going to take you to getQt.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.400
And you just have to
wait for the timeout,

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.980
and you can set that timeout
to whatever you need.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.780
So, is that making sense to people?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.170
Okay, good.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.710
Because sometimes it's a little
hard to wrap your head around

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.860
the fact that you're using
QuickTime to detect QuickTime.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.260
But if it has QuickTime,
it'll go to one page.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.990
If it doesn't,
it'll time out and go to the other.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.760
And that lets you provide an
experience to your users and say,

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.740
well, if they don't have QuickTime,
I want to explain why they

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.500
should get it and that it's okay.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.600
And if they don't,
if they have QuickTime,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.350
I want to go immediately
to a media-intensive page.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.860
Or you might even have two
different versions of your site,

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.690
one that is media-rich
and one that's just,

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.660
you know, JPEGs and text,
if you don't want to

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.900
ask people to download.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.360
The way we set it up, though, nowadays,
it's pretty good at getting people

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.620
to download QuickTime automatically.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:45.430
Okay, let's go back to slides here.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.660
Cover that.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.720
Another tag I want to
show you is the e-tag.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.100
And the e-tag allows you to pass
additional parameters to the plug-in.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.230
One of the things about your HTML is
you're setting up these attributes to

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.380
talk to the QuickTime plug-in and say,
well, I want to do this.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:03.940
I want to do that.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.800
I want to do the other thing.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.480
Make it autoplay.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.410
Give me no controller.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.340
Do it in such and such a size
and such and such a volume.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.440
Then you click the HREF and it brings
up another movie in place of itself.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.520
Now how do you give
instructions to that movie?

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.000
You've already put one set in your HTML.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.410
You can't say,
I want you to have a controller,

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.540
but I want the movie
that replaces you not to.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.990
Or I want you at 50% volume,
but I want the replacement

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.860
to be at 75% or double scale.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.830
So what you do is you use the e-tag.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:37.100
And the syntax I think I'm going
to show you on the demo machine.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.320
So if we go back to computer two,
I'll bring up-- if we can

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.440
switch to computer two.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.210
Here we go.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.500
Here we go.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.500
And here, it's very simple.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.110
I'm going to click the poster,
but the href is to JAWS, WAVES, MOVIE,

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:59.580
TARGET, MYSELF, E, the extensions,
autoplay false, volume equals 25.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.310
So when I click this,
it doesn't autoplay the next movie,

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.440
and when I play it,
the volume will be lower.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.870
It's down to 25%. It's just an example
of some parameters you can pass along.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.810
The syntax is a little tricky.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.240
You put everything in quotes,
put the URL in angle brackets.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.660
This T here, this is optional.

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.310
You could have said target equals myself.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.140
It's just a different
way to do the same thing.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.840
But the key there is put E and
then any parameters you want to

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.620
pass between those angle brackets,
close the whole thing

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.840
up with quotes again.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.620
It's fussy syntax,
but it's a really handy tool,

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.830
and once you get used to it,
it's not hard at all to do.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:41.340
Okay, so let's go back to slides.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.480
Let me just stop here.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.320
Is everybody following this?

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.980
Do we have questions?

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.980
We're doing good here?

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.750
Okay, great.

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:56.280
So let's look at some other parameters.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.620
I'm not going to do demos of all these,
but I just want to mention

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.460
them to you because it's nice
to know that they're there.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.290
There's a QtNext attribute that
says when this movie is done,

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:04.460
play another movie.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.560
So you can play a series of movies.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:11.560
There's an autoplay to make the movie
start automatically when the page loads.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.890
Controller, which you saw,
you can have the controller

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.080
present or not present,
depending on what you want.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.970
Set the volume.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.440
Set the scale.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.580
I think I will show you one
with scale in just a moment.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.730
You can set it to loop,
so you can set the movie

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.310
to continuously repeat.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.620
And if it's a virtual reality movie,
you can set the field of view,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.370
the original angle, the pan angle,
the tilt.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.570
And you can set hotspots,
so when people click on

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.270
different parts of the panorama,
you can specify in

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.300
your HTML what happens.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.340
That's a really,
really powerful technique.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.520
I don't think I have anything
that I want to show you from that.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.390
Yeah, let's switch back to demo.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.620
And I will show you one thing.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.000
This is scale.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.600
Now, this is the same movie at the same
bandwidth as we were playing before.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.200
It's just bigger,
which means it's a little blurry

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.170
because it's not that high resolution,
but sometimes it's worth

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:07.600
it to get the extra impact.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.900
And the syntax is, again, fairly simple.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.260
I'm just saying autoplay equals true,
scale equals two.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.800
Play it at double size.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.460
Those are big ways, aren't they?

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.300
Okay,
well that's it for the EMBED tag for now.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.430
Let's go back to slides.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.870
Let's talk about the OBJECT tag.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.460
Now,
some of you may know the OBJECT tag is

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:42.830
a World Wide Web Consortium standard,
which the EMBED tag is not.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.380
However,
the OBJECT tag works differently in

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:53.050
Internet Explorer for Windows 5.5
and later than it does anywhere else.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.660
So, as a standard,
it's kind of a weak standard.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.290
If you use just the OBJECT tag,
you won't get the same behavior

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.890
from the different browsers.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.400
So, why would you use it?

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.080
Well, the main reason is because
Internet Explorer for

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.370
Windows 5.5 plus and later,
as SP released too, I think,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.770
stopped supporting the plug-ins
page attribute of the EMBED tag.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.720
It still supports the EMBED tag.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.070
If you have QuickTime installed
and use the EMBED tag,

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.270
it will play in
Internet Explorer for Windows.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.010
But if they don't have QuickTime,
it won't look at the plug-ins page

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.890
because they use ActiveX controls,
not plug-ins,

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.130
and there's no ActiveX parameter.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:34.630
So, what happens then is that if they
don't have QuickTime and they're

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.970
using Internet Explorer for Windows,
they come to your site,

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.780
they don't get a helpful
message of what to do.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.800
They just get a broken icon.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.730
And you certainly don't want that.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.340
But it's pretty nice because
the OBJECT tag lets you

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.540
specify an ActiveX control,
so you're no longer dependent

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:56.490
on the browser having somebody
registered for the movie file type.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.820
You're going to say, look,
I want the QuickTime ActiveX and

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.120
only the QuickTime ActiveX.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.710
And if it's not installed,
Internet Explorer will say, hey,

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.510
you need this control.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.830
Would you like to get it?

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.990
And it'll go and get it
from Apple's website.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:15.160
So, it's pretty friendly and it's very,
very simple.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.700
And the syntax is like this.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.050
You set the height and width just
as you would with the EMBED tag.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.250
You set a class ID,
which is an incredibly long,

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.640
complicated number that you want to
cut and paste and never type twice.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.200
You can copy it from our website.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.460
You can copy it from the text
files on the book or from

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.320
anybody's website who embeds this.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.480
The code base tells them where
to get the ActiveX control,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.890
and the user doesn't
actually go and get it.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.080
Internet Explorer gets it for them.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.420
What's different is
you have these params.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.830
A param has a name and a value.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.770
So instead of just saying
source equals my movie,

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.240
you say param name equals source,
value equals my movie,

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.950
and close the OBJECT tag.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.980
And again, you add 16 to the height
for the movie controller.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.140
The class ID and code base never change.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.840
It's a cut-and-paste thing.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.080
All the parameters apart from
that are in separate param tags.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.110
And this works only in
Internet Explorer for Windows.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.030
Well, actually,
that's not 5+. This will work

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.460
with almost any version of
Internet Explorer for Windows.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.940
So, what do you do for everybody?

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.950
It's a nightmare.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.630
There it is.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:26.330
This is as bad as it gets.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:30.890
You set up your OBJECT tag and you
put the EMBED tag inside of it.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.500
And what happens is Internet Explorer for
Windows sees the class ID and

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.170
code base and works with that.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.410
Everybody else sees
those things and says,

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.130
those aren't part of
the worldwide standard.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.400
I don't know what those are.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.220
I'm ignoring this.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.320
And then they fall through
and use the EMBED tag.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.580
Rhonda Straatton, Steven Gulie So,
this syntax works universally.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:53.700
If they have
Internet Explorer for Windows,

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.190
it's going to see if they
have the QuickTime plug-in,

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.260
ActiveX control.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.390
If they don't,
it'll offer to get it for them.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.520
If they do,
it'll just use it to play this movie

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:07.560
and it will pass these parameters
on to the QuickTime ActiveX control.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:13.690
For anybody else, Netscape browsers,
Safari, Internet Explorer for Macintosh,

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:18.770
they'll see the EMBED tag,
width and height, source, the type,

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.960
and if they don't have QuickTime,
where to go and get it.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.090
And the browser will offer
to go and get it for you.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.740
Now, one thing that's critical here
is this little business here.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:33.370
Ordinarily, when you close an EMBED tag,
you can just use a right angle bracket.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.560
But if it's inside of an OBJECT tag,
you have to be closing

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.960
with a slash angle,
more like XML.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.290
Otherwise, bad things will happen.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360
Let's see.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360
Where are we?

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360
Male #1:

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:04.450
Okay, the quote at the end of that,
that is a typo.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.550
Yep.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.240
No need for that.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.510
Sorry.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.900
If you're looking at this, uh...

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.100
Oh, that's right.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.280
It got moved.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.290
I should have inserted it after
the quote and I inserted it before.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.540
So if you try to run this exact syntax,
it won't run.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.470
Fortunately, I debugged the version
I actually put in a movie.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.200
So let's switch over to demo again,
computer 2,

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:39.290
and look at it working properly.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.480
And here it is,
the whole thing actually working.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.790
And as you can see,
it acts just like the EMBED tag alone.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:51.230
It's just wrapped in
all this other stuff.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.530
And this one is closed properly,
where your type and

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.950
plug-ins page are set.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.330
So it really does work.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:05.810
Now, the question is,
if we go back to slides,

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.960
Why do this?

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.970
Well, to make it work in all browsers and
give the people good experience.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:18.120
Now, the other question is,
is there any way to simplify this?

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.450
Do you really have to
type all that stuff in?

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.710
And the answer, fortunately, is no.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.800
You can simplify it nicely.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:27.200
If you go to www.qtbridge.com,
there's a free tool called Pagio.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.070
It's free, it's French, it's great,
and it's got lots of new features,

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.920
and it will go ahead and
make your tags for you.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.650
You just tell it what you want
to do and check off the boxes,

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:41.660
and it'll spit that right
into your web page for you.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:46.580
Another is a little 1995
utility from Qtilities,

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.610
www.qtilities.com.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:49.850
David there is great.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.290
He makes lots of little
widgets for QuickTime,

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.060
and one thing he's got is a
batch converter so that if

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.800
you've written EMBED tags,
now you say, oh, no,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.220
I have to surround my
EMBED tags with OBJECT tags,

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.190
it'll rip through and replace all
your EMBED tags with EMBED tags

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.780
wrapped automatically with
correctly formatted OBJECT tags.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.310
So you just do the EMBED,
and it'll do the rest.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.540
Another possibility is GoLive.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.700
If you use that, you know,
upgrade to a recent version,

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.610
it'll spit all this stuff into
your web page automatically.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.310
You just drag the
QuickTime image onto your page,

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.030
and the rest is done.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.640
So you don't have to type it all by hand.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.480
Thank goodness.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.520
Okay, so let's look a little bit more
at launching QuickTime Player.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.170
You saw that you used that by using
the target attribute and the href.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.480
So we've looked at the poster movie.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.650
I don't think we're
going to do that again.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:39.240
We've seen that.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.700
Well, let's look at a skinned movie.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.890
Yeah.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:49.690
The poster movie,
just to make another point, well,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.190
you saw this.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.150
It can be a web page,
it can be another movie that

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.040
loads a QuickTime player,
replaces itself.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.490
What I haven't shown you is
loading a JavaScript function,

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:00.540
and I'm not going to show you that today,
but inside your href you can

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.940
have a line of JavaScript codes.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.120
When someone clicks the movie,
it activates a line of JavaScript.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.910
And you can auto-href it so
that it automatically executes

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:11.980
JavaScript when the movie loads to
open another window to do any of

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.740
the things you'd like to do with

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:20.040
And the only key is to make
the target QuickTime player

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.860
and some kind of an href.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:22.900
Href means click me.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.730
If you add auto href equals true,
it happens automatically.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.480
Now let's look at a skinned movie.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:37.160
Skins are really different than
media skins for other players.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.040
And the reason is a QuickTime media
skin is not something a consumer

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.610
puts on their player to make it
look cool while it plays your movie.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.680
A QuickTime media skin
is something that comes,

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:48.740
it's part of your movie.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.090
It's a customized player
that travels with your movie.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:56.150
So that your movie doesn't
play in QuickTime player,

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.980
it plays in a customized
version of QuickTime player.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.410
And this can be really,
really nice for brand marketing,

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:04.460
brand identification.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.960
Let's go over to the demo machine.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:08.890
And let me bring one up here.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.340
Here's a standard poster movie.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.200
You're going to click it,
it's going to launch a

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.240
QuickTime movie in QuickTime Player,
target equals QuickTime Player,

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.630
but it's a skinned movie.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:26.660
So, it's got a custom window shape,
it's got custom controls,

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.700
Little sprites in it to do things.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.920
Directional sound.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:38.500
Go places inside of it.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:42.160
And it's got, let's see,
I think it's got a full screen button.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:43.600
Which is cool.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:47.230
Now, I don't know quite what the point is
to having a skin player in full-screen

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.500
mode because you can't drag it around.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.500
But it's, let's see.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:59.490
Go places inside of it.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:04.990
I don't think it has a
volume controller though,

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.580
which is why I'm going
to shut it off now.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.140
But the point is you can create
a player that has your logo,

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.260
that has your shape,
that has the controls you specify.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.370
You're not stuck with
QuickTime players look.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.640
And with the media player,
that can be really important.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.160
If your media player is supported by
ad revenue and is looking at keywords,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.820
the last thing you want to do
is have your movie playing in a

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.250
player that's been skinned with
somebody else's advertisements.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.560
You need a direct competitor.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.860
So these are really nice,
especially if you want people to

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.580
pass around and share your movies.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.580
Let them do it with a click-through
to your website in your logo.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.480
You don't have to do it our way.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.360
We can do it your way.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.850
So those are skins,
and that's one good reason

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:49.780
to launch QuickTime Player,
because you can launch a skinned movie.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.300
Another good reason to
launch QuickTime Player is

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.710
for full-screen movies.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:57.650
But let me switch back to
slides just for a second here.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:01.970
Make sure that I'm not skipping
something I wanted to show you.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.760
Okay, full-screen movie.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.360
Why use full-screen movies?

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.270
Obviously,
they give a more cinematic experience.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.400
You use the whole screen,
not just a little part of the browser.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.620
It's not surrounded
by the browser window,

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:16.700
no distractions.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.060
When you're doing that,
you want to use high-quality source.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.380
If you use a little movie and you
blow it up to the full screen,

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.910
it's going to look pretty grainy.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:26.520
I don't have any of the new great
H.264 stuff in my demo here,

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:30.160
so it's going to be a little bit
cloudier than I'd like it to be.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.320
But there's two methods, basically,
to launch full-screen movies.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.580
One is to use a movie that has the
full-screen characteristic built in.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.780
You can launch into it.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.290
And the other is to use what's
called a QuickTime media

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.540
link file to tell the player,
launch this movie,

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.750
even though it's not a full-screen movie,
launch it into full-screen mode.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:48.260
And I'll show you both
those methods here.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.950
The full-screen mode,
when you're using full-screen movies,

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.860
how do you set the full-screen
characteristic of a movie?

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.440
Well, you can use an Apple script.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.960
There's a little droplet on
the Apple website that will set

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.460
that characteristic of a movie.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.470
It's just a little atom
in the movie that says,

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:06.580
to QuickTime player, when you play this,
play it in full-screen mode.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.230
mode.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.600
You can set it with application like
Cleaner or Live Stage or Go Live.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.360
There's just a checkbox that says, "Yes,
this is a full-screen movie."

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.820
And another way to do it is
to add a full-screen widget.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:22.760
And I think I'll actually go to the demo
screen and just show you how to do that,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.980
because I think we're
doing good for time here.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:33.650
So let me open a new browser
window and go to -- this is

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:37.700
the website for the book,
by the way, which is a useful resource.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.100
Homepage.mac.com QT4Web.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.230
And there's an ugly guy there,
but don't worry about him.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.630
He won't hurt you.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.010
Go to the useful items page here,
and there's a bunch of downloadable

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:06.460
widgets that you can use to make
your movies go full screen or stop,

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.780
and automatic controllers,
all kinds of fun stuff.

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:12.090
So let me--

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:20.000
[Transcript missing]

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.910
Okay,
so what you do if you want to make a

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:29.030
movie go full screen and you've got
my little full screen movie widget is

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:40.790
open the movie that you want to play,
select all, copy, close, open the widget,

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.790
add,

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.230
And now, save.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:51.340
And I believe that we
now have a full screen.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.110
If we play it.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.440
Yeah, I think I missed a step.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.380
Sorry.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.930
Okay.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.310
Oh, I saved it as the full-screen movie.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.480
Right, right, right, right.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.140
Right you are.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.140
And it's just a movie that
automatically launches into

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.300
full-screen mode when it comes.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.620
Now,
one thing I should point out that isn't

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.300
in the--so there's really not much to it.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.420
It's really easy to make any movie
into a full-time--full-screen movie.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.980
And then when you link to it,
it will just play in full screen.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.760
So let's go ahead and bring one up here.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.620
Click the poster and it
launches a full-screen movie.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:43.580
And again, there's nothing to it.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.950
It's just a standard href
and target QuickTime player,

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.690
but the movie itself has been
given a full-screen widget,

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:53.070
so it launches in full-screen mode.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:53.080
And--

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.760
It makes the most of these
high-resolution images.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:04.070
Now, one thing that can happen when you
launch full-screen movies that you

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:09.020
don't want to have happen is if the
movie is downloading as it plays,

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.740
sometimes when a movie
starts to download,

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:14.490
the data comes in very quickly,
and then it hits something,

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:17.240
kind of a big chunk of data,
and it slows down.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.180
So it starts to play,
it goes into full-screen mode,

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.660
then it runs out of data and it stops
and it falls out of full-screen mode.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.450
And that's a jarring experience.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.040
You don't want to have it do that.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.830
So what you do to prevent that
is you take a JPEG or a GIF,

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.890
you know, one pixel,
just a tiny little image,

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.740
and give it about a three-second
duration in QuickTime Player Pro,

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.650
and just paste that onto
the front of your movie.

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:42.100
So you've got -- it says "Movie
title" or something like that,

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.910
so you have low data
rate for a few seconds,

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.340
and it'll buffer up ahead,
and then you won't have that experience.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.010
That dropout will go away.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.240
Okay.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:52:01.120
So that's regardless of how
you--let's go back to slides.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.460
Regardless of how you do it,
that's all there is to making a

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.280
full-screen movie link up as a movie,
but what if you don't want to

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.360
change the movie to full-screen?

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.640
What if you want to play something
at full-screen resolution

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.960
without altering the movie?

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.090
You want to just change your HTML.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.400
Maybe your HTML pages are
generated automatically,

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.340
your movies come from an outside source,
you don't want to go through

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.700
that production process of
adding a widget to a movie,

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.790
you just want to say, hey,
play this movie in full-screen mode.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.240
We have something called the
QuickTime Media Link File.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.290
It's a little XML file.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:32.210
You can generate it from a script.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:33.690
It's a little bit of text.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:34.830
It uses XML syntax.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:38.100
It uses the QTL file extension
or the MOV file extension.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.460
You can tell the world
this is a QuickTime movie,

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:43.010
and when QuickTime opens it
and sees it's an XML file,

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.590
it'll do the right thing.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:45.560
You can create it.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.170
Oh, it's really nice.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:50.610
If you open up QuickTime Player,
just open a movie in QuickTime Player to

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.940
create it and say export,
one of your choices is QTML file.

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.900
And it brings up a nice little
dialogue with click boxes and you

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.680
can say what you want to do with it.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.230
And I'll show you that in a moment.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:05.690
So the syntax,
if you're doing it yourself, is...

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:07.400
Set the XML version to one?

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:09.320
Yes, yes.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.560
QuickTime type, application QuickTime,
media link.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.620
Then it's basically your embed syntax.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:19.120
You only have the option of
setting full screen equals full,

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.190
which you can't do in the
browser because browsers can't,

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:26.160
you can't launch something full
screen inside of a browser window.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.070
You're telling the browser how much
height and width to give to the plug-in.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.390
The plug-in can't use
more space than that,

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:32.920
but the application can.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.120
So you can have full screen
equals full or half or normal,

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.060
you know, the standard settings for any
QuickTime player of setting a

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.960
movie to play on full screen.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.190
So it can scale it up to fill
the screen or it can play at a

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.920
normal size on a black background.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:48.570
Uh...

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:52.660
In this case, I said an Ahrefs,
but you don't have to.

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.690
No, actually, in this case--

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.960
Oh, yeah, okay,
that's just to give it a click-through.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.180
And the source.

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:01.520
Now, the source is a little tricky.

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:04.100
When you load a QTL file,

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:09.290
The browser doesn't necessarily
tell QuickTime where it came from.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:11.630
The browser loads this file
and hands it over to QuickTime.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:16.310
And so you may not know,
you don't want to use typically

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:17.970
relative URLs in a QTL file.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:19.330
You want to use the absolute URL.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:20.450
That's a safe way to go.

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:23.970
You can use relative URLs on a website,
but you can't really reliably

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.180
use them from a disk.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.250
And I've got a disk-based
presentation here,

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:28.020
so I'm using it.

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.690
I'm going to pull something in
off the web to show you this.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.800
So let's go ahead back
to the demo machine.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:38.430
And I'll show you a full-screen
movie that uses a QTML file.

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:42.290
In this case, I've got a poster movie,
just like always.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.060
When I click it,
it's going to load a QTML file.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:46.950
Ahrefs is full sample QTL.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.840
And that was a little
movie on my website that's,

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.660
you know, a tiny movie that's not meant
to be blown into full size,

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.700
but obviously it plays full size.

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.360
And here's the XML file itself.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.270
The obligatory header that
lets it know what's going on.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.340
The URL.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.290
Full screen full, autoplay true,
quit when done true.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.700
I don't know if you noticed that,
but after it played,

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.110
it didn't hang around
in QuickTime Player.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.380
It went full screen, it played,
and then it just quit

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:20.990
QuickTime Player and came back.

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:22.770
I'll show you again.

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.740
And that's a really nice effect
to be able to put in your website.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.440
Okay, any questions so far?

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.690
How are we doing?

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.080
All right.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.240
Go back to slides, please.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:54.490
If there's anything here I haven't
covered that I wanted to tell you.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.360
Ah, if you're launching from a text link,
I showed you launching from a poster.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.980
So basically you had a QuickTime movie.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:08.370
When you clicked the movie,
you told QuickTime the

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:08.430
href was a QTL file.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.430
If you just put a QTL file

00:56:08.700 --> 00:57:02.700
[Transcript missing]

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:09.840
This is a nearly full-screen movie.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.900
Sometimes you don't want to
launch QuickTime players.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.940
You say, "I want to just fill the screen,
but I want to stay in a browser window.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.300
Can I do that?" It's nice.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.380
There's been some additions
to JavaScript in recent years.

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.500
You have a self-resize command.

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:31.300
which is here, to screen width,
window screen available height.

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:34.120
If you try to do it to window height,
it won't work because there's

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.700
some overhead that they need.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.580
You need to use the available height.

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:41.520
But if you use the syntax and
then move the window to 0,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.770
0 to begin with,
it'll move there and resize itself.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.540
Now, to do this,
you really ought to launch the window

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:51.330
itself in JavaScript because it
launches the window and then resizes it.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.060
If you do it otherwise,
let's go back to the demo machine here.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:58:00.500
And here's a nearly full screen.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.820
Oh, no, that's the other one, sorry.

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:04.000
Nearly full screen mode.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.500
Here we go, almost full.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.300
It's not really there.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.460
Let me reload it.

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:11.390
That's what it's supposed to do.

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:14.900
So when it loads and then reloads,
it goes to full screen,

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.860
and it just scales the movie up with it.

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:18.370
And it works pretty well.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.060
You're still in a browser window.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.860
You've still got all the usual
assortment of things here.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.280
It really is the same window.

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.520
It's just caused it to
scroll up to full size.

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.010
And that's a nice trick
they use on Panorama's DK,

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:32.680
which I'm going to go back to
now just to show you what it

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.750
looks like when it's done right.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.420
Let's look at their screen of the week.

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:48.100
You see it opens it in
JavaScript and resizes.

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:51.960
Now this,
did you see that blur for a moment there?

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.830
That's a preview.

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.910
It's a blurry quick time preview for VR.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.190
If you're in a slow connection,
you can be looking at that

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.130
black grid for a long time.

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:06.620
So it's nice to give people a little
preview so they can manipulate

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.090
around and see what's going on.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:10.710
The bad thing about the
preview is sometimes people,

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.260
if they're looking at it for a long time,
think that you've just got

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:14.800
a really blurry panorama.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:19.340
So it's good to add a little text to your
preview image that says loading image.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.500
And I'll show you that
in just a minute here,

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.210
because I think we're
doing good here for time.

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.000
OK.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:30.890
How are we doing for questions?

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:31.810
Are we okay?

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:32.620
Yes, take one.

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:39.340
Yeah, the question is, did it just use
JavaScript to launch that?

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.570
And the answer is yes.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.090
When I clicked on that link,
it executed an onClick

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:47.320
JavaScript function
that's just new window,

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:54.530
and then inside that new window
was the syntax that I showed you.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:08.070
If we go back to slides, the syntax here,
inside that window was a little

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:11.410
JavaScript to move itself
to zero and resize it to the

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.980
available screen height and width.

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:19.290
So, you know, get a JavaScript book and
learn how to make a click,

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.020
launch a window.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.100
It's pretty easy to do.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.560
And then the window will resize itself.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.380
And that's a really nice trick.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.570
And you can just scale the movie to fit,
height and width to

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:32.020
100% and scale to fit,
and it'll work.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:37.560
So, no slide.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.690
Okay, let's...

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.880
Oh, MPEG-4, yeah.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:49.650
Now, we talked about this before.

01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:51.500
I showed you a couple MPEG-4 players.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.130
I showed you MPEG-4 playing in QuickTime,
but there's two ways to use MPEG-4 media

01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:00.240
in QuickTime and one way not to use it.

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.350
The main and obvious way is to put
MPEG-4 encoded video and MPEG-4

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:07.670
AAC audio inside your QuickTime movie.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.130
You can use those compressors,
play them inside of QuickTime.

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:12.720
It's a standard QuickTime movie.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.810
It just uses the codecs from MPEG-4.

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:15.790
And that works great.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.290
There's no problem with that.

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:20.800
The other way is to use
actual MPEG-4 files.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.260
In that case,
you open up your QuickTime movie in

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.770
QuickTime player and export to MPEG-4.

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.790
And you'll have some options to set for,
you know,

01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:30.950
how you want to pass the bandwidth.

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.950
That'll save it as an MP4 file.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:37.130
Now, there's an advantage to using MP4,
which is that it's an

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.640
interoperable file type.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.690
There are MP4 players for
lots of different platforms.

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:44.020
If you want to play it on Linux and
there's no QuickTime for Linux,

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.470
you can save it as MP4.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.120
There are MPEG-4 players on Linux.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.710
If you want to say, look,
I don't care if they have

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:52.080
real or QuickTime or what,
as long as they have some

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.900
kind of MPEG-4 player,
I want it to play.

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:56.810
So I'll just send it out in MPEG-4 and
whoever's registered for it gets it.

01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:59.290
Now, you have less control that way,
but that's another reason

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.760
you might want to do it.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.100
What you absolutely do not want
to do is to save it as an MPEG-4

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.130
file and change the suffix to MOV.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.840
People do that all the time.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.360
Well, okay, I exported it as MPEG-4.

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:12.050
I want it to play in QuickTime,
so I'll change the file suffix to movie.

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.540
So, you can save it as a MPEG-4 file,
but you don't want to

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.220
do it as a movie file.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.090
You want it to play as a movie file.

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:15.460
You don't want to do it as a movie file.

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:16.110
So, I'll change the file suffix to movie.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.330
QuickTime says, oh, it's a movie,
and it starts to open it,

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.540
and the MPEG-4 file specification is
based on the QuickTime file specs,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.610
so they look very similar inside,
but there are details that are different,

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.850
and you do not want to try to
fool QuickTime into thinking

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:32.920
an MPEG-4 file is a movie file
because it won't play properly.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.080
Bad things will happen.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.500
But it is a nice thing to use as itself.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.630
So either put the media
in a QuickTime movie or

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.340
save it as an MP4 file.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.290
And again,
if you want to play an MPEG-4 file,

01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:45.950
come back to Demo here.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.600
You want to save it as MPEG-4,
but you want to make sure

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.480
it plays in QuickTime.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:57.330
It's pretty easy to do.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.420
I'm using it.

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:03.040
Whatever your source is,
in this case it's a QuickTime image,

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:05.510
it could be a movie,
it doesn't get displayed.

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:09.050
The browser looks at it and goes, "Oh,
it's a QuickTime media,

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:12.520
so call the QuickTime player."
QuickTime says,

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.180
"Well, it's not a QuickTime

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:15.290
Yeah, there's a source,
but there's also a QT source,

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.400
so I'll play what's in
QT source and ignore what the

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:18.670
browser hands me as source.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.290
But make that a small file,
because the browser will download it.

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:25.040
You don't want to have a 25
megabyte movie as your placeholder.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.780
You want to have an 8 kilobyte image.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:33.220
But as you can see, if you do this,
I've got an MPEG-4 player

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.080
here called Pacific.mp4,
and it comes up in QuickTime,

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.280
not anything else,
and that'll work that way

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.070
in Internet Explorer on
Windows or anything else.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.980
Okay.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.980
We're racing through this.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:54.300
So I've got-- I'd like to show
you some practical things.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.900
Well, let me go back to slides here and
make sure I'm where I think I am.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.800
If we could go back to slides.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.280
Thank you.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.190
Okay, there's the points I just hit on.

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:14.620
Okay, and we're on the last part of it.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.570
I want to show you some things about
optimizing QuickTime VR for the web

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:23.180
because it's non-obvious and it's a good
way to give some people...it's useful

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:25.960
tips for QuickTime movies in general.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:32.310
So if we come back to
the demo machine here,

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:32.310
I will...

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:36.850
OK.

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:40.080
One of the reasons we call a
fast start movie a fast start

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.940
movie is because the movie part,
there's a header in the file that

01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:46.430
tells QuickTime how to play the data.

01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:51.010
If the data comes before that header,
you have to wait until it all gets there

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:53.100
before you know what to do with it.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.580
But if the header comes first,
then QuickTime knows what

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.710
to do with it immediately.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.400
If you have some old,
if you ever clicked on a website that has

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.350
like a QuickTime movie or a QuickTime VR,
and you see a blue

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:08.160
queue or a white space,
and you're waiting and waiting and

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.100
waiting for something to happen.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.620
Actually, there's a good example of
that on Apple's website.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:18.550
Let's go to the...

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:21.490
Are we still on slides?

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:24.020
OK, thanks.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.500
This is a VR website.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:29.490
And see, this is kind of large.

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.260
See, there's nothing here.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.800
We're waiting for the file to download,
but we don't see anything

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:36.200
until it downloads.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.900
And it wasn't too long,
because we have a fast connection.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.940
If we had a slow connection,
it would have been quite a bit longer.

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.460
Slow this down.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.030
It's neat.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.860
This is a nice way to show,
this is yet another piece

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.760
of QuickTime technology.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.860
This is called a QuickTime Object VR.

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:53.070
So if you have things for sale
or you have museum artifacts that

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:56.240
people would like to handle and
you'd like to let them handle it,

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.960
but you can still zoom in,
look more closely at things.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.500
This is a nice way to show objects,
products, artifacts on the web.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.070
But you want to have it fast start.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.980
And the way you make a movie
fast start is you open it in

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:14.100
QuickTime Player and you just do a save
as or a save and make it self-contained.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.190
And that will automatically
make it fast start.

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:18.720
So most movies are
automatically fast start,

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.080
but some of the older applications,
like the one that turned

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.650
out that Object VR,
don't make fast start movies.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.860
So just open it in QuickTime Player and
export it or save as,

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.620
self-contained,
and it will take care of itself.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.750
So that's a...

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.130
Okay.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.480
Let me just show you how to do that.

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:41.720
Open a movie,
and it happens to be a slow start movie.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.510
You just go to File, Save As.

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:52.540
Give it a new name, save it.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.540
I did that wrong.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:55.540
Let me show you again.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.860
I screwed it up.

01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:00.060
It's simple and I still screwed it up.

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:03.080
Seyvaz,
set it to make movies self-contained.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.610
If you allow dependencies,
you've created a little movie that

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:07.870
points to the movie you were opening.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And the Make It Self-Contained movie.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.530
Now, that is always a fast start movie.

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:22.460
But you can do better than that,
especially if you have panoramas.

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:29.440
You can export a panorama from
QuickTime Player using the Export menu.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:34.860
And one of your choices is Movie to
Fast Start QuickTime VR Movie.

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:39.680
That seems explicit.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:39.680
And

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:49.800
What this does, among other things,
is not only make it a fast start movie,

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:49.800
but it also

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:51.780
Here's an options button here.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.500
It allows you to create a preview,
that little blurry preview,

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.780
and you can set it to be a quarter
or half the size and blurry.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:02.170
You set your quality for
what kind of compression you

01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:06.220
want to use for the image,
and it'll go through the panorama and

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.330
actually create a preview image of it,
compress the way you want

01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:12.060
and the size you want.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.320
You want to make it fairly small
because you want it to load up early,

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:19.420
and that lets people manipulate and look
around in the VR while it downloads.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.850
And I think I can load this from
a website that's hopefully slow

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:24.730
enough that you'll actually see this.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.680
Let's go to...

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:56.700
Test... and let's see which
one I want to use here.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:56.700
That's okay.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:56.700
Anapanofast.

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:11.590
Okay, so we're going to load a
VR panorama from what's

01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:13.990
traditionally a pretty slow website.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.200
Seem to have misspelled something here.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:31.370
Oh, it's a movie.

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:42.970
Okay, well, we're out of luck.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.270
It's a fast connection today.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.820
It downloaded,
and what you would have seen,

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.480
had it been a slow download,
was you would have seen a black matrix

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.120
because there's no preview in this image.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.880
Let's try with the preview.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.380
I think if it's going to be this fast,
though, we're going to be out of luck.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.920
Let's try PRE1.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:12.000
[Transcript missing]

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.250
So the one thing you can do is to
go ahead and load a preview image,

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:16.600
have it generate a preview image.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.140
You can also have it
load a preview image.

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:22.740
So you can take the panoramic
image and bring it into Photoshop,

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:28.570
recompress it, blur it, make it small,
and add text to it that

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:30.780
says image loading.

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:30.780
And unfortunately,

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:33.410
Because this is so... Well, actually,
let's go back.

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:35.240
Let's try doing this the other way.

01:10:42.090 --> 01:10:44.920
Usually the problem with the
web is not that it's too fast.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:50.380
Okay,
let's look at the high-resolution image.

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:53.400
Okay, you probably only saw it
for a fraction of a second.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.470
There was a blurred preview and
there was text on it that said,

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:59.400
you know, image loading,
so that people would understand

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.790
that this is not the only
thing you're going to see,

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.020
that it will eventually come through.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:11.570
And as you can also see,
it's got an auto-rotate sprite in it.

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.570
And this is really nice
because when you load a...

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:13.600
There you go.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.730
When you load a panorama,
a lot of people think they're

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:16.460
looking at a still image.

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:18.150
They don't realize it's something
they can move around in.

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:21.020
So you put an auto-rotate sprite in it,
and it lets them realize that

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.400
there's something to be done here.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.300
and the other two are going to
be talking about the And again,

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:26.300
you can get free sprites on the web.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.300
Adding a widget is
pretty straightforward.

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:35.040
And all you do is open the widget
and add it to your -- Well,

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.300
actually, adding things to a
panorama is tricky enough.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.300
Let me go ahead and
show you how to do that.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:42.790
Let me open this panorama.

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:48.860
Okay, here I've got a panorama in.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.400
Let's go ahead and dismiss this.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.430
To edit things in QuickTime Player,
a panorama, you have to do something

01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:56.640
that's a little bit tricky.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.740
You have to set the movie properties.

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:02.080
The editing feature is part
of the movie controller,

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:07.030
and the VR controller doesn't allow you
to edit because it's not time-based.

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:11.650
So if you go to the movie controller,
suddenly your editing features

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:15.050
are enabled and you can
copy and add things to it.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:22.130
So now if I go here and get
to my auto-rotate sprite.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.760
And this is the process you
would go through normally.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:38.100
Okay, here's a loop sprite.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.580
Where is an auto-rotate sprite?

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:41.660
Here we go.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:52.820
Rotate Sprite, I'll just control-click it
and download it to my desktop.

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:06.970
I'm going to be there somewhere.

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:06.970
Let's go to... There's my desktop.

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:10.840
Okay.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.500
Here's my little auto-rotate sprite.

01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:19.200
And again, I select all, copy,
and close it because

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.380
I don't need it anymore.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.960
Then I go to the movie that I want,
and here I select all again.

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:33.150
And I'm just going to add
the widget to the movie.

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:36.110
So edit, add.

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.100
Let's undo that.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.240
Go back to the beginning.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.430
Let's try select none and add.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.100
Okay.

01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:56.220
Oh, I think the widget has a longer
duration than the VR Pranarama,

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:57.220
but that doesn't really matter.

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:05.060
So if we set the controller
back to the VR controller...

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.090
That should now be an auto-start movie.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.800
So let's -- there we go.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.260
There's really nothing to it.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.300
One of the nice things about
QuickTime is this ability to add

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:23.480
sprites and widgets and effects.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.150
You take something that's static
and you add a widget to it,

01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:28.540
and suddenly it does neat things.

01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:32.850
So this way you can create a VR panorama
that gives a nice preview image,

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:35.630
lets people know there's more coming,
and lets them know they're looking at

01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:37.360
something that isn't a static image.

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.820
And that's the material
I plan to cover for today,

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.120
so that's it, unless you have questions.
