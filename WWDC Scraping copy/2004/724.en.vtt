WEBVTT

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.190
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.280
Hopefully everybody had a good time
at the event last night on campus.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.270
I'm Glenn Bullich on the
QuickTime marketing team.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.990
And we're very,
very privileged to have this speaker

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.300
here all the way from London.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.360
I've known Mark and Dulcy, his partner,
for quite a long time.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.710
And if there has been a developer
in the work that we've been

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.080
doing that has consistently
over-delivered and painstakingly made

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.180
products for their customers that,
you know, just astound in every way,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.180
I'm very, very happy to be here.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.690
And I think that's something that
we've been doing for a long time.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:58.530
And I think that's something that
we've been doing for a long time.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.530
And I think that's something that
we've been doing for a long time.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.700
[Transcript missing]

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.340
We've basically been building these
skins for the last two to three years,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.200
really.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.870
And we found them a really amazing way
of delivering an experience for the user.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.060
And this is really what we're about,
is to try and create an

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.300
experience for the people who
come and look at these things.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.770
So what I want to do today is to
really go through the steps that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.140
we take to create these things.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.430
And they do touch on a lot of
areas of what QuickTime can do.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.970
So I'm going to talk a little bit
about the encoding that we do,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.580
how we do it, the choices that we make

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.780
Designing the skin and thinking about
what we're going to include in it.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.990
Now obviously,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.500
The actual construction of these skins
is critical in creating that experience.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.800
We want this to be seamless.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.020
We want people to feel like they're
having something different out of these.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.280
So to get them to run properly,
things like the graphic

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.190
construction of those is critical.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.910
The other thing that we've got
to do is to think about how

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.080
The people in our audience,
what kind of technologies do they

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.320
use to connect to the internet?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.000
How do they come to our material?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.170
And certainly in the UK,
we still have a very

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.240
large dial-up audience.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.270
A lot of people are still on modems.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.000
It's changing.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.720
Broadband is starting to come
along and really replace that.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.820
Dial-up is really feeling
like it's on the way out,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.790
which is great for us because we
can start to really push what we can

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.080
do with the video and the encoding.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.480
And so on.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.430
So again, I'm going to talk through some
of the things that we have to do

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.080
to make sure that the modem user
still has some degree of experience

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.400
compared to the best broadband.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.880
I've mentioned a bit about performance,
and I'm going to talk as well about

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.290
how the performance relates to the...

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.590
The aesthetics of the presentation.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.190
And then I'll have a quick look about
how we actually go about deploying

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.860
this on the web so that we can create
a destination for people as well.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.920
Because the thing with these
media skins is they're files.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.430
And we don't want to just
embed these in a web page.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.670
You know, there's plenty of sites
that already do that.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.670
And

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.510
Again,
we're trying to be different from this.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.900
We want to create a
differentiator with this stuff.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.520
If we have time at the end,
I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.980
how you can make these things dynamic,
how you can update the content.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.350
Okay,
so we started doing these back in 2001,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.430
not long after QuickTime 5.02 came
out and gave us these capabilities.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.090
So the first one we did was
actually for Pink Floyd.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.400
We were designing this
website that was very dynamic.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.440
It was all Flash-based.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.390
And again, we were wondering how could we

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.480
Include this video in this
very dynamic Flash website.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.040
At the time, Flash didn't have any video
capabilities of its own.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.460
And it just didn't seem
right to have this rich,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.690
interactive environment.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.740
- you know,
and then just popping open a new window

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.100
and embedding QuickTime movies in it.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.740
It would have been alright,
but it didn't really allow

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.600
us to achieve our goals.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.600
So,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.190
We were looking at this and what we
wanted to really do was... I'm going

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.360
to keep going back and talking about
aesthetics and quality in this because

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.780
A lot of our work is around that.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.830
And that was very much part of the brief,
the Pink Floyd.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900
Pink Floyd have always
been about their visuals,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.720
about creating, again, an experience.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.290
The skins that we made for them,
they needed to be emailed.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.780
We wanted to send stuff
out to the mailing list,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.100
to the people who are
interested in the band.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.300
And in the same way,
we wanted it to be part of the website.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.200
Again, stand out from the crowd.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.260
We wanted it to be unique.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.050
At the time, back in 2001,
when we did this, it was pretty special.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.780
It was...

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.180
It did create something new for
the visitors on the website.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.440
And certainly with Pink Floyd,
when we did that, it was,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.640
As is usual with record companies,
the content wasn't there.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.470
We knew kind of what to expect,
but it was...

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.580
I think with about a week till launch,
we still only had one

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.240
piece of video ready.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.830
So the skin had to be able to talk
to a database at the back end,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.190
and we could bring in
new content and so on.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.410
So what I'd like to do now
is just to show you the first

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.520
Pink Floyd skin that we did.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.260
So, excellent.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.320
Oh, sorry.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.190
Come to that one in a bit.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.460
So this is what you get when
you started our player up.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.410
Now to begin with,
this list on the right was rather sparse,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.560
but as time's gone on,
we've managed to dig more and

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.800
more video out of an archive
and put it through this system.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.420
So I'd just like to show you
something running in this.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:55.500
We don't need no education.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:55.500
We don't need no thought control.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:45.040
That's kind of a summary
of where we started.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.200
The main thing for us is also the
quality of the video presentation.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.330
I mean, we see a lot of
QuickTime stuff on the web,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:52.330
and

00:10:53.860 --> 00:11:00.000
A lot of things get encoded around the
available bandwidth that people can use.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.510
But here we were really interested
in pushing full motion video because

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.840
It was a new thing.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:14.340
We'd just got Sorenson Video 3 come out,
and it really did change our

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.200
ballpark at the time completely.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.580
We were now able to deliver these full
motion videos at a larger size and

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.000
encapsulate them in these players.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
This is where we started.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Over the last few years,
we've done quite a few of these now.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We're probably on our
12th or 15th player now.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:39.000
There's been a range
of creative executions.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:48.110
Here's a player we did for Ed Harcourt.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.110
It's a similar thing.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.460
Here we have the 16:9 video,
which certainly in the UK is what

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.570
everyone has been moving towards.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:05.000
Again, we wanted to create a presentation
to really show that off.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.800
Okay, so you see now,
you're probably wondering why I've

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.540
got this nice wide screen area
and I have letterboxed the video.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.740
The reason being, some of the other video
that we were using,

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.940
you know, were completely different,
it was a completely

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.000
different aspect ratio.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.430
And so, the skin had to be programmed in
such a way so that it could...

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.100
So that we can handle both
these videos and try and again

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:17.940
create the best aesthetic that
we could in the presentation.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.580
The other thing that we
were able to do with this,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.500
which we thought was pretty cool at the

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:41.230
We were able to add a commentary
track to the video as well,

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.520
which is something that we see
in DVDs and that sort of thing.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.840
But here we were actually able to
kind of interleave that into the main

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.830
video stream and to give ourselves a
commentary track so that we can actually

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:57.470
get Ed in to talk about the video and the
things and experiences he went through.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.680
Could I go back to slides?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.750
Okay, so I've talked a bit about what
the QuickTime Media Skin is,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.810
you know,
and you've seen a couple of examples.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.410
It started off in QuickTime 5.02 was
the first time we were really able

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.400
to create these custom window shapes.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.910
Before that it was still
rectangular movies and

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.200
You know, they were good.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:34.710
You could certainly brand those up,
but they didn't feel that different.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.950
What we have been able to do is to
create this kind of now electronic flyer,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.520
digital flyer,
that really the shape of the window is as

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.440
much part of its branding as the content.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.190
Each one of these skins uses an
awful lot of what QuickTime offers

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.520
us in terms of its video handling,
the audio handling,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.670
and being able to create interactivity
through the use of wired sprites.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.400
And obviously,
we make full use of QuickTime's

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.730
networking and internet capabilities.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.090
So that brings us on
to where we are today,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.680
and the most recent
skin that we produced,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.060
which is the
Robbie Williams-Nebworth skin,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.310
which you may have seen.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.900
Now the brief on this one was
very much to make an impact.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.800
We wanted to kind of shock
people with this one.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.120
I don't know if you're aware of
Robbie Williams as an artist,

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.170
but in the UK he's huge.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:49.760
He is probably one of our biggest,
most successful artists.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.460
His music doesn't really translate.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:57.800
He's tried to kind of move out
into a bigger international market,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.620
but he's such a typical
British cheeky chappy,

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.450
you know, and it's just,
that's what he's about.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:14.960
And so we wanted to kind of try and
touch on that anarchy just a little bit.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.700
And we wanted to communicate
the energy of his performance.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.750
He is a very, very, very,
very energetic performer.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.100
We wanted the skin to reflect that.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.860
The branding of the player needed to be
integrated across the whole DVD campaign.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.780
We wanted to have some degree
of recognition with what

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.940
they'd done in the DVD artwork,
what they'd done in the tour

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.120
program for the whole series.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:49.450
Robby's tour across Europe was
seen by millions of people.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.980
I can't remember,
I think it was close on two and a half,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:58.220
three million people who witnessed this
concert as it traveled around Europe.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.320
Also,
we wanted to include some of the videos,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.670
the DVD extras,
and artwork from the package.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.620
If I can go back to the demo machine.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.100
I'll just take a moment.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:17.700
I'll take you around the Nebworth
skin in a bit more detail.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.140
So, as you can see, we have a very,
very complex shape.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.600
This took a lot of work in Photoshop.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:37.790
We didn't really have anything
that was the right shape or

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:59.000
[Transcript missing]

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.010
You get the idea with the video there,
but there's a lot of additional

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.110
functionality in here as well.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.880
We wanted to carry across a lot of the
traditional interactivity that people are

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:20.290
used to from viewing video in QuickTime,
sorry, in QuickTime Player.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.840
While being able to
actually play it back,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.500
you can also scrub
through the video here,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.930
choose any point you like.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.610
We can completely go full screen,
and so the user can focus just on that,

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.370
clear out the rest of
their desktop clutter,

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.950
and just concentrate on this.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.980
Also, obviously,
because some users are more capable,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:53.230
we have to account for a range of skills,
so we've included some degree

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:58.400
of instruction for people who
were confused with what all the

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.310
various iconic controls did.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.590
One of the things that I think
that I really think is quite cool

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.780
is in terms of handling all these
different bandwidths of video.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.490
So we have,
obviously this is our big stream.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.540
I'll talk about this a bit more in a bit,
but if anyone's ever tried any, you know,

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.600
done encoding,
you've probably noticed this is

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.320
quite challenging footage to encode.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.520
We have a lot of crowd shots,
a lot of pans and zooms.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.790
And the bandwidth that we were
used to encoding our video at

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.020
really were not cutting it.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:40.460
It really needed everything to be
pushed up a notch for us to be able

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.440
to convey the quality of experience.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.690
So if you're down at the modem level--

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.780
So what you can do here,
at the moment you see I've zoomed the

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:05.440
video up to fill the entire window,
which may well be what

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.190
some people want to see.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:17.340
However,
that is actually its native size,

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.290
you know,
so you can actually choose to have

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.640
a higher quality at a small size,
you know,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.580
if you're on a lower resolution screen,
that's still going to

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.900
be fairly reasonable.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:36.400
But this will download as a file
much more happily over a modem.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.400
Now, we also wanted to kind
of hit a middle ground.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.610
So you can see here,
this is a bit larger,

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:49.230
and this is the stream that
people on 512 kilobit ADSL.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.950
"It was stream in real time.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.250
The big stream over here,
your broadband speeds are

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.970
much more impressive than ours
back at home at the moment.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.290
That big stream,
it would still require a little bit

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.860
of waiting to get it buffering before
it'll kick off and start playing.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.460
So this one, again,
you can zoom it out to

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.950
fill the whole player.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.770
And thanks to the kind of video
smoothing inside Sorenson,

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.100
you still can achieve quite a
quality presentation of it."

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.900
So aside from all the video in here,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.800
[Transcript missing]

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.360
Some of the, what they can expect
from the DVD package.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:35.720
So, we've got this other QuickTime movie
that could be brought in.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.260
I don't know if you noticed,
but when it came in,

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:46.620
the controls changed to allow people
to interact with this content instead.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:51.660
So you can step through and see some
previews from the artwork there.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.690
We have some of the DVD extras.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.670
really exciting.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.140
And we wanted to give
people a proper kind of,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.990
some liner notes really from the
DVD so that they knew what to

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.160
expect from the package overall.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.950
Now this was,

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.690
This is quite a big deal for EMI who
we did this for because it gave

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.600
them a way of getting this out
into all sorts of people's hands.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.460
We could promote it
through Robbie's website,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.230
we could email it to the mailing list.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.080
It really gave us a lot of flexibility.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.290
What I'm going to do now is
really sort of get into the

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.080
nitty-gritty about how we made this.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.080
The steps involved in
actually producing the video,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.510
the interactive part of the QuickTime,
and the eventual deployments on the web.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.700
So if we can go back to slides.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:02.050
So the first step of the process
was trying to gather the assets.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:08.020
Now this is always a challenging process,
particularly when record companies,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.920
artists, management,
there's a whole host of people

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.210
that have to clear this stuff,
and more often than not we find

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:19.260
that we end up with really the raw
deal at the end of the process.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.060
Everyone's taken their stuff.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.200
We see all this media produced and we
can't work out where these assets have

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.290
come from because we never saw them.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.460
But with Robbie, we were quite lucky.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.380
Robbie's management company were
editing the video themselves,

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.010
and so they were actually able
to provide us all the footage

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.380
on DVD as QuickTime files.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.590
So that gave us a really
good head start with this,

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.820
and one that we're not used to seeing.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.950
Normally, we're kind of -- we're
not a large company,

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.800
Bulycz, you know.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.300
We -- but -- so the idea of us
being able to go out and afford,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.960
you know, DigiB to Dex,

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.460
That sort of thing to
allow us compatibility with

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.670
this is really beyond us.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.790
We normally tend to...

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:14.590
Expect things to be delivered on miniDV.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.400
We even get stuff delivered
to us in MPEG-2 on DVD,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.260
which comes with its own set of problems.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.390
There's a lot of transcoding
issues from MPEG-2,

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.040
audio tracks that seem to just disappear.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.840
But in this case,
we were pretty well sorted.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.380
The artwork that we were given in
this case as well was pretty awesome.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.420
We were given everything that they had.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.170
We were given the graphics
that they used to develop,

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.820
to print up all the backdrops on stage.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.220
We had all the artwork from
the DVD and the tour program,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.320
all in high res.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.060
So we pretty much could do
whatever we liked with this.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:04.970
So we started to think about how
we could actually pull this artwork

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.910
apart and build a player from it.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.420
So the first thing I want to
talk about here is the design,

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.710
really.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.880
Because, I mean, we're a strange lot.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.490
You know, it's like we're just as much
into the design as we are into

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.510
the development of these things.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.160
And like I said,
I keep going back to talking

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.700
about the aesthetics of this.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.000
And this is very apparent in this player.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.900
Now, while it's a very
elaborate player design,

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:41.860
the thing that was really key to us to
get good playback was to actually make

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.030
the underlying player incredibly simple.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.090
We found through our own bitter
experience that the moment you start to

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.980
try and get too clever with the way that
you're handling media in these things,

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:58.300
these things tend to really slow down.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.920
But with a bit of thought
at the design stage,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.600
you can really sort this out.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.000
We were, and obviously we wanted to
include a lot of interactivity,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.590
so this was already forcing us
down a particular path with this.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:25.380
I've already spoken a little bit about
the context-sensitive navigation.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:25.380
And again, I'm

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.800
A lot of the time we don't know what
is actually going to end up in this.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:36.960
So there had to be levels of
code written inside QuickTime to

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.010
enable that functionality.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.190
Now the window mask shape
caused us no end of problems.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:52.340
We knew we wanted to create this
very elaborate baroque feel to

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.580
the way the shape of the player.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.720
And so we thought, well, yeah,
we'll just take the artwork, you know,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.900
we'll stick it through
levels in Photoshop,

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.800
bit threshold, and it'll be fine.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.300
And oh, no, it wasn't.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.040
It was horrible.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.030
I mean, the first time we tried that and
started to play video back in it,

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.900
everything was being jerky.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.010
You tried to pick the player up
and move it around the screen.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.420
It would be jumpy.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.500
It just wasn't very pleasant.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:23.500
So, um,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:31.790
We had to kind of go back to scratch
and literally draw that shape by hand,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:37.860
concentrating on getting as many pixels
in a horizontal line as we could,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.980
because that really helped QuickTime.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.840
That meant the drawing routines
on both Mac and Windows could

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:50.190
really deal with it.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.570
That's the shape we ended up with.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.140
So as you can see, it's pretty clean.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.370
I mean,
there aren't many stray pixels in there.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.660
We've painted them all out.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:07.650
So that gave us our shape.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.760
Inside that,
we needed to lay in a background,

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.510
something that we could build on top of.

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:27.170
So what you're seeing there is the actual
background JPEG from the QuickTime skin.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:33.580
We use a range of image file
formats to encapsulate these things.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.100
We use JPEGs where we have
large complex backgrounds,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.260
or photographic backgrounds.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:47.090
We still use GIFs occasionally where
we want something to be really small.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.940
And more and more,
we're now getting into using

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.120
PNGs and that sort of thing,
because they have certain

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.700
advantages themselves.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:08.430
Here you can see what would happen
if we laid the video into the design.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.420
Which wasn't really doing what we wanted.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.630
So we figured, well,
maybe we can take these extra bits and we

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.480
can float it over the top of the video.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.040
With alpha channels and so forth,
but again, we lost all our performance.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:31.460
The video would not play back smoothly at
25 frames a second with those in place.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.370
So we kind of thought about this,
and we actually went back to a

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:40.080
technique that we used to use years
ago when doing CD-ROMs in Director.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:49.040
And we actually laid this
framework in place into the video.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.400
We produced a mask,
and as we were encoding it in Cleaner,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.940
we were applying this mask to
every single piece of video.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.420
So that when it came back
to be displayed by the user,

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.760
it would seem seamless.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.130
And we tried to make sure that
whatever state the player was in,

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.870
that that edging would be in place.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:17.970
So that you never saw the actual
rectangle that held the QuickTime movie.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.880
So again, talking about the aesthetics,
one of the things that we find

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.930
really frustrating about QuickTime is
the fact that it wants to put

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:34.540
this funny white rectangle with
a little QuickTime loading icon.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.960
And we find that quite jarring.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:48.220
What we did here is to create an overlay,
an image that we could bring back

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.290
to the front whenever a video stream
started playing that would cover

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:56.340
up what we figured was a bit of a,
something that didn't really

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.980
fit with the overall feeling
that we were trying to create.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.640
So now we start looking at laying
in the interactive elements.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.050
Now again, this was critical.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.020
One thing that we -- certainly I did it.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.770
The first time I tried
to create one of these,

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.160
this is exactly what I did.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.930
I would create a sprite track.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:18.160
I'd try and lay it in
over the complete design,

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:25.620
knocking out the background by setting
it to transparent in live stage.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.310
But again, that just does not work.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:32.470
Every element needs to be
-- it needs to be separate.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.020
It needs to be its own thing.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.480
So what you start to do is to
build up a whole range of tracks

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.300
for each interactive element.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.540
So for instance, the progress bar here,
the transport control here,

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.640
the bandwidth control,
the main navigation,

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:56.300
which is embedded as a flash track,
and the kind of window control.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:56.770
rolls.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.210
They're all separate elements.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.080
They've all been kept small,
self-contained,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.870
so that we can have a whole range of
different functionality around the

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.470
player without it impacting performance.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:14.980
So, now the flash track at the top,
that gave us some very

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:19.770
interesting issues,
because the...

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:25.530
Again, just like the video,
we couldn't stick any graphics over

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:29.300
the top of that track because it
would kill performance throughout.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:34.800
So using the track masking
features of Photoshop,

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:41.300
we added a mask for that
top bit of navigation.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.860
would define the area that
the Flash movie would occupy.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:52.520
So this enabled us to lay
the Flash track on top,

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.720
but to create the visual
appearance of a track that was

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.080
behind the rest of the design.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.340
Okay, so once we've got all
those components together,

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.120
they all add up and
create the impression of

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:21.700
[Transcript missing]

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:27.000
So those are kind of the design
considerations we set out with,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.230
which is basically based on our
experience of doing these in the past.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.250
So we'd already equipped ourselves
with these few bits of knowledge

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:40.970
about how QuickTime would respond
when laying these elements together.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.190
Yeah.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.880
So now I'm going to talk about the video.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.960
In this instance,
we didn't need to capture anything.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.200
We already had been given files.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.470
And I'm sure different people here
will have different technologies

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:03.660
that they use to capture their video
and bring it into their workflow.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.760
For us in this instance,
it had already been done.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.980
So we could move straight
into the encoding phase.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:16.500
So, to do this,
we're still using Cleaner.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.930
I know Cleaner seems to have
kind of gone very quiet,

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.260
and we find that a shame because that
was historically our favorite tool.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.620
I've been using that right back
from when it was a piece of

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:35.340
shareware called Movie Cleaner,
and that really had been my main tool

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:35.340
for processing and sorting out video.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:40.410
Where Clean is going,
I have no idea at the moment.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.340
And we're certainly going to have--

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.370
So, yeah, we'll be looking at other
tools to help us do this.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.470
The trouble is, is that with Cleaner,
it...

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.120
Cleaner was special in as much that it
enabled us to do everything in one go.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.560
The cropping the video so that we could
get rid of all the extraneous sort of

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.480
video signals and stuff from our source.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.980
It enabled us to do all
the color correction and,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:09.980
you know, the color

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:16.940
set up a batch that would just run
through all these files in one go.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.940
Like I was saying before,
it was horrible.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:27.320
When we first got the video in and
we tried our first test encodes

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.040
at the bandwidths that we were
used to encoding this material at,

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.510
it was a disaster.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.230
We just thought,
how can we ever send this out?

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:46.300
Again, the aesthetics of the
presentation just wasn't there.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.770
So we kind of moved everything up.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.580
We normally kind of overall
used to use kind of 100 kilobit,

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.420
300 and 600 to carry the video.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.200
In this instance,
that just wasn't going to be possible.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.320
So we moved all the video
bandwidth up a notch,

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.370
up to one megabit at the top end.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:07.120
And then we found that all of a sudden,
you know,

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.100
it was a lot of trial and error.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.440
But eventually we found a point
that we were happy with the file

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.960
sizes compared to the quality
and the motion we were getting.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.760
So as I said,
it's all encoded in Sorenson 3.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.360
And Robbie's one is...

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.540
One of the first ones that we
started to use AAC audio in,

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:35.060
simply because the quality of that
presentation is so much better.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.420
You can probably hear the difference
between the Pink Floyd one where

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.800
that's actually an MP3 soundtrack.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.660
It's all right,
but the moment you start using

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.460
AAC at the higher bandwidths,
it really starts to shine.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.300
So these are some of the
things we considered as we

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.670
were encoding this thing.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:04.400
Now one of the things that we've always
taken as a choice is I want to...

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.040
Be true to the original timing,
the temporal quality.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.520
I want to try and carry through
that 25 frames a second of

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.910
the source material because

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:15.760
It's music.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.160
Music is about rhythm.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:22.000
It's called full motion
video for a reason.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.740
And we found that the moment you
started to drop the frame rate down,

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:34.970
you would either start to have all sorts
of horrible sort of half-frame problems,

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.950
and the rhythm of the
performance would be lost.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.900
So we chose to go for a temporal
quality over spatial quality.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.040
I wouldn't mind seeing a bit of
blocking or artefacting in these

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.920
streams if it meant that I could
keep this thing running at 25 frames

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:59.390
a second and to carry through the...

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.890
The Vibrancy of the Original Performance.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.220
We also use progressive
downloads rather than streams,

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.500
and we do this for a
very particular reason.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:16.500
It allows users on all sorts
of connections to access this.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:21.260
If we try and start to stream one
megabit movies down to the user,

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:28.340
we're going to be immediately leaving
out a whole segment of our audience.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.930
Whereas with a progressive download,
they can just wait.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.140
If they really want to watch the
high-quality version on dial-up,

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.620
they can just wait for it.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.540
It also means that we can do
additional functionality like

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:48.110
the scrub control on the video,
so that people can randomly access any

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.350
point of that file once it's downloaded.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:59.010
As I already mentioned,
the style of footage that we

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.900
had for this gig was such that
it's an encoding nightmare.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.200
You've got kind of crowds jumping around,
you've got these long shots

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.470
showing 50,000 people.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:17.170
It's kind of the worst possible
situation for encoding.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:24.970
And like I've already said as well,
we needed to burn those elements,

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.150
burn the edge of the frame
design into the video,

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.790
which was all done as
we encoded the video.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.650
So I guess the point I'm trying
to make there is that the design

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:40.980
considerations up front were really
important for us because we had to

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.920
work out how to put all these different
things in place as we were doing it.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:48.610
So, here I can give you some of
the settings that we used.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.770
So the Pink Floyd material and
the Pink Floyd player and the

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:58.210
Ed Harcourt player that I showed you
are very much that middle column.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:05.630
So you can see the jump that we had to
take with Nebworth to achieve what we

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:12.100
felt was a similar level of aesthetics
to the look and feel of the video.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:17.990
Now, again, a lot of these numbers came
out through trial and error.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.830
You know, I sit there with clean air,
just batching out different

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.310
qualities over and over again.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:30.030
And we found that there were
certain sweet points in that

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:34.840
where the quality of the video and
everything would just come together.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:41.270
So that's that.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.050
And you can see that we,
as far as the audio goes,

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.740
that's pretty simple.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.270
We've found a set of values
there that we're quite happy

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:53.690
with over a whole range of

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.900
Different things that we're given.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.740
And obviously, at those bandwidths,
AAC audio just,

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.260
it blows MP3 out of the water.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.330
So now we get into the...
So what we have now,

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.980
we have a folder full of encoded video.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:20.020
We have an idea of the design
that we are going to use to...

00:42:21.000 --> 00:43:02.300
[Transcript missing]

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:08.030
As the author,
an amazing amount of control.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.320
The language inside
Livestage is called QScript.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.600
It's an odd language.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:19.320
It's not perhaps what
you'd be used to in,

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.040
you know, compared to today's modern
scripting languages.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:30.040
But you can still get the results if
you're prepared to kind of work on it.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:30.040
Now,

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.030
So again,
every interactive element was laid

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.930
up into a track so that we could

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.770
"Get the performance that we
wanted." So we had to break that

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:46.230
design down into the little pieces.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:49.440
So that we can actually achieve
the interactivity without it

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:53.190
interfering with the video itself.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.490
So then,

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.680
I want to talk a little bit
about where we put all this code.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:08.450
Because you get into these
authoring environments.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.710
And it seems like you can stick
stuff just about anywhere,

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.810
but in this instance,
we normally now try and concentrate all

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:20.210
our code into just one of these elements.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.410
In this case particularly,
it's actually all held

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:28.370
in the progress bar,
because that is where I need to

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:35.320
write code to manage the playback
of this video as it streams down.

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:39.690
I want that progress bar to be
the thing that is dynamically

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.180
updating as the video downloads.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:49.240
So that's where most of it's kept.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.650
All the other interactive elements
tend to send events back to that

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.800
progress bar to trigger certain
events and that sort of thing.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:02.030
It also means that I have one
point inside the entire movie

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:06.760
that I can go and see all my code.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:13.500
So, oh,
and the other place that tends to end up

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.960
with a lot of code is the flash track.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.930
The way that a flash file or a Swift file
will work in QuickTime requires

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:28.600
you to attach code to buttons.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.430
You have to kind of pass things
backwards and forwards to the flash.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.640
You can't, I mean this is something
that really pains me,

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.130
is the ability that,
or not having the ability

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.210
to call a function.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:46.210
So in Flash 5, you can define your own
custom functions anywhere,

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.390
any movie clip inside the tool.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.460
But...

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.660
QuickTime doesn't work in that way.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.120
I have to expose variables at
the right at the root of the

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.790
movie and put data in those.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.960
And literally I have to have
little buttons off screen so

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.380
that once I've populated these
variables with the right data,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:16.170
I can click that button from
the script and the appropriate

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:19.410
actions can take place.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:29.300
The most complex code in this is
all about playback management.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.250
When you normally sort
of see a QuickTime movie,

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.870
you have a route timeline,
and that's what you're controlling.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.600
When you play and stop that, it's...

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:43.400
It's all happening at that bottom level.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:51.440
So we actually have
quite a multitude of...

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.370
A couple of hundred lines of code in this
thing just for managing the playback.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:01.990
If the user's network stalls, if...

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.120
For whatever reason, the video stops.

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:09.350
I want the player to be able to
recognize that and react accordingly

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.560
so that when the data is back in place,
it can just pick up and carry on through.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:22.960
So I've now got a folder
full of encoded video.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.160
I've got a design,
and I've authored that.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:35.560
I've put the code in the right places,
and that's behaving itself now.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.770
We now get onto the step of
actually publishing this thing.

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.490
We have this QuickTime movie.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.770
It's doing its thing,
but I want to actually

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.370
move it to the web.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:53.560
The main reason I wanted to have it
on the web is to create a destination.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.930
You can't just -- well, you can.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.770
You can obviously give somebody
a URL that goes straight

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.660
to the QuickTime movie.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.620
But then you're not going to have any of
the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.930
The wonderful sort of shape
to the window is just going to

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.500
be embedded there in the page,
and it's not the most

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.200
aesthetic experiences.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:22.700
So we actually have to try and
launch the movie from the web page.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:31.910
And we do that by embedding a second tiny
little QuickTime movie that handles that.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.770
The other thing that we want
to do from the web page is

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:39.200
to give people the ability to
download this thing and keep it.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.190
It's one of the great powers of these.

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.200
They are like digital flyers.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.170
And it's all well and good for you
coming to the page and seeing it,

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.120
but not everyone has QuickTime Pro.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:58.640
Users with QuickTime Pro obviously
can save this thing off their

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.970
drive and keep it for later.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.940
So we wanted to give
people an easy download,

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.090
so they can just keep this.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:12.930
So if I can go back to the

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:38.330
So we actually have a link
to this from our website.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.200
So you'll see it automatically
starts launching the movie,

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.300
and there we go.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:59.550
So we can kind of create that whole
seamless experience in one step.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.770
That little embedded QuickTime movie
in the page is the secret to

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:09.300
moving it into QuickTime Player and
kicking the whole thing off.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.760
And now we're here.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.300
Obviously, we can interact with the skin.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:20.100
I can go back and I can
choose to launch it again.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:31.340
Indeed, I can click a link and take
it home to keep it for later.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.230
So that's kind of pretty
much the process we,

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.000
an outline of the process that we
went through to create this thing.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.290
It's, you know,
it does touch on just about every

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:52.110
element that QuickTime has to offer.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:58.460
I guess apart from VR, you know,
but we couldn't really

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.780
see a good use for that.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.340
So that is pretty much it
in terms of Neverworth.

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:09.120
Neverworth was-- we always
knew what the content would be.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.200
It was very much a static target.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:17.160
The clips that were authorized for
us to redistribute were very clear.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:22.750
And so we could build that
player in such a way so that--

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.630
The content was just there.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:32.600
We didn't need to hook
anything up to the web.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.900
What I'd like to show you
now is another skin that we

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.790
actually did for Robbie Williams,
an earlier one, where we had really no

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.590
idea about the content.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.340
So again, a similar thing, you know,
the video's there.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.330
We have a range of video
available to browse.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:06.370
You can see that

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.090
As I select things,
it gives you descriptions about

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.390
what those pieces of video are.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:17.800
We even have this top-level menu where
we can actually choose to see what area

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.800
of content we're interested in seeing.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.800
And now all of this is dynamic.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:31.180
The player really is just a completely
empty shell that needs to connect

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:37.310
to an XML file on the server before
it knows what it's going to do.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:50.320
So this gives us the ability to create
these players as empty shells and then

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:56.930
choose what content we're going to play
into it and how the player can be updated

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:02.110
over time as new video becomes available.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.890
I guess really that's about it.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:11.970
I mean, I guess in conclusion I can say,
I mean,

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:15.040
this is all pretty exciting to us.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:20.430
The ability to create these
experiences for people and

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.940
Yeah, you know, it's cool, you know?

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.840
It's something different.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.340
It's something new.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.600
There's a lot of power to these players.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.020
And we really feel like we're just
starting to scratch the surface of this.

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:41.370
And we're very interested to see
how QuickTime is evolving and the

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.250
things that we can do in future.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:47.490
Okay, so...
