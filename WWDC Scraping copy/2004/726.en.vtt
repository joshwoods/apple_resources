WEBVTT

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.500
Good afternoon everybody.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.780
I'm Glenn Bullich on the
QuickTime marketing team.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.500
You are in session 726,
QuickTime Case Studies.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.430
And we have the privilege
today to talk to the folks who

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.500
delivered all of the media for
the South by Southwest conference.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.030
And if you're not familiar
with this conference,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.310
it's the largest conference for
independent music in the world.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.540
And we have some 1300 bands get
together and perform for a large

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.830
audience and other bands and hopefully
lots of artists and repertoire people

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.500
who are adding independent bands
and unsigned bands into labels.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.740
And clearly the last several
years have been really,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.490
really important for independent music.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.050
Most notably the internet arising as a
way of merchandising and a way of getting

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.500
bands to be able to promote themselves
without being captive or accepted.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.610
And that's excluded from radio
and some of the promotion vehicles

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.490
that are available to major labels.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.600
And the team at South by Southwest this
year sort of went over and above,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.730
not only delivering thousands
of MP3s from all these bands and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.460
delivering video from the panels,
but also allowing or leveraging some

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.490
of the technologies including wireless
and streaming to cross-pollinate

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.410
between all the different clubs and the
performances and that kind of stuff.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.500
So, pretty packed session,
pretty in-depth.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.360
I'll turn it over to Scott Wilcox.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.340
And if we have questions,
let's save them to the end and come

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.060
up to the microphones and say your
name and company name and we'll do

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.500
our best to answer all the questions
and I'll kick it off to these guys.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.580
Okay, my name is Gary Woodcock and this
is Scott Wilcox and we're going

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.680
to talk to you a little bit about
how we have done our production

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.660
workflow at South by Southwest.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.390
And I guess this is... That's right.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.590
Yeah.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.280
So, sorry, I got confused there.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.600
So this is just kind of an overview
of what we're going to talk about.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.200
We want to explain kind of
what South by Southwest is,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.820
what it's about,
how we've used QuickTime in our workflow

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.770
for production for music and for video,
how we've used QuickTime to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.400
help us promote the event,
how, you know,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.060
we've delivered the media that
we've created during the event,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.050
we'll talk a little bit about
some of the experiments that we've

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.440
conducted during the course of the
last few years during the event,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.150
and go over a few ideas that we have
for future directions of how we might

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.920
use QuickTime to help us in the future.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.140
Along the way,
what we hope to do is help you learn

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.360
a little bit about how you can use
Apple technologies to help you do these

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.400
kinds of things for your own promotions
or production delivery sorts of things.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.470
We've used iTunes and QuickTime and
Rendezvous and a lot of different

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.300
Apple technologies to really streamline
the process of delivering media

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.490
for South by Southwest attendees
and people who aren't attending

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.950
the show but come and look at the
media that's available online.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.660
So just to give you an overview
of what South by Southwest is,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.290
it's, as Glenn said,
the largest sort of event

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.620
of its type in the world.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.480
There's various components.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.230
It all overlaps.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.550
And for the last 10 years, specifically,
we've been focusing on

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.020
convergence of the film,
music,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.310
and interactive technology industries.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.400
So to sort of break it down,
we also have an

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.450
exhibition and trade show.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.680
It happens in March every year in Austin,
and we're in our 19th year for music and

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.130
our 12th year for film and interactive.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.570
In terms of attendance,
it's a large group of attendees

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.710
who are sort of registered and
can attend the panel sessions.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.140
And then there's specialties.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.560
We have a lot of special events.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.760
And in the nighttime
during the music festival,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.750
we have the bands play on 60
stages around Austin for four days.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.500
So interactive.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.010
Basically our focus here is we do a lot
of panels and conference programming and

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.700
the sort of community that has involved
itself most heavily over the years is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.140
really working with web technologies,
blogging, the entertainment industry,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.470
we have designers,
and all these people kind of come to

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.240
sort of talk about the challenges,
the unique challenges that are facing

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.300
them in their event and how can
they also use the tools they've been

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.210
developing to leverage the music
industry and the film industry to

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.110
put sort of products in the hands of
executives who are running labels,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.480
independent labels, major labels,
people who are in licensing.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.500
So we have a web awards show
which is focused on trying to

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.980
acknowledge the best work we feel
done in the web over the last year.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:49.300
And all in all, the interactive event
has about 3200 attendees,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.810
which has been growing significantly
every year and the event tries to

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.060
reflect what's going on in this space.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.620
And we've been moving more towards
we have a wireless track and we're

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.280
talking more about mobile content
delivery and basically what's happening,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.420
we just try to reflect it.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.600
For the film, our emphasis here is
really independent film.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.630
You've got a tremendous amount of talent
out there that have been making fantastic

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.240
films that have been picked up and
distributed by large distribution houses.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.790
And then we try to bring the
directors who are really notable and

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.920
working in the field of independent
film like Robert Rodriguez,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.830
initially at least, in independent,
kind of broken through

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.740
now to the sort of majors.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.840
Richard Linklater, similar story,
really put Austin on the map

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.300
with Slacker in the beginning.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.910
And then we've got Jim Jarmusch.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.100
We've had any number of other
filmmakers over the years.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.660
Our focus as far as the
festival goes is premieres.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.860
We try to premiere as many
regional and world films.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.140
We try to do as many films as possible.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.760
We have about eight venues.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.720
We do about 200 films over 10 days.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.520
So we complement the conference aspect
of the event with this film festival,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.720
which then creates a forum for buyers,
distribution, people looking to work

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.760
in independent film.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.060
And then we've got a consumer base,
which basically is comprised mostly of

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.840
fans that also come in and see the films.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.000
So to give you an idea
of the scope there,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.470
this year we had about 30,000 single
admission entries into the films,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.890
so 30,000 people in seats basically.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.280
And from that, a lot of these films go
on to find distribution.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.580
And we were able to arrange special
screenings like Jim Jarmusch's

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:01.300
film Coffee and Cigarettes played
there this year in addition to,

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.800
who else, Robert Duvall did something,
Code 46.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800
And then we had a couple of other
films that premiered there this year,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.800
which is Tim Robbins' independent film.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.880
So that's going on.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.870
There's over 3,000 attendees for that.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.910
And that sort of happens simultaneously
with the interactive event.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.780
We've got both people in the same
buildings in just separate rooms

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.800
and then we do crossover panels.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.920
So people can sort of meet
and mingle in that arena.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.030
For music, this is probably the
cornerstone of our event,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.760
mostly because it's
been going the longest.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.760
And we've been able to develop a lot of
the music that we've been able to do.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.620
We've been able to develop a
robust international reputation

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:43.260
with a large European contingency
and Asian contingency.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.380
We have a European rep, an Asian rep.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.000
We have a Pacific rem
rep down in Australia.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.440
And we really try to
pull the best talent,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.650
the emerging talent from around
the world and the industry that

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.560
supports them from managers,
the labels they're working with,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.880
publicists come.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.720
And people come to really see, okay,
I'm going to do this.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:04.890
I'm going to do this.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.090
I'm going to do that.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.810
And they're like, "Okay,
what's the stuff going on

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.090
now?" So because of that,
we're focused largely in the indie scene.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.080
You know,
we've got smaller indies and your

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.990
more established indies like Sub Pop.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.950
And this really -- what we've seen,
interestingly enough,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.170
is that that is really thriving now.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.950
As the larger labels and
distribution houses continue

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.020
to merge and merge and merge,
we've seen that,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.200
with the tools given to people,
they're really able to get into the

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.650
industry and get into people in rich
media and on the Internet and websites,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.900
that more independent houses have been
taking advantage of implementing new

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.340
media as a strategy for promotion.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.650
And the end result is that sales
have been through the roof.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.040
I've got a friend who's the
director of sales at Sub Pop,

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.700
and he says, "We're doing well." And this
is really encouraging news,

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.220
I think, for the music industry overall.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.110
So 8,000 people there.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:09.660
This is an example of one clip we
did with QuickTime during the event.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.680
We shot this with minimal
production on mini DV and then

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.620
edited it in Final Cut Pro,
compressed with Cleaner 6,

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.120
and delivered it the day after.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.470
Sort of we compressed overnight
and then published in the morning.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:11:02.200
[Transcript missing]

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.390
Because then you're cheating yourself.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.560
Your conviction is not there.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.780
You're doing this because
you believe in it.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.900
It's you and it's real.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.460
You didn't steal, you didn't kill,
and now you're not even ill

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.500
because you got the real feel.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.590
If you want to play the guitar,
really play the guitar.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.070
Learn how to play the guitar.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.250
Learn how to play the piano.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.500
Learn how to really sing.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.940
Don't cheat yourself.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.510
If Bessie ain't doing it,
don't copy Bessie.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.080
Because Bessie ain't going nowhere.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.880
If she go in the West,
she ain't gonna be that long.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.160
She'll be back home.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.730
Learn how to really,
really put something in it.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.720
And remember this,
that the grass may look

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.160
greener on the other side,
but it's just as hard to cut.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.800
So that was a clip from our
keynote presentation this year.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.620
Most of you, I'm sure,
recognize Little Richard.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.210
And every year we try to have
artists with the benefit of

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.490
industry experience do our keynotes.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.090
And then we integrate other aspects
of people in the music industry

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.360
throughout the panel's programming.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:29.560
South by Southwest has a unique set of
constraints because it's a festival,

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.630
it's an event.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.100
And we basically go into the space,
which would be the convention center,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.760
and into the clubs.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.550
And we have to set everything
up like in 48 hours.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.390
And then we have to do the event.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.430
And at the same time,
we'd like to capture as much from

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.580
the event digitally as possible.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:51.260
And then we need to cut the stuff and we
need to get it out there on the channels

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.180
because we have very little time.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.370
And we have a very fixed amount of time
where spotlight on South by Southwest.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.590
We've got a big promotional push
and we need to take advantage

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.220
of the interactive and new media
technologies at our disposal.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.650
So for our video program in particular,
we have a lot of budgetary limitations

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.940
due to the fact that we're also
having to put all the production

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.500
in the clubs and we have to sort
of do things with the theaters.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.160
So we've got a lot of
physical production.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.330
And then so which leaves us sort of scant
resources from a new media production,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.760
digital production standpoint.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:36.100
So the way we solve this problem is that
we use volunteers for our production.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:42.320
And we ask the volunteers that
they provide their own camera,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.360
actually.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.230
We've been going with mini DV primarily
as a format over the last four years

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.930
because of just the sheer amount
of proliferation of the device.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.200
And we've been kind of running the
consumer and pro-sumer markets.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.130
So what this does for the volunteer,
though,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.380
is create a unique opportunity for
them to gain exposure at the event

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.710
because we try to make sure that
they're credited appropriately.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.290
We'll say this person shot this clip
and this person edited this clip.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.260
And then when they're
meeting people the event,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.130
they have the opportunity to say, oh,
yeah, this is what I'm doing with

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.360
this and here's my card.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.960
So the whole social networking
aspect of the event plays really

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.060
well into gaining sort of.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.050
A range of talent from from
novice to professional.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.940
So they go out and we deploy
them to shoot the event.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.100
And the main thing that we
focus on is simplicity overall.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.340
We have a fairly elaborate
production scheme,

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.910
which I'll talk about in a minute.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.600
But we we try to do it in a guerrilla
fashion whereby for the panels and

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.320
stuff we we maybe will plug into the
board and we'll set a camera up in the

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.080
back and then we'll send up a close up.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.120
Shot up front for the bigger events.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.060
So we have a two shot to edit between,
you know,

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.220
but we don't get more complicated
than that because it creates a lot of

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.320
editing time overhead and we need to
get this stuff out quick and we want

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.710
to be able to get it out and extensible
to emerging mobile formats as well.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.930
So we've basically chosen something
where we're actually getting a lot

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.500
more content than we're currently
able to to use in real time.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:22.750
So we've basically chosen something
where we're actually getting a lot

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.020
more content than we're currently
able to to use in real time.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.470
We focus on the two to
five minute clip or so.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.940
And I think that's next.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.570
Oh, you're talking about that.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:32.940
OK.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.080
I'll continue with that part later.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:42.450
So one of the things that South by
Southwest does a really excellent

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:48.950
job at is event promotion and also
promotion for the various films and

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.740
bands that participate in the event.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.570
And the typical,
just looking at the music side of this,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:16:00.460
the bands will submit songs to
South by Southwest that they want

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.440
to use to promote either their
performance or perhaps they have an

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.330
album out that they want to tie into.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.170
But basically something that
represents their vision,

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.090
their art, and that they want to
emphasize at the event.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:21.270
The songs that are received by South by
Southwest are encoded into MP3 format and

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:27.100
then they're made available for download
on the South by Southwest website.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.370
And there also,
there was something very new

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.930
that happened this year that an
engineer at South by Southwest,

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.060
David Rose, had a great idea.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:40.290
He had a great idea to try to leverage
the songs that we were getting

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.700
from the artists through iTunes.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.100
And so the same songs that are encoded
are hosted on a central server and

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.660
they're available through iTunes.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.590
And David also did some
additional work to go talk with

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.120
the Austin City Wireless Project,
which is kind of a collective

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:03.100
of people that offer free
access points throughout Austin.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.730
And I think there's 50 sites currently.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.090
There's 50 sites during the event,
but now there's like 80.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.220
So this is kind of
blowing up really quickly.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.840
They work in conjunction
with the city as well.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.380
Yeah, so it's pretty much citywide.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.730
While the event's going on,
there are access points

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.730
you can walk into.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:29.090
You can basically bring up iTunes
and get access to these songs.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.620
And this is kind of what this looks like.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.420
This is an example of one of the
access points locally in Austin.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.420
And you can see that there's
the promotion for South by

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.900
Southwest with the logo.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.150
And it also has the iTunes tie-in to
let you know that if you have iTunes,

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:49.820
either on your Mac or PC,
and you log into their access point, hey,

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.050
there's something really
neat waiting for you.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:57.120
And this is another login
example that you can see.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.880
And so this is just kind of the
screen that you get when you go enter

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.100
one of these places that you have to
log into before you get the access.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.090
I

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.640
Okay,
so this is just kind of an example of

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.000
what you'd see if you brought up iTunes.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.190
And you can see there's the South by
Southwest 2004 showcasing artists.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.900
And you get a list of all the
songs and all the bands that

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.200
are available on the playlist.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.260
And this year we had 600 different songs.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.320
20-some odd.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:27.710
Yeah.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:34.730
And it's very cool because you
can browse any -- use all the

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.890
tools that you have in iTunes.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.200
You can browse by category or band name
or song and find something that you like.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.910
And I think Scott's going to talk later
about how you can even tie that back

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.400
to find the band during the event.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.750
So how does this work?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.840
Basically,
the iTunes sharing is based on something

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.940
called the digital audio access
protocol that's proprietary to Apple.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:07.900
Now, even though it's proprietary,
there are some open source repositories

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.220
that implement a server technology
that can be deployed on OS X,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.840
on Linux, on Windows,
on pretty much anything.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.600
And you can run this open source
server and serve your own playlist.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.740
And then there's a second piece,
which is the rendezvous piece.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.790
This is basically the service discovery.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.910
So this is the part that lets you,
when you're in the access

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.950
point service area,
lets you know that there's actually

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.750
a service here that you can use.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.760
And this was done using
the DNS proxy sample code,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.050
the rendezvous sample code
that's actually available

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.730
from the Apple website.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.950
Now there are other ways to do this.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.310
You can do the same
sort of thing with Howl,

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.120
which is another
rendezvous implementation.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.840
Rendezvous is also known as
zero configuration or zero conf.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.260
You might know it by that name as well.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.610
The point being is it's
all openly available.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.120
It'll run on a variety of systems.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.470
And basically what happens is we have
the tune served from a central server,

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:16.900
and then at each access point you can
run an instance of this rendezvous.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.510
And then you can run an instance of this
rendezvous client or this rendezvous

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.770
server that can relay the server
content to the local access point.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.960
The reason this is necessary,
at least currently,

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.840
is that the service is
bound to a local subnet.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.780
So the server itself has its own subnet,
and you need to bridge to

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.720
the access point subnet.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.160
Basically this sounds fairly complicated,
but it's really not.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.530
You can download the sample code,
and you don't really have to be

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.500
a software engineer to run this.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.250
You basically need to be able
to type make in the console,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.560
and it'll all work out
for you pretty well.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.820
It's not difficult,
but it was a bit of inspired

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.740
work on David's part to pull
all these pieces together.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.710
And I'd like to just check with David.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:05.260
I think David has a surprise
kind of for the audience here.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.980
If you have AirPort here,
you should be able to log in with iTunes

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.880
and actually see the playlist here.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.000
We have it relayed here into this
room so that you can see it in action.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.180
If you're curious.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.520
And it's, again,
it's a very powerful concept,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.610
but it's relatively simple and
very inexpensive to set up.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.580
So it fit very well with the philosophy
that South by Southwest has for getting

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.480
maximum leverage out of the technology.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.220
So just real quick,
I promise this is as technical as

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.140
we'll probably get in the session here,
but I did want to kind of

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.210
get this into the slides.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:47.340
Again, to do this sort of thing
yourself is not difficult.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.170
You just have to go out
and download the code,

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.060
build it with your environment of choice.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.060
It might be Xcode on OS X.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.370
It could be just using
standard GCC tools on Linux,

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.230
and then install it.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.710
And then there's some fairly
simple configuration that you

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.940
need to do to basically advertise
the fact that you have a digital

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.340
audio protocol service available,
which is the first line

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.060
of blue text there.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.300
And what you're basically
advertising is your IP address,

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.190
your database name,
how you'd like your playlist to be

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.010
advertised in terms of text in iTunes,
for example,

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.770
and then the protocol and the port.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.780
The second line basically just
starts the audio service protocol,

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.870
and it's just a single line.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.910
And it's not much more
difficult than that.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.110
So, yeah.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:52.420
I just like to add that the real
benefit that this has had for us

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.460
is that it's really increased the
distribution using cool new technology

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.310
while actually all of our audio files
still live on one server actually in

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.240
a co-location facility in San Antonio.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.720
So because serving up this
type of content is actually

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.600
minimal work for the processor,
this is a pretty old box.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.000
It's like a 500 megahertz box.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:26.600
But what we've noticed is that a box
is capable of pushing at least 60 gigs

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:34.630
a day in content during the event,
and performance hasn't really suffered.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.340
Okay, and then just as a last note,
that after the event, too,

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.300
there is another way,
actually I guess during

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.400
the event as well,
but there is another way to get

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.040
this same content in the form
of a streaming audio service.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.470
And so if you were to go to
the South by Southwest website,

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.150
you could actually download a playlist
file that would show up as essentially

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.490
a continuous streaming audio stream
that you could play in iTunes.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.090
And it's, again,
that too is available through,

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.510
if you want to try that.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.900
We've gotten a lot of feedback on this
being particularly handy to our attendees

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.280
because the big problem that people
have when they attend our event is,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.040
what do I go see?

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.240
You've got, at any given time,
you've got 60 bands playing.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.760
You've got 400 bands a night.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.260
What do I go see?

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.020
So this is one of the real
problems that sort of drives the

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.180
use of new technology for us.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.200
And here, people,
when they're sort of kind

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.060
of figuring out... Oh,
they're thinking about the event.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.290
They can launch this.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.100
And if they hear something,
then they click back to iTunes.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.690
They see the band there,
and then they can basically

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:48.040
easily match that with our
scheduling software on our site.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.620
So we got a lot of good feedback
on just having a continuous

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.910
random stream for those reasons.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:02.260
So really the big takeaways
here are just that,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.910
first of all, that Apple technologies and
open source technologies

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.390
really do play well together.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.120
It's something that you've
probably heard before,

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.380
our experience in trying to do it for
ourselves is that it's really true,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.400
it really is easy, they really do work.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.690
We get a lot of mileage out of using the
standard Apple interfaces for media types

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.380
through iTunes and QuickTime Player,
things of that nature,

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.670
because it gives a very standard
experience for all the users

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.400
that are coming to view or listen
to South by Southwest content.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.310
And it works on Mac and Windows.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.390
Excuse me, didn't quite go there yet.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.400
And again, it's also very simple and
cost effective to set up.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.400
You can get, you know,
everyone that wants to use it, you know,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:47.400
you can get a lot of
people that want to use it,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:47.400
you know, you can get a lot of
people that want to use it,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.160
you know, you can get a lot of
people that want to use it,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.400
you know, you can get a lot of
people that want to use it,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.770
you know,
but they want to listen to this stuff,

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.310
can go get iTunes for free,
they can get QuickTime Player for free,

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:56.400
there's no cost burden on the people who
want to view or listen to the content,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.400
and, you know, that just, that's great.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.730
Nobody wants to pay a lot of money
when they've already paid for Badge,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.440
they just want to find out
what's going on with the bands,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.400
as Scott says.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:11.180
This is just another way that
we integrated audio content.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.800
For the last three years we've
been developing a sort of

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.580
schedule application for Palm OS.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.880
And we had basically a
lot of high demand for,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.190
oh, I want it all in my Palm so that
I can take it with me so that

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.800
I can kind of see and navigate.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.740
So we've been adding more and more
features to this over the years.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.880
Now this year we made it so you could
beam your own personal audio content.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.830
So you could see what
you were going to go see.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.230
And also this was a first
for us this year that we,

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:50.130
via Pocket Tunes,
integrated a connection directly to

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:56.190
that same media server in San Antonio so
that if you're on your Palm and

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:02.100
you have a Treo or something and
you're within a Wi-Fi hotspot area,

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.880
you can listen to the music
directly on your Palm.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.580
So that was a new sort of like
interesting way to kind of integrate and

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:19.520
again bring audio content and rich media
in general through various channels.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.090
Okay, the production quiro.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:30.140
Well, I talked about already
how we use only mini DV,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:35.140
and what I found out when we did
this the first year in 2000 is that

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.930
I had a variety of camera types.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.340
I had a Hi8, I had a mini DV,
somebody else had a DV cam,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.500
and essentially,
given the fact that we're trying to

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.040
get through so much production in such
a short amount of time with resources,

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.400
we really felt like we needed
to standardize so that we

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.970
had one type of tape stock.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.730
So that, you know, we could really,
we wouldn't have to worry about whether

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.270
we had a deck available for a different
type of media at any given time.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.670
So, again,
it's worked to the extent to which

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:08.640
now we turn people away if they
don't have the type of equipment.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.640
In the future,
we might create a higher quality

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.160
production arm as part of our digital
media program and kind of use newer

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.830
high quality technologies that way.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.180
But right now, we've been doing mini DV.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.030
So you've got those and you've got your
editors and your quality reviewers and

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:30.650
sort of the way it works since we're not
normally in the convention center space

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:34.850
is we take a room and we turn it into
an editing suite in about six hours.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.780
And the way we can do that really
easily is by using Apple equipment,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.820
Final Cut Pro.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.040
And we basically get a, you know,
an Ethernet connect

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.520
into one of our subnets.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.940
So that way, we can get a, you know,
an Ethernet connect

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.860
into one of our subnets.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.000
into one of our subnets,
so that we can move content easily.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.180
And we install Final Cut across all the
machines that we have at our disposal,

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.740
which varies from year to year,
depending on all sorts of factors.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:09.600
We also load Cleaner 6 on them.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.140
One year we had a compression
farm available to us,

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.560
a Cleaner Central product.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.380
And we did things a
little bit differently.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.380
We sort of like the minute
we were done editing,

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.420
we compressed.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:24.740
But due to sort of
constraints of compression,

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.860
what we do is we'll edit all day,
and then we'll compress at night.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.240
So we run this editing suite from, say,
9:00 AM to 6:00 PM,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.570
so that people are freed up to
move around at night to get more

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.980
content or to enjoy the event,
heaven forbid.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:46.260
So that's how we sort of produce all
of our digital video in a nutshell.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.710
So this is just a short clip on
basically how to be a pros drummer.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.300
Do you use storyboards at all or do
you sketch out your shots in advance?

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.300
Less and less.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.290
I used to more.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.700
I think that was just insecurity,
like thinking I would be on

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.300
the set and not know what I'm
doing and everybody would wait.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.280
So I would plan out each
shot much more in advance.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.660
But now I've enjoyed

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:52.500
[Transcript missing]

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.220
We'll do 14 after lunch.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.470
Yeah, no problem.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.630
On my set too, though,
we always have this joke of like,

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.150
before lunch it's gone with the wind,
and after lunch it's

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.410
the Dukes of Hazzard.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.020
Right.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.990
Because we do three shots.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:33:05.100
[Transcript missing]

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.500
Here's a photo from this year.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.840
And this is what we used.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.980
Some G5s and then we had a couple
of people bring in their power

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.660
books because they were like,
I really want to edit on my thing.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.900
So we let them do that.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.290
And then we used
Final Cut Pro and Cleaner 6,

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.740
as I said before.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.980
Because of the simplicity of
the sort of plug and play nature

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.500
of this equipment and software,
we don't need to take two days

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.730
to build an editing suite.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.280
You really just bring in the power books.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.810
You bring it in and set
it down and plug it in.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.710
And so this is really a really good
thing for us because then we have

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.370
editing stations that kind of come and
go throughout the week according to,

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.130
well, we need to put this one here.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.830
Oh, and then we need it over here.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.880
So we kind of just balance how many
editors do we have and who's good

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.100
and they'll get heavier workflow.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.350
Again, here's the guidelines.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.420
We really try to find that moment.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:13.040
Rather than get really fancy and
put in motion graphics and do

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.730
all sorts of things like that,
we just try to find the moment,

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:21.630
keep it simple, make a few cuts,
and keep the audio

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:24.950
processing to a real minimum.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.640
Sometimes if you've got a sort of
low quality production on the tape,

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.930
we'll use sort of built-in EQ and filter,
audio filter effects

00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:35.980
that come with Final Cut.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.950
And that's a big reason we don't use,
that we use Final Cut, say,

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:42.880
over something even
more basic like iMovie.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.630
It's because it has the ability
to do the more advanced things,

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.240
but it's also really good at
just doing something simple.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.250
So I'll have an editor who's like, well,
I've worked on Avid forever.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.920
And I'm like, oh,
you can learn Final Cut in five minutes.

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:55.960
minutes.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.660
This is a really good thing for us.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:36:35.300
[Transcript missing]

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.570
So this is just kind of a,
this is another short example of a

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:46.140
piece that I think somebody who was
relatively first time videographer did.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.400
A couple of years ago, yeah.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:50.690
Yeah, so it's short,
but it talks to the things that

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:56.340
Scott was mentioning earlier about
trying to really capture the salient

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.850
key moment of a particular event.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:27.800
[Transcript missing]

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.030
This is a very important point,
which is I want to first

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.980
of all thank my wife.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.540
Here he was doing an introduction
and Q&A at the Paramount Theater,

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:50.670
which is one of Austin's
oldest movie spaces.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.170
Well, there you have it.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:56.740
Oh, you might have noticed that all these
pieces have like a motion bumper sort

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.170
of graphic thing on the front of it.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.470
Well, it's something we've tried to
do for the last three years is

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:06.220
basically make one for interactive
and one for film and one for music.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.930
And we'll basically just take a
finished motion graphics piece

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.640
that a friend of mine was doing
for us and we'll just drop it in.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.140
We'll put it on all the different
editing stations and say,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.250
oh, before you finish up,
we need to drop that in.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:25.100
And it just becomes easily
part of the final cut movie.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:34.340
So let's talk a little bit about
the delivery aspect of this in

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.710
terms of what the goals are with
actually making the media available.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:45.980
And the goal was to have,
basically we recognize that not everybody

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.720
has DSL or even ISDN source of lines.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.750
We still feel like there are enough
people out there that have slow

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.840
connections that we need a low
bandwidth version of the media.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.990
But we'd also like to provide a really
good experience for the people who

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:01.840
really do have the fast connections.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.710
So we want both high and
low bandwidth versions.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:09.240
And obviously we want this to play
in as many platforms as possible.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.360
And of course we get that
with QuickTime because it can

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:16.220
play in a variety of different
browsers on Mac OS and Windows.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.680
It's perfect for what we need.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.130
And you get the standard user
experience no matter which platform

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.890
you're using or what browser.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:29.580
We also get the benefit of we want the
playback to begin as quickly as possible.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.100
We don't want the guy to go
click on a link and then wait

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.800
and watch a progress bar.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.580
There are also cases where we want
some basic content protection with

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.790
the media where you can't just
sort of arbitrarily download it

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.690
and go post it wherever you want.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.610
We really want people
to come to the South by

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.240
Southwest site to get this media.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.470
Also, we didn't want any particular
licensing restrictions in terms

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:53.760
of whatever technologies we use.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.160
Glenn Bullich, Scott Wilcox,
Gary Woodcock We want to make sure that

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.060
we're using the technologies we use
to produce the media and deploy it.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:04.200
So basically MPEG-4 and AAC actually
fit the bill very well for us.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.490
It does well at low bandwidths
and relatively high bandwidths.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.520
It's certainly available
since it's in QuickTime.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.370
It's on Mac OS and Windows.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.400
And since we're delivering
as a QuickTime movie,

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.380
we get all those nice things like we can
get progressive download and fast start.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.940
Glenn Bullich, Scott Wilcox,
Gary Woodcock And we can disable

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.650
saving and all the standard things
that you get as part of using

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.620
QuickTime as your deployment media.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:38.280
So in terms of preparing the media,
in keeping with the keep it

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:42.090
simple sort of philosophy,
we really don't do a lot of filtering,

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.070
and we're always starting
from the same media.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.960
So we don't need 50 different settings,
we're always starting from DV.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.960
And we have a low bandwidth
setting that we used in Cleaner,

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.930
and those are the parameters
for those who are curious.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:00.640
It's basically just the standard
sort of postage stamp video that

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.010
you would get on a 56K modem.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:08.330
But it's MPEG-4, it looks pretty good,
and you have pretty decent audio with it.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.800
For high bandwidth,
we went to a quarter screen 320x240,

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.850
and it's full frame rate,
and you get very nice stereo sound.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.380
And in fact,
the clips that we've actually

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.740
been viewing here are the
exact same high bandwidth clips

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.610
that we encoded for the show.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.380
So they're not something
we've used in the past.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.360
We did special for the show.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.200
It's just what you see up on our website.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.600
So that's what we've
been watching here today,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.980
and it looks pretty good.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.160
So I think Scott touched on
this a little bit earlier.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.740
We do try to do some basic automation.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.790
Cleaner 6 has the ability to
basically have drop folders where

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.850
you can take your source media,
drop it in, and just have it sort of

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.890
automatically run through whatever
settings files you're using.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.750
We use the full resolution
DV media output from Final Cut Pro.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.560
Just drop it into the desktop folder.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.280
The editor doesn't really have
to know anything about it.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:10.290
It gets picked up and processed and
dropped into a review folder for the

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.700
quality reviewer to come and look at.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.760
We also get film trailers for the
people that are doing premieres,

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.430
and we'll encode these
in exactly the same way,

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.500
so they're the high and low bandwidth
versions of the film trailers as well.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.580
They're available during the show,
so if you want to check out to see what's

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:38.130
worth seeing in terms of the premieres,
what kinds of things match your taste,

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.550
you can go check those out.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.990
And they're available before,
actually before the show,

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.740
during the show,
and after the show as well.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.590
One thing I did want to point out
is we have been experimenting with

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:00.870
mobile media and it's a very important
aspect to some of the future directions

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.160
that Scott will talk about later.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.600
Something we've played with is Konoma.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.160
Now this isn't part of QuickTime,
but it is a QuickTime movie exporter.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.380
So it fits very nicely into the
QuickTime centric flow that we

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.160
have in terms of the production.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:24.130
It will run on standard Palm OS devices,
things like the Trios will play it,

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.160
any of the Sony devices.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:33.960
It can be targeted for
playback on any color device.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:37.730
You don't have to necessarily
worry about whether it's going

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.160
to play on a particular version
of Palm OS or a particular model.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.160
Konoma will actually take
care of all that for you.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.800
The interesting thing about this
is that the Palm devices by and

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.110
large have the IR transceiver.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.320
So once somebody has this,
they can actually beam the media

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.160
to another device at the show.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.420
They can, you know,
hey this is a very cool clip or hey

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.160
you might want to go check this out.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.160
They can actually just
beam it to somebody.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160
They can look at it.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160
They can share it.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.160
It kind of just proliferates
on its own throughout the show.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.160
You can also download
these things from the net.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.640
If you've got a web enabled phone,
you can pull these things down

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.160
and play them in the player.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.160
One of the questions you might have is,
well gee, why Konoma?

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.160
Why not 3GPP?

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.850
We're very keen on being
able to do 3GPP stuff.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.550
Currently we find that there's actually
more people with Palm devices that

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.100
attend the show than people with 3GPP.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.160
Probably not a big surprise
to most people in here.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.150
So we are doing the
Konoma stuff right now,

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:47.140
but to go to the 3GPP or say
H.264 in the future really doesn't

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.120
perturb our workflow at all.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.160
It's just another QuickTime plug-in.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.160
We can use the same production
flow we've been using.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.160
It's really no change.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:03.150
So QuickTime really makes this very,
very convenient for us and very flexible.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.900
Okay,
future directions as Gary was saying.

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:15.400
3G is definitely something that
we've been interested in a long time.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.430
And given the sort of content sizes,
the two minute movie,

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.840
the 30 second movie,
we think that this is going to be really

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:30.070
not a very difficult transition for
us in terms of our production change.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:36.370
I think we'd also like to get into some
more sort of full live broadcast stuff.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:41.320
But there's only so many volunteers
and only so much equipment.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:46.200
And basically, there's just we have to
dedicate more resources,

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:50.690
more equipment, and better talent to
basically put and say,

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.680
yeah, we're going to do just
the live broadcast.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.630
The thing is, because we use sort of
volunteer camera people,

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.660
everything they shoot is not good.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.660
I mean, you know,

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:09.010
Right now we've got about 500 hours
of footage from the last four years.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.100
We did 200 of that this year.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:16.040
And I haven't really been
able to watch or log it all,

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.050
definitely not.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.850
And there's some great stuff
and there's some just atrocious,

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.720
like why were you filming the floor?

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.210
And the thing about, you know,
we basically have to put

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.460
a higher quality sort of
production team on the live stuff.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.700
But it's definitely something
we're working towards and something

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.380
we'd like to do in the future.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.060
We also have been,
we did RFID stuff for the first time

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.970
this year and I think we'd also like
to continue to look how our sort of

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:51.600
badging authentication systems because
we have the whole access control thing.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:57.780
How we can get that to play with
the delivery of our digital media,

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.000
you know.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:33.900
[Transcript missing]

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.880
So lots of possible things
to do in the future.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.080
And we're just trying to figure out how
we can come at it at different angles

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:52.610
and utilize the new technologies for
a huge real time sort of deployment.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.100
Kind of, you know,
it is a case-- it's a built

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.120
in case study because every
year we're trying new things.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.110
Oh, that didn't work.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.640
Or wow, that kind of worked.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.120
And you know, and that's just sort
of how we've developed.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.620
And I find that integrating
new technologies available,

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:12.940
especially along the lines
of what we've been using now,

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:16.840
is a great thing for
our attendees to see.

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.210
Because they're in the entertainment
industry and they're thinking,

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:24.010
oh my god, what are we going to do,
you know, with all this new stuff?

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:30.650
How are we going to play in digital
space with the relationships we have?

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.900
So, I mean,
just some closing remarks that we'd

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.240
like you to go away with here is that,
you know, as we talked about at the

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.250
outset of the session,
South by Southwest really has

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:50.180
kind of a different problem than
perhaps a lot of you are used to.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:57.240
It's really about trying to process
a lot of media at a very good

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:02.460
quality level very quickly with high
turnaround and to make it simple.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.040
You know, to keep things very easy,
very simple,

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.580
very reliable so that things don't
break down during the show because

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.620
it is a very compressed time scale.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.100
It can be very stressful.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:17.100
So, QuickTime really helps us with this
problem because I think one of the

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.730
things that perhaps people miss.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.890
about QuickTime is that

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:27.020
If you just do the simple things
with the tools that Apple has,

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.020
the base quality level is
really quite impressive.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:36.190
Yes,
you probably could make some better video

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:39.780
output or perhaps some better compression
than what perhaps you've seen today,

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:43.540
but just what you do out of the
box with the very simple stuff

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:48.010
with fairly untrained people or
novices is really quite amazing.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.340
And QuickTime really makes that possible.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.790
And South by Southwest with
the kind of resources we have,

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:58.930
it really wouldn't be possible
without something like QuickTime.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.410
Well, it eases the learning curve for
the people that are doing the work,

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.580
too, because, oh, I've played with that.

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.150
Oh, I'm familiar with that.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.920
So we've got a whole lot of
people that we work with who

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.450
have already used the products,
are already familiar with trying

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.230
to put their stuff out there.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:19.000
And so we kind of follow along those
lines because there's already enough

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.740
to do with getting our volunteers who
have never worked together before,

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.840
except maybe the year before,
all sort of in this rapid production

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.420
environment and working together and
answering each other's questions.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:39.330
And so the less obstacles and the less
variables we introduce to this situation,

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.490
the better off we are.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:46.590
And then we also have the headway
with the tools to increase quality.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:52.640
As people become better or as we get
return volunteers from years past,

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.380
their skills increase,
the tools are the same,

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.440
it scales as their capabilities
and experiences scale.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.390
Now I guess the other point we'd
like to leave you with is just,

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.960
you know, hey,
it really is easy to integrate

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.920
QuickTime technologies and
Apple technologies with some of these

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.720
open source solutions that are out there.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.990
It takes a little research on the web,
but there's really some amazing things

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:21.700
that you can do integration-wise that may
seem sort of intimidating to start with,

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.280
but really with a little
bit of investigation you can

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.790
do some incredible things,
as David has certainly

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:30.380
shown with the iTunes app.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.800
stuff that we deployed this year.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:39.310
And with that, we have a parting clip of
John Landis talking about

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:41.910
digital tools in filmmaking.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.260
There's no such thing as
the artistry of filmmaking.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.690
This is interesting about film.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.250
Film is not art.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.670
People don't understand that.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:05.890
Film is craft.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:09.780
Filmmakers are craftsmen,
just like carpenters.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.770
But a carpenter can make a chair that

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.890
The Carpenter can be
Charles Eames or Chippendale,

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:21.920
but the vast majority
of chairs are just that,

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:22.300
chairs.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.290
And they're sturdy and they function,
they sit on them.

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:28.970
I have a very dear friend who's a
great filmmaker named David Cronenberg.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:34.470
David actually considers himself an
artist and he's one of the few filmmakers

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:41.250
I know who can seriously discuss his work
as an artist and not sound like a putz.

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:45.450
I mean he's very serious about it and
David's brilliant and I always say,

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.580
"How do you do that,
David?" And I come off like a jerk,

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.260
you know.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.530
Because I know a lot of filmmakers,
very famous filmmakers,

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.940
who discuss their work
like that and I think,

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.430
"Oh, shut the f*ck up." Like who?

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.560
Never mind.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.500
A little bit more.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.500
People always go,
"How do you feel about the lack,

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.300
you know,
the fact that there won't be film

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.490
in ten years?" And there won't be.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.500
It's just, well, that's what's happening.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.050
Filmmaking as a craft is so new.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.480
I mean, we're talking about something
that's a hundred years old.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.500
A hundred years old.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:25.680
I mean, sculpture, painting, you know,
I mean, they've had a lot of time,

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:26.500
you know.

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.500
Filmmakers had a hundred years.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.500
And so,
the equipment's evolving all the time.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.500
And I think the biggest change
in film was probably talkies.

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:39.500
And the first time that happened,
that was a shattering blow

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.490
that I personally don't think
film has ever recovered from.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:43.300
Sound?

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.270
Absolutely.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.500
Because before sound,
film was completely international.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.500
And sound came in and made
it the Tower of Babel.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:54.280
And it just, it's sad.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:55.500
It's sad.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.500
Anyway.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.300
But in terms of tools, they're tools.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.500
And I think everything
depends how you use it.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:08.490
Thanks very much.
