00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.540
Good morning everyone.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.980
Let's get started.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.320
From your desktop
management solutions team,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.270
please welcome
Senior Engineering Manager Michael Lopp.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.980
Good morning everyone.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.400
I hope you've had your
coffee because it's early.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.040
All right.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.460
My name is Michael Lopp.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.470
I am the senior engineering manager
for desktop management solutions.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.740
And we're going to be talking
about a lot of things today.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.450
We're going to be talking about what
Apple's evolving management strategy is.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.280
More importantly,
we're going to be talking about

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.550
what management actually means.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.190
We're going to be talking about
how you're going to be seeing

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.690
this stuff as I'm going to give
you a couple live demonstrations.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.950
And we're also going to give
you some overviews of some of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.710
the features you've probably
heard about in previous sessions.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.830
So let's jump right into it.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.610
What is desktop management?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.980
This is a slide I used last year
and we're still using it because

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.940
it's a pretty good message.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.230
What you're doing out there right now as
you're managing all these machines and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.270
hardware and software is you're probably
going through about three states.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.250
There's a fourth one too.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.630
But the three states
are you're sitting down,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.780
you're getting a new piece of
hardware and you're figuring out

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.680
what needs to go on that machine.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.430
And then you are actually deploying
that machine out to users,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.480
making sure that it has
the right stuff in it.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.920
That's all that needs to be on there.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.700
And you're managing it.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.200
You're making sure the desktop is
correct and has the correct preferences.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.480
And then you're assessing it.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.810
You're trying to figure out, okay,
what information is on this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.080
machine that I need to get back?

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.480
It's this process of all of
this constantly going around.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.050
And that's just for a single machine.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.830
You're adding more hardware.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.620
You're replacing hardware.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.430
You're adding more software.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.120
You're constantly
managing these machines.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.470
And there's another
thing that you're doing.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.640
Things go wrong.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.820
I gave a demo on Tuesday,
which you're going to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.750
see here in a second,
of ARD.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.140
And it went swimmingly well.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.010
We did really well.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.240
But at the very end I did one wrong
thing and something on the end

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.800
of the demo wasn't quite working.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.500
So I had to do a little troubleshooting.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.640
I'm guessing a lot of what you're doing,
a lot of the management tasks

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.010
that you guys are doing,
is troubleshooting.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.450
It's when things go wrong.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.210
And we need to be developing tools
and technology to help you with that.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000
So let's talk about a couple scenarios,
a couple of different

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.270
management scenarios.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.390
You guys seen this slide?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.500
This is University of Tokyo.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.020
That's a whole lot of Macs.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.230
What you probably haven't heard
about this slide is that there's not

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.320
a single hard drive in the screen.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.900
What they're doing is actually what the
University of Tokyo has done in this

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.500
lab is they're disc-lessly netbooting
all of these machines over the wire.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.970
So what their management solution is
is to have a single image on a netboot

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.370
server and then actually boot the
lab up every morning over the wire.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.540
That's pretty cool.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.980
If they want to redeploy
these machines and make it

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.650
something completely different,
they just change the image on the server,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.890
and that's it.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.620
So that's one of the people
that are using our technology.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.440
And this is something that's actually
in Panther's server right now.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.200
Here's another group of
people that we worry about.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.890
Slides?

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.950
There we go.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.870
I call these hostile users.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:05:13.500
[Transcript missing]

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.390
The other thing we've done,
another one of our goals,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.060
is we've got to evolve with technology.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.490
There's a lot of different things
that are happening right now.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.450
First off, you've got wireless,
becoming very prevalent so you don't

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.380
know whether you're going to be
on the network or off the network.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.160
How do you have management policy if
the user is no longer on your network?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.510
You've got portables,
people are opening and closing them

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.800
so they may not be on and off and,
again, they may be leaving the network.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.420
You've got hybrid infrastructure.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.820
You've got PCs, you've got Linux boxes.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.360
I know you have these.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.120
So you've got to be able
to interact with those.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.800
So what you're going to see here
is we put some features in to allow

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.920
you to interact with some of those.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.450
And the other thing is you've got an
explosion of Mac OS X applications that,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.410
again, you're going to want
to manage these things.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.910
So we're going to show you
guys a bunch of stuff today to

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.500
actually help you with that.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.800
Okay.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.330
So first thing we're going to
do here is we're going to talk

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.400
about Apple Remote Desktop 2,
which I believe you

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.960
now all have a copy of.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.200
So we're going to give
you guys a demo of that.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.640
We're going to go into some detail there.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.800
We're going to talk a little
bit about Workgroup Manager.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.570
We've got a new preference management
strategy we're going to give you

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.530
guys a good demonstration of.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.280
We're going to talk about the
mobile home directories feature.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.180
This is the feature
that you're expecting,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.920
a mobile home directory.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.080
We're going to talk about system
imaging and we're going to talk

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.860
about software update server as well.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.370
We don't have demos for all of
these and some of these are actually

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.320
not in the DVD that you have,
but we're going to give you a lot of

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.930
detail around each of these features.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.960
Okay.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.980
Let's move along.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.940
Okay.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.080
ARD.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.240
This has been my life for
the past three months.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.520
This is all I've been doing.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.320
For those of you,
how many of you have used ARD 1.2?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.380
Excellent.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.400
Wow, that's just about everyone.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.040
Have you seen this screen before?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.880
This is the 1.2 screen right now.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.800
This is a little long in the tooth
is the way that I think about it.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.560
It's a very useful interface,
but it's sort of dated.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.060
Then you have our favorite multi-observe,
four windows open, that's it, you know,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.400
very modal interface.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.280
So what we've done over the past year

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:30.010
: We've completely redone it.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.010
We've completely redone ARD 1.2,
I mean ARD into the

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.010
Apple Remote Desktop 2 product.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.090
It's pretty.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.100
It's not just pretty, but what it is,
it's also extremely useful.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.450
We're going to go into a
big demo of it right now.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.070
You can look.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.610
We've kind of adopted the iTunes
interface for Management Console.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:08:52.800
[Transcript missing]

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:58.940
Really quickly, some big ticket features
that we put into ARD.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.600
As you saw already,
we've got the brand new user interface.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.930
We've improved multi-observe vastly.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.400
We've introduced a task metaphor.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.590
The task is basically any action that
you can do against a set of computers,

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.940
you can actually save that, reuse it,
schedule it, schedule it again and again.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.960
So we've given that and made that
kind of a first class object.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.890
We've integrated scheduling into tasks,
as I just said.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.990
So it's really easy to have a set
of tasks that you can actually use

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.680
and reuse on a scheduled basis.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.320
You're going to see scanners everywhere.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.410
First thing you're going to do when
you pull this out of the box is

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.130
you're going to go look for machines,
right?

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.950
So we're giving you a lot of
different ways to actually find

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.480
all your assets on the network.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.040
From the architectural perspective,
again, we've totally rewritten

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.680
screen sharing on VNC.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.320
This is an open protocol and
it means that you can actually

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.700
go and observe the data.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:44.700
So we've added a lot of
different things to the network.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:44.700
We've added a lot of different
things to the network.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:44.700
So we've added a lot of
different things to the network.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:44.730
So we've added a lot of
different things to the network.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.240
observe a PC or Linux or anyone
who's running VNC on the server.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.750
And we've also added some great,
amazing speed improvements to it as well.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.360
You're going to see much,
much better performance

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.740
than against Arity 1.2.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.500
You guys are going to like this one.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.140
We put a SQL database as well.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.460
There's a SQL database behind that's
holding all the reporting data.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.000
And if you want to,
you can go and access that and use

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.640
it for whatever means that you want.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.260
Thank you.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.280
So, and also we've done an offline
reporting architecture,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.400
which is to address
the mobile deployments.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.230
What this is,
is currently in the ARD 1.2 product,

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.030
you're all reporting and
everything the admin needs to be

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.310
running to get all the reports.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.980
What we've done is we've allowed
you to specify an alternate data

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.720
source for reporting information.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.880
So you can actually have clients which
are reporting up to that data source

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.620
whether or not the admin's running.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.510
So that way you can always have
up-to-date data about your deployments,

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.870
whether or not the machines are there,
or whether or not the

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.160
admin is running as well.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.500
My favorite feature, send Unix.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.200
This is a command that allows you to send
any Unix command to your set of machines.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.800
If you can do it in Unix,
you can do it via ARD.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.040
I'm going to show this in a second.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.010
It's very exciting.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.410
We've got more ASP than ASP.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.090
We've got a huge amount of
data that you can actually pull

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.720
out of these machines as well.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.270
We've got directory integration
and we've also really

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.080
simplified client installation.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.630
So, enough of me talking.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.740
Let's go to two here
and take a look at this.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.580
But first I'm going to get my water.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:21.150
There it is, running right now.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.480
We've got our set of remote
desktops over here on our left.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.220
These nine machines that
I'm going to be controlling.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.960
So just a quick lay of the land in ARD.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.360
What we got here is, like I said,
it's sort of an iTunes interface.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.160
Over here on the left you've got
all our different computer lists.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.260
I've got my master list.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.400
I've got a test list.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.440
I've got my problem children.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.940
I've got a video lab.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.280
I've got a bunch of different machines.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.480
These are all just basically
my assets that I have here.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.620
I have the scanner,
which I'll go to in a second.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.280
It gives me the ability to
actually scan for machines.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.680
And then I've got the save task feature.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.920
What this is, is this is just a set
of tasks that I've kept.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.290
And these are just dummy tasks,
but just to give you an idea

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.760
of some of the things we do,
we've got a locked video lab.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.590
That's just a task to
close that lab down,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.800
make sure the screen
kind of looks like this.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.010
It means, everybody go home.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.980
Really simple.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.340
Thank you.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.960
So what you saw here when I did,
I just executed our first task and I want

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.270
to give you guys a little bit of an
explanation about what we're looking at.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.340
We have the main window here and
what happened when I ran the task

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.040
was this task progress came up.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.210
But the task progress is the
detail about everything that

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.940
just happened in that task.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.700
So what I did was I went and
ran a task against its machine

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.510
and it succeeded really easily.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.580
What you have up here on the left,
as we call these the select-o-matics,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.150
we call that that,
I'm not sure what marketing calls it.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.200
But what these do is these actually
allow you to select groups of computers

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.280
based off of what their state was.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.230
Since everything worked here,
everything is selected.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.930
But if you had some tasks
that actually failed,

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.900
reporting didn't happen,
something didn't occur,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.290
you can actually go and
easily select it and do that.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.290
These task progress show up
for every task that you run.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.420
If you don't want this coming up,
you can turn it off and just have a

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.790
preference and via the preferences
and you can just look at it here.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.730
Again, here's the task that
just ran right there.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:29.570
: All right.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:29.570
And so that's just a quick
overview of the interface.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:29.570
Oh, the other thing is we've --
ARD does a lot of different tasks.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:29.570
I've got to show you guys this.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:29.570
There's a lot of things you can do,
right?

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:29.570
And there's other commands in there
that do things you can't even imagine.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:29.570
So

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.770
We'll go ahead and we'll
actually create a scanner first.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.660
So what I'm going to do here is
I'm actually scanning a local

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.340
network and ironically I'm seeing
all of my machines right there.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.910
Let's go ahead and first unlock them.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.920
Another task.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:14:06.190
. Let's go ahead and
create a scanner now.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.190
You can create as many of
these scanners as you want.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.190
So let's go ahead and create one.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.190
Let's see.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.190
These are all the machines
that we're currently seeing.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.190
I'll go ahead and create
a new one from this list.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.190
We'll call this WWDC live.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.190
.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.120
There it is.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.020
It's a pretty simple thing.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.310
Just a list of computers.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.180
But what you're going to see
is any time that you can see

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.020
a list of computers using ARD,
multi-observe, reports,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.190
you can constantly create lists from this
to actually make yourself Post-it notes,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.480
is what I call them,
to actually say I need to do this or

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.740
that to a certain set of machines.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.400
So we have our WWC live list right here.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.360
But let's tackle this.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.420
Maybe I have a different way
that I want to look for machines.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:36.470
Maybe you've got an Excel spreadsheet
that has all of your assets in it.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:45.620
It's really easy via the file import
to actually just drag any arbitrary

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.620
file that's got IP addresses.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.620
You can just take it, plop it in there.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:15:04.420
: So, we're going to go ahead
and start the session.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.420
And we scan it.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.420
Any file.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.420
As long as it's got IPs,
we're going to find it.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.420
So, PDF, Excel, whatever you want.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.420
So, however you're managing it.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.420
And as I go and edit that file,
if I just want to reload it,

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.420
I can just reload it and, again,
start creating lists from there.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.170
So once you've got your set of machines,
the first thing you're probably

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.260
going to want to do is you want
to upgrade them because everyone's

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.520
probably running ARD 1.2 right now.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.500
These are all actually up
to the 2.0 client right now,

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.380
but just to quickly show you how
easy it is to take ARD 1.2 and

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.380
bring it up to the 2.0 is we've
got an upgrade client software.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.580
If these machines were 1.2,
what you'd see is you'd

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.420
actually see them in there.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.990
You can authenticate to them,
but the current status would

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.280
be old software ARD 1.2.4.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.410
All you have to do to actually
upgrade it is select those machines,

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.270
click upgrade, we install a package,
we restart the agent, you're golden.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:42.730
That's it.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.940
It's a single click to
upgrade all the software.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.320
It's a really handy feature.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.040
So let's actually do
a different task here.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.940
What I want to actually do is
I'm going to change some client

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.460
settings on these machines.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.680
Let's go ahead and walk
through client settings.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.520
Now what client settings is
doing is it actually setting

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.670
the preferences for the client.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.770
So let's say the agent software
has already been upgraded.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.210
So I want to set some preferences.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.650
I want the menu extra to be there.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.440
Again, so we kind of have a setup
assistant kind of walk through.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:19.580
We'll go through and we're going to say
I'll leave the startup element enabled.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.900
I'll leave the menu bar running.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.020
I'm not going to create
any users right now.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.660
I'm not going to specify
any access privileges.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.100
I am going to talk about
this one really quickly.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.330
But this setting here,
this first one here,

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.190
set request permission option,
this is guest access.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.930
This is one of the most requested
features that we've had.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.260
What this is is the ability to say, okay,
I maybe have some

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.320
politics at my deployment.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.570
I have people that are
fine with my desktop,

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.370
but I want them to ask before they go in.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.660
So what guest access allows
you to do is to specify,

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.170
okay, I can be observed and controlled,
but only at my permission.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.710
So what will happen when you set this
permission is it will actually prompt --

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.480
when you go to control one of the users,
it will actually prompt them and say,

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.800
do you want this person
to actually help you out?

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.620
So they get at least -- they get to
be -- respond and allow you to run

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.080
it -- allow them to be observed.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.490
You can also set this VNC viewer access.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.640
So if you have a VNC viewer
that you want to use,

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.630
we can actually do that in here as well.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.720
What I'm going to do just for
this demo is actually set some

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.950
of the system information.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.190
Go ahead and set the field there.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.630
Set that.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.840
What you're seeing again, here it is,
the task window.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.640
It's everywhere.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.020
Any time you run a task,
you're going to see this.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.670
Just real quickly to give you a
little bit of detail about this,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.440
what you see down here
are these two buttons.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.180
These are always on every single task.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.900
This gives you the ability
to schedule a task.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.400
This was in the current product,
but now we've made it really easy to use.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.600
And also, if you want to target
it at a set of machines,

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.840
you can do that as well here.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.930
We're just going to
go ahead and run this.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.780
I'm just going to set one client setting,
one system information setting.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.860
We'll go ahead and just
copy it down there.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.680
See our task progress going.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.660
See the status changing on
all the machines over there?

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.560
You're not going to see anything
there as it goes and installs a

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.250
package and changes all the settings.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.320
changes all the settings.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.660
Little bit more about the
buttons and the task progress.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.070
You see these other-- you see
these other bezel buttons up here.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.580
What these allow you to do
is actually repeat tasks.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.940
Or if you want,
you want to actually duplicate it,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.400
you can easily just create
another task based off that.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.670
So if you've got something
that you want to say,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.510
well, I was close with this task,
but it wasn't everything that I wanted,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.610
you can actually create another
task right there as well.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.600
Lots of flexibility.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.260
Okay.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.900
So we've updated our client software.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.670
We've done some settings.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:48.590
Let's do that lock screen again
because that's always interesting.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.590
I'm going to lock it.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:19:09.030
It's pretty handy.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.030
So let's actually do some
real world scenarios.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.030
Let's say that we've got a new
version of Safari out there.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.030
You want to know whether or not
these systems have Safari or not,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.030
or which version they have.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.030
I have a version on this
machine that I want to use.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:14.480
: I happen to know they
all have the same version,

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.190
but for the sake of the demo,
let's go ahead and

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.040
just generate a report.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.400
You guys all use 1.2.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.930
You're all wondering,
how did that report come up so quickly?

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.420
Because normally it's this live
active report that you see in 1.2.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.320
What happened is,
is what I was talking about earlier,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.730
is we have a SQL database under there.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.270
And what I was doing is I was
actually running the report from

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.420
a cache that was built a while
ago based off my reporting policy.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.200
If it was the first time that
this report had actually been run,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.580
it would have been a little
bit longer as the machine was

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.260
actually caching and doing that.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.850
So.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.300
Let's see here.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.840
This is our report window.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.630
Again, it's a computer list.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.940
If I want to create a list from here,
it's really simple.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.590
Let's say, hypothetically,
that these four machines have

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.500
an older version of Safari.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.190
Just like every other window,
I can go ahead and

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.780
create a list from this.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.070
I'll call this old Safari.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.340
Safari old.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.720
All right.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.940
Now I have yet another
list that I work from.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.540
And again,
the idea here is I left a little

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.860
mental note for myself saying,
OK, these have old version Safari.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.530
I want to copy something down to this.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.940
So let's go ahead and
actually copy down a package.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.950
And we're getting into sort of the
software distribution features of ARD.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.660
What we're going to do here is we're
actually going to copy a package.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.020
This is a dummy package that is designed
for speed rather than usefulness.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.090
We'll go ahead and I've got
this dummy Safari package,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.790
which is actually going to just
copy it down just to give you an

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.420
idea of the install package feature.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.580
This is something that we had in 1.2.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.200
So it's the same feature with the whole
new task metaphor wrapped around it.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.730
You can install any set of packages.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.450
What's going to happen here is the
package is going to be copied down,

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.840
and the install is going to be run.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.170
And it's going to be installed.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.570
Let's go ahead and just do that.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:12.430
Again, detailed task progress,
copying the package down.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:13.490
It's installing?

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.300
Success.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.560
Knock on wood, everything's going swell.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.600
Okay, so what we did there was we
actually copied it down and now

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.760
we installed whatever package
we had just had right there.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.260
So let's actually verify that.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.590
Let's go ahead and open up
Safari on these applications,

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.960
on these machines over here.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.630
So what I'm going to go ahead and
do is use the open application task.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.310
Again, tasks just like any other.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:40.310
What we're seeing here is all of the
applications I have on the local machine.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.110
I'll go down to Safari.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.540
"Wherever that is, S,
go ahead and open it.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.670
And it's opened."

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.500
Great.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.380
We're on the internet.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.660
Excellent.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.450
Okay, so let's go ahead now and
close the application.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.710
Close the application.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.320
Oh, there is no close application.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:05.780
That's right.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.810
We don't have a close
application command.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.320
This gives me an opportunity to
show you something really cool.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:16.880
We have a command called sendunix
that we added as a part of ARD2.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.300
Sendunix is pretty much
what it sounds like it is.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.300
It's the ability to send a Unix
command to any machine that you want.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.420
Remember,
you're running as root on both sides,

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.300
so don't get yourself in trouble.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.610
So what I'm going to do here is
I'm actually going to go and since

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:35.300
I don't have a closed application,
I'm going to type kill all Safari.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.350
Again,
what this is doing is this is sending

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.290
this command to all of these machines.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.300
Let's go ahead and click send.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.200
All the windows are gone.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.900
Success.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.900
Send Unix.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.810
I don't know what you guys
are going to do with this,

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.210
but it's a lot of flexibility.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.000
It's a lot--you can do some
amazing amount of stuff there.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.980
For example,
let's just do a couple other examples.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.280
Let's go ahead and let's say
I didn't know there was an

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.470
open application command,
so I'm going to go ahead

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:11.560
and use the open command,
"set via send unix,"

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:34.500
[Transcript missing]

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:57.300
[Transcript missing]

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:58.500
That was SendUNIX.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.700
Let's talk a little bit
more about reporting here.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.000
As I said a little bit earlier,
we have the ability to have offline

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.660
collecting of reporting data.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.710
Let me just show you guys
how we actually set that up.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.360
I'm actually not going to demonstrate it,
but just to give you an idea from the

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.750
admin perspective what you need to do.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.480
So here's my preferences window.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.160
I'm going to go ahead and
jump over to data collection.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.320
What you see here is
I have the ability to say,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.490
listen, don't get reporting data from me.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.240
Get it from somewhere else.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.630
You can set that there.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.090
Then if you wanted to change
for the clients to say,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.500
okay,
don't use me as a reporting resource.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.900
Use someone else.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.120
It's again,
it's very similar to everything

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.130
else that I've been showing you.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.700
You just set the reporting policy.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.920
Here it is, the task again.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.950
What this says to these client
machines is don't use me.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.170
Use someone else and do it this often.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.900
Again, so this is the idea is to give you
the ability to have mobile computing

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.460
dumping the data to a mobile computer
is dumping the data to this database

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.640
so you always have a fresh set of data.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.270
As fresh as it can be, right?

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.520
Because you can't actually get data
from a machine that's not there,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.160
but you can get the
last time it was there.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.860
So we're improving the likelihood that
you can get a good quality report from

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.010
the set of machines that you're managing.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.340
All right.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.150
So let's do a little bit more.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.720
Let's try a file search.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.130
I'm going to go ahead
and do a file search.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.440
I'm going to search for the word --
I'm going to search for "incredibles."

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.340
Well, incredible.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.190
Go ahead.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.440
We'll go ahead and do that.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.500
Again, nice and fast.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.850
First time you do it,
it may be a little bit slower,

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.940
but the second time,
it will be nice and fast.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.550
We'll go ahead and see this.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.020
We found what looks like
a QuickTime movie here.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.830
Again, I want to go back to the idea
that all of these windows,

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.300
the paths that you can do against them,
the verbs that you can do to them,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.760
you can do in any of these windows.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.900
So I've got a report here.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.390
This is just a static
report and set of data.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.340
It's actually not.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.040
It's a computer list which says,
this computer has this

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.000
set of information on it.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.360
So I'm going to go ahead.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.320
: I found these things,
go ahead and start running,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:02.300
go ahead and open it with whatever
the associated application is,

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.700
which in this case is QuickTime.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.380
You're going to see a
trailer here in a second.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.910
It's The Incredibles.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.640
But again, this is visually interesting,
but what is really interesting

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.650
is how you're going to use this.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.600
In a lab situation or maybe in some
sort of institutional situation,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.140
it's a really handy way of
actually opening applications,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.250
setting an initial state for
the desktops that you want.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.920
And once again, we have success.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:28.920
All right.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:34.670
So what I want to do here is
now that I've got this trailer

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.680
running and you're all distracted,
you're looking at that,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.810
you're not looking at me anymore.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.210
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to actually reuse one of these

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.670
tasks down here just to show you a
little flexibility of the interface.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.640
So I have the send
Unix command down here.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.720
That was system setup.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.630
What was this one?

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:47.590
This was open that.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.540
So what was I doing?

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.190
I forgot that command that I liked.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.150
Oh, it was kill all.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:51.900
That's right.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.610
So let's go ahead and use this again.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.290
I just did it.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.610
I duplicated the task.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.290
And quick time player.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.610
I'll go ahead and send it.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.520
All cleaned up,
except for the one that I didn't select

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.830
because I probably didn't do them all.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.020
That's right.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.560
So I'll duplicate it again.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.080
And this time since
I missed the other ones,

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.110
what I'm going to do here is
I'm actually going to grab the

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.830
ones that I didn't run against,
remove the ones we

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.320
already did it against,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:26.180
: Grab the ones we are still running on,
drag those over into the well.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.180
Let's get a little real estate here.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.180
Drag those over into the well.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.700
Again, these windows,
it's not a modal interface.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.900
We've gotten rid of all the
modality of the interface.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.700
You see what I'm doing
is I'm jumping around,

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.370
moving stuff between different wells.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.960
If you had a little
more real estate here,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.190
I can imagine a lot of task windows,
the task progress maybe

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.490
being up all the entire time.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.550
It's a flexible tool.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.650
So go ahead and send this command
to kill the QuickTime player,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.210
which is still running.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:28:09.200
[Transcript missing]

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.120
What we're going to do now is
we're going to go into a little

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.200
bit of the more demoable features
of ARD because they're so visual.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.620
As I've already showed you a
little bit of the reporting and the

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.440
other features that we have here,
what we're going to get into is

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.350
some of the interaction stuff.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.390
So what I'm going to do to set this
up is I'm going to do another powerful

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.410
feature kind of akin to signed Unix.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.080
What I'm going to do is I'm going
to copy an Apple script down.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.300
This Apple script is just doing some
finder stuff to actually give a little

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.060
visual interest to the screen here.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.990
But again,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.600
copy it down and I'm going to run it.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.320
And the idea here is that
you could do whatever sort of

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.960
Apple script you want to do.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.650
It's a good way to actually
distribute some sort of automated

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:48.980
tasks that you want to do.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.790
Again, who knows what you're
going to do with it.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.400
You're just giving the ability to do so.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.490
I'm going to go ahead
and copy the items down.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:18.350
What I have here is I'll
go ahead and copy items.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.350
A little bit of detail on this one here.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.350
This is very similar
to the one-two feature.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.350
It's basically saying, OK,
go ahead and copy this file down.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.350
I'm going to actually put it
on the user's home directory.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.350
And the thing I'm going to do here that's
different is I'm actually going to say,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.350
once it's there, kind of like we did with
the Incredibles trailer,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.350
I'm going to say, go ahead and open it.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.440
I already have it there,
so what it's saying to me is like,

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.720
listen,
are you sure you want to overwrite this?

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.550
You bet I do.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.020
Okay, once again, success.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.760
Here goes the screens.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.690
In the demo on Tuesday,
everyone just started watching that.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.750
I don't want you to watch that.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.900
I want you to watch me.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.590
So, locked.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.830
Andy.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.040
Hi.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.880
Okay.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.360
So what's going on behind
the screen right now is the

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.500
Finder script is still running,
but as I showed you right there,

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.400
this gives you the ability to
kind of focus the attention.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.760
Again, this is more for sort
of the institutional,

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.840
the lab situation.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.520
So let's go ahead and unlock those.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.900
Let's talk a little bit
about observe and control.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.480
Everything seems to be
going along reasonably well.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.680
You see here as the students
are sitting at their desktop,

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.340
the current application
status is changing.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.680
This one's in Finder.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.820
This one's now in TextEdit.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.640
I don't know why,
but they're moving along.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:21.540
So let's go ahead and start up with
what ARD 1.2 used to look like.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.320
There you go.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.000
You've got your four screens.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.170
You've got your students doing
whatever they're doing right now.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.880
But you know, there's a lot more machines
out there than four,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.500
right?

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.510
What you want to do is you want
to look at a lot of machines.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.340
And maybe you don't
want it to be that size,

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.780
you want it to be this size.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.520
Maybe you want it to be this size.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.180
Who knows?

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.160
Multi-observe is vastly improved.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.010
Whether you've got two machines or 200,
this is going to be a really

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.560
handy way for you to actually
look at these machines.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.080
Let's just quickly go
through the task bar.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.120
What you have up here is all the
tasks that you can do against it.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.060
Just like we can do in any other list,
all the tasks work.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.340
So let's do this,
my favorite command today.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.300
Lock all the screens.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.180
It's just like any of the other Windows.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.270
Anything else you want
to do to these machines,

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.200
any other tasks you want to run,
you can do.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.780
So we'll go ahead and select them all,
unlock them.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.830
Closing again.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.800
They're merrily going along.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.150
This first slider up here
gives you the ability to adjust

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.940
how many machines you want.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.400
Again, you want four, you want two.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.090
How many do you want?

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.060
What's on the next page?

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.010
Maybe I want to look at two and I want
to see something on the next page.

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.670
Hi, I'm Mike Lopp.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:41.100
I'm a computer scientist at
the University of Michigan.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.620
I'm going to talk about
the new technology that's

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.170
coming out in the future.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:52.690
I'm going to talk about
the new technology that's

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.200
coming out in the future.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.490
I'm going to talk about
the new technology that's

00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.490
coming out in the future.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.640
If I want to adjust the time,
I can just adjust it over here.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.600
I've turned it off right now because,
you know,

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.300
after a while it kind of gets annoying.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:10.070
But, so the other thing is we actually
have the ability to change the

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.460
codec that's being used right now.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.360
So what you're seeing right
now is thousands of colors.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.980
If you want to go to a different one,
you can go up to millions or

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.520
you can go down to grayscale.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.600
Why would I want to go to grayscale?

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.880
Why don't I want full color?

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.690
You don't want this because it's
taking up a lot of bandwidth.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.000
Maybe you're really starved for
bandwidth and you want it to look

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.580
like a very old version of some OS.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.920
who knows?

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.880
But the idea is here these codecs
give you the ability to adjust your

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:39.000
multi-observe session to whatever
your bandwidth situation might be.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.830
So let's go back up to a
little more color here.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.270
Give us a little more
machines to work with.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:33:08.400
: Again, I'm going to hammer this
and keep on saying this one

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
because it's really important.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
There's a lot of flexibility here.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
Before,
you had a multi-observed window open.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
You couldn't do anything else.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
You were looking at the machines.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
You weren't getting the cool cube effect.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
Now you can do whatever you want.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
You want to open this one here.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
Okay, let's do that one.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
I want to control this one here.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
I missed it, sorry.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.400
Control that one over here.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.340
Click.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:09.660
There we go.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.030
Oops.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.230
Slow down.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.040
Control that.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:12.720
There we go.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.460
Here's our second window open.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.010
Sorry, I don't really want them that big.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.930
I want this one this big.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.740
Sorry, students.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.580
Excellent.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.460
Thank you.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.340
It's really flexible.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.930
Again, what you're going to do with it,
how you're going to set it up, who knows.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:31.580
We've given you the tools to get yourself
into whatever sort of trouble you want.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:32.730
All right.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.990
In a single observe,
you're going to see a couple

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.820
different options here.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.570
What I'm seeing here is I'm
looking at this machine right now,

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.330
and I'm actually not controlling it.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.020
And I know that because
I've got this icon up here,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.100
which is sort of the universal
control icon that we have.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:50.230
If I wanted to take control,
all I need to do is click it.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:50.710
Boom.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.770
I'm in control now.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.600
Click on system preferences.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.180
It's doing its little
bouncy thing over there,

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.290
and it popped up.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.320
These scripts are still running,
so I'm sort of fighting for

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.760
contention with them right now,
but it gives you the idea.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.940
The other one here is the ability to
actually share the cursor with the user.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:10.430
If you want to,
you can actually turn that on and off.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.180
So if someone's fighting
for you with a cursor,

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.800
you can just turn it off,
and they don't have any cursor control.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.440
They can still see what
you're doing on the machine,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.110
but they can't actually
start dragging with it.

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:23.400
Mark, who you'll be talking with shortly,
was messing with me the other day when

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.080
he was sitting at one of the machines,
so I just turned it off.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.760
The other thing that you can see
is maybe you've got some sort

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.960
of weird resolution situation.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.500
Maybe you're looking at one
of these massive machines.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.100
Maybe you want a lot more detail.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.860
If you've got less resolution,
we've actually added a

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.880
new mode called panning.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.880
Oops,
that's not a very good version of that,

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:42.960
which allows you to...

00:34:43.100 --> 00:35:02.800
[Transcript missing]

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.000
Let's go ahead and close this.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.490
And we talked a little about the colors.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.040
We talked a lot about a lot of stuff.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.810
So the other one is-- we
talked about controlling,

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.260
and we talked about observing.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.730
Now the other one that we have is the
ability to actually send the screen.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.220
Sending the screen is
sort of a special case.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.400
Because what you're doing is
you're actually going to send

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.270
this screen from this machine
to all of the other computers.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.090
This isn't popular for maybe in a
training situation when you want to say,

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:27.570
watch me.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.370
Take a look at this.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.060
You can actually give people a live demo.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.040
It's using the same technology
as Observe and Control.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.690
Amen.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.420
I want to talk about
this window really quick.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.120
What's going on here is I'm
going to share this screen.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.240
But you see there's another option there.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.640
It says share another screen.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.800
What you can do with ARD2 and
the prior version as well is you

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.910
can actually broken an agreement
between two machines and say,

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.020
listen,
this gentleman's screen over here,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.300
I want you to see the rest
of the screen anywhere.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:58.570
You can set up whatever arbitrary
screen sharing relationships you want.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.590
Again, schedulable and all the
other things are there.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:00.590
So here we go.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.800
There I am in eight machines.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.300
One thing you probably notice is
the task progress is still up.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.150
What happened there was
this task is still going on,

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.600
right?

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.960
The screen sharing is still going on,
so you're actually getting

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.630
that idea and you're getting an
interesting redraw effect as well.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.040
I'll just erase that.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:19.710
Okay.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.150
So we'll go ahead and stop that.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:38.100
[Transcript missing]

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:43.840
So that's a really quick,
super fast version of ARD.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.140
Just to get us cleaned up and start up,
what we're going to do is

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.980
something that's a lot of fun,
is actually going to go and

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.250
restart all these machines.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.050
This is the thing that didn't
work on the demo on Tuesday.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.640
We're actually going to
do it right this time.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.370
What we're going to do is actually--
we have these scripts running.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.800
Some of these things
have text edit running.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.380
So I'm about to actually lose
some data because I have text

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.880
edit files with data in there.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.970
But we have the ability to actually
restart and just close the user.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.660
So maybe at the end of the day,
you actually want to just shut them

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.230
all down or restart them in this case.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.500
Thank you.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.820
Oh, there's one more thing.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.320
Sorry.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.500
There was one more thing.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.250
So all these machines
are offline right now.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.500
They're black, right?

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:31.070
There's one other thing that's a
really good benefit of screen sharing

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.070
is we've got this one machine here.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:32.200
says VNC.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.760
You're probably wondering what that is.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.540
You can probably guess at this point.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.640
This is another machine.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.580
You don't actually have all
the ARD functionality on it,

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.350
such as all the tasks,
but what you do have is you

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:49.250
have the ability to control this
machine if you need to in a pinch.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.250
Yeah.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.920
We like to make fun of it,
but the fact of the matter is you guys

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.850
got a lot of different hardware out
there and you need to interact with this.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.050
So here we have a PC under there
that we have the ability to control.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.700
Just like anything else,
you're running it,

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.690
you can actually use it.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.320
You've got a remote desktop for PCs.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.610
This is a great feature.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.870
If it's a Linux box, if it's a PC,
whatever you want,

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.080
you now have the ability
to observe and control.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.340
It's important to remember
that you don't have the ability

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.400
to do all the other tasks.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.190
That's a whole other
part of our technology.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.340
You can't do the copy items.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.920
It's just a screen sharing piece.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.540
So that's ARD 2.0.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.680
If you guys like it,
I'd like to hear a round of applause.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.910
because we've been working
our tails off on that.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.650
Okay, so that's ARD.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.900
And there's a lot more coming.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.630
All right.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.900
First off, with mobile home directories.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.010
You guys aren't going
to get a demo of this,

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.830
but you're going to hear
a lot about it right now.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.920
I have an apology first.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.400
We had a feature in
Panther called Mobile Accounts.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.880
And you guys said, mobile accounts?

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.800
That's a great feature.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.900
I want to have the ability to
actually cache my local account.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.270
But a lot of people said, listen,
does it actually cache

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.440
my entire home directory?

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.600
No, it actually doesn't.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.920
It was just the account.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.530
So Panther was mobile accounts.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.020
What Tiger will have is a feature
called Mobile Home Directories.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.500
This is the feature
that you're expecting,

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.660
right?

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:18.660
This is the ability to have

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:22.880
This is the ability to have
essentially a mobile home directory.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.700
That's the best way to call it.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.930
The idea is to provide a
mobile solution for portables.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.070
Portables are on the network
and they're off the network.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:41.020
You want your home directory to be
local so that you can actually have

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.110
a mobile solution so that when the
network's there you can actually use it.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.020
We want to leverage the
convenience of network storage.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:51.160
If you've got a network
home or a network mount,

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.220
you want to actually have it be there,
back up to it.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.290
The other thing is we want
to build a solution on top

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.580
of the file sync services.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.290
They're actually building
into Tiger as well.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.420
So let's talk about how it works.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.370
So here's a pretty standard basic setup.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.020
What you're seeing here is actually
for mobile home directories,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.660
the basic use case is this.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.280
I'm a user.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:12.700
I'm this gentleman right
here in the front row.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.370
I log in.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.680
I'm an admin, I'm sorry.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.000
I go and I say,
this gentleman's account is mobile now.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.790
What happens is,
the first time he logs in,

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:22.140
he gets a warning.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.560
He says, listen,
you're about to go mobile.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.380
Do you want to cache your account
in your local home directory?

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.750
And he gets to choose something.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.340
He gets to basically choose
what we call the truth.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.410
The truth is this.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.960
The truth is saying, listen,
I'm the user.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.070
I'm smart enough to know that either
my local home directory is the current

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.760
version of the directory I want,
or the server version is.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:39.440
And they pick it.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.480
And they say,
my local home directory is the

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:42.880
one that I want to be using.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.880
And then we go, and it copies via the
synchronization services.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.500
It copies it from one direction to
the other in whatever choice you had.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.240
You could also say, I trust my admin.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.990
My admin's home directory up on the
server is the one I want to be used,

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.130
and I'll sync it down.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.560
And then what happens is, nothing.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.310
Actually, one little thing happens.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.480
It's trickle syncing.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.000
As you're making changes,
to the local home directory,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.930
they're being synced
back up to the server.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.940
You're not seeing this in any other
way except via the menu extra.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.440
What happens, and this is the cool part,
is when the network goes away,

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.460
you just have your home directory.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.910
It's just sitting there,
and it's waiting for the

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.260
network mount to come back.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.100
But in all the changes,
nothing's happening.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.370
There's no network bandwidth there.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:27.600
It's just sitting there waiting.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.700
When those network mounts come back,

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.230
The synchronization occurs again.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.830
So this is a very, very,
very powerful feature.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.880
This is something that everybody wants,
because everyone has portable computers.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.720
They may have a network home directory.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.880
So let's talk about the--

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.080
Let's talk about the case
that everyone cares about.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:51.350
This is an error case that
everyone wonders about.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.110
Because what if the
dog does eat my iBook?

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.230
Right?

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.700
What that means is what
if my iBook vanishes?

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.270
And this case actually really
gives you a good example of what

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.060
this power of this feature is.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.900
So this is the scenario we care about.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.250
Let's just walk it through.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.340
So how we can-- let's talk
about how mobile homes solve it.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.740
First off,
let's just say the iBook is eaten.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.110
OK.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.760
So the user somehow gets a new iBook,
right?

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:22.740
And they've already logged in once
before using the mobile accounts feature.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.100
And what happens is--

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.220
What happens is the synchronization,
I log in, I type in my network

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.320
password and it says,
oh, you've already logged in,

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.020
you've already had a
mobile home directory,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.820
but the sync between the network store
and the local store is out of date.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.680
So again, you get the same choice that
you had when you started.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.160
You get to pick the truth again.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.590
You get to say, listen,
I want my network home directory because

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.810
that's the current version of what I had.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:48.300
And what it does,
it does the same thing it

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.410
does at the initial login.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.330
The truth gets copied down
again from the local backup.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.850
So what you lost in that case is
only what happened between when

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.590
you went off the network and when
the dog actually ate your iBook.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.520
Thank you.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.280
I'm greatly simplifying this feature.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.140
I know you guys are sitting there going,
well, what about this,

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.880
or what about that?

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.610
And there's a lot of different
ways to-- synchronization is hard,

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:14.840
is the slide I originally had.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.380
And it is hard.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.290
Synchronization is a
very hard thing to do.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.140
We want to-- you can't get into a
case-- there's a lot of cases you want

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.360
to avoid with mobile home directories.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.260
You want to avoid the
multiple writer situation.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.450
Multiple writers is this,
is I've got my mobile

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.560
home that I'm using,
my local home directory.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.120
I'm typing away.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.180
I'm changing stuff.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.250
And somehow,
someone is also typing or getting

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.160
data into my network home.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.080
That's a bad thing,
because we're not talking

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:39.910
about a single file.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.560
We're talking about
thousands of files here.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.110
And we don't want to give you
guys suddenly a case where you're

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:46.750
getting thousands of conflicts,
dialogues, and saying, pick this file,

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:47.470
pick this file.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.580
How we solve this is when the
mobile home is checked out,

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.460
when the mobile home is first bound to a
network home directory and checked out,

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.120
you can't get to that network home.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.890
Administrators can get to it,
but the users can't get to it.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.390
So you can't actually--
so that's a store,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.360
basically,
up on the network home directory.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.270
Home directories are also
extremely complex beasts.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.030
There's semantically intertwined files.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.080
There's lots of files.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.100
If you were getting conflict dialogues,
how would you know which one to pick?

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.560
Because you don't even
know what the file is,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:12.640
right?

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.700
Because there's a lot of stuff
that's non-human readable.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.870
So we actually-- that's why we
got this concept of the truth,

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:20.460
which is saying, "Listen,
we want to do big block copies of the

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.330
network homes to move them around."
The other thing is we're going

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.440
to give you a lot of flexibility.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.290
Maybe you don't need to do
the entire home directory.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.900
Maybe you only want to do portions of it.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.270
Maybe you just want to say,
"I want documents to be synced."

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.540
Just a documents folder.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:34.560
That's a little bit easier thing.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.970
So you can really go ahead and you'll
see via-- you can actually define a

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.350
policy that makes sense for your users.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.860
So mobile home directories are
not actually in the Tiger server.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.900
This is in the Tiger server
version that you have.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:47.540
But this is a feature that
we're going to include in it.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.800
I think you guys are
going to like this a lot.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.690
I think there's going to be a
lot of usage of this feature.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:56.560
So moving along, software update server.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.260
Again, a well-named feature.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.030
This is pretty much exactly
what it sounds like.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.530
The problems we have with software
update right now is that there's

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:06.700
a lot of software updates.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.480
And again, your policy may vary.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.840
At Apple, they just let us install
whatever we want.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.300
But at an educational institution,
maybe you want to have some control over

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.200
what updates are actually installed.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.800
Or maybe you want to do some
testing before it's installed.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.790
There's a lot of them coming out,
and your job is to really make

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.100
sure that all of your hardware
and your software is working.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.870
The other thing is that bandwidth
can be really expensive,

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:27.760
right?

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:28.720
It's never cheap.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.820
So the thing is that
we also-- for example,

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.300
when you have a 10.3.4 update,
maybe you're getting a lot of bills

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.830
because every one of your users
is actually pulling down this big,

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:39.480
huge update.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.800
So we wanted to put together a
solution that gave you basically a

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:45.170
way of proxying software updates,
but also gives you the ability

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.080
to maybe intercept and test
before you actually land things.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.110
So here we are again.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:51.080
Let's talk about how it works.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.900
What you're seeing here is-- I'll
do a simplified version of this.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.150
What happens right now when
you click the software update

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.270
client is two things happen.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:02.270
First off, the client says, listen,
tell me what I need to know,

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.760
tell me what I need to download
in terms of software updates

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:05.710
relative to my machine.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.900
I call that the catalog.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.160
Then it says, OK,
and tell me where I can find them.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.840
Those are the two things
that happen right now.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:15.990
And what happens is all that information
comes from our servers via the internet,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.460
and it goes to your clients.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.880
That's where you're
spending a lot of the time.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.000
So there's a lot of transactions
that are happening from your

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.470
clients up to the servers and
back and forth and back and forth.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:24.800
And the catalog isn't big.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.740
It's a small file,
but the updates can get really big.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.160
What software update server
does is it allows you to put

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.320
a server right in the middle.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:37.250
That server's a proxy for all of
the updates that you have there.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.260
So this server is the only one
who's actually talking to our

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.720
servers to actually pull down
the catalog information and to

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.210
pull down the updates as well.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.620
So they're all just talking
to that single server.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.100
So it's a really handy
way for doing that,

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.940
and as you probably expected,
it's integrated straight

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:52.960
into server admin.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.740
This is a screenshot.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.850
Again, this isn't in the
Tiger DVD that you guys have,

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.000
but here you go,
and you can take a look at it.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.230
It should look very familiar.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.640
It's basically the software update
client plopped into our server here.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.090
But there's some other options.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.140
You can actually give the
ability to mirror updates,

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:09.660
enable or disable them.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.520
You can define your
policy however you want.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.010
Maybe you just want to mirror them
and just save the bandwidth costs,

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.920
and you don't want to worry about
testing them before they go in.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.860
and you're going to ask,
can you add your own updates to this?

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.850
You can't currently,
you're not going to be able to

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:25.180
do that as part of Tiger Server.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.230
Let's get that question done right now.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.320
So there's a lot of features that we
have as part of Software Update Server.

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.000
There's the flexible approval policy.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.330
Do I just mirror everything or
do I want to approve things or

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.750
do I want to selectively approve?

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.580
We have bandwidth
throttling in here as well.

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.030
So you have the ability to,
if I'm worried about maybe a lot of

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.780
updates coming down from my server
and I don't want to wedge my server,

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.800
you can actually adjust
bandwidth throttling on it.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.420
The other piece of this,
the other half of this equation

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.280
here is Software Update Client,
right?

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:54.820
You've got to be able to
do something about that.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.700
You've got to be able to
point that another way.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.220
So as you're going to
see here in a little bit,

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.670
we're going to actually show you
management via a work group manager.

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:04.020
So Software Update Clients can be a
high level plugin that allows you to

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.500
be managed via a work group manager.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.670
You could also use remote desktop to
copy your preferences out or you can

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.180
just go individually to the clients
and actually manually configure them.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.910
But each of the client will support the
ability to point at a different server.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:19.530
All right, moving right along.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.340
We also have a technology
called Netboot and Netinstall.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.500
This is our system imaging solution.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:32.050
For those of you who don't know,
Netboot comes in basically two flavors.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.150
There's the ability to Netboot kind
of like the University of Tokyo did.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:47.100
[Transcript missing]

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.460
We've spent a lot of time on the
last release and this release

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.600
on a tool that we originally
called Network Image Utility.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.400
Network Image Utility has actually
been redubbed System Image Utility

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.560
because it's not really a
network that you're imaging,

00:48:58.580 --> 00:48:59.900
you're actually imaging systems.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:01.990
That makes sense.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.660
What happens when you have a single
image is you run into a situation

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.860
where you want to have specific client
information on each individual client.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.200
For example, IP addresses or a machine
name or something like that.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.540
So what you're going to see in a
lot of the features that we put

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.790
into NetBoot and NetInstall is the
support for directory services.

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:23.220
I can build an image and I can also
add directory services information.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.870
We can have per CPU directory services
binding information associated with it.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.630
We have the ability to say, "Okay,
I don't want these set of

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.500
hardware to boot from this."
We have model property filtering.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.960
And also, I know this is something that
everyone's been interested in,

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.200
we have the ASR block copy.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.620
What this means... Thank you.

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.890
It's our block copy for those of you
who don't know why everyone is clapping,

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:49.050
means really fast installs.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.900
So that's something else
that's going to be in there.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.980
So and also we have the ability
to set machine specific settings,

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.900
rendezvous, computer name, host name,
all these things so that when

00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.330
I boot from a machine I have unique
information associated with it when

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.500
I use one of the Netboot installs.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:05.700
So let's take a quick look
at System Image Utility.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.200
This is the same tool as before.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.500
You're going to see
some new features here.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.090
We have the ability to change
the by host preferences,

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.490
do some check some
checking after we install.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.740
This is the new ability to actually
have an image be associated

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.570
with a certain set of hardware.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.940
And then the ability to actually set the
client settings for these images as well.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:29.770
So that's System Image Utility.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:30.820
We're working on it hard.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.350
We would love your feedback about it.

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.400
We want to make sure that this
is just a great application to be

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.740
able to do system imaging with.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.800
So--

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.200
Okay,
last but certainly not least is going

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.380
to be the work with manager discussion.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.700
We're actually going to
get back to a demo here.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.090
So manage desktop.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.400
This is a very vague term.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.090
Managed desktop,
if I could have one thing

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.120
before you guys leave here,
is to really understand what's

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.400
going on with managed desktop.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.690
Managed desktop is basically
managed preferences.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.160
What's happening with managed
desktop is via the server,

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.230
via open directory,
you have the ability to

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:12.690
define a set of preferences,
in some cases,

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:17.020
which are associated with the users,
groups, and they're actually blasted out

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.840
and copied down to an individual
computer at login window time.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.310
So this way,
a managed desktop really allows you to

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:25.480
set the user experience when they log in.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.040
Make sure they've got
certain mounts already there.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.500
Make sure the user interface
looks in a certain way.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.150
And because it's integrated
straight into the client,

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.520
you all have this ability as long
as you're running open directory.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.420
The other thing about managed desktop
is it's extremely backwardly compatible,

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.400
meaning that if you
have Tiger Server with

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:45.550
WorkRoute Manager running,
there's going to be features that are

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.540
going to be only specific to Tiger,
but you're also going to

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:51.110
see plug-ins from Jaguar,
features that were only maybe

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.720
in Jaguar or maybe in Panther.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.480
We do a lot of work to make
sure that you can see the

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:55.480
features that are only in Jaguar.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.300
And we can continue to manage
back as far as basically when

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.330
managed desktop first landed.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.180
So here we are, preference management.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.160
You're going to see this in a second.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.260
This is the WorkRoute
Manager in the preference pane.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.670
We've got our users
over there on the left.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.760
I got all the preferences.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.580
It looks very familiar.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.280
There's a System Preferences over there.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.680
You're going to see this in a
little more detail in a second.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.600
But the idea is, these are all the
preferences that you can set.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.400
There's a hitch, though.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:30.750
What we found is, what the feedback is,
all of these preferences are really

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.310
associated with things that are Apple.

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.600
All these management options that
we have are System Preferences

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:37.850
or things that are ours.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.460
And fortunately for us,
there's a lot of other

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.800
applications out there.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.220
There's a lot of new features coming
out in the OS and other stuff.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.850
So we need to have a strategy
which scales around this.

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.320
We need to have the ability to
actually manage things which

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.720
are outside of our domain.

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:54.780
And what we're going to do,
what we've added as part

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:59.120
of Tiger and Tiger Server,
is we've added a preference editor.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.400
This gives you super fine-grained
control over the preferences.

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:05.160
This is not for the weak of heart.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:10.350
It's something that you can get
in and you can tweak whatever

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.400
you want in terms of preferences.

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:15.150
The thing about preferences,
and quickly what's going on here,

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.550
what you're seeing here is actually the
preferences for Peter and Timmy here.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.480
They've got preferences
associated with Dashboard,

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.400
which is a new feature.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.400
There's no high-level plug-in for that.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.300
Finder, QuickTime Player, Safari,
the Terminal, and Dock.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.690
What you're going to
see here in a second,

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.390
you can actually drill
down and you get a sheet.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.360
It gives you the ability to
change any of this stuff.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.650
So that means next time
that this person logs in,

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.520
they're going to get these
preferences associated with it,

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.400
and they're tweaked to whatever you
guys want to be able to do with them.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.390
There's one other quick--

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.440
Thank you.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.540
There's a catch though.

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:52.540
Plists are not necessarily
human readable.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:54.380
We like to go in there
and tweak around and say,

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.560
"Well, what's this going to do?

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:58.920
Well, that's interesting,
right?" So what we've done is we've

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.440
-- and they also actually often
contain features of the product

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.680
that you don't even know about.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.380
And you go, "Well,
I'll add this and see what happens."

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:08.540
So what we're doing as part of a
Mac OS X server -- part of an entire

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:12.500
server is we're actually introducing
the concept of a preference manifest.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.700
A preference manifest is a
template for preferences.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.660
It says, "Listen,
I know you're a human being and you

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.820
want to be able to actually read
these preferences." It's a template

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.140
that we use to actually describe
preferences in a way that's useful.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:28.910
And you're going to see this here in
a second as part of our demo here.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.240
Obviously,
for preference manifest to be useful,

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.480
they've got to be everywhere.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.320
So what we're doing is first off
we're making -- we're working with the

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:39.830
application groups at Apple and the
tools group to make sure that a manifest

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.240
is included as part of every bundle.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.700
So that would mean like this.

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.100
If I wanted to manage Safari, let's say,
how I'd work it is,

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.350
I'd actually pull this
Safari preference manifest,

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.150
put it into the preference editor
-- and you'll see this in a second

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:54.840
-- and I can see all the things
that are manageable as part of this.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:59.650
So the demo preference manifests
and managed desktop -- I'm

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.720
going to have Mark Rammel,
one of the engineers on the team,

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:05.110
come up here and give us a little tour,
and I can stop talking for a second.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.410
Hey, Mark.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.190
Hi, everybody.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:12.010
Hi, my name is Mark Rammel.

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:15.670
I'm the QA lead for the managed desktop
product and let's just get started.

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:18.970
What you see here now is I'm
currently running 10-4 client.

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:22.260
This is the same build that's been
distributed to everybody here.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.330
You should have,
most of you have probably

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.670
already installed this.

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:29.340
I also have the server administration
tools installed and I'm running work

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.010
group manager in the local node.

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:33.360
Who here,
I mean pretty much everybody I'm going

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.660
to assume has run work group manager,
but who has run say preference

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.510
management for any users,
groups?

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:39.250
Okay, cool.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:40.580
We're going to start with
the work group manager.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.150
We're going to give a little bit of
a high level overview before we jump

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.760
right into the preference management.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.600
So I'm running work group
manager in the local node.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.820
I'm running the same build everybody has.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.840
You can run in the local node,
but primarily you would really want

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.410
to stick for a server client solution.

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:02.350
This is probably too powerful to use
on just a single client to client

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:04.220
scenario and not everything will work.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.280
I've created a couple
of users for this demo.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.580
I've got a user name, a shell,
a local server, and a server client.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.450
I've got a local home directory defined
for each one of these as well as some

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.060
preferences defined for each user.

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:21.350
For this user, I've got a finder and doc,
and for the people who haven't used

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:25.080
worker manager for preference management,
we're going to jump right in.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:29.670
For the finder here,
I've set an always preference.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.330
Currently for since 10.2,
we've had two different types

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:33.750
of preference management.

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:36.240
We have, well, never,
nothing is managed for this

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.960
particular high level plug-in.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.250
We have an always management option,
which will then copy prefs

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:47.360
that we've defined in here to
the client's managed domain.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:51.220
Each log in, these preferences will be
rewritten to the managed domain,

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:54.040
which you've probably
found is in the library,

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.280
managed preferences, user name.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.480
Then the other option
here we have is once.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.020
These preferences will be written
the first time the user logs in after

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.620
these preferences have been defined
into their user's home directory.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:10.540
For example, if I were to set these
preferences here via once,

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.440
I would have to set them here as always.

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.660
These would be defined when they log in,
but then they could change it.

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.270
Right now I've set this as always,
maybe to reduce clutter

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:17.280
for the demo here.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:22.290
We're not going to show hard disks,
removable media, et cetera, and always.

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.080
Additionally for these users,
both these users have

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.440
the same preferences.

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.340
I've also set doc preferences.

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:29.440
Pretty standard.

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.530
I've defined this as my default
user template for these two users.

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:37.480
They have Safari, Mail, iChat, whatnot,
and pretty standard doc display.

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:40.080
I don't want the user to change this.

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.490
This is the default user template.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.250
I've set it to a new one.

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.200
I'm going to go ahead and
show you how to do this.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.530
So I'm going to go ahead
and show you how to do this.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.690
So I'm going to go back to
the preferences overview.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.270
And for those of you who have
been using Worker Manager for

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:52.450
preferences for a while,
you see this new feature

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.000
that Michael showed earlier.

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:54.880
This is details.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:57.440
Currently,
I've set some finder preferences,

00:57:57.450 --> 00:58:01.030
which are defined in the finder
plist and the global preferences

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.420
plist and the doc plist.

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.390
The first part of the demo I'm going to
do here is I've set these preferences,

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.500
but I want to tweak them a
little bit more than what they

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:09.410
were probably designed to do.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:11.930
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and open up

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.980
the doc preference right here.

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.470
And we have something that
Michael didn't touch on earlier.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:21.040
We have always and we have once,
but we have this new management

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.740
feature we're introducing for Tiger.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.060
This is called often.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.920
This is like always,
but it's written every

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:32.280
time the user logs in,
it's rewritten into their home directory.

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.890
So maybe for a kiosk
or a classroom setting,

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.280
you want users to have a
little bit of flexibility.

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.480
You want to give them the creative
control to make sure that they're not

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:40.860
just sitting in a classroom setting.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.890
You want them to make mistakes.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:44.730
But the next time they log in,
we're going to wipe a clean slate.

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:48.220
So these are the preferences
that I've set for the doc.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.000
We've got a lot of strings.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.300
A lot of this stuff doesn't
really make much sense.

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.410
Magnification.

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:58.410
I can set this to true,
but I'm not really sure what that does.

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:02.230
Some of you guys out there
already play around with plists.

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.890
I'm going to add a new key.

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.750
I'm going to call this key pinning.

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:13.400
And I'm going to add "and".
I'm going to save this.

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:15.050
And it's done.

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.460
So for this demo right here,
since I'm running locally,

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:21.330
I'm just going to fast user
switch into this Mark user.

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.140
So you've probably already seen
that the dock is over here.

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.440
This is something the dock does.

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.880
It's built into the OS.

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:38.220
Nobody really knows about it.

00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:40.880
I'm sure pretty much everybody here has
probably played around with that as well,

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.300
though.

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:44.010
And for the people new
to preference management,

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:45.740
notice I cannot move the dock.

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.100
I can't change the size.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.260
It says dock preferences.

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:51.290
It will bring up a system
preference pane with blank options.

00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:53.300
Everything will be
grayed out and mutable.

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.300
And that's it.

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:57.410
An important point before I jump
back to the administration console

00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:59.250
is I've set this preference for Mark.

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.790
But as you've seen, I could have very
easily selected a group,

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:05.300
groups, a computer list.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.840
I could have easily set
this setting for hundreds,

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.990
if not thousands,
of potential clients in the future.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:14.990
And as Michael touched on earlier,
everything I've set here

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:35.640
will be set and written to
preferences back to 1024 clients,

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.640
will be what we will support.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.640
Now, of course,
since keys change and new keys

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.640
are introduced all the time,
we can't really promise

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.640
everything will be managed,
but nothing will harm

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.640
those older clients.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.640
So let me log back into
the administration console.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.640
Oops.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:43.100
Okay, so we've created an example
preference manifest for the doc

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.300
just to give you an idea of what
the preference manifest can do.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.180
We saw all those options earlier.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.180
We saw Boolean, we saw True,
we saw some numbers.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.680
We weren't exactly sure what they did.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.930
So we're going to add
something to this list.

01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:59.970
My desktop, manage preferences,
and this manifest.

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:00.730
Bam.

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:01.890
The doc has changed.

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:04.420
It no longer gives a
generic plist description.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.980
It's no longer italicized.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:09.120
This is more of an native
thing to the preference editor.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.780
This is telling us that
things are defined.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.730
And if we go in here and
we look at this again,

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:17.890
We have human readable text.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:21.180
We see a largest tile size.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.870
This tells us and we have a
description for each of these

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:28.200
strings below that would tell us
what might not be common sense.

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:32.450
For example, this minimization UI,
true to disable the

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:36.390
minimization effect pop-up menu,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.700
This is pretty slick.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.840
Since we also tweaked this file,
there's something in here

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.250
that's getting our attention,
something that's non-native

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.310
to this particular plist.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.040
Right here, the pinning.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.800
This doesn't match.

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.690
And it says right here, additionally,
the template files we

01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:58.730
changed for the doc items,
we added Safari and a

01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:59.860
couple other things.

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.750
Those are also flagged as non-default.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.410
So that's a pretty basic overview
of the preference manifest.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:10.750
Now, the second part of this demo
that I'd like to go into is

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:13.430
Editing individual strings
and keys is great and all,

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.940
but that's very time consuming.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.300
What I'd like to do is,
and what a lot of people did

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.290
for other products before,
is using, say for example,

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:24.230
this administration account I've
created to mimic preferences

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.860
for a different user.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.270
I can change settings here in the
administration console and then

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:32.580
push those plists to another user,
group, computer list.

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:35.530
For this demo I've got
a user called Michael.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:39.520
Let's say for example I have
an engineering manager who's a

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.650
bit of a control freak and he
likes things his certain way.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.140
I'm going to change things for him.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.090
I'm going to set things
up the way he likes them.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.240
Since he's a bit of a control freak,
he likes granularity.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.280
He likes the ability to manage anything
and change any setting that he can.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.150
He wants everything there and
he never wants to launch the

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:00.790
system preferences utility.

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:04.640
So what I've done here is I've added
everything I could to the menu bar.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.620
I'm going to push this
preference on to Michael.

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:10.230
Let him have it.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.480
So we're going to go into my-- this is
my administer-- and for those of you

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:19.040
who haven't been using this before,
I'm in my admin account, library,

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:20.720
preferences.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.840
And I've taken the time to find out which
actual plist here has been modified.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.210
This is the system UI server plist.

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.610
And this has now been set for Michael.

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:34.610
And just to give you an example that--

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:42.300
And earlier I edited a doc plist
and I showed you the finder plist,

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:45.090
but here I'm going to set this via often.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.660
This is the default for now.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.040
Here you go.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.360
You can add even more to this or
remove things that you don't want.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.800
Let's see, what else is Michael like?

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.600
Hmm, Michael's probably like a
lot of you guys out there.

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:59.480
He likes his terminal green on black.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.040
He likes to be able to see through it.

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:03.390
Let's give it to him.

01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:05.010
We're going to go back
into my admin account,

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:06.500
library preferences.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.140
We're going to find the terminal plist.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:11.890
There we go.

01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:16.500
So we can try logging in as Michael,
but what's going to happen?

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.250
We'll find out.

01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:23.280
Okay, there we go.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.910
We've got his,
Michael has all his menu items.

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:29.460
Thank you, thank you.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.460
For example,
Michael did not have the doc defined

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:36.000
the same way that the mark user did,
so Michael's back in the

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:38.140
center with the default items.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.440
And he also has terminal.

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:41.320
There we

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.270
So now we're going to do a
little bit of a bonus round.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:53.370
I was pretty surprised during Steve's
keynote on Monday to see the bleeding

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:57.500
edge new items that he added and what
were in Michael's earlier screenshot.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.320
We've got dashboard.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.990
This is brand new.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.610
This is, I mean, can we manage it?

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.290
Let's find out.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.610
So I've set up for Michael.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.590
Michael likes things a certain way.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.050
He likes everything
staggered and stepped.

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.970
Let's see what happens.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:24.300
[Transcript missing]

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:28.400
Did I mistype that?

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.340
No, that's right.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.350
Logging back in as Michael.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.400
There we go.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.090
Running the Workroom Manager in the
local node is probably a really good

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:47.200
example of how developers can use
Workroom Manager to see if their

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.760
applications are managed or not.

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.630
But for most of the IT folks out there,
this would be a great way to

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:55.080
test locally on your machine,
your laptop, sitting in a hotel room.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.310
I just installed this new software
I got at this developer conference.

01:05:58.310 --> 01:05:59.210
Can it be managed?

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:02.340
Test it locally before blasting
the plist out to everybody else.

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.890
And basically,
we're hoping that we're giving everybody

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:10.320
the ultimate control and granularity of
preference manifests for this release.

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:13.640
Anything set via CFPreferences can
pretty much be managed.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.050
And as you've seen,
you can make it as easy or as

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:20.260
difficult as you want it to be,
especially via preference manifests.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.300
For some plists,
there might be plists that

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:26.740
have hundreds of keys,
hundreds of strings.

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:29.910
But say, for example,
you are only going to

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:31.780
manage a few of those.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.790
You can set a preference manifest.

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:35.780
With just descriptions and
values for those three.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:40.060
And leave everything else if it's
too confusing or maybe gray them out.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.080
So there you go.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.110
Thanks, Mark.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.110
I had no idea I was so
fond of menu extras.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:56.620
So that's our Managed Desktop demo there.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.930
What you can see there is, again,
the concept, tools.

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:00.000
What are you guys going to do with this?

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.550
We've given you a lot of tools to be
able to do a lot of different things with

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:06.460
Preferences and the Preference Manifest.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.220
There is something here that you want to
do-- and this is more for our developer

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:12.360
community out here as well-- is there's
things that we'd like you to do to

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.000
actually support managed applications.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.540
The first one is out of the
gate is using CFPreferences.

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:21.600
This is all the game's off if
you're not using CFPreferences.

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.560
Fortunately,
a lot of people already use that.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.940
We would like to avoid
by host preferences.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.770
That's something--

01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.140
Those are hard to manage.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.400
So better support is
obeying force preferences.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.600
What you didn't see in Mark's
demo is this a force or always

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.470
pref is something that you're
basically saying to your user,

01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.090
I don't even want you to touch this.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.490
I know better.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.030
But there's a -- you need to have a
commitment from the application to say,

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.110
Listen, oh,
this key is managed and I don't

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.620
want them to change this.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.600
So like you saw in the doc there,
it was actually disabled.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.460
That's something that the
application actually needs to do.

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.840
And best support is -- or good
support is including a manifest.

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.380
Make it easy for the administrators
to manage your applications.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:04.950
It's not up on the website yet,
but what we're going to do is we're going

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:08.200
to be publishing a managed desktop white
paper for developers to make it really

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.110
easy for people out there to actually
make their applications manageable.

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:16.550
So system administration is all the time.

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.440
You're doing it all the time, 24/7.

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:22.080
What we hope we've done with a lot of
the applications and the technology

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.200
we've shown you and you'll be seeing
eventually in Tiger and Tiger servers,

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.640
really help you building reliable,
reproducible infrastructure.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.190
We want to make sure that you guys
are actually doing this work from

01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.040
managing one to many machines.

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:36.160
And like I said,
what I hope we've done is we've

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.140
provided you a lot of tools
and not just applications.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.100
So with that, I'd like to say that you
already have these tools.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.940
They're sitting in your
goody bag right now.

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:47.840
You've got ARD in your bag right now.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.730
You can use it, try it out.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.590
We'd love to hear about it.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.640
And soon you're going to have the final
version of Tiger and Tiger server.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.840
These are the things
you need to manage 24/7.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.640
And I'd like to thank
Mark and everyone else.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.530
Thank you for your time.

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:01.100
And we're going to bring some people up
here to answer any questions you have

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.530
about all the technology we're doing.

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:05.190
Thank you very much.
