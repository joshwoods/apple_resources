00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.790
Welcome you to the audio
production session at WWDC 2004.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.320
My name is Phil Jackson,
I'm the audio product

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.740
specialist for Apple computers.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.450
And during this presentation what
I'm going to do is show you how

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.960
we can use Logic Pro 6 for audio
music production on the Macintosh.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.270
It's really,
this is something I really love

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.370
to do and I really love to show
people how this how this works.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.370
Now,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.780
Before I actually start the presentation,
I kind of got to get a gist or a feel

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.770
of what type of people are in here,
besides the people that are yawning.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.140
Any musicians in the house?

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.970
Wow, excellent.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.920
Any non-musicians in the house?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.900
Like drummers?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.900
Think people like that?

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.040
Okay.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.740
And how many video people do we have?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.310
Wow, so we've got a whole selection.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.490
I'm assuming that you've
been enjoying the show,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.690
and that's fantastic.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.060
Now, a friend of mine, Joseph Linasky,
he did his presentation earlier,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.520
and he said that he allowed some question
and answering during the presentation.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120
I, on the other hand, don't allow that.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.580
So, we may do that.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.420
We may wait until the end.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.580
So, what I want to try and do is to
help you guys understand exactly

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.520
what Logic Pro 6 is all about.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.800
I want to take a step back and show
you the way that maybe making music

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.440
has been done for the last few years.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.300
Now, music production has changed
considerably over the last 10 years,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.060
thanks to the computers.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.210
The ability to take a simple melody or
chord progression and just go with that,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.900
and shape it,
and produce that into a finished song.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.940
It's just really, really incredible.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.700
And slowly,
the computer has started to replace

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.050
some of those larger devices
within the recording studio,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.470
and has really allowed
a lot more flexibility.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.270
So that's what I want to start with.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.850
I wanted to sort of talk to
you about how music used to

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.670
be recorded in the old days.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.740
Not so much in the old days,
maybe a little while ago,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.430
but... We start off with
musical instruments,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.690
and we need musical
instruments to create music,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.100
to make sound, to actually record music.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.020
And instruments can be anything
from acoustic instruments,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.360
such as a piano, acoustic guitar,
or an upright bass,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.980
to an electronic instrument
or an orchestral instrument,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.150
maybe like an electric
guitar and electric bass,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.880
or an organ or a synthesizer.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.790
Now inherently,
when you're in the recording studio and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.730
you want to make a nice large project,
that requires a lot of work.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.710
That requires arranging and
organizing multiple musicians

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.650
and multiple instruments,
and paying them and getting them into

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.620
one room where we can actually go ahead
and experiment with textures and sounds

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.970
that are beyond what a particular
band have within their players.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.350
And so that's been quite expensive.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.100
And so, some musical instruments
is definitely something the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.410
computer has helped us with.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.920
It has given us much more of a
palette of tools to work with.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.310
So that's the musical aspect,
the musical instrument aspect of it.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.840
The next one, microphones.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.830
Now we need microphones in the
recording studio to help us get down

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.930
the sound of these acoustic instruments.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.980
We've got an acoustic guitar,
we need to mic it up.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.470
That microphone gets plugged
into a mixing console,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.090
and then straight on to
the multi-track recorder.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.380
So let's talk about mixing consoles.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.060
Now the mixing console is inherently
there to pre-amplify the microphones or

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.410
the line instruments that we plug in.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.140
It allows us to boost that signal,
add some equalization,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.870
and then that will often go off and be
recorded on the multi-track recorder.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.080
Now mixing consoles range in size.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.580
They can go from anywhere from
a four-channel mixing device

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.140
all the way up to something
like a 96-input SSL like that,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.870
which could essentially
cost a million dollars plus.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.170
Now the other nice thing about
the mixing console is it allows

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.150
us to take all of the tracks
coming back from the multi-track

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.620
so that we can listen to playback.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.180
So we can mix and we can balance out that
and we can listen to the arrangement and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.610
see exactly which musician's parts need
to be replaced with real musician parts.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.900
So essentially that's the
idea of the mixing console.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.860
And as I said, they can be very,
very expensive.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.760
And a lot of them, like the SSL,
on Each of their channels,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.720
they'll have a dynamic section
like a noise gate and a compressor.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.230
And they'll usually have a center
master section that allows you

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.590
total control over the volume
of your speakers in the studio.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.590
So, if I can get a new battery for this,
this would be great.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.000
There we go.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.060
Multi-track recorders.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.500
Now, after everything's gone
through the mixing console,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.100
it's going to go on to
the multi-track recorder.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.370
A multi-track recorder is
a little bit like the tape

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.040
player that you have at home.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.050
I don't have any tape
players at home anymore,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.990
but use your imagination.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.120
One exception is a lot bigger, of course,
and a lot more expensive.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.570
But the thing about a multi-track,
it allows every instrument

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.850
to have its own track.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.760
It allows us to stack and layer different
instruments onto the multi-tape recorder.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
Excuse me.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
Oh, thank you.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
I thought he was coming up to take over.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
I was going to say,
I don't think I was sucking that bad.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
Oh, okay.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
So anyway, I was talking about the
multi-track recorder.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
It allows you to layer up
track after track after track,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.680
in essence making one
vocalist sound like many.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.900
Now, multi-track recorders come
in various different sizes.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.640
They can come in a 4-track, 8-track,
16-track, 24-track.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.280
And sometimes when we need really,
really big sessions,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.460
what we can do is we can synchronize
these multi-tracks together.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.630
They can be synced or slaved together.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.640
Thank you.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.630
Let's have a look at that again.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.630
They can be synced or slaved
together to double the track count.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.600
And in the early part of the 90s,
when digital multi-tracks first

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.180
started appearing on the market,
we then had single machines

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.530
that could get as high as 48
tracks per single machine.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.500
So that's a multi-track recorder.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.850
Now,
when you've done all of your recording

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.540
and everything's sounding good,
we usually go into what

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.910
we call the mixing stage,
and this allows us to

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.640
take effects processors.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.630
And effects processors can run
the gamut of different types.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.860
They can range from subtle
things to things that radically

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.640
change the way something sounds.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.710
The way something sounds
when it's recorded,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.640
or the way something sounds
before it actually gets recorded.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.640
It really doesn't matter.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.640
But these things can range from
simple things such as an equalizer,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.730
high, mid frequencies, low, mid, low end,
to compressors and noise gates,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.640
to modulation effects like chorusing,
flanging, and phasing,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.580
to echo systems and delays,
all the way up to something

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.640
maybe like a room simulator,
a reverb unit,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.610
which can place an instrument or a
person's voice in any type of room.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.630
It could be a concert hall,
it could be a church,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.640
it could be a parking garage,
it could even be a hallway.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.640
It could be a mall like this one.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.640
And so that's the effects processors.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.630
Now the nice thing is all of this
stuff that we've just looked at,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.630
the multitrack recorder,
the mixing console,

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.640
the effects processors,
with the exception of the microphone,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.640
have all been rolled into one
production system called Logic Audio.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.640
And what we can do is we can go through
and look at some of the comparisons now.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.640
Logic Pro 6 really gives you
total integration in one package.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.640
And this has allowed
musicians and drummers,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.870
and producers,
to freely experiment more with

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.610
the music that they're recording.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.790
In fact,
the whole workflow of recording music has

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.480
somewhat changed because of computers,
because we can now do

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.640
things while we're doing,
while we're tracking,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.630
we can add EQ and we can add effects,
rather than waiting to the

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.550
entire end of the process,
and just, "Okay, right,

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.120
we're finished recording,
let's send it off to an overly

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.640
expensive guy to mix." So,
let's take a look at it.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.580
Logic Pro 6 as a multitrack
recorder for audio.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.630
Now, Logic is only limited by the
audio hardware that you're using.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.580
So, for example,
if you've got four inputs

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.580
on your audio hardware,
that's the maximum amount of tracks

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.570
that you can record at any one time.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.640
If you have 16 inputs,
that's the maximum amount of tracks

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.640
you can record at any one time.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.120
However,
Logic Pro 6 can play back up to 256

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.640
tracks of digital audio at any one time.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.640
And that's with sample rates
all the way up to 192 kilohertz,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.640
at 24-bit, pristine sound.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.640
It also, like I say,
sample rates up to 192,

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.640
and always sample accurate playback.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.640
The difference between Logic and
a regular multitrack is,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.640
there's a little picture
here of the arrange window,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.640
is that Logic is a multitrack
recorder for audio,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.600
but it's also a multitrack
recorder for MIDI.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.640
And for those of you who
are not familiar with MIDI,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.640
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument
Digital Interface,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.640
and it's just a protocol
that allows synthesizers,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.640
let's say you've got a synthesizer
over here and one over here,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.640
they allow them to talk and communicate.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.730
And inherently,
that allows the computer to

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.640
communicate with an external keyboard.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.640
So, for example,
when you're recording a MIDI keyboard,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.630
we refer to this as sequencing, actually.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.580
So recording audio, multitracking,
recording MIDI, kind of sequencing,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.010
one of the same thing,
but we don't actually

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.580
record an audio signal,
we record MIDI data.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.640
That MIDI data is played back
in real time out to the device,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.430
which tells the device exactly which
notes and which chords to play.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.640
And of course,
Logic offers non-destructive recording,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.640
which is something that you
don't have in the analog world.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.780
If you accidentally hit record
over the last tail end of an

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.020
amazing vocal performance,
you bet your bottom dollar

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.640
that it will be gone for good,
and also can be very expensive.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.580
So, Logic Pro 6 has an
integrated mixing console.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.570
Logic Pro 6 has a beautiful
integrated mixing console.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.640
Every single channel that
can be recorded in it,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.640
every single channel that
can be recorded in Logic,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.930
or played back, has its own mute button,
its own solo button for

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.640
isolating it from the mix,
has a volume faders, and of course,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640
it has level meters.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.570
We also have many different
types of channel strips.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.640
We have audio channels,
we have auxiliary channels,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.640
we have buses, we have input channels,
we have output channels,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.610
just like in the analog world.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.640
Logic can operate every channel,
either mono, stereo,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.640
or incomplete surround.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.640
Anyone out there mixing
music for surround,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.640
Logic Pro 6 is definitely the way to go.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.640
It has flexible routing capabilities
and flexible DSP inserts.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.640
In fact, let me just stray one second.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.640
Thanks to the sheer power
of the G5 and the Macintosh,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.630
it's allowed Logic Pro 6 to
create a suite of unbelievable

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.640
virtual instruments that can be
played like any other synthesizer,

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.640
and they range from simple
sampled instruments,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.160
sampler, or sampled instruments,
to instruments that are

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.200
created via synthesis,
and other instruments that are

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.640
created via physical modeling.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.790
And they really allow the single
musician like myself or you to

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.430
have many more textures and tones
available to you for when you're

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.640
actually writing and arranging music.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.750
And the nice thing about those
instruments is they live on

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.640
what we call audio instrument
channels right here in the mixer,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.640
and they have their own set of volume,
mutes, solos, panning,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.580
and DSP inserts for complete and total
integration into the production process.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.540
So that's fantastic.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.640
And of course,
everything on the integrated

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.640
mixing console is fully,
fully automated.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.640
And we, just for my friend over there,
Logic's got silky smooth EQ,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.620
I can tell you that.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.640
It's phenomenal.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.640
So what about Logic Pro 6 as
a multi-effects processor?

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.640
And there is the EQ right at the top.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.590
There are eight bands of silky smooth EQ.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.640
As a multi-effects processor,
Logic comes with over 50

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640
amazing sounding effects.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:07.460
Now these particular effects, again,
range the gamut from subtle to radical.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.640
So subtle being things like EQs,
compression, multiband compression,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.640
and more radical being things
like spectral gates and phasing,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.390
fast modulation, echo, room simulation.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.630
We have Space Designer,
which is the plug-in right down here.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.870
This is a convolution reverb
that's capable of taking any

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.630
instrument into any environment.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.630
It could be a room like this,
it could be a church,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.950
it could be for use in post-production
for video because you might have some

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.640
dialogue that's going on inside of,
say, a Volkswagen Beetle.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.640
And you need that voice to sound
like it's inside of a Beetle.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.930
No good shooting a scene inside of a
Beetle and having it sound like the

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.640
guys are in a big parking garage.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.870
So Space Designerigner allows
you to place any signal in

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.640
any type of environment.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.970
Now built right into the
Core OS of the Mac is the

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.640
Audio Unit Standard for plug-ins.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.640
And what this has allowed Logic to do,
because it supports it,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.380
it's allowed all of these third-party
people like yourselves to create

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.640
amazing and innovative plug-ins that
can immediately be integrated right

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.390
alongside Logic's own plug-ins for even
more of a wide variety of sounds and DSP.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.360
So basically Logic Pro 6 is probably
one of the most flexible music

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.500
production systems available.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.550
And although we've just seen
some of the analog counterparts,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.400
the multi-tracks and the mixes,
and we've made those

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.170
comparisons to Logic,
there are many other aspects

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.180
of Logic which make it truly a
wonderful and inviting program to

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.440
use for creating any type of music.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.490
And it could be just writing a
song at home in your home studio,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.490
it could be writing a
number one hit record,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.500
it could be scoring music
for film and for television.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.180
So Logic Pro 6,
we talked a little bit about the

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.500
instruments and let me show you them.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.770
There are nine of these
instruments in all,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.500
all packed into one
complete production system.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.010
And as I said before,
the sample-based instruments at the top,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.490
we have the EXS24, it's a 24-bit sampler.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.490
It can load up a variety of instruments.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.360
It can load up a variety of
different sound libraries.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.410
So you pretty much have access to
thousands upon thousands of sounds,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.500
everything from a piano to an oboe,
anything.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.490
We also have plug-ins that
create their sound via synthesis.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.490
The ES1,
the single oscillator synthesizer,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:38.490
or the ES2, which is really,
it's a real badass.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.500
It really is, and it's three oscillators,
just sounds amazing.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.560
But we also have modeled instruments,
and modeled instruments

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.530
are a beautiful thing,
and finally, for the first time,

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.020
allow us to faithfully recreate some
of the classic instruments that we

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:57.500
have spent years and years listening
every day on records and CDs.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.180
At the top we have the EVB3,
which faithfully recreates

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.480
the Hammond organ.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.490
The EVD6, which models and recreates
the classic Hohner D6 clavinet

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.820
that was made famous by,
I don't know, just called, Stevie,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.450
Stevie Wonder.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.490
And then down here we have the EVP-8.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.500
And then down here we have the EVP-8.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.500
Which faithfully recreates all
of the classic pianos of the 70s.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.500
So there are the virtual instruments.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.820
Logic also has integrated editing,
because of course once you start

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.500
the production process and you
start recording MIDI and audio,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.500
you need something to edit them with.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.370
So Logic has a wonderful built-in event
list editor that lets you edit all

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.500
of your controller data and your note
data via a numerical style editing.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.490
That's the event list.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.500
Then we have the matrix editor,
which gives you a sort of,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.500
more of a piano roll look.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.110
This is where you can have a vertical
keyboard here that represents each

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.500
of the notes on a horizontal line.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.270
And you can see where the note starts
and you can see how long the note is.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.490
You can even see how hard
that note or chord was pressed

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.490
by referring to the colours,
red being the loudest,

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.500
blue being the quietest.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.500
We also have the hyper editor and we
also have an integrated score editor.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.500
Now I do want to say this
about the score part of it,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.460
is it's not really just a score editor.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.400
Logic is a full-on score editor.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.500
It's a full-on page
layout scoring program,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.610
which can be used either
with the sequencer or

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.500
independently of the sequencer.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.260
So for example,
I could put down a little melody in

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.300
C and listen to that melody in C,
yet I can have the score show

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.500
me what it might look like
scored for a trumpet in A flat.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.490
Those guys playing brass,
they always like to blow their own horn.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.620
But anyway,
so what we're looking at here is

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.430
just an example of some printing out.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.500
This is using the jazz font.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.500
On this particular example, City Nights.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.500
So full-on scoring.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.550
And this is great for arrangers and for
musicians that are composing music and

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.100
then needing to take printed notation out
to a sound stage where you may record the

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.500
final piece of music with an orchestra.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.500
And of course you would be
recording it directly to Logic.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.940
Logic Pro 6 is a professional
desktop and portable solution.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.970
The G5, absolutely amazing,
up to dual 2.5 GHz,

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.900
will give you enough power for even
the largest large scale production.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.770
And of course with the PowerBook,
that's going to give you the

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.280
portability and the mobility that
you need to take a project out into

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.900
the field and just start recording.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.890
You can finally take your entire
recording studio to the client.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.640
Essentially that alleviates
so much equipment.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.930
I mean,
I remember reading something about the

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.000
Beatles when they wanted to actually
take the tape machine out of the tape

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.680
machine room and take it down the
hallway to move it into the studio room.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.910
It took them like five days to get
permission to move that big tape player,

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:52.440
but now we can just take our power book
and we can be recording it any place.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.500
So Logic truly is an all-in-one
solution that offers convenience,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:03.080
it offers economic values,
it's a lot cheaper, more portable,

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.330
and of course much more creative
control over everything.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.370
So at this particular point,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.730
get on the computer and just give you an
idea of exactly what I'm talking about.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.370
Is that alright?

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.620
Don't all jump and say yes at once,
will you?

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.840
Alright,
let's take a look at what we've got.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.190
So, let's switch the screen.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.620
I've got a lot of equipment up here,
so... So what we'll do is we'll

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.080
start with a brief overview
of the main arrangement,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.440
and this is the main
arranged window within Logic,

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.940
and this is where you do
all of your sequencing and

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.780
you do all of your editing.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.640
You can think of this
like your virtual canvas,

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.680
for example.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:46.720
So, over here on the left-hand side,
this is our track list, and as I said,

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.160
when we're talking
about multi-track logic,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.660
it's more than just audio.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.300
It is audio, it is virtual instruments,
there are MIDI tracks.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.190
So, this is your track list right here,
and that track list can be

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.210
freely configured by you,
the user, depending on the type of

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.070
tracks that you want to record
at any one particular time.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.580
Each track can be given a track name.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.880
We've got an icon, a mute,
protect button,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.890
and a track number running at the side.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.480
On the left over here are
what we call the parameters.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.720
They help you as you're
actually creating your music.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.920
At the top where it says MIDI through,
we have playback parameters,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.050
and I'll talk a little bit about
playback parameters in a little while.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.620
They're primarily used for editing,
and we are, I'm not showing it right now,

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.400
but we have a toolbox,
which usually lives in the parameters,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.300
and we have instrument parameters,
and then we have a channel strip,

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.900
which is essentially the
one channel strip from the

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.240
particularly selected track.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.560
So, for example, the bass is selected,
and that's showing the single

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.040
channel from the virtual mixer.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.740
Those parameters can be hidden.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.440
At the top we have a transport control,
which has got our tempo

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.600
and our time signature,
and then along the top

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.820
we have our timeline,
and you can see the line right there.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.720
That is the SPL,
or the song position line.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.490
That moves from left to right
and indicates the current

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.720
position of our arrangement.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.680
And you can see the white bar at the top,
that's what we call the cycle beam,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.500
and that allows us to just cycle
around a particular section.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.640
If I'm working on something
over and over again,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.140
I can go over and simply change
how many bars I'm cycling around.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.560
The main body of the arrangement here,
this is really like your virtual canvas,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.340
and you can see that
we have some objects,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.930
because Logic is an
object oriented sequencer.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.240
It's essentially you move objects around,
you manipulate these objects,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.140
and these are what the objects look like,
and they can be of different varieties.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.300
So, for example, right there we have the
guitar left and right.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.120
That's what we call an audio region.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.860
That's an audio file
that's been recorded,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:39.200
and it can be identified because it
has a waveform overview over the top.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.060
The difference between an
audio region and a MIDI region,

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.630
sometimes referred to as an object,
we do sometimes refer

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.200
to these as objects,
is that MIDI data,

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.900
and they have a notation overview.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.800
Again,
that helps to identify the difference

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.930
between a MIDI track and an audio track.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.640
So let me just give you an example.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.870
I'm just zooming in right
here on my lead vocal track,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.270
and I'll just play this a little
bit just to give you an idea.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.510
Some things are missing.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.580
In fact, what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to take all of that

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.140
and we'll just delete those.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.820
So let's just take a listen
to what we've got here.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.770
We have a little vocal track.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:36.900
[Transcript missing]

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.240
So, this song is somewhat unfinished.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.640
It's got some vocals,
it's got some guitar and some bass,

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.300
but there are certain things
that I want to sort of add to it.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.100
I might want to add some drums,
I might want to add some bass,

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.160
and things like that.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.720
So, what I want to first do is
introduce you to those wonderful

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.160
instruments that we talked about.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.060
So,
the first one I'm going to talk about,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.980
I'm not going to actually use this one,
but this is called the EVB-3.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.860
And this emulates the classic Hammond.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.850
Let's see if we can get a
bit more volume out of that.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.420
And let me just make sure, yeah.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.660
So how many people are actually
familiar with the Hammond organ?

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.850
Yeah, I mean,
really it's one of the hardest

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.810
instruments to recreate,
especially the Leslie speaker.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.370
So for example, here's-- let's kick
the Leslie speaker on.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.540
Now this thing has got
some amazing parameters.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.560
It's got all of the classic
parameters that you'll find on the B3,

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.090
including draw bars, so for example

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.350
adjustments to our drawbars.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.760
We have all of the parameters for
crafting this instrument from a brand

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.280
new Hammond organ that just came
out of the factory way back in 1950

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.400
to one that's been around the world
and has been completely thrashed

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.860
upon night after night after night.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.780
The tubes are old, the whole workings of
the machine are old.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.490
And we have plenty of parameters down
here like the volume of the click,

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.020
how much drawbar leakage
we can hear in the sound.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.700
And all of that serves to
age the B3 in many ways.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.740
And this is a modelled instrument.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:24.060
So for example, we can come up here and
we can turn the growl on.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.240
We've got three types of
distortion because sometimes the

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.690
Hammond was a classic for growl.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.400
Fantastic.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.040
Now the other nice thing is the reverb.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.550
One thing that made the Hammond
so nice is the reverb unit

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.400
would go through the Leslie.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.400
And for those of you who
don't know what a Leslie is,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.400
it's a spinning speaker.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400
It's essentially two spinning speakers.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.480
It's got a bass pointing down with a
drum that revolves in one direction,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.910
and then it's got a tweeter
at the top with a horn that

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.370
revolves in the other direction.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.400
And if I crank the reverb up,
we can hear that.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.130
We can just hear that
going through the Leslie.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.810
So faithfully recreates what
is inherently one of the most

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.840
magical instruments of all time.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.900
And of course we can simply
call up different presets.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.810
Music

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:26.590
All the way up to really
thin sounding DAWs.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.380
So, getting back to what I was saying
in the beginning about instruments,

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.490
about having to organize different
musicians and different instruments

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:40.180
all together in one room to
create different arrangements.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.620
Again, you know, you've got Logic here,
and you go, I want a Hammond.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:44.280
No problem.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.260
Call it up, and there it is,
immediately ready.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.450
And it actually weighs a
lot less than the original.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.790
So, what else do we have?

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.380
Well, here's one of my favorites.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.560
This is the EVP-88.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.270
This is actually one of our first
instruments that eMagic created.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.000
And it's actually one of
the more simple plug-ins.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.120
Essentially, let's,
what I'm going to do here is I'm just

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.800
going to call up a default patch,
and just going to bring up

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.950
the volume a little bit.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:18.690
So, we essentially have models
of different types of pianos,

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.900
and for those of you familiar
with the electric piano,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.680
we have a suitcase piano.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.760
My sustain pedal's not working.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.140
It's back to front, give me one second.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.400
See,
let me just zip around this software,

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.630
there we go, click some ports, polarity,
let me just put that back to normal,

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.580
there we go.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.650
So, that's a suitcase piano.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:49.510
We can turn this big knob here and we
can have a model of a suitcase version 2,

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:56.320
or the classic bright suitcase,
or the Fender Road Stage 1 piano.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.620
Can you hear that?

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.570
Because I can't hear it.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.700
You know what I'm saying?

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.700
It's about music.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.700
It's about sending these
people out of here deaf.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.270
Okay, so that is the classic Stage 1.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:22.890
Of course there was a Stage Mark 2,
which was just slightly different.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.570
Had a sort of bit more
metallic feel to it,

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:30.040
and we even have a
classic Wurlitzer 200A,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.200
which is just a phenomenal sounding.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.500
Now he's singing it,
you know what I mean?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.430
You got some pliers?

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.500
Where are we John?

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500
Um...

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.330
So anyway, that's the classic Wurlitzer.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.070
Now, the nice thing about this,
because it is modeled,

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.760
we have some model parameters
like the decay and the release.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.630
So for example,
with the classic suitcase,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.190
I can change the release,
I can bring that down,

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.440
I can bring the decay up.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.840
It sounds exactly the same.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.070
Let's bring it down a bit.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.580
So it's a very short
and staccato sound now.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.960
We also have the ability
to change the the tines,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.700
or the volume of the tines,
or the bell as we call it.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.620
And also the damper.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.160
For those of you who don't know the
intricate workings of an electric piano,

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.240
they have a damper that
when you let go of the keys,

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.740
it comes down and rests.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:33.340
And sometimes you can
actually hear that damper,

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:33.460
if I crank it right up, we can...

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.460
It's hard for you to hear, but it's just,
again it adds to the

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.400
realistic characteristics of
this particular instrument.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.530
And we have a stereo intensity,
we have a stretch parameter,

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.550
so if you were to play this,
because this is a model,

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:54.580
unlike a sampled instrument,
so for example, there are no funny,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.800
strange envelopes or loop points to get
in the way of what I call the pure tone.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.200
So for example,
if I play an octave down low,

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.700
We essentially have a pure tone.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.180
There's nothing cross-fading
or destroying that tone like we

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.230
would hear if it was sampled.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.400
And because it is so pure,
if we were to play this in

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.640
conjunction with an acoustic piano,
acoustic piano is manually

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.890
tuned by a human ear,
so we have a stretch function which

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:30.480
allows us just to slightly vary it so
that it will sit more pleasantly within

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:34.180
the confines of a grand acoustic piano.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.930
It has got an EQ,
it's got a beautiful drive,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.390
it has an amazing phaser.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.880
Check this out,
we'll just bring up the rate

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.010
and the color just a little bit.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.480
and it's also got a beautiful tremolo.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.200
Let me just go through here
and let's bring that down and

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.160
let's bring up the tremolo.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.160
This is a stage mark
one with the tremolo.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.760
So if we wanted to take this,
for example,

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.340
I'm just going to call up a simple patch.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.900
Yeah, I'll just call up this patch.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.900
And what I'm going to do is,
I'm just going to close

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.900
this for a second.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.880
I'm going to come up here to my song.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.900
This is my verse.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.900
So I'm just going to
zoom out a little bit.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.900
Let's take off the
automation of this track.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.900
And, let's say I want to actually just
go ahead and record a little,

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.900
just a simple line.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.900
Nothing extravagant.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.900
We're just going to record.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.000
Love is so good.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:41.880
If I make a mistake
I can stop and go again.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:47.470
I can actually come
down just a little bit.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:30:05.680
And you can see once I stop recording,
as bad as that performance was,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.390
it gives me a MIDI sequence right
there in the arrange window,

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.870
which I can zoom in,
and I can come over here and

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.450
I can quantize that to correct
those mistakes that I made,

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.870
and do some other editing to it.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.740
So I'll leave that for now.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.850
Let me show you another instrument,
the EVD-6,

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.510
yet another modeled instrument.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:33.950
Now the modeling of this particular
instrument is done using a string.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.610
It kind of models the characteristics
of a stringed instrument,

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.320
in this case, a clavinet.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.150
So for example, it can sound like this.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.370
Or we could change that to
sound a little bit more like,

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.330
say, a guitar.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.440
Makes me feel like singing
a Michael Bolton song.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.500
Yes, who needs that?

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.080
We can add some tape delay over here.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.100
We can see that we were talking about
the channel strip in Logic before.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.100
You can see that the
EBD 6 is right down here.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.330
That is the actual instrument,
and then up here I have

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:26.400
some effect slots,
so I can add a delay to that.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.510
And also some modulation to
really enhance that sound.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.200
And we can also mute that,
and we can come down here.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.470
It's got wonderful effects built in.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:52.100
It has got an incredible phaser built in,
the same phaser that is

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.380
used all throughout Logic.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.600
Also a wow-wow pedal,
a classic guitar wow-wow

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.960
is built right in.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.470
So let's see.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.310
Let's get that up.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.380
Classic.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.120
And of course that can be automated.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.230
We can create auto-wow patches.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.150
Phenomenal.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.640
I actually like to use the
EVD-6 just to give me a bit

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.250
more sort of rhythmic stuff.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.830
For example,
I might come down here and enhance that

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.480
piano part that I've just put down.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.450
Okay, so here's my piano part,
I just want to add a little... Just a

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:46.100
little bit of sort of chicken picking.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.300
♪ Love was so good ♪

00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:01.260
Stop playing, of course then I'm left
again with an object here,

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.340
but this time I could potentially
just loop it over and over

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.780
again so it keeps repeating.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.310
I've actually got some
echo on that via Ascend.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.070
The actual EVD 6 is panned
slightly to the left,

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.640
and the echo slightly on the right,
just to give me a slight stereo imaging.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.870
So that's the EVD-6,
absolutely phenomenal.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:41.830
Let's take a look now at, quickly,
at the ES-1.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.940
The ES-1 is one of our
synthesized plug-ins.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.500
This is a single
oscillator synth plug-in.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.490
It actually has a
sub-oscillator right down here.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:57.500
So there's the classic sawtooth square
wave with pulse width modulation.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.360
We've got the mixer,
which lets us mix between the main

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.500
oscillator and the sub-oscillator.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.500
A very simple signal path
goes through a drive,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.500
which can be driven into a filter,
a four-stage filter with a 24 dB slope,

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.500
12 dB slope, 18 dB slope.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.430
How many people actually
know what that means?

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.910
Mate, could you tell me?

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:22.220
So we even have our classic fat slope,
and usually when you

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.560
slope by as much as 24,
you lose a lot of the

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:25.560
bottom end to the sound,
so our fat filter allows us to

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:25.580
reclaim some of that lost bass.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:45.600
Absolutely...

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.900
Amazing, my god, I'm drooling,
can't believe it.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.900
Here's another bass.

00:34:51.970 --> 00:35:02.300
Wow, just incredible.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.290
Let's have a listen to
a little lead sound.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.020
And of course,
what a difference if you just

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.790
add a little bit of delay.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.440
So that's the ES-1.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.300
Absolutely incredible.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.090
It does have a built-in
ADSR for adjusting your attack,

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.890
decay and release.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.180
I'll just quickly show you that.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.400
I'll call up this bass patch.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.490
I can change.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.280
And of course there's a router right
in the middle because we have an LFO,

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.020
so we can assign the LFO to
trigger anything from pitch,

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:49.610
pulse width, our cutoff frequency,
our resonance, and we also can affect

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.350
the sound via velocity.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:55.830
So we could, the harder we play,
I could assign that cutoff right there.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.580
So for example, let's try this.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.420
I'll bring back down my envelope.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.170
So now the quieter I play,
that reflects the bottom right here,

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:08.330
which is zero.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.570
We're selecting cutoff.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.370
So this is the range as I play harder,
which will increase the cutoff.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:21.690
So that's the ES-1.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:26.490
Let's take a look at this bad boy
because this really is one of the

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.560
simplest UI designs I've ever seen.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.960
Where do I begin?

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.200
Let me select the track down here.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.380
I've got a simple brass pad,
just a simple sort of 80s.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.710
Music

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.600
And if you really listen to the attack,
it really kind of spits a bit.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.850
Now, this is a three oscillator synth.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.290
We've got one, two, three oscillators,
and we've got all of the classic

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.250
waveforms that you would normally expect.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.900
The difference on the
second and the third is,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.690
the second and the third,
their waveforms, like the square wave,

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.630
can be synced to number one,
so that you can create

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.940
that kind of syncing sound.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.650
Just over here to the
right of the oscillators,

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.970
we have a triangular mixer,
which allows us to mix between

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.320
the three different oscillators.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.400
On the left-hand side of that,
we have the tonal control, like so.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.720
Let me just call up a
default patch for a second.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.760
Maybe I can just borrow
Manfred for one second.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.980
Can you just come over and play
this for me while I tweak and show

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.730
what can only be considered the
most wonderful crowd ever at WWDC?

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.920
I just want to quickly show them here,
for example.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.530
So if I stick that right up here,
I'm only hearing oscillator one.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.370
And I can pick a digital sine wave.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.760
any one of a hundred digital sine waves.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.340
But the difference is, with oscillator 1,
I've also got FM right here at the top.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.020
It looks like that.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.300
I can slide that,
it doesn't really do much,

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.340
but what that is,
is the FM side of oscillator 1.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.080
It needs to modulate
itself off something else.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.360
So for example, let me show you this.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.480
So if I go to oscillator 2,
let me just turn oscillator 1 off.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.730
Oh, let me do that again.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:24.390
Look at that.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.520
Wow.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.110
Oh, that's fantastic, that is.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.760
Let me just try it on that one, Dad.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.780
Okay, so what I'm going to do is just
pick a digital waveform down here.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.840
Can you play it for a second?

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.120
So I'll just choose pulse 5.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.520
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to put that back over here to 1.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.430
Now when I slide it,
it will modulate the FM on

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.070
that second oscillator.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.200
"That's the nature of that classic sound.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.950
And then it's going to come through
here to a dual filter that can either

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.200
be put into series or parallel.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.190
So for example, this is in series,
that's in parallel.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.710
Can I do that again dad?

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.190
Look at that, that's fantastic.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.680
We have a blend mode that lets
us blend between the two filters.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:23.670
And we have low, high,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:36.220
Peak, Band Reject and Band Pass,
and also the classic 12, 16, slopes,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.340
as well as resonance.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.700
We can mix between the two.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.100
Over here,
we come to the distortion section

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.840
that allows us to add distortion.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.060
either dark or bright.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.810
And we've got a chorus
flange and a phaser.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.090
Now,
the thing about most analog synthesizers

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.210
is they are indeed... Where you going?

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.520
I'm finished yet mate, I'm telling you!

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:11.660
Come on!

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.420
The thing about most analog synthesizers
is that they're very analog,

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.210
and they do analog inherent things,
like for example,

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.870
when you used to switch them on,
they would sort of, the oscillators would

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:22.860
go in and out of tune.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:32.270
So, we have this analog thing here
which reproduces that kind of feel,

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.270
so yeah, just...

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.300
sends it a little bit out of tune,
just again to give it

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.260
that analog fatness.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:44.280
Then the other nice thing about
analog synthesizers is it used

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.060
to let you play in unison,
didn't it?

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.500
Remember Unison?

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.310
Yeah, she was a really nice girl.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.750
We can come over here
and switch Unison on,

00:40:51.750 --> 00:41:02.500
which essentially doubles the notes,
so now give us... And of course you're

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.440
hearing this with absolutely no effects.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:05.000
Thank you, mate.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.220
Round of applause for Manfred.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.780
He's German!

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:14.280
He's come over from Germany.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.340
He's been staying with me for a week,
and I haven't shown him anywhere.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.100
I'm showing him a damn thing.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.100
I've been sat in the
house working on my demo.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.100
So that's the ES2.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.070
A couple of other things about the ES2.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.180
It has an extensive modulation matrix
right here in the center section,

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:35.100
which allows you to route any parameter
to any knob or slider on your keyboard.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.080
It has also got three LFOs.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.360
One is a polyphonic LFO,
one is a monophonic LFO,

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.100
and then we have three envelopes,
a single one there.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.180
We have one that can be
used for the filter section,

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.870
and one over here that can be
used for the actual amplitude.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.730
So for example, I could take that,
bring down the filter,

00:41:54.730 --> 00:42:00.320
come down here in the modulation matrix,
and you can see here that cutoff 1 and 2,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.880
which is fine, cutoff 1 and 2,
is being affected by envelope 2.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.100
So for example,
if I want to do a modulation,

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:05.100
I can do a modulation,
and then I can do a modulation.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:10.210
So for example, if I bring this up,
the attack of envelope 2.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.840
opens up that filter as it builds along.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.940
So I want to put down
a simple brass part,

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.610
let's do that.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.740
I'm going to come up here and select my
brass again and let's just put it down.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.800
So I'm going to take off my automation.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.910
There we go.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:39.890
Make sure, just come up an octave,
there we go, up the volume.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:44.380
All I'm using here is just a
standard keyboard controller,

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.120
nothing fancy,
nothing really that expensive.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.000
They come in all sorts of
sizes and models and weighted

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.500
keys and non-weighted keys.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.230
You can also use the ES2 for
some beautiful things like pads,

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.020
I mean,
and we can open up the filter just

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:21.790
by bringing up the modulation wheel.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:43.800
Of course we can then bring up the volume
simply by taking the automation off.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.440
So that's the ES-2,
absolutely capable of producing

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.220
some earth-shaking basses,
rich, warm, analog sounds.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:59.220
I want to come back now to one particular
instrument which I wanted to do first

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.400
but I actually left till last because
I want to record some drums with this.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.400
And this is the EXS24.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.770
This is the sampler, built-in sampler.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.370
It is one of the most
popular samplers of all time.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:16.400
One of the reasons it's so
popular... Do you need a pillow?

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:16.700
You sure?

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:16.820
Okay.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:21.200
I've got one for you.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.020
What's nice about it is that it
can load up sample libraries,

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.960
not just made specifically for the EXS.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:32.240
This can load up sound fonts
if you happen to have a PC,

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:39.160
and you've got sound fonts that
you want to load up into the EXS24,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.280
that's not a problem.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.990
That will convert your sound fonts.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:00.330
If you have an old boat anchor
of an Akai sampler in a rack,

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:00.330
you know, one of those big heavy things,
or even more so a Kurzweil,

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:00.330
then you can simply take all of your
Akai CDs that you have purchased

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:00.330
over the years and convert those.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:00.330
The other nice thing too,
is anyone familiar with Giga Sampler?

00:45:01.500 --> 00:46:38.600
[Transcript missing]

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.500
I can't play that, can I?

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.880
Now, the thing about this piano is it
uses a different set of samples

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.500
for when the sustain pedal is up.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:57.890
What happened there?

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:08.110
Something's... Let's try that again.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:08.110
And it has a completely
different set of samples for

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:08.110
when I step back down on the...

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.580
So what you actually hear is the
sound body of the piano resonating.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.620
I'll give you for example,
it has another set of

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:20.880
samples which change when we
actually let go of the keys.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.890
One set of samples,
second set of samples.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900
Now it doesn't sound like...

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.250
Why would you put a second
set of samples on the release?

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:29.200
Well you might put it on for this reason.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.940
For example,
when you let go of the keys of a piano,

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.700
the body of the piano resonates.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.100
So if I take the release samples and for
example I just bring them down in volume,

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:43.400
it will essentially give this
piano a sort of dead sound.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.200
"No reverb, no reverb.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.190
Ok, so... Now listen to what happens
when I whack that up to +12.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.200
Just to accentuate it a little bit.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.520
It sounds exactly the same."

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.190
A little bit different.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:04.500
You can hear that natural reverberation.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:08.660
And that's the performance
factor of the EXS24.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.580
The other nice thing about the EXS24,
let's go back here,

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.450
is for example on this string sound here,
the modulation wheel is

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:21.460
changing the samples from,
say, a sort of legato sound like this.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.470
And when I pull it
back down to the front,

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:32.240
more staccato.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.240
So, beautiful, and that's,
same thing can be said for

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.410
what we call key switching.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:56.270
For example,
here's a violin that uses key switching.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.940
So for example,

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:00.780
There's a note.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.500
Now,
when I hit certain notes at the bottom,

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.970
it doesn't actually play anything.

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:06.380
It just serves to switch the sample.

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:09.710
So, for example, if I hit C1, I have a...

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.300
When I hit C sharp, it gives me staccato.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:22.190
And when I hit D...

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.760
Just like the cartoons running around.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.940
And we can go back.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.940
We also have tremolo.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.790
And trills.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.500
Wow, I feel so animated.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:47.310
So as you can see, as a performance tool,
it allows you to perform with

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.970
much... Thank you very much.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:55.540
allows you to perform with much
more flexibility and expression.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.840
Now, the EXS obviously does much
more than just strings,

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.600
and much more than just pianos.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.880
It will also allow me to do drums.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.710
Here,
I have an EXS loaded up with some drums.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.280
So if I want to record some drums,
I can close my plug-in window.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.100
I'm going to move over
here to my introduction.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:19.270
Just here.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.930
I'm going to mute this
piano for a second.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.460
There we go.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.430
And so,
what I want to do is I want to record

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.540
some drums over and over again,
so I'm going to check

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:29.820
my recording options.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.300
Auto create track in the cycle mode,
which is good.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:40.810
So... Just allows me,
if I make a mistake, I can start again.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.690
I'm going to shorten that by four bars.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:54.500
There we go.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.490
Select a track below it.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:22.180
You can drop out of record,
and I can solo.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.770
Just those objects.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:27.450
Now those objects have
been quantized on the way,

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:31.370
and that means, okay,
you set Logic by clicking here and

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.050
coming up to the playback parameters,
and you can see that we

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.660
have 16 swing enabled.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.970
So basically Logic's saying, okay,
got a real hack playing the keyboard,

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.580
he's playing stuff in out of time,
I just need to correct it all

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.380
for him so he sounds good.

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:48.980
And that's exactly what it's
done on those three objects.

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.760
I can take that off and you can
hear it in its original glory.

00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.340
And that's the nice thing about Logic,
because everything about

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.450
Logic is non-destructive.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.780
It doesn't matter if you
quantize stuff on the way in,

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.010
or you do it after the fact.

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:08.400
It will always preserve
your original performance.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:12.180
So, again, that can be 16ths.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.820
We could swing it a little bit.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.800
And I'll just put that back down to 16B.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.750
Now once that object has been recorded,
we can do a number of

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.600
different things with it.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.550
Of course it stops right here at bar 20.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.580
Now maybe I want that to
repeat over and over again.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:40.220
For example, this is my kick,
which I can name as my kick.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:44.090
This one down here I'm
soloing right now is my hat,

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.580
and right here is my snare drum.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.320
If I want those to repeat
over and over again,

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.100
I can just simply loop them like so,
and they will repeat to the

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.430
end of the song or until
they run into another object.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:04.870
Okay, now I also have another EXS with
a different snare drum on it.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.060
So I can simply move these things around.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.520
I can say, okay,
let's drop this to this track,

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:14.140
which is just another channel
with the same instrument on it,

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.770
but this time it's got a
compressor and an EQ on it,

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:17.900
and some reverb.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.810
So for example, so...

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:24.420
Okay?

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.940
And that is going to bus 8,
and I do want to check something

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.010
on my track mixer here.

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.210
Global.

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:39.100
Well I've got nothing going to bus eight,
so let's just do that.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.520
So let me show you how I would do that.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.530
I'm going to come here,
I'm going to say input bus eight,

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:45.710
there we go.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:50.240
I'm going to bring up a
mono to stereo reverb,

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.160
space designer.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.590
I'm going to call up,
let's call up this patch right here,

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:59.130
vocal, let's just use vocal plate, small,
there we go.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.620
And make sure that the, that's on max.

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:08.520
So now this channel receives bus eight,
goes out of output one and two,

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.670
so now that should give me reverb.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.700
Here we go.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.300
So I can come down and I can move my
hi-hat down to another track to give

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.990
me a less than electronic hi-hat.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.890
"I'll just move that down to conserve
space and I'll just delete that track,

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.470
that track, that track.

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:29.600
So now I've got some drums.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.150
Let's just have a listen."

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.410
Logic also deals with audio.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.180
How do I get audio files in
besides just recording them?

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:44.400
Well, let's say I want to deal
with some drum loops.

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:48.500
What I can do is,
I'm going to come over here to

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:50.350
Screen Set 7.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:54.100
Logic has 99 screen sets,
and don't be confused by screen sets,

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.200
they're not that complicated.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.200
They just allow you to
quickly jump from one view,

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.450
like this view,
to a view which is a little

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.480
bit sort of zoomed in,
to even something that, you know,

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.130
maybe has an instrument open.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.900
You have 99 of these,
and they're just recalled

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.560
by simply tapping a number.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.060
So I want to bring in an audio loop
so I'm going to go to the finder here,

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:17.560
here's my finder and I'm going to
grab this drum loop right here,

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.560
just go back to Logic and I'm going to
come along and just drop it right here,

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.450
just there.

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.880
And let's take a listen to that.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.470
It's just a four on the floor loop.

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:31.790
And let's bring it up in volume a little.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.800
Let's take a listen with the other drums.

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:39.830
And... They're not really grooving,
because this is a four

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:42.500
on the floor groove,
and the drums I recorded had

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.800
very much a syncopated bass drum.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.940
So, for example,
what I'm going to do here is,

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:50.140
I'm just going to take this bass drum...

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.970
And because it's looped,
I'm going to turn the loop off just

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:54.200
so you can see what's happening here.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.960
If I grab the right hand side of it,
I can simply hide.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.720
So that's just going to give me one kick.

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.140
Now I can make copies of that and say,
OK, well maybe put one there,

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.460
and put one there like so.

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:09.220
Or I can simply just loop that one.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.020
And that gives me a four on the floor.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.120
Or I can stretch it out a little bit.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.680
And let's take a listen with these.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.600
So again, four on the floor.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.090
There we go.

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.490
Take that solo off and take
a listen with the loop.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.010
Logic also reads Rex files.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.620
Rex files are a similar
type of audio files,

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.560
but the difference between these types
of files is Rex files allow you to change

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.620
the tempo of your song after the fact.

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.720
With this particular loop
that I just put in there,

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.960
that loop is a certain tempo.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.660
It just happens to be at 124.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.570
But I could, for instance,
bring in this conga loop right here.

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.380
I can drop that there,
and I'm going to say bring

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.340
that in without crossfades.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.340
Hit OK.

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:02.900
And it brings in a folder full
of little sliced audio there.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:07.010
And that will allow me to
change the tempo if I desire.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.340
So again, I'm just going to loop that.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.350
And there's the conga.

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.360
I'm going to bring one more loop in.

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.630
Okay, this is called Killer Loop.

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:22.940
I'm just going to grab that,
just going to drop that right here,

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:26.320
and this time, again,
I don't want crossfades.

00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:28.900
So, now I have another loop
which I will also loop.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.190
My original drum loop,
which is an audio file,

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.100
I'll loop that now.

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:34.740
So now my rhythm section
is really coming together.

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:39.130
I want to do some editing to
these parts I've recorded.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.220
For example, the brass stabs.

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:44.450
I want those in the beginning.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:53.750
Now I don't want to hear
her just make my heart go.

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.760
She's just not moving me,
so I'm just going to mute her for now.

00:57:56.870 --> 00:58:00.500
I can't be doing with it,
you know what I mean?

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.840
I also want to bring in the pad,
so I'm just going to

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:04.700
slide the pad in there.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.700
Don't move the automation.

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.690
I'm going to make a copy of the piano.

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:24.900
I'm going to make another
copy of the piano here.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:29.220
I don't want the clavinet to start,
so I'm going to move that to here.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:43.340
There is a little tag line on this piano,
two bars that I want to add,

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.790
so I'm just going to come here,
I'm just going to use the

00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:47.080
marquee tool and clip that out.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.780
In fact,
I don't even need to clip it out,

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.100
I can simply highlight it like so,
and then just hold the option key

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.100
down and just make a copy like that.

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.610
It gives me my little two
bar tag line right here,

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.770
then I continue on,
make a copy of that and

00:58:58.770 --> 00:58:59.840
just simply loop it.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.400
My arrangement is
starting to come together.

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:06.530
I want to do, what about editing
across multiple tracks?

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.600
Well,
let's come back here to the beginning.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.100
So before she comes in with
that "Love was so cool,

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:17.290
I want a little stop." ♪ ♪ Just here.

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:20.890
So again I'm going to
take the marquee tool,

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.400
I'm just going to go across
those tracks like so,

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:32.300
and then just delete them like so,
and so that gives me a nice little stop.

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:41.810
You can see that I've also got to stop
right here as I come into my verse.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.660
Right there in the chorus,
this is the chorus,

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:50.760
I'm just going to put the pad again.

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.020
So I'm just going to take the
pad and just hold the option

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:55.360
key down and move that to there.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.310
I don't want to copy the automation.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.830
Now what about if I want to
make some edits to audio?

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:05.070
Well that's also quite simple.

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:07.670
I'm just going to come here and
I'm going to find my snare drum,

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:11.290
which is right here,
and bring down that reverb,

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:12.590
it's too much.

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:18.260
So I want to do something with the lead
vocal in my introduction right here.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.580
I've got a little synth introduction.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.990
So I want to do a couple of things.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.230
I want to take the verse,
so I'm going to take

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:30.730
this verse right here,
just going to make a copy of that

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:32.940
right up to the top of the song.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.240
Do you want to copy the automation data?

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.960
Yeah, I'll, never, I'll just say never.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.770
So here we go.

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:41.960
It'll build the new fade files.

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:50.960
Love was so good,
could receive the trouble ahead.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.960
And what I'm going to do
is just come over here,

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.780
and on this last one,
I'm going to cut this up.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.630
So I'm just going to trim that like,
oops.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.460
Just going to grab the corner of that,
trim that to there.

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:08.750
You can see the fade.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.060
I can take that fade off, like so.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:14.540
I can add a longer fade, like so.

01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:20.310
And I can make a simple copy of that,
like so.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:24.070
I'll make this copy of the word baby,
just to give me a bit of a composite.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.690
There we go.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.600
Okay, and then the last thing I want
to do here is I want to take

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.100
two bars of this phrase here.

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.660
I'm going to take that phrase there,
make a copy of that over here,

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.100
but this time I'm going to
drop it on the track below.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.210
I'm going to make a
copy of that to there,

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:46.600
copy of that to there.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.100
This time what I'm going to do,
I'm just going to come here,

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.200
take out these effects
so you can hear it.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:13.480
So I want to get rid of that,
so I'm just going to

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:13.480
get rid of it like so.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:13.480
And again, I'll put a fade, just zoom in,
put a little fade on it like so.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:13.480
Let this play through,
and then I'll also snip the

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:13.480
end of that off like so.

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:19.300
Now what about effects?

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.660
How do we add effects
to things like this?

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.410
Well, I'll give you an example here.

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:23.600
Let me go to the verse one second.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.370
Here's the verse.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:29.240
Let's take a listen to the
lead vocal on its own actually.

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.530
Again, I'm using Cycle.

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:36.530
♪ But could we see the trouble ahead
♪ So we have the basic compressor.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.500
You see I've got a compressor right here.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.000
And if we unmute that,
bring the threshold up,

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.790
the compressor will just
smooth that vocal out.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.460
"But could we see the trouble ahead?

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.230
I wish I could." You can also add EQ.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.300
I've got an analyzer.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.300
"Have I read the thoughts
inside your head?

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.090
Did you go crazy?"

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.800
A little bit of AM radio there.

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:05.210
You can even put some distortion on it.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.080
And of course, I can have total shelving.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:16.130
Or a regular vocal.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:24.710
I'm boosting 200 which
gives it that wood feel.

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.710
I love things that got wood.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.090
So that's the EQ,
and then we have Space Design.

01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.180
I talked about this before.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.760
Space Design is a
convolution reverb that,

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.740
via a convolution method,
you can actually take

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:37.580
a reading of a room,
convolve that,

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:40.430
and it will give you an impulse
response file right there in the middle,

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:42.520
which is a representation
of a particular room,

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:45.890
and that room could be something like,
for example, a small vocal plate.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:56.800
[Transcript missing]

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.920
You can even half the sampling
rate to give it twice,

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.960
make it twice as long,
but also give it even a

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.440
bit more of a warmer feel,
because darker e-boards

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440
have a warmer feel.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:20.300
[Transcript missing]

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:23.360
It also does many other
things like for example,

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:27.460
I can give myself a stereo spread,
slap back.

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:37.000
Double Imaging And then using Sends I can
add some delay and some more reverb.

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.960
Here's another quick example.

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:41.620
On this edit that I made right here
we can use effects to radically

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.000
change the sound of something.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.110
So for example,
here I've got my edited vocal.

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:53.290
Okay,
so I'm going to add a spectral gate.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:54.380
This is a spectral gate.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.380
Listen to this.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:00.200
That sort of gives me a gate
all the other frequencies in

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.190
this particular patch is giving
me a sort of chirping effect.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:11.000
Um, could also be a tremolo,
which is just giving me a stutter effect.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.480
Add those together.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.540
Let's try that again.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:19.890
Oh, that one, there we go.

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:26.040
And then I can add a tape delay.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.930
And the nice thing about the tape
delay is if you push the feedback up,

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:33.250
you can send it into distortion.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.120
And that's nice because now I can
give myself some creative control.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.150
I can come to the top of the song.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.300
Here it is.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.300
We can see the edit
that we made just here.

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:50.910
There it is.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.900
I'll just zoom in a little bit.

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:55.790
I'll make sure that the
track is in touch mode.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:01.160
And what I want to do is use that
feedback to fill the gaps between here.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.270
So we'll do it like this.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.970
"You know what I'm going to do is just,
yeah, you'll hear it, it doesn't matter.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.190
Here we go."

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.300
You can see that just
records those movements.

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.380
Thank you very much indeed.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.220
And of course I can then go
into any of these and just make

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.370
breakpoint movements like so.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.880
I can take any sort of tool
and make curves or S-shapes.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.110
I can paint a really nice
little picture there,

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:48.980
if I really want.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.910
And then, usually,
throughout this actual demonstration

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.390
I've been sort of showing you,
you know, obviously the same editing

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:59.240
applies to MIDI and audio.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.680
But for example,
I had switched off the automation of

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.540
certain instruments like the piano,
and I can come back and

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:08.360
put that into read mode,
because read allows it to read the

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.940
automation that we've put down there.

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.090
So sometimes,
within the context of a mix,

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.780
when we solo it,
it's a little bit on the quiet side.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.680
But let's just take a listen.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:42.500
the volume up with that.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:48.160
Now there is no bass on this so
what I'm going to do is I'm just

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:53.140
going to finish this up by record
enabling this track right here.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:57.040
We'll just make it large
so that we can see it.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:02.980
We'll go to the top of the song and
make sure that my bass is working.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.670
I've got my monitor right here.

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:07.000
In the real world this
is exactly how it works.

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:10.940
We've got an actual instrument,
my electric bass guitar.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.840
As I said before I'm
not really a musician,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.840
I'm just a drummer so bear with me.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.350
I'm just going to back up here
to my intro and hit record.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.500
Just to show you it's working.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.460
Wait for it to come
around and here we go.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.270
That's it basically,
that's the gist of it,

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:06.200
you know what I mean?

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:16.300
And so, just to quickly come back,
it will rebuild the waveform,

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:20.150
and then right here in the solo,
let's see...

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:25.930
I actually made a mistake.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:31.970
I should have gone...
I can just cut that out.

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.460
Let's drop it out of record, there we go.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.310
And we'll just split that, one click,
gets rid of that region.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.910
Come over here, we'll just highlight

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:55.680
We're going to highlight that
two bar section right there,

01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:59.450
make a copy of that, stick it there,
make an adjustment to the end,

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.450
and we've fixed it.

01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:15.360
And of course it's extremely hard for
you to hear in this particular room,

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.200
but I think you get the idea.
