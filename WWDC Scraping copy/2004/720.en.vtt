WEBVTT

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.540
Okay.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.480
Well, first of all,
welcome and thank you for

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.940
attending this session.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.320
I don't know which is worse,
to have a panel directly before

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.150
lunch or directly after lunch,
but hopefully we can keep you awake here.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.520
So, as Frank Casanova talked about
in his Digital Media State of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.590
the Union presentation yesterday,
mobile video is really an exciting new

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.190
opportunity for Apple and QuickTime.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.520
With QuickTime's support
for the creation,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.200
delivery, and desktop playback of mobile
video standards like 3GPP and 3GPP2,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.200
we are a leading provider of mobile
video infrastructure and technology.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.180
And we're working with a number
of operators worldwide on both

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.200
the development and deployment
of multimedia services.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.520
So, in today's session,
we're going to step back a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.050
bit and take sort of a broader
view of the marketplace.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.350
We have some experts from various
different leading companies

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.200
within the mobile universe.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.630
And they're going to take us through sort
of their unique perspective on the market

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.200
drivers that are helping to shape this
marketplace and turn it into a reality.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.200
So, first up, we have David Brudnicke
with AT&T Wireless.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.140
We have Eugene Sarmiento from Ericsson.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690
And last but not least,
we have Gabriel Sidhoem

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.190
from France Telecom R&D.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.280
So, in terms of the format,
they're each going to take

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.180
you through a presentation.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.190
If we could hold questions to the end,
then we'll go through some questions.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.200
We actually have a little
bit of demo in here as well.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
So, hopefully, that'll deal with the
after lunch doldrums.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.920
But that's basically it.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.190
And I'll open it up to Dave.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.700
Thanks, Benjamin.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Thanks, everybody.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.600
Hopefully I won't bore you too much.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.760
I wanted to spend a few minutes
and give you some background around

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.810
the evolution of data services and
the work that AT&T Wireless has

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.160
been doing in this space,
and talk about some of the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.700
opportunities that exist for
leveraging some of the convergence

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.700
that we're seeing of capabilities.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.440
So, you know,
all the analysts have lots of reports

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.550
around the importance of wireless data,
and while they vary on what they think,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.140
how big the opportunity is,
I think they're all in agreement

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.700
that it is pretty substantial.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.060
You know, this is the U.S.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.700
forecast through 2006.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.970
I've seen forecasts for
mobile commerce in Europe,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.690
for example, saying that just for
mobile commerce alone,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.690
the forecast there is $5 billion,
and this is a data revenue forecast.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.680
So we're pretty excited.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.700
I think there's a pretty
substantial opportunity here.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.900
And this is important to us,
and I think it's important to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.260
most of the other operators,
in that data is our opportunity to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.570
reverse the revenue erosion that we've
seen happening in terms of decline

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.700
associated with the pricing of voice
minutes and services around voice.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.680
And a good example of
this is on the voice side,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.700
the opportunities to compete
are relatively limited.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.090
So there's so many permutations of
voice bundles and minutes that you

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.670
could create to be competitive,
and it's always a game of catch-up.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.680
Okay, they've got nights and weekends.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
Okay, now we've got nights and weekends.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.700
So come over to us.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.440
So it's just a mad dash of
customers running back and forth

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.700
between different voice plans.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.740
So back in 2001,
we formed a division within

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.460
AT&T Wireless called the
Mobile Multimedia Services Division as

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.590
a part of our investment
agreement with NTT Docomo.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.690
And we realized early that we
wanted to make sure that we

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.700
could get ahead of the data game.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.740
And really move the differentiator away
from being price competition around

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.420
voice to being data services that our
consumers would value and that would

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.680
provide some stickiness that would
keep the customers with AT&T Wireless.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.270
So moving away from the value that
you'd see in how many voice minutes

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.250
you have or what plan you have to
being able to look up the latest

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.680
sports court while you're on the go,
being able to check your

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.700
email from your phone,
traveling to San Francisco,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.700
which would be nice to know where
a good restaurant to eat is.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.040
it is,
or even find directions to the hotel.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.590
So we started this little M-mode data
experiment way back in the mid-90s

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.790
when we used to call it "pocket net."
And that was back when there was lots

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.420
of hype around the "wireless internet."
I think those two words together

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.060
back in the mid-90s were kind of an
oxymoron since there was really nothing

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.690
internet about seeing a five-line
black-and-white LCD display trying to

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.500
communicate what was on the internet.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.000
Running at 9.6 or 14.4 kbps wasn't
necessarily a very compelling experience.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But it was a great opportunity for us to
get our feet wet and learn some lessons.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.200
And some of the important things
that we picked up through this

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.000
was obviously devices matter.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
You know, back then it was a big clunky
Mitsubishi or Sony Ericsson phone.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.140
And while it was pretty
advanced in its day,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.000
"I'm looking at the
wireless internet now,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.460
I'm pulling out my antenna and waiting
for it to connect," was a rather

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.480
underwhelming experience unless you
were a pretty patient individual.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.470
And also, the other thing we learned
there was content matters.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.620
Our approach then was a walled
garden approach where we said,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.550
"You can have unlimited access
to the wireless internet,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.500
but it's the wireless internet that
we give you within our garden."

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.260
And back then there weren't a lot
of applications or services that

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.790
were necessarily enabled or could
be easily converted for application

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.450
and use in the wireless space.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.220
And probably most importantly,
one of the things that we learned through

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.910
this is it's really important for us to
focus on the environment in which our

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.500
customers are going to use the services.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500
It's not really practical to expect that.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.050
It's not really practical to expect
someone to pick up their phone,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.500
wait for the connection to happen,
to try to look up a phone number

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.700
when they're competing with voice
minutes and all they have to do is

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.500
dial 411 or call somebody to get the
information that they're looking for.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.500
So I think one of the most
important takeaways that we had,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.180
and I think what's important for
folks to understand as they're looking

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.120
at creating more advanced services,
whether they be multimedia

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.820
services or applications,
or any application that they

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.490
think they would like to
bring into the wireless space,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.500
is that it needs to be relevant
for the mobility of the device.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.390
And it needs to be relevant for the
mobility scenario and environment

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.380
and be relevant for the time slice.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.500
Because that's really
what mobility is about.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.140
It's about I have a few seconds,
I have a time slice of availability

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.520
to be entertained or find
information or connect to

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.500
those that are important to me.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.490
So I think that's really
what mobility is about.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.850
It's about I have a few seconds,
I have a time slice of availability

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.140
to be entertained or find
information or connect to

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.500
those that are important to me.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.870
So we launched M-Mode in early 2002
when we were in the process of rolling

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.900
out our GPRS network nationwide.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.220
And at that point,
we had hundreds of content providers.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.900
We had lots of applications,
Java applications, ringtones.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.880
You could go to 19 different
places and get news.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.650
And it was like walking into
Walmart and having never been there

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.970
before and just having rows and rows
of aisles of stuff to look for and

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.870
not really knowing how to find it.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.870
So one of the things that
we did in 2003 was rebuilt a

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.900
whole new M-Mode data service.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.960
And what was really important here
was we really were trying to focus on,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.430
again,
the point I made earlier about it being

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.890
relevant to the mobile experience.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.530
Through some extensive customer
interviews and research and

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.900
working with a leading design
firm here in San Francisco,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.900
we relaunched M-Mode and we remade it,
and we relaunched it last November.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.900
And what was really important to
us was that we had a lot of data.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.900
And what was really important to us was
it needed to appeal to the mass market,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.860
not to a propellerhead 35-year-old
person like me who was patient enough

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.900
and understood the complexities
of trying to buy a phone,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.350
figure out how to launch a browser,
get all the settings correct,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.900
and make it work.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.260
Because our real goal here
was to drive daily usage.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.120
We wanted this to be something that was
important and part of people's lives.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.770
And we wanted it to be a best-in-class
service through work that we were

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.850
doing with our content partners to
make sure it was compelling content

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.780
and it was meaningful and up-to-date.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:01.920
So today we have over 260 sites and
applications available through M-mode.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:07.930
These range anywhere from repurposed
Internet content or sites that

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.720
have been rewritten or have a
mobile version of their content,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.870
such as some of the new sites,
Google and others,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.010
as well as applications for download,
primarily a lot of Java content

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.600
available for phones.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.210
And additionally,
we even today already have some

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:28.010
sites that are providing streamed
content on the GPRS network.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.550
So some of the questions
I get from a lot of people is,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.090
well,
how does this whole M-mode thing work for

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.080
me as a developer or a content provider,
somebody who wants to create an

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.680
application and bring it to market?

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.170
We at AT&T Wireless,
and through our M-Mode platform,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.600
we don't host content.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.790
We don't have big servers in our
data center aggregating lots of

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.890
Java applications for people to
connect to and download and vend them.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.900
What we do is we follow very
closely the NTT Docomo iMode model,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.110
where M-Mode is your portal,
your connection to those

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.830
content partners and providers
within our sphere or without.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.530
We don't prohibit our consumers
or customers from connecting

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.140
anywhere they would like to,
but for those content

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.640
providers that work with us,
they can reach into our entire

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.900
customer base without having to have
an individual billing relationship.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.420
So it makes it really easy for our
content partners to bring an application

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.900
to market and to be able to monetize
it without having to worry about,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.210
"I have to print a bill,
I have to figure out how to do all

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.500
these transactions with the customer,"
because we have a very flexible

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.540
mobile commerce platform that we've
put in place to try to... take that

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.900
burden off the content partner.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.890
So I know you're all probably wondering,
"Well, this is really cool.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.470
What does this have to do with mobile
video or multimedia or QuickTime?" Well,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.900
bear with me and I'll get there.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.310
Because what we are constantly doing is
we're refining our platform and looking

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.900
to deliver new applications and content.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.810
Some of the examples of new applications
that we've recently launched are

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.900
the mobile traffic applications,
so that in over 70 cities in the country,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.900
you can pick up your phone
and within a few days,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:03.900
you can get your phone back to work.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.900
And within two clicks,
if you subscribe to the application,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.890
in your phone,
see the traffic conditions.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.520
So a logical evolution of this would be,
"Well, it's really nice that I can

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.900
see the traffic conditions,
and I see that there's a backup here,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.550
but what about that traffic cam
associated with that?" So there's a

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.340
lot of natural extensions that our
multimedia capability and devices

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.900
in the network could enable to
extend applications like that.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.900
We see the same thing with some of
the other applications with news,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:31.900
with games, with movies and movies.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.900
So we're trying to get that back.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.860
with movies and movie trailers.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.250
We are continually working
with our content providers,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.160
trying to help them understand what
capabilities we have in the devices

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.300
and in the network and our billing
platform to help them bring these

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.880
applications and services to market.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.100
So we've seen some pretty substantial
success that we're really excited about.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.100
In 2003, we crossed over the million
subscriber mark for M-Mode.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.260
These are a million active users,
and we see on average $7 to $8 a

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.100
month of revenue for those users,
in addition to their voice revenue.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.100
So if you remember back to
that previous slide I put up,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.100
we're really seeing data revenue
reversing the decline there.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.020
And we see advanced applications
providing us a tremendous opportunity

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.090
for both ourselves and our developers and
content partners to continue that trend.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.140
So, I talked a little bit
yesterday in Frank's keynote,

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.700
I mentioned 2004 being
the year of convergence,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.900
some of you may have been there
and heard me make that comment.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.400
And some of the trends that
I see and that we see at

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.920
AT&T Wireless and with our partners is

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.400
Three key areas that are converging
in this year and in the years to come.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.990
And some of these
enablers are already here.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.060
So we launched our
Edge network last year.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.700
We completed the deployment nationwide.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.100
So Edge, if you're not familiar,
is an advancement or enhancement to GPRS.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.860
And GPRS was the data
standard that GSM employs,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.100
and I'll show a little
network evolution slide there.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.060
But this allows us to provide customers
with devices that have the capability to

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:15.550
access data at rates up to 130 kilobits
per second with bursts up to 200.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.000
So the networks are getting there.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.970
New devices.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.400
One of the big challenges to
delivering richer applications

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.100
was device capabilities.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.430
We had, years ago,
Frank and I mentioned going to Asia and

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.100
seeing demonstrations of mobile
streaming over wireless networks.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.100
And, you know, one of the big inhibitors
was the Internet.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.100
And one of the big
challenges was devices.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.100
We didn't have enough devices that had
the horsepower to stream the video.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.220
They didn't have the big enough color
displays to actually render it in a

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.090
format that was meaningful to customers.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.100
And then there was battery life.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.280
You know, walking around with five
batteries in my pocket so I can,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.640
you know,
watch 15 minutes of video wasn't

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.530
a really compelling experience.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.860
And, of course,
new types of applications,

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.850
some of those of which I've showed
you and that we'll take advantage

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.420
of and use this capability.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.620
But more importantly are the
tools that are needed to bring

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.480
these applications to market.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.350
Three years ago,
a content partner of ours

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.550
would have been forced to say,
"Okay, I want to deliver rich

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.460
content to my consumers.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.080
How am I going to do this?" Well,
I could go out and buy a real

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.810
server and pay for lots of
hardware and lots of licenses,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.430
or should I use packet video?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.640
But if I use either of those,
then I have to work with the device

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.100
manufacturer to make sure they're
putting the appropriate hardware

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.500
codecs and everything into them.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.500
And there were a lot of
hodgepodge of standards.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.800
Standards were evolving and
weren't quite there yet.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.210
But this year,
I think we've really seen the

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.290
standards turn the corner,
and that we're actually seeing these

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.240
capabilities and standard compliant
capabilities implemented in tools.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.940
And I think what Apple's done with
QuickTime and their tool set there

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.130
for content authoring and creation
is a perfect example of that.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.500
It's that easy to create your content,
author it, and deliver it to the device.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.690
So devices,
there's a whole plethora of devices.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.500
You walk into any of our
stores or competitor's stores,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.240
you have a wide variety
of devices to choose from.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.240
On the consumer side,
from smartphones to camera-enabled

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.310
phones to music-capable
phones to gaming devices,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.990
some that have been successful
and some not so successful.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.310
I'm sure some of you have probably
been to that favorite Nokia,

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:25.120
non-Nokia site, sidetalking.com,
where you see lots of people

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.200
talking on their taco.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.540
So there's definitely been some
lessons learned by both the operators

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.970
and the device manufacturers.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.860
On the enterprise side,
we offer a pretty rich array of devices

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.840
to support our enterprise customers'
access to their corporate data,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.140
applications,
and email in a secure manner,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.930
both through devices as well as
PC cards and working with various OEMs

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:52.310
to ensure that the capabilities are
baked into the device at the factory.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.580
The network evolution has been a
really interesting journey for us.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.600
As I mentioned,
we launched GSM and GPRS and

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.780
completed our build-out in late 2001,
and that completed our GPRS deployment.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.920
Last year, we did an upgrade nationwide
across all of our network,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.510
which took us to edge,
which takes us up to 384 kilobits

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.000
per second aggregate throughput.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And again, that varies by conditions
and the device's capability.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.670
Not every edge device is going to
be configured by the manufacturer to

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.930
take advantage of all the throughput.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.730
But on average, the newer devices,
such as the device I'll

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.000
do a little demo on,
the Nokia 6620,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
is a four-time slot edge device.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.240
It's a Class 10 device,
for those of you who may be following

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.000
some of the wireless standards.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.740
But what that means is I have the
ability to access data at speeds up to

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.000
about 120 to 130 kilobits per second.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
That's pretty cool,
considering I'm mobile.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.990
And for the PowerBook users
in the audience,

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.190
this is the greatest
wireless modem I ever had,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:51.000
because I just turned
Bluetooth on on my laptop,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and I'm connected.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.980
It blows dial-up away.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.450
And now, with improvements we've
made to our network,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.990
it's accessible just about everywhere.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.460
We also announced that this year
we would be deploying the next

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.240
evolution on the GSM data path,
and that is our move to wideband CDMA,

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.070
or you may have heard
it referred to as UMTS.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.100
We'll launch UMTS in
four cities this year.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.040
We've launched it already.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.100
It's available in Dallas.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.100
That was our original launch
city that we were testing in.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.880
We'll launch it in three
other cities this year.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.360
And some of you may be familiar
with the fact that we're

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.100
being acquired by Singular.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.160
And Singular has announced that
they will be--they're fully

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.100
committed to UMTS and will be
launching UMTS nationwide as well.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.100
So we're really excited that
the bandwidth is increasing,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.100
and there is a pretty robust
evolution path that takes us to HS.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.090
That's actually misspelled.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.090
It should be DPA, and that stands for
High-Speed Data Packet Access.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.200
But it's just the next evolution
in the GSM/GPRS data path.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.660
So what is this Edge thing?

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.300
I talked a little bit about it,
but what's great about

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.610
Edge is we rolled out Edge,
and all we had to do was a

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.740
software upgrade to our network.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.830
We didn't have to go out
and replace radios and roll

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.200
trucks and have forklifts.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.460
And Edge is essentially just a
new algorithm that takes what was

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.960
previously required three data time
slots in the GPRS world and condenses

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:24.210
that into one time slot in Edge,
which is really important to

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.120
us because not only it frees
up capacity on the data side,

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.480
it frees up capacity on the voice side,
so it's a big efficiency

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.970
improvement for us.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.590
So what does this mean to services,
and what does this mean to those

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.190
folks who want to create multimedia
applications and deliver those?

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.150
Well, you can see the evolution here.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.110
I talked about GPRS.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:48.160
We got pretty excited when GPRS came out,
but the reality is, on average,

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.200
a GPRS device supports around
30 kilobits per second,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.200
which means you probably want
to do a typical video encode at

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.180
around 24 kilobits per second.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.170
And streaming is probably something a
lot of people would avoid under GPRS,

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.190
unless you were doing some
lower-quality AM quality audio streams.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.760
But it was good for crude
video or more of a slideshow or

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.170
download and playback scenario.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.200
With Edge,
we've seen significant improvement,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.150
and Edge is substantially better
in that we get really good

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.200
quality streaming for video.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.180
For audio, you can have a pretty
decent experience with AAC,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.200
the 32K or 64K encodes
on AAC work really well.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.190
Streamed over Edge,
pretty decent FM quality.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.200
And the big benefit we get is
the latency is much improved.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.260
That was one of the biggest complaints
we got from a lot of folks was,

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.200
"That's great, you always have an
always-on GPRS connection,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.360
but the latency is really
painful." Edge is a substantial

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.210
improvement in latency,
and that's really important

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.200
when it comes to applications.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.960
And then, moving to UMTS,
we get really excellent

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.200
quality streaming,
even lower latency,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.200
and a good amount of performance.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.490
And the typical video encode around
128 kilobits per second provides

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.180
a pretty compelling experience.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.540
So we're really excited
about the capabilities that

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.510
have converged this year,
and we're excited about our partnership

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.180
with Apple and the work that Apple is
doing to enable folks like yourselves

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:18.200
to create content and deliver this
content without having to figure out,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.190
"Am I delivering this to the desktop?

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.180
How do I encode this?

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.450
What are all these standards?"
That's the beauty of

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.200
QuickTime and the authoring tool.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.300
And the authoring tool is, I just select,
I want to export it,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.140
and I don't have to be the rocket
scientist to figure this out.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.170
And it really works.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:39.200
Recently, a little side story here,
Frank, I'm going to make fun of you.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.200
Not really.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.190
No, I won't make any comments
about your shirt or anything.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.890
Frank and Elisa were
recently up at our offices.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.860
We were in a meeting,
and I was introducing

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.700
Frank and telling him that,
you know,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.900
this Apple job is just a distraction
because Frank's really a musician.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.860
And he mentioned his website to us.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.080
Well,
while we were sitting in the meeting,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.140
I browsed out to Frank's website,
downloaded one of his video

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.900
clips of him jamming out with
some famous guitar players,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.010
put it into QuickTime,
exported it to 3GP, and in the meeting,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.900
I streamed it over to my phone and
showed everybody in the meeting.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.870
That's how easy it is,
and that's how easy Apple's made it.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.900
So with that, I'd like to conclude
with just a quick demo.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.300
So working with Benjamin,
what we did is we took some

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.170
movie trailers and we encoded
them and put them up on their

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.890
Apple QuickTime streaming server.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.900
What I've done is I've got
a session queued up here.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.900
I'm going to connect to the server,
and we'll actually stream the Alien vs.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.900
Predator movie trailer
over the Edge network.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.870
And if the demo gods cooperate with me,
we'll actually see it working.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.870
So let's see.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.380
Get the phone over here.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.560
This is a two-minute clip,
and I could let it stream and stream,

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.690
and I would get about a meg and a half
worth of data moved through the network.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.520
So as an operator,
I get pretty excited about customers

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.200
moving a meg and a half of data.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.780
Obviously,
we have data plans and arrangements

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.000
available to our consumers that
make that affordable to them,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.800
so that's important as well.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.930
And I don't know necessarily
that someone wants to watch the

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.090
entire two-minute video clip,
but this is a great example of how

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.890
easy it was to take very rich content
on the desktop and convert it and

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.800
deliver it to the mobile device.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.000
So with that, thanks.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.850
Thanks, Benjamin.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.640
I think we'll note that was
actually streaming off of one of

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.910
our XSERV G5s back at Apple using
QuickTime streaming server,

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:06.110
and the content was created
using Final Cut and QuickTime.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.470
That client happened to be Packet Video,
but we work with a

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.310
number of 3GPP compliant

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.400
These devices come with
the real player on them,

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.400
which supports 3GP,
but it doesn't prevent anybody

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.500
from downloading other players.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.760
That's the beauty of having a device
with an open operating system,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.240
and the pack video player
works really well and is

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.800
available across other devices.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.270
So as an operator,
we don't have bias toward

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.770
one player or the other.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.720
Our bias is toward standards,
and our bias is toward

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.630
great customer experience.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.350
Thank you, David.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.900
Okay, so coming up next,
from the infrastructure perspective,

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.490
we have Eugene Sarmiento from Ericsson.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.150
He's going to talk to you a
little bit about some of the

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.820
Some of the other components
that are involved in delivering

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.160
rich media to a handset,
we play a very specific role in that

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.960
we are the streaming engine that
delivers content to the handset,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.310
but there's a whole bunch of other
stuff that has to happen before that,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.840
like billing and authentication.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.350
And that's really where
Ericsson plays a role,

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:16.100
and we've been working together to
ensure that both of our standards-based

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.590
solutions work quite closely together.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.000
Thank you, Benjamin.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.370
Can I borrow this?

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.100
Sure, why not?

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.400
So, good afternoon, everybody.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.940
First of all,
I'd like to thank Apple for giving

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:33.240
Ericsson this opportunity to address
the developer community that you

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:39.780
have and to give our insights on
the convergence of mobile and media.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.570
We've seen already a lot of
things that I might be repeating,

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:49.940
but I'll try to add the world view to
this in terms of what we see in mobile

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.290
media from the holistic perspective.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.500
To start off,
my name again is Eugene Sarmiento.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.500
I'm a Product Marketing Manager for
Ericsson.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.300
I've been working with the streaming
and download solution from Ericsson

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:08.300
for the past two and a half years,
working with the global operators,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:09.800
trying to push them.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.100
towards this mobile
and media convergence.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.340
Now,
the slides I'm about to present to you,

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.630
We'll mainly cover three main areas.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.800
First of all, what opportunities we see
in the mobile media space,

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.700
what's Ericsson's role in this space,
and finally,

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.960
what are the key success factors that
will basically take what we have now

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.590
into a full-blown service earning
millions or billions of dollars.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.160
So,
the first question I'd like to address,

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.530
of course, is why will mobile,
when combined with media, be successful?

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:53.700
So, what's so interesting about the
mobile network that will allow for

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.580
better services of media content?

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:01.770
Well, as a start-off,
what I've put on as a slide is the

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:08.600
huge number of mobile subscribers
that we address today with 2G,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.600
2.5G, and 3G networks.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.590
As you can see, in 2004,
we have roughly 1.3 billion

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.600
subscribers that are covered
with mobile phone technology.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:26.590
Now, this 1.3 billion subscribers are
potential subscribers for media content,

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:31.600
and we see another billion of growth
within the next four to five years.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.740
So, that's the amount of potential
revenue or potential customers that

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.600
the mobile media industry will have.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:46.600
We see a lot of growth in
areas such as Asia Pacific,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.600
specifically talking about, let's say,
China and India.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.600
We see in China alone a growth of
5 million subscribers per month,

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:56.600
right?

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.590
And in India, we have roughly 2 to 3
million subscribers per month.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.150
And we see the same growth
in Southeast Asian countries

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.600
such as Bangladesh,
Pakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.600
all having a total, let's say,
a total population of 100 million each.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.900
And at this point in time,
they only have penetrations of 14%. So,

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.810
there's still a lot of growth out there,
and what you can see is the

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.530
penetration of mobile phones is much,
much more than what there

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.560
is for the web today.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600
It's much more than the TVs.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.470
And what you can see also with the
number of phones that are coming out,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:39.400
there's more picture messaging capability
that are coming out than there are

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.600
digital cameras that are coming out.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.290
So,
we see all these factors as key points

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.600
in making mobile media successful.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.680
Now, the first thing that I'd
like to address or ask is,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.600
what's so different?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.590
What's so different about
mobile technologies?

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.550
Well,
I can basically sum it up in two things.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:06.600
The first thing is that
it's very personal.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.220
A mobile phone is the only
device that you have where you

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.600
keep very personal information.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.580
If any of you have mobile
phones with picture capability,

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.600
a big probability is that you have
your family's picture inside it.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.600
You have credit card information or
password information as I have it.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.320
And basically,
this is the only device that

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.600
you keep right up to your face.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.560
No other device has that capability.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:35.600
And that would mean that you could
push content to the mobile phone.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.590
Anytime, anywhere.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600
And, you know,
we always emphasize in Ericsson,

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.600
mobility, mobility, mobility.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.520
Because that's actually the
key for mobile technologies.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.550
So, it's the personalization
factor of mobile phones.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:58.050
The second part to that is that
users are willing to pay for

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.490
content on the mobile phone.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.600
This is something that's
very different from internet.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.510
Or web technologies.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:13.380
Because it's very difficult to have
the user perception that the internet

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.520
is a secure way to pay for content.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.580
Although it's taking
off with Apple's iTunes.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.600
It's taking off with real networks.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.550
And a lot of music downloads
we see from the web.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:30.540
It's still easier for a user with a
mobile phone to pay for that content.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.600
So, we see that as a big potential.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.580
Or a big reason why mobile
networks are so different.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.600
Just to give you a small example.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.570
I saw American Idol at home.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.600
Because my mom comes from, well,
my brother comes from San Francisco.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.600
And, you know, there's two,
I come from the Philippines as well.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.590
And there's two contestants there
that have Philippine background.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.950
And so, when my mom visited me in Sweden,
first thing she said was, "Oh,

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.470
do you know about
American Idol?" And I was like,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.800
"What's that?" And so,
she starts streaming, you know,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.590
using our wireless LAN at home.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.980
She starts streaming, showing me, "Oh,
these are the singers." Now,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.030
I think she would have done
the same thing if she had

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.450
that capability on her phone.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.360
You know?

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:22.600
If I was on the train going,
I think it was four months ago.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.300
I was going to an office in Atlanta.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.050
And there was this guy who
was just talking to me about

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.560
Michael Jackson's trial.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.600
And then his mother called.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.640
And she said, "Oh,
have you seen the latest information

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.390
about Michael Jackson and what's
happening there?" If she could

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:42.600
have sent him a link or a telephone
number to call to show her that clip,

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.600
I think she would have, I mean,
he would have, you know,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.540
shown me that clip and said, "Hey,
here's what's happening

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.350
with Michael Jackson." So,
there's a lot of potential

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.380
for mobile media.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:58.540
And 3GPP has seen this potential,
has standardized codecs as well as

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.600
protocols to make sure that streaming
is available on mobile networks.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.910
I think they're forecasting
roughly $6 billion worth of

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.600
revenue in five years from now.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.600
So, that's 2008.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:15.590
So, that's the first reason why we
think mobile media is successful.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.590
But there's growth drivers.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.330
And our colleague from AT&T has already
mentioned that one of the growth drivers

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.410
is the technologies that we have.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:25.600
Right?

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.600
And what technologies that we have today
in most of the world is 2G technology.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.560
Where you have up to 28 kbps.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.600
Right?

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.670
If you've monitored how Vodafone has
addressed very small numbers of users,

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.000
The first thing I want to say is that
mobile media content on the 2G space,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
since there's very limited bandwidth,
they don't push or they don't provide

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.920
streaming applications as their
thrust or as their core services.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.960
They're looking at download services
because then you would have the quality

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.990
of the video even though the bit rates
are quite low on these 2G networks.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.920
But we've seen a lot of the
operators in 2003 move into Edge,

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.960
which have 64 to 144 kbps capabilities.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.900
One of them is AT&T,
and there's roughly 76 operators

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.890
around the world who have Edge and
have launched Edge in 50 countries.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.630
So now we have the network
technologies with huge bandwidths

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.990
to deliver mobile content.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
So these are growth drivers
for mobile media services.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
And then there's 3G,
which is 384 kbps with 2 megabits.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.000
And finally for 3G Evolved, which is HSE.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:46.000
As he explained,
it's 384 to 15 megabytes per second.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
I saw a session yesterday
talking about H264.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.110
That's already been,
or is being introduced in 3GPP and

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:01.800
there's a lot of hype on that and there's
a lot of activity in making that codec

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.760
available for the wireless handset.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
I think if you have phones that have
not just 64,000 colors available

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.040
but millions and millions of colors,
then you have almost

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.960
DVD quality in 3G networks.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.460
So, what else do we see?

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.770
We also see,
since there's a lot of bandwidth

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:31.160
in the operator networks,
we see that the revenue potential for

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.400
mobile data is increasing year by year.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:41.750
This figure alone is
from Q2 2002 to Q4 2003.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:47.140
And you see 5% increases
in the operator's revenue,

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:51.910
in the revenue that
they earn off of data.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:58.870
And this has moved up from roughly
10% to roughly 30%, and that's

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.770
quite a big number for them.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:08.540
Another driver for mobile media is,
as you can see here, is the handsets.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.140
There are a lot of handsets coming out.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.330
Last year, when we were trying to sell,
well, two years ago when we were trying

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:18.200
to sell streaming technologies,
we couldn't find handsets.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.290
So we had to hire application developers,
create clients, put it in iPacks,

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.120
connect it to a GPRS phone,
and then stream content.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.050
But that's not the case today.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:34.370
You have all the big brands,
all the big terminal manufacturers,

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.580
Sony Ericsson, Nokia, Sanyo, LG,
all these Japanese terminal

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.230
manufacturers,
coming out with phones which

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:46.200
have video call capabilities,
content streaming capabilities,

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.440
download capabilities,
and this is driving the

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.200
mobile media market as well.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.080
Okay?

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.420
So...

00:33:55.150 --> 00:34:00.570
Now that we have the handsets,
we have the bandwidth, the next thing is,

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.570
of course,
for operators to take both and offer

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.000
mobile media services to the customers.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.490
And what we've seen is
there's a... Last year,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.000
it was more marketing-oriented.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.990
A lot of operators said, "Okay,
we have streaming capability,"

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.920
but not really fully launched it.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
So it was more a marketing campaign
that they have that capability.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
We're first, and basically,
we have that service up and running.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.830
But we've seen services
like TV to the mobile,

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:28.910
video on demand,
video telephony services.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.000
I'll just give you a short example.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.210
In Italy and in Sweden,
they have a service

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.910
called Big Brother Live.

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:41.000
Has anybody heard about Big Brother here?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.430
No?

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.000
Okay, there.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.390
Big Brother is a reality TV show,
and basically,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.620
a group of people stay in one place,
they live there,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.990
and they have cameras everywhere.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.230
What they did in Sweden is they
had six live feeds of content,

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.970
plus on-demand content,
and a director's cut, of course.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:07.740
The director's cut is the most
important aspect of this whole show.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:14.000
And they were able to generate
roughly 50,000 streams per week,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
and these streams were 1 to 2
euro each time you access it.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.850
So it generated a lot
of money for one show.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.000
And this is not the only
thing that's picking up.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.760
We've also seen what we call the
Master Tone Download Service.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.910
That's been picking up
here as well in the US.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.870
But it is very popular in Japan,
especially with KDDI.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:45.000
They have roughly 7 million
downloads of ringtones per month,

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.990
and each ringtone download is $1 each.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
So that's $7 million every month.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
In the US, Beyonce launched her song
with this Master Tone,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
and you could download the Beyonce song.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:05.990
And what it generated
was 1 million downloads.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.790
So that's roughly $1 million.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.150
So apart from that,
we have video telephony services,

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:19.000
where you can call people,
have video-to-video conferences,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
but also you have the
possibility to send numbers,

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.000
and with these numbers, stream content.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
And what advantages that have, of course,
is I could push a special number to you,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
and you would dial up through this
number and access specific content.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.270
So, what else have we seen?

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.900
As you see,
all the big operators such as Vodafone,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.090
T-Mobile with their T-Zones,
NT2 Tacoma with their iMode,

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:56.300
they're all looking at packaging services
and integrating that to the handset.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:01.300
It's all about the personalization,
quickness to access that content.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:07.300
And in terms of the services that
Ericsson has launched with our operators,

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:12.300
we've done live TV with a lot
of the Hutchinson companies.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.210
For infotainment services,
we've done a lot with Telefonica,

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.030
we've done a lot with Amena.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:21.240
SmartTone, we have a traffic cam service.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.200
I think you were talking about
the picture-based traffic cam.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.300
We have streaming-based
traffic cam services.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.100
We have streaming-based traffic cam
services in Hong Kong where they have

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.300
certain streets that you can select and
find out what the traffic situation is.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:37.010
But of course,
the most mature markets will always be

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:42.280
Japan and South Korea where they have,
specifically for South Korea,

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.300
they have roughly 400 different channels.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.150
And they earn roughly 7.5
US dollars per month on top of

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:55.410
their previous ARPU because of these
streaming and download services.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:03.720
So, there is an opportunity and what we
would like to do is have a special

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.960
role in the mobile media space.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:06.950
And what is that role?

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.590
First of all,
we address our customers' needs.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.450
And who is Ericsson's customers?

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:16.420
It's mainly operators: AT&T, Orange,
Vodafone, T-Mobile.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.820
These are our customers and what we
provide to them is end-to-end solutions

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:26.800
for person-to-person services as well
as application-to-person services.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:34.360
Person-to-person being SMS, MMS,
video call, instant messaging,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.800
as well as voice over IP over wireless.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.280
Apart from that,
we are also trying to bridge

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.110
the gap between the media
industry and the mobile industry.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:51.300
Although AT&T is quite advanced
in having a lot of partners,

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.690
a lot of content providers already
having access to the mobile

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.020
network and to the mobile clients,
there are still a lot of

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.050
operators out in the world that
don't have that relationship,

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.800
that don't know what the
content industry is doing.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.090
They don't know what
your competencies are.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.600
They think that, "Oh,
maybe it's the same thing as voice

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:17.200
and I'll just try my luck in this
service." And then they fail.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.790
So, there's a lot of things that
we would like to do for them.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:26.000
And one of the major things that
we would like to do is aggregate

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.800
content and aggregate applications.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.570
And this is quite important for us.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.490
And we have an initiative
called Mobility World,

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:41.520
mainly targeting content developers,
application providers,

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:47.190
and bringing them in to our portfolio,
testing them, verifying it,

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.390
and then saying, "Alright,
this is a verified application.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.600
It's a cool service,
and we'd like to take it to market."

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.530
And so that's what we do now.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.170
We do a matchmaking
and tell the operator,

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.400
"Alright, which one do you want?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.960
Is it the live traffic cam service?

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.170
Is it the music download
service called EMU's?" This is

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.610
another service we provide.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.190
And then the operator selects from these.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.760
And we sell it as part of our portfolio.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.500
So that's what our role is.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.640
And again, as I said,
we provide person-to-person

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.490
and application-to-person.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.240
So what's Ericsson's offering
mainly to our operators?

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.710
We cover handsets from Sony Ericsson,
as well as Ericsson's mobile platforms,

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:35.500
which is used by six terminal providers.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:40.810
We provide access networks,
which is routing, radio-based stations,

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.260
wireless networks.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.350
We have core networks,
switching infrastructure,

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.500
service networks,
which is basically enablers.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.330
And we have content and applications
as part of our portfolio.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.490
And apart from the hardware,
software infrastructure that we sell,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.500
we provide services to integrate that,
to manage it, and if necessary,

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.500
to host it.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.500
Because we've won a lot of outsourcing.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:10.200
deals when it comes to
supporting wireless networks.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:17.610
So, we think that we can take the
next step towards the convergence

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:22.900
of mobile media and our strength
in the system side from 2G,

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.900
2.5G, and 3G, along with, of course,
Apple, because Apple enables the

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.160
whole end-to-end flow.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.230
Without the authoring,
without them supporting 3GPP,

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:33.920
it would be very difficult.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.760
It would segment the market.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:40.160
So, I think that our competencies
in the wireless network with

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.900
Apple's content authoring tools,
the streaming distribution platforms,

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:50.370
when you tie these things together,
you have a very good story and a

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.840
very good offering for our operators.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.040
So, I have two more slides,
and basically this one is,

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.240
so now we know that
there's an opportunity.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:06.010
We have a specific role that
we've taken as Ericsson,

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.100
and how do we make it successful?

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.310
There's two aspects to it.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:13.100
There's the user aspect,
and then there's the operator aspect.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.020
From the user aspect,
we need to make sure

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.540
that it's easy to use,
it's easy to pay,

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.100
and it's relevant for the user.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.060
And we have a lot of initiatives
that focus on these three areas.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:29.660
From the easy-to-use aspect,
we have an initiative called Zero123,

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:35.100
which is no manuals, so zero manuals,
one button to access internet services,

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.100
such as, let's say,
a T-zone service or an AT&T service,

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.040
and two seconds to access
the content that I want.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.060
And three, maximum of three clicks
to find that content.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.100
So that's Zero123.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:54.560
And on the side for relevant services,
how we address that, of course,

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.030
as I said, is we have Mobility World,
where we collect the best

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.100
services around the world,
and we resell this to our operators.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.910
But apart from that, we do consumer lab,
consumer studies.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.100
We ask the users,
"What services do you want?"

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.630
Is it a peer-to-peer service?

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.100
Is it an email service?

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:12.990
Is it a video call service?

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.100
And these are things that we collect.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.100
And after we collect it,
we create packages around that.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.100
And then, easy-to-pay.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.230
This is one of the things that
we really need to consider,

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:29.590
because at this point in time,
a lot of the operators are missing the

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:36.840
growth they should be getting because
of the high prices they put on the data.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:41.100
I think it's averaging
roughly $20 to $30.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.100
Right.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.100
Per megabyte of data.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.230
So we need to make sure
that the packages are there,

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:51.000
or we have the capability to do
either subscription-based charging,

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.710
event-based charging,
or time-based charging.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:44:01.140
Finally, we have the operator aspects,
which are platforms, handsets,

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.690
applications, and content.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.830
These are things that,
if you tie everything together,

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.800
will make mobile media successful.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.540
So, as a summary,
the mobile network offers great

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:19.220
opportunities for both you and
us because we sell systems,

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.510
and the more traffic that goes in there,
the more systems we sell.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.410
Ericsson is leading the way,
and we'd like to invite all of you,

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.680
if you have bright ideas,
if you have applications that

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.510
you'd like to take to market,
we have the Mobility World Forum to allow

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:38.540
you to take your applications to market.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:42.230
Finally,
the key to success for mobile media is

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.700
basically exceeding user expectations.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:49.700
It's about the user, it's about the user,
and it's always about the user.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.700
Thank you.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.500
Thank you very much, Eugene.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.960
That was a great presentation
and excellent choice of hardware

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.200
in that architecture slide.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:08.200
Coming up next, we have Gabriel Sidhoom
from France Telecom R&D.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.640
Gabriel and France Telecom are
in a unique position in that not

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.200
only are they one of the lead
mobile operators in the world,

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.190
but they're also one of the
lead broadband operators,

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.200
and they actually have a R&D facility
here in the Silicon Valley.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.230
I think Gabriel's role is to be
the liaison between what's going

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.100
on in the Silicon Valley and then
spreading that throughout all of

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.200
France Telecom's operations worldwide.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.230
I'll hand you the clicker.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:40.740
All right, thank you.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.900
So a couple of hard acts to follow.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.850
I'll try.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:51.700
So I wanted to start first by
introducing France Telecom just to set

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.700
the context where we're coming from,
where we are today,

00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.980
the kind of challenges we're facing,
and then move into our take

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.770
on the wireless data space.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:07.300
Okay, so where are we?

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.860
We're a global group
present on five continents.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:16.500
We have about 117 customers worldwide,
117 million customers worldwide.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.440
And we have some global
solutions through strong brands,

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.230
and they're listed there.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.630
We're pretty much a leader
in most of our markets,

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.500
and we have both multinational
and fixed-line solutions.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.840
So these are our brands.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.730
So we have Orange,
which is our wireless carrier; Wannado,

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:42.500
which is our internet provider;
Equant is a corporate provider,

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:47.500
global corporate provider
in about 220 countries.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.840
Basically, there's an airport.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.500
Equant will be there.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.500
And then France Telecom,
which is the brand you see in France.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.500
And then TP is the Polish carrier,
which is a global carrier.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.490
And then, of course,
we have the same thing

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:01.500
in the United States,
which we own.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.490
So those are our two
major fixed properties.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:11.210
Now, it's interesting because this,
first of all, if we go back six,

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.720
seven years,
we were basically a fixed-line carrier,

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.260
doing phone, doing some basic data.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.940
And in the last six years,
through acquisition and growth,

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.400
we've become a full-service provider.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.240
And to a certain extent,
this has given us

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.500
opportunities to do more.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.400
It's given us opportunities,
caused us some problems, of course,

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.490
integration and so on.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.500
But one thing that's
positive in all that,

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.520
it has given us the view that
we treat our clients across

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.490
all those different contexts.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.500
So for us, it's really important for us,
for the client.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.500
In fact,
we're organized around client context.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:52.280
The client when he's at the enterprise,
the client when he's at home,

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:57.460
the client when he's in his personal
sphere that is in between those two.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:01.500
So our approach isn't so much to say,
"Okay, what are we going to give him?

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.430
What's our fixed services?

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.500
What's our internet service?

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.370
What is our wireless service?" But it's
to treat the customer as a whole and

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:15.990
pretty much serve the different contexts
that that client finds himself in.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.360
Market position.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:24.540
So if we look at in France and UK,
we're a mobile phone leader.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:29.500
We have about 47 million customers
for our wireless property.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.500
Internet access,
we have about 10 million clients,

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:38.640
and about a quarter of
them have broadband access,

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.500
which is probably not
impressive for the US,

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.400
but it's a pretty good rate for Europe.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.540
And we're a fixed service
leader in France with about

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.460
half of 50 million customers.

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:56.810
So basically half of our
customers are fixed customers

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.500
and half are mobile customers.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:11.310
So we have the three major properties,
and we have a distribution division

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.600
that distributes the products,
and that's very important in

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.590
order to reach that sort of,
to be able to meet our clients' context.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.240
And then we have a network
organization that provides the

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.690
infrastructure to our business units.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:36.380
So let's talk a little about who
we are in terms of annual results.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:40.500
So we're about a 47 billion euro company.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.600
These were the revenues for 2003.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:50.290
Our EBIT about 17 billion and
operating results of 10 billion

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.800
and a net income of 3.2 billion.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.700
Now, last year, this is to show the
improvement over last year.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.330
Over last year,
we ran into a debt problem and

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.800
have come out of that since.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.460
And a lot of the debt issues
that carriers were facing,

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:11.530
at least in Europe,
were due to some investments that

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:13.760
had to be made for 3G licenses.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:20.870
So we're very interested in
monetizing these investments we made.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:27.440
In terms of R&D,
we have worldwide about 3,000

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.700
engineers and scientists in R&D units.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:37.700
It makes us one of the larger R&D units
in terms of a European telecom company.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:44.700
In 14 sites, last year we had about 600
million euros dedicated to R&D.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:50.660
We own about 6,000 patents,
including patents for

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.700
MPEG-4 and patents for ATM.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:51:00.710
And in the last few years,
we've created about 15 spin-off

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.700
startups from our R&D units.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.680
So these are engineers and business
people who came up with an idea,

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.100
and then it was spun off.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:16.540
One company you might know is NVIVIO,
who is in the MPEG-4 space.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.030
In terms of our key missions
here in San Francisco,

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:26.370
so one is technology transfer,
the identification of new technologies

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.210
and new business models especially,
and then transferring those

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:31.500
back to the business units.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:38.620
Visioning of new cutting-edge concepts,
that is developing either a mock-up or a

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.230
demo or a prototype as the needs require.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.920
Developing IP and inventions,
integrating,

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:52.440
doing an analysis of the impacts
of technology integration

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.500
into our network unit.

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:58.260
Development and management
of partnerships,

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:03.500
and then doing a sort of operational
support of our BUs in the US.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.500
We have basically two BUs in the US.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.500
One is Equant, and the other one is a
company called Globcast,

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.490
which is a satellite services provider.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.940
Anyways,
I'm not going to go through this,

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:21.500
but basically this is our process in
terms of detection of new technologies,

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.790
validations, and implementation,
and then a handoff,

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.160
an operational handoff,
and then just keep doing

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.280
that over and over again.

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:34.200
What are our kind of
key practices right now?

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.600
They're wireless
communications and services,

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:43.110
the digital content management,
web services, identity and messaging,

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:49.600
broadband and network engineering,
emerging technologies, and advanced IT.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.750
One of the sort of the
conclusions that we've come up

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:59.490
with is that as an operator,
we need to move from being a

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.600
transport carrier to being an
intermediator for our client.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.710
And so that'll,
as we go through the presentation,

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.480
you'll see what that means.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.450
But that means really
being in a position to,

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:15.990
for example,
manage the client's preferences and

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.600
their context and their identities.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.600
If so required.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.600
And then,
because I think the future isn't so much

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.350
clients looking for information anymore,
I think clients are going

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:34.600
to want information to find
them based on where they are,

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:39.600
based on the context they're in,
and so on.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.040
And I think that
changing those two words,

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.050
you know,
instead of clients finding information,

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:50.870
but basically information finding them,
it structures a lot of what an operator,

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:55.600
traditional operator,
needs to do to move on and succeed.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.080
Because, let's face it,
transport as a business

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.600
is not the future.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.510
That's a very mature market.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.940
IP, you can become an IP carrier
with a very low cost today,

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:14.600
so they aren't the usual barriers
of entries that we saw 10 years ago.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.950
Okay, so now let's move into a little
of the market positioning in

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.920
terms of our wireless business.

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:29.120
So, anyways,
I just wanted to remind you all

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.140
of the 47 million customers.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.480
So what's going on in
the market right now?

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.470
We're in the 3G launch.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.960
The official launch is slated
for fourth quarter of this year.

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:47.020
Right now, we're bringing up about one
city in France per week.

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:50.510
So it is in test mode,
so we're testing a lot

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.080
of the interoperability.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:57.200
We're testing a lot of the
device management that we can do.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.590
And of course,
looking at the users and making sure that

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:06.170
what we're providing is well integrated
with the other services we're providing.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:13.500
In terms of 2G, 2.5G, basically,
there is a growing customer

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.810
base still and growing RPU,
and so we're bundling voice offers

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:23.150
with some basic data services.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:28.520
There's significant pressure from
the regulators to open up our

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:35.100
network and provide MVNO services,
which for us, on one hand,

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.570
is a source of revenues,
and people like Sprint have

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.310
done real good business with
providing these MVNO capabilities.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.960
On the other hand,
it does lower the barriers

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.400
to entry into market.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.380
It allows people to come
in with integrated offers,

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:56.400
so it allows a content creator,
somebody who owns content,

00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:02.110
to enter the market and be able
to provide a bundle service.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.160
We, as traditional telecom operators,
have really not gotten

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.380
into the content business,
almost stayed out of that.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.400
We were very careful not to
close the door on the internet.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400
We were very careful not to
close the door on the internet.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:18.380
certain of the boundaries
in the value chain.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:24.130
So it provides some issues
we have to deal with,

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.980
but on the other hand it's clear for
us that it also means that we just

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:34.210
have to be much better at partnering
with content providers in order

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:38.120
to be able to play in this market.

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:42.540
And then of course as we've all
heard image music games value

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:47.040
added services that we're going
to be bundling with a voice.

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:54.400
So here's what's going
on with the takeoff.

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.490
So the launch takeoff mass market.

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.280
You see by end of 2004,
we're pretty much,

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:07.020
at least for mobile TV and video
downloads and video MMS and photo MMS,

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.410
we'll be achieving sort of the,
we'll be getting past the takeoff

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.750
stage and getting into the mass market.

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:16.390
And then in the next year,
having video phone and

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:18.890
broadcast video being launched.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.400
These are,
so in terms of what's going on in music,

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:32.900
these are some of the offers in the
European companies of ringtones.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.650
So, on average,
the price of a ringtone is

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.900
about 3.5 euros in Europe.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:44.900
So that's one thing that probably
is in contrast to the US market

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:48.900
is the fact that people are
paying more for the ringtones.

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:54.970
It's an interesting market
because it shows the value of,

00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:58.880
I mean, if you think of it,
you could buy the song for 99 cents

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.900
and then edit it out and then,
you know, get the ringtone.

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:05.280
But it shows the value
of having a service,

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.810
you know,
that's perceived as being different

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:09.900
than actually buying the song.

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.570
So, yeah.

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:26.100
In terms of the music, okay,
so we lost the references here, okay?

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:26.100
I'm sorry.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:26.100
So,

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:31.910
What you see here is the
responses of customers in Italy,

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.350
the blue is UK,
and then the green is Germany.

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.410
Responses to...

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:57.800
[Transcript missing]

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:01.600
Most people agreed with downloading
being something that's free,

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.010
that people aren't willing to
pay for a service to download.

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.770
They might be willing
to pay for the content,

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:11.530
but not for a service that
allows them to do the download.

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.650
They also think it's a way,
it's a first step in perhaps

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.750
sampling a CD before they buy it.

00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:23.650
What we see in the UK,
a big difference in the UK versus

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.770
some other European countries
is that UK kind of like,

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.540
customers like to pay as they go.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.100
As opposed to having a flat fee,
you know,

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.420
an all-you-can-eat type of model.

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:39.340
So that was very interesting
in terms of behavior.

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:44.100
And basically--

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:49.230
Basically,
people were on either side of the

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:54.700
scale as to whether downloading was
something that was useful or appropriate

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.800
given their current terminals.

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:04.160
Staying on the music, so this is,
as we see what's happening

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.610
in the music market,
one is transmission speed

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:12.580
of the network increases,
and then you get more powerful,

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:37.600
[Transcript missing]

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:49.860
Finally, to look at the games,
we see a huge growth in people

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:54.890
downloading games to their mobile.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.890
We did a survey, and although it was a
significant difference,

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:02.900
it seems a small difference,
but of the people we surveyed,

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.900
15% said they were ready.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.900
They saw their mobile phone
as a way of playing games,

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:13.470
as opposed to 11% who
had gaming platforms,

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.880
portable gaming platforms.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.980
Now that could be also,
I think that's probably a particular

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:24.210
characteristics of the European market.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:32.050
So in terms of some of the conclusions,
I think that one, we really see that this

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.640
is the way to valorize,
because let's face it,

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:41.080
voice is still the killer application
on any type of wireless network.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:45.040
And in fact,
3G actually makes voice more efficient.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.650
And it's probably a value
proposition that's more appropriate

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:57.000
in the U.S., where as you upgrade,
you get better quality on your voice.

01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:01.740
The second point is very important,
because I think that for us,

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.710
it's user-created content that's
going to make this market take off,

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.800
and not necessarily just
professionally created content.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.160
At some point, I think we're going to see
the same phenomena we've seen,

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.000
where people use a service a lot,
for like the first year,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:17.910
and then there's a drop-off.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.480
I think what's truly going to
have the stickiness is when

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:26.000
users can integrate their own
content with professional content,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.810
or just create their own
content and be able to use it

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:33.570
and display it on their phone.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.530
Of course,
that also means that there needs to be

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.970
some developments in the metadata field.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.960
In fact, being able to capture
in real time metadata.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.960
That's going to be one of the source
of innovations in the years to come,

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:53.180
as will your indexing
strategies of that metadata,

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:57.960
and how you correlate it
with user preferences.

01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.520
In order to be able to
push the right things,

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:07.640
in order to be able to make sure
you can recommend to the client,

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.280
you know, well, if you like this song,
you might like this song,

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.150
and you can download it right
now or hear a sample right now.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:20.000
And finally, I think we're positioned to
provide innovative services.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.240
That sounds probably banal,
but I think the reason I put

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.890
that up there because of the,
I think it's going to be important

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:32.980
to all carriers to treat their
clients in a holistic manner,

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:38.420
not as a wireless client sometimes and
sometimes as a different type of client.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.540
They're one client with
different contexts.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:45.880
In different contexts,
they have access to different devices.

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:50.240
And by understanding
what their contexts are,

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.570
you're in a better position
to be able to provide them the

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.580
content that they may need.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.370
All right, thank you.

01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:00.670
Kevin, thank you very much.
