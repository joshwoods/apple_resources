WEBVTT

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.890
Good morning everybody and
welcome to session 708,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.970
Introduction to QuickTime Streaming.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.740
My name is Stephen Tonna.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.420
I work on the QuickTime product
marketing team.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.310
This session is going to give you an
overview of how the streaming server

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.300
works and basically how to get your
content up on the streaming server

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.530
in order to deploy it across the
Internet and actually other mediums

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.670
including wireless cell phones.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.890
And in addition,
Victor is going to go through a little

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.820
bit about how to set up a live broadcast.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.570
So with that, we have who works on the
Mac OS X server software

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.100
engineering team as a seed engineer.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.840
And he's also set up
actually in his former life,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.420
he did a technical training
class on QuickTime Streaming.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.780
So he knows just about everything
there is to about how to get up and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.580
running with QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.540
So without further ado,
I'll let him take over.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.190
Thanks, Stephen.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.260
My code is done.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.890
Excellent.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.990
So introduction to
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.090
This is a introductory session.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.140
So if you've done streaming before
in any moderate to large capacity,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.890
I would encourage you to check
out one of our advanced streaming

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.270
sessions later on today and tomorrow,
or check out another

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.490
session in this time block.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.990
Because this definitely is just
an intro to get you up and running

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.960
with some real world steps.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.440
As Stephen said, I'm Victor Alexander,
software seed engineer.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.310
I pretty much focus on
enterprise software,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.470
so Mac OS X Server,
which QuickTime Streaming

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.440
Server is a part of that package.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.180
Definitely love
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.580
I've been doing it for several,
several years.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.380
So let's get an
introduction out of the way.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.760
We're going to talk about the
topic of real-time streaming.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.340
I'm going to give you just a basic
intro of what it is so we have

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.330
a basis to have a discussion.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.050
Give you some setup and
configuration information,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.760
shorten your learning curve hopefully
so when you go home to try this,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.090
you'll be ready to go.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.420
My focus will be on
QuickTime Streaming Server,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.260
QuickTime Broadcaster,
and QuickTime Publisher.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.160
So those are the three tools.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.340
There are other streaming
tools that are available,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.560
commercial third-party
applications in a lot of cases.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.960
But I'll focus on those because those
are freely available and you can

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.900
check them out and work with them
and it's a good basis to start with.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.140
I'll cover some new features added
in QuickTime Streaming Server that's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.610
included with Tiger Server.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.380
And I'll try and give you some real-world
steps as best I can so that you can

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.720
go back to your organization and
get this running quickly and easily.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.270
So the good old what you will learn slide
will do an introduction to QTSS and QTB,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.490
QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.900
I'll show you how to do a quick
session request to see if your

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.240
server is running properly,
all important.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.840
We'll talk about preparing
media for the streaming server,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.600
working with playlists, QTSS Publisher.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600
We'll do a quick live streaming
demo if all goes well.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.090
And we'll do some Q&A at the end
if there's any questions you have.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.880
So first off,
what is real-time streaming?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.400
We need a basis of discussion here.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.400
So real-time streaming is basically
moving media from a server to a client

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.420
over a network for playback in real time.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.430
And that's fundamentally different
from opening up your web browser,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.710
say, for example,
going to the QuickTime movie trailers

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.340
website and watching a movie trailer.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.860
That experience is not
quite as time sensitive.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.310
Some people call that
experience streaming,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.990
but in true underlying terms,
it's really not.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.720
The files are just progressively
downloading to your machine,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.480
and you'll start playing them back when
enough of that content is downloaded.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.340
What we're talking about here
today is actually a streaming

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.060
server with protocols to
support that real-time exchange.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.180
It's a very, very time-sensitive process.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.480
The main fundamental protocols are RTP,
which is Real Time Transfer Protocol,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.890
and RTSP, Real Time Streaming Protocol.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.410
These are really brother and sister
protocols that work together to get a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.270
stream from the server to the client.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.060
RTP is really the meat and
potatoes of the stream.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.110
It carries the actual stream content.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.000
It's the video and audio
that you watch on screen.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.090
RTSP is the control.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.400
So it does the stop, the pause,
the close the window

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.050
to destruct the stream.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.470
It's really the control language.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.950
So they work in concert with each
other to negotiate with the client and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.220
server to get that content down to you.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.160
But really, RTP does a lot of the heavy
lifting in terms of pushing

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.710
actual media across the network.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.710
Another thing to note about real-time
streaming is that no files are

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.620
written to the client's computer.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.870
And for people who have a,
are concerned about copyright and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.310
where their files get distributed,
that's a big deal.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.780
They want to make sure they
maintain control of their content.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.580
They want to broadcast a concert.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.560
They want to broadcast a CEO address.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.710
They want to broadcast their earnings.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.980
They want to make sure their
information stays on their servers.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.740
And all the client viewers,
all the people who are watching it,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.630
all they're left with is a good memory.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.970
They're not left with a copy
of the actual presentation.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.660
So that's useful to know.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.460
There's three main methods
of presentation in using the

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.960
QuickTime streaming server.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.620
The first one is video on demand.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.790
If you've ever missed a macro
keynote by Steve Jobs and then

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.810
gone to our Apple website a
few days later to watch it,

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.130
you're watching a video on demand.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.680
You go to the website, you demand it,
it plays it back.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.320
The second kind is a simulated live,
which is more like a radio station.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.810
The third is a live stream.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.780
In fact,
that's the thing that most people,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.510
it tends to attract them to
QuickTime Streaming Server and

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.180
its related tools because
the live is so compelling.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.820
It's timely information that
your viewers want to watch.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.100
So here's a really,
really basic architecture, right?

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.880
You've got your media, really,
it's sitting on the server,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.580
and you're sending it over a network,
typically a TCP IP network,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.480
and you're sending it to your client.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.680
Right?

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.340
Really easy.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.220
Just keep that model in mind whenever
you're working with the streaming server.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.190
It's just these pieces are in play.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.840
In reality, it's really these players,
right?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.900
You've got some quick-time content.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.590
You've got, of course,
everyone has a rack of XSERVs, right?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.280
You just stream your stuff off,
and you've got a client

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.230
on the left-hand side.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.780
So some basics about
the streaming server,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.900
which I think will be helpful.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.270
Just like a lot of what Apple does,
the QuickTime Streaming Server is

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.440
based on open standards.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.950
There are ratified RFC standards
behind the protocols that

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.540
the streaming server uses.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.100
The goal is for us to work well with
other players in the same space.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.100
So RTP and RTSP are open standards.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.440
Anyone can write players or servers or
pieces that will work in that system.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.630
A single server, literally,
a QuickTime Streaming Server literally

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.280
can handle thousands of connections.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.180
In the last couple of
versions of Streaming Server,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.600
we've added support for MPEG-4 streaming,
which is excellent.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.200
You have also a feature in
recent versions of QuickTime,

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.300
which is instant on.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.870
If you've ever watched a stream,
you've probably gone to watch it,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.330
and you have to wait a few
seconds for the stream to start

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.140
playing while the stream buffers.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.900
If you have a broadband connection,
that time duration will be very,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.360
very short, if not nil.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.720
So the stream will start to
play back almost immediately.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.550
There's web-based
administration built in,

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.080
as well as a tool provided
with Mac OS X Streaming Server,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.000
which is very useful.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.310
So if you're on a platform
other than the Macintosh,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.340
you can just open up a browser
and manage your streaming server.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.930
And the design of QTSS is
really similar to Apache.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.180
So if you have any
experience with Apache,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.600
the design mechanisms that it
implements are very similar.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.660
So there is an open source version of
the QuickTime Streaming Server called

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.460
the Darwin Streaming Server.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.000
Really all that means is
you get all the same kind of

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.180
capabilities in the core server,
except the Darwin Streaming

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.150
Server is distributed for platforms
other than Mac OS X Server.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.860
So there's a short list there, right?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.420
Mac OS X, you can download a version of
Darwin Streaming Server for Mac OS X,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.960
Linux, Solaris, Windows.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.980
Of course,
the source code is available if

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.300
you're very gung-ho and you have
other units operating system,

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.220
you want to compile the source code,
it'll work just fine.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.520
An impressive list of
places the server can run.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.780
So Server Admin.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.990
This is a new tool as of
Mac OS X Server version 10.3,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.480
so last year's presentation.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.300
It was brand new.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.500
It continues on, this tool continues on,
in the Tiger Server version.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.430
It's basically a general
configuration tool for a number

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.220
of services in Mac OS X Server.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.140
But of course now they have a QTSS module
as of the last version of the server.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.050
There's some QTSS configuration
monitoring tools built into that

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.820
tool that makes this valuable for us.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.040
You can do IP binding,
if you happen to know what that means.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.810
You can check out the throughput graphs
and how many connected users you have.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.300
Of course you can do remote
administration with this tool as well.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.120
You can copy the server
admin to another machine,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.950
maybe your admin machine,
and run that and monitor

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.910
your server from there.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.410
So demo.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.990
So let me show you.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.410
We can switch to computer one.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.180
So I have Mac OS X Server installed,
version Tiger,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:24.370
the same version you have picked up,
of course, from our registration desks.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.160
All I'm going to do is I'm going to
give you a quick tour of Server Admin.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.000
So I'm going to launch
Server Admin and take you into the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.750
QuickTime Stream Server related pieces.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.610
So on the upper left,
we have our machine that

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.380
we're interacting with.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.270
I'm actually admitting the
machine I'm sitting in front of.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.320
It doesn't have to be that way.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.440
You can run server admin, as I said,
remotely.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.940
I'll turn down the left
hand disclosure button,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.240
and we'll see that QuickTime Streaming
is an available option.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.380
So this is present in Tiger Server and
Mac OS X Server version 10.3.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.840
We have a general status here, of course.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.220
You can check out your logs.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.550
I should note here that the
server is currently stopped,

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.350
so we'll turn it on in a moment.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.420
You can check out your logs,
see if there's any errors or issues.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.000
You can also inspect the access log
to see who's been watching movies.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.050
Check your number of connections.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.700
These are current number of
connections of people watching streams.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.060
That list can get very long,
depending on how popular your content is.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.360
You've got some pretty graphs of
how many people are connecting.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.330
and settings.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.540
So in order to start the server--
before I go through the upper

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.240
tabs-- in order to start the server,
it's a very complex process.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.100
I'll show you how to do it.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.730
I click on the start button
and I wait two or three seconds

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.400
and the server is enabled.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.640
That's pretty much it.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.470
All the defaults are
a good starting point,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.400
especially for testing.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.400
You might want to go and configure things
as time goes by before you do a rollout,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.920
but turning the server on is that easy.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.570
Quickly,
just to take you through a brief tour of

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.260
the settings options that are available,
you can control where the

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.860
directory on the server,
where your movies you

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:04.010
want to serve are located,
using this dialog, this text field.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.020
You can also control how many connections
you want to do simultaneously,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.620
your maximum throughput.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.640
Obviously,
you should set those to relative

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.360
to what your internet connection
will be for your server.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.470
If you're serving the internet,
you'd probably want to set it

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.640
appropriate to your external
connection to the internet.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.980
If you're serving to your enterprise
or to your school or organization,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.480
100 megabits, if that's what you have
going outside the server,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.540
is probably suitable.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.770
You can also set some passwords
and access for doing live

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.270
streams and MP3 broadcasts.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.700
IP bindings, I won't get into this,
but it's very useful if you have multiple

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.300
Ethernet cards and you want to assign the
QTSS service to one or the other or both.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.020
Relays, a little more advanced topic,
but you now have a

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.300
UI for figuring relays,
which is very, very helpful.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.300
And of course,
you can control what the logging is.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.370
So that's pretty much a rundown
of what's in Server Admin for

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.300
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.300
It's pretty straightforward.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.290
As you can tell, it's just one click to
turn the service on.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.560
So now, how do I know this is running?

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.320
How do I know?

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.170
It says it's running.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.270
How do I check?

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.400
So there's an easy way to do it.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.060
If we switch to computer two,
I've got a client here.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.810
And I will launch my QuickTime player.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.330
So normally the streaming experience is,
for most end users,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.150
once you have a polished system,
is they'll launch a web browser,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.450
they'll go to some event page
where there is either a live stream

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.210
happening or there's a prerecorded one,
a video on demand.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.140
And they'll click on a
link and they'll be sent to

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.460
QuickTime Player in most cases,
and they'll watch the stream.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.880
But for us, since we're the IT admins
for the streaming server,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.720
we just need a quick test to make
sure the streaming server is working.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.870
So there's a very handy
little menu option,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.820
which is Open URL in New Player.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.070
And that's just a quick
and dirty way to--

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.980
That's a quick and dirty
way to make the-- oh,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.170
can we switch to computer two?

00:12:59.180 --> 00:12:59.600
There we go.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.220
Thank you.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.700
Let me step back.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.590
In QuickTime Player,
there's a menu option called

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.160
Open URL in New Player,
which is a quick and dirty way

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.240
to let you just quickly check and
see if a stream is functioning.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.190
Normally,
most users won't access streams this way,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.100
but for us it's perfect.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.140
We just want to do a quick test to make
sure the streaming server is working.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.440
There are sample files
included with the server.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.530
We've got one noted right here.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.520
There are various bit rates.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.800
This one's a perfectly
suitable one to test here.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.980
And we can go and see, and in fact,
success!

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.200
Our streaming server is working.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.000
This content is coming from
the server we just turned on.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.420
How do I know that?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.060
The information box reports
in the source that it's coming

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.490
from a location called RTSP.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.890
Remember me saying that
acronym a few minutes ago?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.310
Right?

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.440
Real-time streaming protocol.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.640
So this file is not playing
back on the local machine.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.770
It's streaming over the network.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.070
Perfect, our streaming server is running.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.180
Can we switch back to slides?

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.440
So we turned the server on,
we did a test stream,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.750
everything's working, great.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.710
Time for a coffee break.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.630
The next thing you need to do is you
need to get some content to deliver.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.620
Now this session focuses on
IT administrators who are

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.960
working with the server from a
server deployment standpoint.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.710
Of course,
you have a crack team of people

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.350
who are developing content for you.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.120
There's a whole other topic
area where people can shoot,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.770
edit, use tools like Final Cut Pro and
compression tools to compress that video

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.480
down to a suitable size and format.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.050
That's beyond the scope of this session,
but essentially what I want to point

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.010
out is that you'll need to find some
content somewhere that's compelling for

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.360
you to post on your streaming server.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.850
The one key thing to remember is that
you need to perform an additional step

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.240
just beyond taking that good quality
video you may have shot of some event

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.240
and reducing it down through encoding.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.380
You also need to perform
a step called hinting.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.720
It's a really simple step.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.030
It just simply adds a couple of
additional tracks to your movies,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.800
which give the streaming server a tip on
how to deliver the content via a stream.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.110
That's it.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.280
Very, very simple.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.490
So you simply export the
movie using QuickTime Pro.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.620
You can add these hint tracks
via a couple of clicks,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.650
and that's all you need to do.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.710
If you don't want to use QuickTime Pro,
there's other tools out there.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.580
Discrete has Cleaner, which has several,
several options for encoding,

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.320
but they also offer
options to add hint tracks.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.340
There's numerous other
tools that do it as well.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.780
You usually want to look
for a streaming tab.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.480
It's a good place to head for when
you're compressing your content.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.490
The important thing to
note about this step,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.370
although simple,
it should be the very last thing you do.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.640
You can't make any other
changes to that media at all.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.400
You need to make the last
change and then hint the file,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.580
and then place it on the
streaming server for consumption.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.660
All right, let me do a quick demo.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.480
We'll just take you through that.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.700
I just need to push some
content onto my machine.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.690
Excellent.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.600
So we,
I had my crack team of videographers

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.160
go out and film some content for me.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.210
We're going to bring it over to...

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.280
and I will be joined by David and David,
who will be our co-hosts.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.280
David, I'm going to bring it
over in just a moment.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:27.280
Excuse me.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.080
I'm going to bring it
over from my PowerBook.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.750
Now, this content was just
filmed with a DV camera.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.230
In this case, I used iMovie.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.540
You can use Final Cut Pro.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.920
There's some basic editing applied to

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.190
Basic editing applied
to the video content.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.400
It was compressed using Cleaner.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.740
I just picked one of the presets
that's available in that tool.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.520
We'll just bring that content over,
and we'll show you how to hit Media.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.360
Very, very simple.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.340
So for the disks you picked up
from the registration desks,

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.260
QuickTime Pro is enabled by default.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.840
Normally under
non-pre-release situations,

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.280
non-beta issue,
QuickTime Pro is $29.95 US.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.530
So that will get you the export options,
which among other things will

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.930
let you hint your content.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:33.050
So we have our sample here.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:47.180
and David I don't know who that guy is,
but-- so we've got MP4 content now.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.500
What I'm going to do is simply
just go File and Export.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.460
And I'm going to do Movie to MPEG-4.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.220
Even though it's already in MPEG-4,
I'm going to go Movie to MPEG-4.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:12.110
And what I'm going to do is,
since this content's

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.250
already been processed,
edited, and compressed for me,

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.250
someone else did all that hard work.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.370
I'm simply going to say for
the audio and video tracks,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.410
just pass them through.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.550
Don't do any changes to them.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.690
Don't try to encode them.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.940
Just pass them through.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.110
And typically,
if you're admitting a streaming server,

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.220
you typically just want to do that.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.360
You want to let them pass them through.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.350
Or if you can get your people
who are creating your content to

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.080
add the hint tracks themselves,
you don't even have to do this step.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.300
The content will be ready.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.500
But I want to do a pass-through
for audio and video.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.940
And I want to enable streaming.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.620
And those two or three options,
just leave them as is.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.450
Unless you have a very,
very high volume server,

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.020
in terms of number of people connecting,
you might want to select optimize server.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.640
But these defaults are
absolutely correct.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.420
So turn on enable streaming, click OK.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.260
I'm going to save it to my desktop.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.240
I'm going to call it Hint at
the end because it's hinted.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.640
And I'm going to click Save.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.590
Hinting is not a computational
intensive process.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.390
It's simply just looking at the media
and adding those extra simple tracks,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.210
which are just a recipe on
how to break up the media.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.740
So as you can see,
we've got a hinted movie here.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:25.710
If I bring up my properties-- how
come I can't bring up my properties?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.550
Yes, I may not be able to show you,
unfortunately,

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.400
but I'll try and just put this
in the stream folder file.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.600
Let me just do this.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.900
So we'll try and stream this file,
see if it works.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:57.800
So we'll go library, QuickTime Streaming.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.810
As you saw in the interface,
the movies are located in the library

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.480
QuickTime Streaming movies folder,
so I'm going to drop this movie in there.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.830
And I'm just going to go
to this local machine.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.360
I'm just going to play this
back from the local machine.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.440
So RTSP colon slash slash QTSS.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.260
I'm just using a little quick bit
of rendezvous here to access that,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.110
my local machine.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.450
So there's my stream, right,
playing back.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.220
Golf clap?

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.680
Hello, and welcome to the-- Maybe not.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.980
So the file plays back properly.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.130
I added the hinting.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.060
That makes it viable for the
streaming server to play back.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.200
Works as expected.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.080
No problems at all.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.580
So, hinting is a simple, simple process.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.820
Can we switch back to slides?

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.700
So let's talk briefly
about viewing locations.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.300
Typically streaming,
when you think about watching streams,

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.400
is who thinks about watching
it on a computer screen?

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.760
How many people think that that's
the default way to watch it?

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.800
Is there any other locations you
can imagine watching streams on?

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.840
Television?

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.710
Anywhere else?

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.890
3G cell phones?

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.320
Yeah.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.680
The generic term you might hear
for clients viewing content,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.140
especially with streaming,
you might hear the term terminal,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.840
just like a viewing terminal.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.020
And it's not only computers, right?

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.190
Of course, it's handsets,
as someone said, you know, 3G phones.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.810
So we have a brief demo.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.500
Stephen's going to come up,
and if our GSM network is good

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.020
enough quality in this room,
we can get a fairly decent stream.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.970
But we're going to use a 2.0 GSM network.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:58.140
using GPRS to stream a sample.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.240
Previous to this session,
I simply did an extra export

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.180
of the content you just viewed,
but I did it as a 3GP file.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.000
If you've been to previous sessions
like State of the Union QuickTime,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.180
you saw that process happen.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.000
It's literally two clicks,
and you can export the file.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.090
We have the content on a public
server that we can stream

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.940
over this cellular network.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.330
So Stephen,
do you want to give us a demo?

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.330
Do you want to switch to demo two?

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.470
So,
Stephen will demo and I'll just briefly

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.570
walk you through what's happening.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.170
We have a video camera hooked
up to the second computer here.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.030
It's just showing us the
screen of the cell phone.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:38.090
We're using a player that can perform
streaming capabilities on the cell phone.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.910
It's requesting the content from a
streaming server that's back at Apple.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.120
It's just literally sitting
on a wired network just like

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.390
we have under the desk here.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.140
The cell phone has data
capable services called GPRS.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.460
They layer on top of the voice
services that you're normally

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.540
used to by making phone calls.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.970
And the content will play back over
that GPRS data system and we can

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.490
watch the content on a cell phone.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.060
So,
you saw the clip playback on a computer,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.600
you see the clip
playback on a cell phone.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.540
Amazing.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.740
This particular clip is using
a technology just simply GPRS.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.880
That's a fairly vanilla, at this point,
vanilla.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.640
Speeds for data services.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.020
We're using AT&T network to do this demo.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.200
They have GPRS services.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.190
They've had them for quite a
while with their GSM phones.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.780
They have a next generation
series of phones called Edge.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.180
Edge is an enhanced version
of the GPRS system you're

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.900
seeing being used here.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.140
That essentially will give
you better quality video.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.100
Right, higher data rates,
better quality video will play back.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.470
This day rate is 35 kilobits per second.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.230
Actually, sorry, 30 kilobits per second.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.970
I didn't want to push it too hard
because we're inside a concrete building,

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:50.110
but we had to do some juggling this
morning to make sure it played back.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.080
So it's 30 kilobits.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.410
This is not the new codec.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.080
This is simply using a standard 3GP
file that you could export using

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.280
a standard version of QuickTime,
you know, QuickTime Pro that you get

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.980
on Mac OS X version 10.3.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:08.900
I'm using an H.263 codec and something
called AMR Narrowband for the audio.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.970
Pretty vanilla.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.010
It's kind of the default presets.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.020
No real magic.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.370
I just needed to pick a speed
for the content that was slow

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.760
enough to support the GPRS system.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.400
So, why does this matter?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.220
I think it was important to
show this in the intro session,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.180
because I want you to think about content
just beyond playback on your computer,

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:28.530
right?

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.450
We've got wireless,
we've got wired clients,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.400
but using the data services
provided by cellular carriers,

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.800
we can actually play this content back.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.800
Now, you couldn't hear the
audio quite well enough,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.780
but what that was is a simple
demo that I just cooked up a few

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:46.390
days ago with content that would
be something that a sales force

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.230
for a company would find timely.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.300
So, if you had a sales force
of 50 or 100 or 200 people,

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.840
or remote schools,
or people in the service industry that

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.550
are doing remote service and repair,
they can literally get up-to-date

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.870
information off their cell phone
without having to be near a hotspot,

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.480
without having to go plug in anywhere.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600
They can get updates.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.040
Some of the information in that video is,
you know,

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.580
please note that there's new firmware
for the hardware we just shipped.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.830
Note that there's an
announcement at 2 o'clock.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.200
Please check that information
on the corporate website.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.290
Timely information that they
need to pick up every day.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:22.200
So, it's a good thing.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.510
I produced this video in
about 20 or 30 minutes,

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.200
and it's literally something an
organization could pump out on a daily

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.200
or weekly timeframe and distribute
that to a very wide range of people,

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.280
geographically widespread.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.190
All you need is a cell
phone with a signal,

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.290
essentially.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:45.290
So, can we switch back to slides?

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.870
So we talked about the three
ways to play back content.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.590
You've already seen the video on demand.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.500
When I hinted the file
just a few minutes ago,

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.720
we went and played it
back on the computer.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.080
That's a video on demand stream.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.200
That's the most common
way to stream content.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.230
People go to a web page,
they click on it, they ask for it,

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.200
they demand the video,
and it plays back for them.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.550
It plays start to finish, and it's done.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.550
That's it.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.130
Playlists,
which is the second type of presentation,

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.230
is more like radio stations where you
simply jump into the stream and just

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:27.210
like turning on your radio on your car,
you turn on the stream and wherever

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.940
that content is in its set playlist,
it will just start playing.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:36.600
So that's vastly different than
the video on demand experience.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.640
You have two types of playlists,
I should note.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.060
There's movie,
QuickTime/MPEG-4 playlists, and MP3.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.050
I won't talk about the MP3 because
that's using a format called Icecast.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.210
You may have heard of it,
but I'll leave you to explore

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.740
that after the session's done.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:56.660
What we really want to work with is
the playlists for QuickTime/MPEG-4.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:03.800
The playlist is configured via
QTSS Publish or Web-based Administrator.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.680
I think what I might do is
I might leave that demo for

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.960
John or at the end of the session.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.600
I'm going to skip over this
demo just because of time.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.070
We're starting to get
a little time crunched.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.540
The playlist, basically,
you set the order of media.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.960
You can say I want these 10
items to play in this order,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.200
or you can set it random and
say I want these 10 audio

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.460
files just to play randomly.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.780
You can set it to loop
or play start to finish,

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.340
and literally that content will
just go off on the stream server and

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.970
just play it in the order you deem.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.600
If people jump into the stream,
they'll just jump in,

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.990
wherever the content has
played to at that point.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:47.120
So QTSS Publisher,
this is a tool that ships

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.720
with Mac OS X Server.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.450
It was brand new as a
Mac OS X Server version 10.3.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:57.740
It is included with Tiger Server,
of course, but this version sports

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.500
a highly revamped UI.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.740
Much improved, very, very nice, very,
very elegant.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.050
It gives you remote
media file management,

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.100
so instead of doing the process
that you just saw me do on the

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.700
server where I opened a media file,
I hinted it,

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.960
and I copied it to the machine, and, oh,
if I'm not on the server,

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.040
if I want to add my machine,
I have to find a way to, like, FTP or,

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.020
you know, set up an AFP server on that,
QuickTime Streaming Server,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.940
and copy the file over.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.670
QuickTime,
the publisher tool circumvents that.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.020
You can launch that on the admin machine,
take your files, drop them on the server,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.130
and it's much more seamless
integration with the server.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.600
There's automatic hinting
and web page preparation.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.760
You can stream playlists and
control playlist management,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.310
as I mentioned.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:44.020
You can edit the annotations,
which is some of the copyright and

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:50.790
details that come along with a movie,
like the title, the copyright,

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:50.790
who authored it, things like that.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:50.790
And of course,
it includes some Unix tools.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.650
So I'd like to introduce John Anderson,
who is an engineer for

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.380
the Mac OS X server team,
who worked on Publisher,

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.040
and I'd like to have him do
just a quick demo of Publisher.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.030
So here's John.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.400
Hopefully this is on.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.920
So I'm here to demo
QuickTime Streaming Server Publisher,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.400
as Victor said.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.010
And a little bit more into what's going
to be in the version 2 of Publisher.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:21.620
One of the major things that we're
adding as well is AppleScript support.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.390
So you're going to be able to
control this via AppleScript if

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.010
you already have workflows,
and theoretically from Automator as well.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.820
So that'll be great.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.960
So what I've done is launched Publisher,
and of course,

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:36.040
since I've already logged in,
all of my information is filled

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.260
in for me from my keychain.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.110
So I'm just going to go
ahead and click connect.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.070
Now, of course,
I'm connecting to a local machine here,

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.820
but I can connect from any machine
that's accessible from the network.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.760
And what I'm going to do is I'm going
to take Victor's piece of content here.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.830
Now, this is not hinted at this point.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.460
So I'm just going to drag
it up to the library.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.920
And that will upload the movie,
put it in the proper streaming folder.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.120
And it will hint the movie as well,
automatically.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.240
Now if you look at here,
I have some settings that are new to

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.760
QuickTime Streaming Server Publisher 2.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.460
And this is something
that allows you to choose.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.950
If you're binding the streaming
server to multiple IP addresses

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.920
in the server admin tool,
then you can actually choose

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.960
which IP address that you
want this to serve from.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.720
Same thing for web servers.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.320
So if you have multiple
virtual host sites,

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.040
you can choose which site you
want your web pages to go on to.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.030
So what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to click on this movie,

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.840
and I'm going to say I want
to publish this movie to the

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.900
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.510
And I'll hit Apply.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.970
So this movie is now
available for streaming.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.580
And it will automatically
grab the poster image,

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.200
which the first frame is black,
so that's what it's stuck to.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.180
But I could also choose a
custom image if I wanted to.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.000
Making playlists is also
very easy with a publisher.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.030
All you have to do is click the
little plus sign down here and...

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.310
Take your files and drag
them right to the playlist.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.200
So this interface is
very similar to iTunes.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.710
Then you can choose whether you
want this to be looped or not,

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.100
whether you want it
to be weighted random.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:26.230
And weighted random means that
if you have more than one file,

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.750
you can give files different weight,
and it will play them more often or

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.750
less often according to that weight.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.000
The other thing that we can
do here is if I go back to the

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.520
library and click on the file,
you can see I can edit the

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.200
annotations right from here.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.730
And the kind of neat thing is that,
as Victor said,

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.960
you need to do the hinting last
after you make any changes.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.080
So if you change these
annotations from here,

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:51.730
it will actually re-hint
the movie when it's done.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:52.950
So it saves you the trouble
of downloading the movie,

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.950
making the changes,
and uploading them again.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.340
If you scroll down here,
you can see some settings for how you

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.400
want to embed the movie in the page.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.890
And, for example,
you can have the user click on the movie

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.590
and have it open in the QuickTime player.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.100
You can have it embedded
in the page itself.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:15.390
And, depending on those settings,
it will actually give you HTML that

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:20.890
you can copy and paste or drag and
drop into BBEdit or Dreamweaver or

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:20.890
whatever your favorite HTML editor is.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.000
And the other thing that we can
do is we can make web pages.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.550
So--

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:35.600
You can create a page just like I create
a playlist and drag files to it.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.410
We will actually use an XSLT web
template on the server to take that

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:46.300
HTML that we saw in the field earlier
and insert it into a page so that

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.850
you can automatically create web
pages of content without having to

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.000
ever enter an HTML editor at all.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
So that's Publisher.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.100
Excellent.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.460
Publishers, amazing tool.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.490
Definitely is extremely helpful.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.100
Thank you, John.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.090
So on to the third type of method for
presentation on the streaming server.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.260
And like I said at the
start of this session,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.370
it's really what often drives
people to inquire about streaming

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.260
server in the first place.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.580
Live streams.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.720
The only way to get an event or a
happening or a press conference or

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.580
an earnings announcement delivered
to your intended viewers as it

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.880
happens is using live streaming.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.600
You can't do this using the
mechanism I mentioned previously,

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.600
which is progressive download,
watching those movie trailers.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.650
That's pre-stored content
that's been already authored

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.440
and mastered and placed there.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.730
It's content that happened
and was filmed in the past.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.360
This is absolutely live.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.930
There is a few seconds delay, of course,
to film the footage, transcode it,

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.400
and bring it to the server.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.640
But it's effective when
probably live for your users.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.300
It requires the use of
live encoding software.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.160
For us, that means QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.540
There's other choices out there.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.080
I would encourage you to check out
apple.com forward slash QuickTime.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.980
Go and check out the tools area.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.510
There is a streaming and live encoding
area where you can check out some

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.600
excellent third-party tools that will
let you do things like multiple cameras,

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.760
add text, you know, wipes, effects.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:26.500
Broadcaster is a free, from Apple,
just baseline, good live encoder.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.080
Get you going, one camera,
get you started.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.220
started with low cost.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.920
You can connect any
AV equipment you want.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.160
Of course,
your computer has to support those

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:37.840
connectors using cards or whatnot.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:42.370
The most common way we tend to see,
even with more professional setups,

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.360
is what I've got here on stage,
which is a DV camera with

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.760
a FireWire jack on it.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.820
And that's connected to a FireWire
port on the live encoder machine,

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.100
and that's how the source gets done.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:58.290
I've seen large-scale streams
where they have five $10,000

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.390
video camera with FireWire on it,
and they've still got the

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:02.710
same type of setup as I have.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.280
They've just got better lenses
and optics and equipment and a

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.870
much better camera operator too.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.600
So, the same kind of system exists.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.610
On large scale events,
you want to typically

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.640
dedicate an individual machine
to do the live encoding.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:19.350
So you're going to have a live encoder
box that's shuttling data to a server,

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.460
then that's shuttling
data to your clients.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.380
It's a little bit different than the
original diagram for the live stream.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.820
So, MPEG-4 audio and video
streaming require G4 or greater.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.280
Because of the computational
expense of those codecs,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.260
in order to do that type of
encoding on the fly in real time,

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:38.940
you need a bit of horsepower.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.110
So, pick up a Power Mac G5 if you want
to do any kind of MPEG-4 based,

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.920
AAC based streams.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.200
The last thing I should
note is Apple uses this

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.550
stuff for our live events.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:56.420
We do it on a larger scale, of course,
because we have 50,000 or 100,000

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:59.370
people show up for some macro keynotes,
but we use this stuff.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.940
If you're not already aware,
we do quarterly

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.490
announcements for financials,
and that system uses many of the

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:10.020
tools that I'm showing you today,
certainly QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.010
So the setup is quite simple.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.150
We've got a video camera.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.070
In this case, I'm going to say that we're
going to do a large-scale event

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.760
because I have a separate machine,
as you can see that PowerBook up top,

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.370
which is my live encoder box.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.440
It's a dedicated G4 or greater box.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.170
It's taking the video in,
it's encoding it, it's hinting it,

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.770
and it's sending it to, in this case,
the G5 XServe.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.890
So that live encoder is
going to be quite busy,

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.340
very, very busy.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.280
And the XServe G5, of course,
is going to be sending the

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.780
content out to the client.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.240
So keep that in mind.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.340
Let's do a demo and I'll kind of
talk through some of the different

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.890
areas to do with a live setup.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:55.370
I'll use my nicely set up camera here.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.680
I'm just going to turn my camera on.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:08.190
My front row guys will be
my unvolunteered talent.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.820
So in the Applications folder,
we have QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.320
Again, it's included with the
streaming server-- excuse me,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.080
it's included with Mac OS X Server.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.500
We launch it.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.740
Very simple tool.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:19.620
One window.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.880
You've got your preview.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.120
Plug in my camera and
we'll have a preview.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.880
There are a couple controls down below.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.480
You have to relaunch it.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.700
Oh, there we go.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.730
So we just have a preview up top,
a broadcast button, recorded disk,

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.700
some settings, and that's it.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.340
So if you wanted to just plug and go,
you could easily just use this interface.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:49.060
Of course, showing details will expand
to give you more options.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.060
You can see there's an audio, video,
and network tab.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.000
In order to perform a broadcast,
there is a little bit of

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.740
pre-work we need to do.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.030
Before the session started,
I actually went into Server Admin,

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.520
which I showed you at the start,
and I went into an area where

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.550
you can configure passwords.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:06.670
And because I want to control
access to who can broadcast

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.500
content to my streaming server,
I don't want any Joe Schmo in my

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.580
company to be able to do that,
I set a password that

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.660
will control the inputs.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.620
I just don't want any live
encoder to be able to send content

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.860
through my streaming server.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.050
So I had a control point.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.420
So I'll mention that in just a moment.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.620
The defaults here,
you have some presets available.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.420
They are based on the connection speed
that your users are going to be on.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.220
So if you're on modems,
I'd select modem presets.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.430
We'll use a LAN setting since
we're in a wired LAN here.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.320
You can select the source
where the audio is coming from.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.960
I think I'm going to pick the
DV audio first two channels,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.070
I believe.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.200
You can set the gain for
the appropriate options.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.020
There's some codec options
here that are available.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.700
These are very much the same
as what you'd when you're

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.280
exporting a QuickTime movie.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.920
There is packetizing information,
but generally you don't have

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.610
to make any changes to that,
especially if you're just

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.800
getting started with streaming.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.220
These defaults are perfectly suitable.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:05.220
You also note that you can enable
and disable the video and or audio.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:09.270
So you can have an audio-only stream,
or a video-only stream, or both.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.620
Of course, if you're doing an earnings
announcement for your company,

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.910
it's likely going to be audio-only,
so just disable the video tab and all

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.880
you're going to broadcast is audio.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.400
So switching to video tab,
I'm going to select LAN low motion.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.440
That's kind of suitable
for this situation.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.590
It's one of the presets.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.930
It notes the source.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.700
So I have a FireWire camera.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.960
It's the Sony DCR PC100.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.910
Just a pretty simple camera.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.870
It pulls that information
from the FireWire frameworks.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.230
We can set the size of the video.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.360
320x240 is a good starting point,
especially because I'm going to

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.920
be streaming on my wired LAN here.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.500
If you're streaming to a modem,
you'd want to set that size down

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:51.840
to something like... 176x144,
something in that range.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.390
We can pick the codec.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.190
MPEG-4 is a good choice.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.500
You can set the quality you want.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.390
I like medium.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.900
Set the frames per second.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.180
I'll leave that as default since we
have a fairly generous network here.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.140
And we get to the network tab.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:07.960
So if you're just
starting with streaming,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.460
you literally could just pick
one of the presets for audio,

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.230
one of the presets for video,
skip right to the network tab,

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.740
and this is really the only place you
have to do any real work to get your

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.610
stream just at least into testing mode.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:20.700
You can save presets here.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.040
There are none created because,
of course, each network is different.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:28.040
And all we want to do is
determine how we want to transmit,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.400
how we want to announce the
details of this broadcast.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.210
And I should point this out.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.610
QuickTime Broadcaster
does something very,

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:36.390
very useful.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.160
It uses the announce protocol.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.010
And what that means is when
you fire up a brand new stream,

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.220
a small text file is created.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.260
It's just a description of the stream.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.750
It's called an SDP file.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.720
It's one of those standards
that we talked about.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.670
It's an open standard
along with RTP and RTSP.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.270
That file, using the announce protocol,
will automatically be sent

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.790
to the streaming server.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.010
So in this case,
I'm using the same machine to do

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.730
the encoding and the streaming.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.270
But if it was a separate setup,
like I showed on the

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.190
diagram just a moment ago,
QuickTime Broadcaster will automatically

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.180
push that SDP file to the server.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.590
Extremely helpful.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.830
I can't tell you.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.820
Because, again,
using the slightly older format,

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:22.480
which is a manual, a manual unicast,
you end up having to try and copy files

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.520
to the streaming server using FTP or AFP.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.870
You have to use some sort of file
protocol or sneaker net to run that

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.370
SDP file over to the streaming server
and drop it in the right folder.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:35.410
Announce will automatically
push that required file there.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.360
So I'm going to use the
announce feature here.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.120
I've got the host name.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:40.920
I'm just using that.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:46.120
I'm going to call it, you know,
intro to QTSS.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.440
Actually,
I'll answer that question at the Q&A.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:54.960
How's that sound?

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.120
Just so we can get it on the mics.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.360
Now, username and password.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.550
Remember I did some pre-work.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.620
I said I went into the server admin
and I went to the passwords area

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.440
and I set the username and password.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.290
I'm going to enter that here so
that not just any Joe Schmo can use

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.670
my streaming server as a live feed.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.480
Did I just...

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.640
I just crashed out,
so we'll just restart that step.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.060
Let me just go back and get
us back to where we were.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.570
We're going to use music, video-- oh.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.410
We had our camera turn off.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.580
Sorry about that.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.120
Let me just get us back to where we were.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:30.620
My apologies.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.180
My camera turns off after a few minutes.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.110
I want music.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.000
I want music.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.450
I want-- let's find High Motion.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.900
I'm going to use custom
Unicast QTSS local.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.330
I'll call this Intro.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.240
My username is admin.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.820
My password is super secret.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:55.970
I can set a buffer delay.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.420
You can set that to any value.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.650
If you're streaming to
your corporate network,

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.120
which is all wired Ethernet,
you can set that value a little lower.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.390
There is a built-in default
of two to three seconds,

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:08.820
even though if you set this to zero,
it will still be two to three seconds.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.720
So typically, you know,
four to five seconds of

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.880
a little bit of buffer.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.160
Let your clients kind of queue
up the content on the other end.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.190
If you're broadcasting something
like a concert or a remote event,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.380
and you have your live
encoder at that remote event,

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.310
because of course the camera
has to be there as well,

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.850
you can use broadcast over TCP IP.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.330
That just means it will do a better
job of guaranteeing that the live

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:34.960
encoder will send the content in
its complete form to the server.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.100
We'll not choose that here.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.210
We have a wired LAN.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.860
QTSS.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.950
S, of course I'm the author.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.650
I'll just save that as
a preset just in case.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.050
Excuse me.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:05.390
Call it QTSS.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.820
Click OK.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.430
And if all goes well,
I should be able to just

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.610
hit the broadcast button.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.940
And you notice that in the preview
window it said starting broadcast,

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:15.840
and now it's broadcasting.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.200
And it gives you some status
underneath that preview area.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.140
It's a little bit small.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.240
I'll just hide these details.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.850
And literally, your live encoder,
all it has to have is

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.160
just that small window up.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.380
That's enough to perform
the live encoding duties.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.930
Now, I've got a Power Mac G5
dual 2 gigahertz here,

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.520
so it's got lots of horsepower.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.680
So I'm running the streaming
server on the same box.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.990
So now to watch that content,
like I said, normally your viewers would

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.760
go to a Web page that you've
created with a link to the stream.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.710
But if we switch over to computer 2,

00:44:49.200 --> 00:45:03.270
Hi, everyone.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.530
I'm Stephen Tonna, and I'm the CEO of
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.240
I named the stream Intro to QTSS.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.340
So to pick up a live stream,
it's quite simple.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.240
I'm going to use the same
address of my streaming server.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:21.400
Now, notice what's missing in that URL?

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:22.700
An extension.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.610
So you don't need to enter an extension
for a request for a live stream.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.830
It's just understood that .sdp,
that little small file that's

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.430
created by Broadcaster and
automatically pushed to the server,

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:42.130
it's understood that that is what
you're requesting when you type in

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.310
just the file name sans extension.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:44.310
So if I hit OK,

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.010
We now have a live stream
playing back from our client

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.530
off our server using this.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.730
Yes, everyone automatically starts
doing stuff in front of the camera.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.480
There's roughly a five to
eight second delay probably,

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.720
but you can see that we're
watching a live stream.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:03.910
Now, just like broadcast radio,
they have a six second delay.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.020
Like I said at the start
of the presentation,

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.540
live broadcasts,
there's a bit of a delay, right?

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.410
It depends on what's happening.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.270
There might be other traffic.

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:15.320
And I think I set the
buffer at five seconds,

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.100
so you get eight seconds of delay.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:22.630
The optimal situation is to run a
live encoder on a separate machine,

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.770
because this box is running a
couple services and streaming

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:25.820
server and live encoding.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.680
So it's doing a bit of hard work.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.280
So keep in mind,
your viewers at the other

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.830
end won't see this delay.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.150
They won't know, because they're not at,
you know,

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.990
people don't sit in the radio broadcast
booth and listen to the answer,

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.530
right?

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.980
They're out in their cars,
they're driving, they don't know there's

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.900
six seconds of delay.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.480
Effectively, it will be live to them,
right?

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.300
So that's a live stream.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.260
And literally, within five, 10 minutes,
you can set one up.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.740
Turn your streaming server on,
open up Broadcaster,

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.400
plug in any consumer camera,
certainly with FireWire on it,

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.400
and you're ready to go.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.080
OK.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.680
Can we switch back to slides?

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:12.590
So for more information,
there's an excellent PDF guide

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:13.580
that you can pick up.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.570
It's the Darwin Streaming
Server Administrator Guide.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:19.220
With QuickTime Streaming Server,
you get the QuickTime Streaming

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.140
Server Administrator Guide,
excellent PDF,

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.460
which documents several features,
how to set up the server in more detail.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.260
You can also go to apple.com
forward slash QuickTimes,

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.770
forward slash products,
forward slash QTSS.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.200
There's all the latest information
and links to downloads for Darwin,

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.580
updates for the QTSS, of course.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.930
If you're more on the development side,
because of course the source code for

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:43.100
the streaming server is available,
if you do more development,

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.440
we will gratefully accept source
code suggestions and changes.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.360
You can submit back to Apple after
you download the source code.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.810
You can check out the two developer
links there at the bottom of the

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.420
screen for more information on that.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.660
Reference Library,
I'll leave this up for a moment or two.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:06.460
The training group used to offer a
QuickTime Streaming Server course.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.200
It was the one that I wrote
that Stephen mentioned at

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.150
the start of the session.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.930
It no longer is in current circulation.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.350
If you contact the fine folks
at the technical training

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:19.890
group at training.apple.com or
training.apple.com and request it,

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.990
it would be a nice way to
see a revival of that course.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.240
It's a three-day classroom
taught course with examples and

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.120
exercises you need to work through,
and there's theory about bandwidth

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.700
calculations and saturation
and live event planning.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:38.310
You can receive a manual
that's 250 to 300 pages of

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.750
content you can take with you.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:41.850
An excellent class.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.970
but like I said,
it's currently not in circulation.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.020
So I'd encourage you to contact
the technical training folks at

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.810
train.oppa.com and ask for it.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:52.430
So I'd love to see it come back,
especially in light of the cell phone

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:54.940
streaming we demonstrated earlier.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.440
Fabulous book by Stephen Gooley called
"Quick Time for the Web," excellent book.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.250
There's a general reference on QuickTime,
including streaming.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.360
We've got a streaming media bible
and the engineering task force,

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.770
which is the standards which describe how
RTP and RTSP are supposed to function.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:13.440
I'll jump back to this in a moment.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:15.980
There's a couple of knowledge base
articles which are extremely helpful.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.330
If you forget your password
for your streaming server,

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:18.940
how to reset it.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.100
There's a description
of a log access format.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.880
The streaming server logs
over 40 parameters for every

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.000
time a stream is requested.

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:32.390
How many bits they watched,
how many bits they lost,

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:37.590
what they watched, when they watched it,
all those details and several

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:37.590
more parameters are captured.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.610
And the binding on how to
bind the QTSS server to a

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:44.080
particular Ethernet interface,
one or the other or both,

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.500
is described in the last article.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.280
So who to contact?

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.250
Guillermo Ortiz, Stephen Tonna,
who introduced me at the

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.340
start of the session.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:52.910
Of course,
we're going to do a Q&A in a few moments.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.680
You can ask questions about the
information I just presented.
