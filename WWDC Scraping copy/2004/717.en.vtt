00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.590
Hello everybody.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.700
I'm Rhonda Strahton.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.740
I'm the director of
QuickTime Product Marketing.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.030
Welcome to this nice early session.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.990
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.320
I think you probably all have started
to attend enough of our sessions

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.980
in the QuickTime content creation
track to know that usually someone

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.100
from Apple does the introduction,
so that's me.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.780
And I'll come back for the
Q&A to make sure that if

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.440
there's any sort of QuickTime,
you know, features and those kind of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.400
related questions that maybe
I can help Alex with those.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.620
But just wanted to let you know that
we invited Alex to come here and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.610
talk to you about interactivity just
because of the great content that he's

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.180
created that we've seen over the years.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.410
He's submitted content to
the design awards that is,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.930
you know, done very well.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.050
And we thought it would be great to
have him come and talk to you about

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.250
the things that he creates and how
he creates them and the things he's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.460
learned about working with QuickTime.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.980
So without any further discussion,
I would like to introduce

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.390
Alex Ogle from Tubb Atomic Studios.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.110
Thank you.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.600
Well, good morning.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.070
I want to thank you
all for having me here.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Before we do start,
I do want to say that if you

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.360
think of any questions during
my speech and while I'm talking,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.310
just feel free to remember those
and let's get some good Q&A towards

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.550
the end about interactive QuickTime.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.910
I just don't want you to be hit at
the end and there's the Q&A and you

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.020
haven't thought about any questions.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550
Definitely keep that in mind while
I'm going through everything.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.630
My name is Alex Ogle.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.570
It's basically interactive
design and I'm a partner in

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.320
a business called Tub Atomic.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.710
Our company focuses on providing
solutions to clients and very diverse

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.970
basic clients like anybody from
say a manufacturer of automobile

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.860
tires to an independent music label.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.460
While doing that, we've always used
QuickTime in production.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.710
In 2001, we actually started using
QuickTime for interactivity,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.800
which back then was pretty
new and interesting.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.870
We were playing around doing skin
designs and things like that that

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.130
were kind of pushing the envelope
and having a lot of fun with that.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.260
I'd just like to definitely thank
everybody for having me here

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.640
and glad to see the turnout.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.270
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.200
The first thing I'd like to
do is just kind of go overview

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.440
what I want to talk about,
and that is what is interactive

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.100
QuickTime and kind of why you should
consider using interactive QuickTime,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.210
what tools are available for creating
interactivity inside of QuickTime,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:29.030
and relevant ways to use interactive
QuickTime on the web and other places,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.100
and then techniques for
designing interactive QuickTime.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.220
and the next step is
to do the same thing.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.660
Let's go ahead and get
started on the first question,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630
which is, what is interactive QuickTime?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.900
And that's a very simple answer.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.140
It's not only the QuickTime file, which,
you know, is, you know,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.890
Well known.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.280
If you look at VR tracks and everything,
those are natively interactive.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.120
I'm not really going to
talk about that so much.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.070
I'm going to really focus on where you
can use interactivity and how you use

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.800
it is displayed within QuickTime Player.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.000
inside the browser using plugins and
then other compatible applications

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
like Director and other things
like that that use QuickTime.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.980
But, each one of these has their own
kind of possibilities for use.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.450
In QuickTime Player you have like
skins and you can really brand

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.290
things and it's interesting.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.090
And you can jump right out of
the browser window with it.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.820
The actual browser plugin you
can actually have like inside the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.700
windows you can use wired sprites
and wired movies that can talk to

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.510
each other and you can reuse like

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.320
Interactive controllers that can be
branded and then they can use all

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.660
your media right away and you can just
kind of make them talk to each other.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.770
So that's kind of an advantage
to using the plug-in over

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.140
necessarily going to a player.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.220
Let's go to the next one,
which is why use

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.500
QuickTime for interactivity?

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.400
Well, it's cross-platforming and goes
from Mac to PC very easily.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.000
QuickTime is really good about
keeping up on having published the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.470
same version for both platforms.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.410
So you don't have to worry
about if you make it for Mac,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.500
you know, the PC version is not out yet,
don't worry about that.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.570
It usually comes out
very seamlessly together.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.170
It's also important to remember that,
let's say you're doing viral content,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.830
like you have a movie that you
want to share with your friends,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.500
and then you want it to spread
out and network and keep going.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.550
Well,
you don't want it to go to a Mac user

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.430
and then to go to a PC user and have
it just kind of stop and not move on

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.930
because that person didn't get to see it.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.840
And with this,
you get one file that can do both.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.530
Let's say you do a Flash document
or something like that,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:10.370
and you export and publish it into
an EXE file and a Mac projector file.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.170
And so you send that out.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.800
Well, which one are you going to send?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.880
You know,
it can only go out to a specific

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.440
group and that kind of thing.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.450
So what this does is give you
the advantage to keep bouncing

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.540
and going further and further
with your viral content.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.240
And the whole viral thing
started like a couple years back.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.620
And it's-- It's kind of a key phrase,
the thing that everybody's

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.170
been throwing around,
but it still is very interesting

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.000
and does create a lot of awareness
of your movies and your products

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.990
and interesting things like that.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.000
And then Flash 5 support.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.000
Flash 5 really broke ground
when we were using Flash 4.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.090
I remember when it came out.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.480
It came out around 2001.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.230
We were very excited about that.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.800
We were like, "Wow, we can use all this.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.770
We can use a lot of variables and we
can do all these different things."

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.380
It was a big advancement over 4.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.800
It had some different compression
things and audio and stuff like that.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.760
It's very powerful.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.800
Some of the greatest
sites are made in that.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.800
You can see some very interactive
things like database-driven Flash sites.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800
It's extremely powerful.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.600
It is an older version of Flash,
but because it is older,

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.800
you have more resources.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.790
It's almost an advantage.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.820
A lot of times when we
publish Flash content,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.350
we actually try to play back to
plug-ins that people will typically

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.240
have because maybe they haven't quite
updated to the newest Flash plug-in,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.790
things like that.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.800
We actually publish older
versions and things like that.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.800
Being able to have Flash 5 content
is like when Flash 5 came out.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.080
If we would have had somebody say, "Well,
you can just do a custom skin

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.760
around your Flash 5 content,"
we would have freaked out.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:00.680
We would have been like,
"That's the greatest thing ever."

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.220
We have that ability now with
QuickTime and it's kind of

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.800
an exciting thing to do that.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.300
Using Flash 5 really isn't
a hindrance necessarily.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.290
You should definitely
take advantage of that.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.290
There are so many people that know
Flash and Action Scripting and all this.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:27.480
It's a great ability to simply
jump in to creating QuickTime and

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.300
interactivity inside of QuickTime.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.310
You can use resources, information,
tutorials and things you find

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:39.300
all over the place to get into
creating your activity very easily.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.630
A lot of people have Flash because
we're talking about people that develop

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.300
content for clients and things like that.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.300
Flash is a very common thing.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.780
It's almost like Photoshop.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.440
You have Photoshop and
Flash definitely in your studio

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.300
and you're using those every day.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.300
Of course you have
QuickTime on your machine.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.300
The marriage of everything
together is just so seamless.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.110
together is just so seamless.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.770
Then we have the same file
can be used on a CD and a web.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.940
Now,
we've all gotten DVDs and CDs and things

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:14.500
where somebody's tried to take their
website and put it onto a DVD as extras,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.660
or onto a CD because
it's a band or something,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.580
and they've just taken their content.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.650
Well,
if that content's like database-driven,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.340
it's very difficult to move that over.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.950
And using QuickTime,
what you can do is if you make

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.210
the whole website or something,
inside of QuickTime,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.160
it's very easy to move that file
and launch it directly from a CD or

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.520
a DVD and have that content be
used the same on both platforms,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.100
the web or CD or whatever.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.730
What that does is means you create
one thing and then it can be reused,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.530
which is great and clients love
that because we don't have to keep

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.930
building and charting more and more.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.660
Seamless leap from a browser is
just kind of an obvious thing.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.790
I mean, all players do that, right?

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.740
You click on a media file,
it launches into a player,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.030
you see it and that's it,
and you close the media

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.340
file and you go back.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.380
Well, a seamless leap is like,

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.340
is amazing in this case,
because you're talking

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.620
about interactivity.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.600
So you could literally take and build an
entire website inside of this and have a

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.450
launch page in HTML that basically just
has an embedded QuickTime file in it.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.820
That QuickTime file calls the other file
and launches it right in to the player,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.040
and then you have a whole
site built right there.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.900
And so that's a completely
interesting concept,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.500
and with being able to move the
files around everything to a CD,

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.690
it really opens up some
doorways that you can't really

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.060
get with other media players.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.600
And of course,
then you have attached media skins,

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.630
which is way different
than other players also,

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.900
in that we've seen MP3 players
and different things like that

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.840
where you can skin the program
and have different interfaces,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.400
but it's always the same interface.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.070
I mean, you're basically a play button,
a stop, a fast forward,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.400
that kind of thing.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.360
And so what this does is it
allows you to mix in your own

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.930
interactivity into an attached skin,
so that you basically have greater

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.490
ability to make people understand
where you're coming from and

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.390
remember your brand and your
logo and that kind of thing.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.120
And that brings us to branding,
which is like the key terminology

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.940
when you're talking about QuickTime,
in that you can really brand your

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:43.400
content and make people remember
and stand out from other people,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:43.400
and that it's...

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.650
In design,
when you're talking to clients,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.500
they always want, "Well,
we want our logo the same.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.730
We have this big,
thick book of standards where if

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:58.280
you don't use the logo the same
exact way over and over and over,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.770
they won't use it or something.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.560
They'll keep making you force this
manual." When you brand across all these

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.690
different things like business cards
and brochures and websites and CDs,

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.080
having this one seamless thing that
you can use and then having skins that

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.600
you can cut and continue that branding
across that place and not be locked

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.870
into a square is quite a powerful thing.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.130
Let's talk about some of the tools.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:30.180
Of course, you have Live Stage Pro,
which is like the Photoshop of

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.390
interactivity inside QuickTime.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.270
It's the standard.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.400
Everybody that does any kind of
professional interactivity uses that.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.670
There's a good reason,
because it is probably the most powerful

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.740
tool for creating interactivity and
writing scripts and things like that,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.590
which we'll get into.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.260
Also,
we should cover a few others just to

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.030
make sure we're being equal to everybody.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.840
Of course, Live Stage Pro is also
done by Totally Hip,

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.800
which does Live Stage Pro and
Live Slideshow.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.100
Anyway,
that's kind of a lower-end program,

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.020
and not so professionally used,
but it still adds quite a

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.920
few abilities and things,
so I wanted to show it up there.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.400
Then you have QTI and MoviePlanet.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.690
MovieWorks, Deluxe,
which are strong programs

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.670
that can create great content.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.020
Then you have Flash,
which can export out MOV files.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.180
Like I said earlier,
it's a tremendous resource,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.570
because so many people
already know Flash.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.920
Then you have shareware
applications like Tattoo,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:49.180
which I think costs
like $23 or something.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.160
You can go to the studio and
everybody's using it already.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.740
You can simply go and buy a small
application like Tattoo and get your feet

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.800
wet and start playing around with that.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:04.440
I'll go through a short example of
how to play with those simple things

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.280
and get a project going where we
show how easy it is just to create

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.800
something from what knowledge you
probably already have by using Flash.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.800
Then there's Go Live.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.840
It kind of shocked me when
I first saw it actually.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.730
I don't actually use
Go Live in my studio,

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.300
but I use BBEdit for most of my
HTML writing and things like that.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.130
It's interesting that they put
so much QuickTime Interactivity

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.140
inside of Go Live,
but I wouldn't really recommend to

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.300
go out and buy Go Live if you're
just going to do interactivity.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.580
It's something if you
already have and you're doing

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.500
WYSIWYG editing inside of it,
then you can jump right in

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.520
and start embedding files.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.800
It's a really great tool for that.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.400
Then there's a component
download program called Axle.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.910
You know,
I haven't mentioned any other component,

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.950
really, applications,
but this program is amazing.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.730
I mean, when I first saw this thing,
I was like, it was like when I saw

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.900
Flash for the first time.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.900
It was like, wow,
I can't believe that's inside QuickTime.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.740
And it really adds so many features,
and there's some other 3D application

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.240
software out there like Axle,
but I think Axle's kind of

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.150
leading the way right now.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.150
And

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:26.000
The possibilities for what we can really
do with it are just kind of open-ended.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.910
I mean, I can't wait to see the content
that really comes out from what we,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:36.700
in the future, from what we see with what
the capabilities are for Axon.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.680
So let's talk about a
little bit of QScript,

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.700
which is kind of the standard
language for writing in LiveStage Pro,

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.460
which I'm sure if anybody here has ever
created anything inside of QuickTime or

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.070
interactivity sort of things,
that they probably have written some

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.540
QScript because it is kind of the
standard and everybody kind of likes it.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.880
So it's important to
remember where QScript lives,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.360
and that's kind of what
I'm trying to show here,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.360
is that

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.600
It's too small.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.140
Anyway, you can see the highlighted
key press there.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.260
And so if we type into, like,
the dialog box over here on the right,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.500
you can type in your cue script there,
and it gets applied to the key press,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.840
which means that if that action happens,
then it runs a script.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.660
So you can see kind of like some of
the idle and all that kind of things,

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:33.660
those track events that you can have
happen that can execute your cue script.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.300
So that's kind of where it lives.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.990
It lives on different tracks
and happens when events happen.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.100
So anybody that doesn't know
anything about cue script,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.290
that's kind of a basic
outline of how it's used.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:17:02.320
I want to show this because it shows
some of the track layouts from what

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.300
you work with inside of QuickTime.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:12.290
You have a flash track, a sprite track,
a movie track, and then a skin track.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.300
All these different tracks
have attributes and abilities.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.280
What you do is you layer
them on top of each other.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.460
They communicate,
but can pass variables and do

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.300
all these different scripts.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.300
You can attach scripts to most of them.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:31.300
Probably the sprite track is the most
capable as far as attaching scripts.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:36.030
Flash is great because you can pull
in variables and sprite tracks can

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.580
look at them and so on and so forth.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.750
But we also, you can kind of nose around
on other people's files,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.120
which is kind of fun to do.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.540
If you open up somebody's QuickTime file
and it's a skin player or anything,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.060
you can kind of go down to,
if you have QuickTime Pro,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.550
you can go down to edit and go to
enable tracks and look at that and

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.250
you kind of get a little dialog
box that tells you the track names.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.350
So you can kind of look through and
see if they changed the names or if,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.300
you know, how many movie files are
actually there track-wise.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.300
It kind of gives you like
a little insight into how

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.300
other people make their files.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.170
So it's kind of fun to nose around.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.700
So then we get to TrackTypes.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.060
These are some of the track types.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.300
I don't know if I got every
single one of them there,

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.260
but in live stages,
these are typical ones you'd make:

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:36.550
sprite track, picture track, text, flash,
movie, VR, sound, color, skin,

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.380
and then effects tracks.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.170
And then you have the components,
which actually add

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.210
capability to the QuickTime.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.040
And these are the interactive ones.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.780
Well,
what I would call the interactive ones.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.610
Obviously there's codecs and things
that are part of the component

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.160
downloads too which add capabilities.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.140
But these add basically
functionality and logic.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.720
iPix is kind of like VR.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.230
I don't think I've ever seen anything
done in iPix inside of QuickTime,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.510
but it's there.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.830
And then Zoomify is kind of an
interesting product where you

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.040
can zoom in and use big images
and it kind of redraws them.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:22.090
So it's a very interesting product
which I haven't gotten used

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.940
to yet in anything commercial,
but I'm kind of looking forward to

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.840
trying to figure out ways to use it.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.330
Pulse,
which was kind of big several years ago,

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.230
but I don't think they're really
doing anything in QuickTime right now.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.080
I'm not sure what's going on in there.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.940
And then Axle,
which is a 3D kind of rendering engine.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.290
And Pulse and FBX are kind
of the same kind of deal.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.000
I mean they're 3D rendering
inside of QuickTime in real time.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.580
So Axle I think has probably,
in my opinion, the best interface,

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.940
the best ability for
programming and really,

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.640
I don't know,
it just seemed very intuitive.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.960
I just really liked it.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.300
Okay, now we get to relevant ways.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.540
The relevant ways are,
and this is only four,

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.890
but I think it's the big four.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.870
Full websites,
which I think we're going to see

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:19.890
more of because it's so nice to be
able to have that ability to brand.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.420
Branded media players,
which are kind of the

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.000
obvious thing to do,
to add functionality, which are great,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.400
but I think our scope is
kind of limited there.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.900
I think we could go beyond
that into regular websites.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:40.760
I would love to just see somebody
doing a lawyer's office site or

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.930
something like that inside of QuickTime,
because I think that would be

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.860
really a breaking of a standard,
or maybe an ice cream shop that

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.680
doesn't have any kind of media files.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.060
But it's just interesting because you
can brand it with the skin and show text.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.360
And so I think what that does
is that opens up kind of a--

00:20:58.600 --> 00:22:50.200
[Transcript missing]

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.650
Then you have options.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.300
I say options,
but I really mean ideas and

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.200
thinking that you can really do
inside your interactive QuickTime.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.400
You can have database-driven information.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.080
One of the great things there
is that people often used to,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.300
when we did Flash content and
very expanded websites there,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.010
they were always like, "Ah,
we'll never be able to update it

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:31.390
though." We started doing interactive
Flash with database-driven content,

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.390
which

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.390
We were doing that in Flash 5 too,
so we have that capability

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.040
in QuickTime very easily.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.420
You're not necessarily
limited to pulling in XML,

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.790
which I'll show a little later.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.770
I'm going to show some
examples using load variables,

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.670
which is a really standard way
to pull in some text from text

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.790
documents or a database or something.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.720
There's photo galleries,
which we're seeing already.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:24:00.910
Photo galleries technically could
be a slideshow or maybe pulling in a

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:08.640
bunch of images and showing those and
being able to create it dynamically.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.830
I think we'll probably see more of those.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.310
I'd like to see an artist do
a website with their work and

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.420
just make it real dynamic where
they could upload some files and

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.670
QuickTime could automatically spot them.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.790
We see that a lot.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.790
We see that kind of
with the movie industry.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.120
We see photos of the sets
and things like that,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.800
which is great, but I still think it
could be used a lot more.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:34.250
Contact form, which in Flash,
one of the greatest things about

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.110
Flash is you can embed fonts and
do color and things like that

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.800
really easily inside of that.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.670
You could see contact forms.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.680
Our standard on websites,
so you're not like have to put an

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.640
email link that's going to do a
mail to or something like that.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.680
You could easily do a contact
form which hits a database or hits

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.510
a server side script and fires
off an email through the server,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.240
that kind of thing.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.360
Email friend works the same way.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:05.360
You could email the player or email

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:12.460
A link using a server,
which was kind of an interesting idea.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.080
Multiload progressive movies.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.220
Now this is something I did
and I thought it was kind of

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.750
an advancement when I did it,
but it still could go a long ways.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:27.580
But what you can do is like
say a user is viewing content,

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.660
right?

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:28.660
And they--

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:34.920
They want to click on a movie trailer
or a video for a band or something,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.990
and they click on it
and it starts to load.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.230
Well, if you're inside the
player inside of QuickTime,

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:48.000
or even if it's an embedded movie,
you could still do this, you could

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.330
You can have them be able to click
out and still view content which

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.180
could be dynamically driven like tour
dates for a band and stuff like that.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.800
What you have there is the potential to,
instead of going to a page where

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.090
you see a little progress bar start
and if they hit back to go view

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:07.780
something while it's downloading,

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.060
It can just load in the background.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.290
What you can do is with multiple movies,
you can say,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.970
"I want to see these four videos,"
and you click on them all,

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.740
and they all start downloading,
and they all have percents,

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.370
and they're analyzing how much is going.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.550
You can sit there and go through
a shopping cart or something,

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.300
which is the next thing,
which you can buy merchandise while

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.400
you're sitting there watching or
waiting for the downloads to happen.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:36.750
Those possibilities are there inside
of Interactivity inside of QuickTime.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.540
And for the shopping cart,
at first I think people were kind

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:47.180
of resistant to this kind of theory,
but I've always kind of thought,

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:47.180
you know,

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.760
It's kind of an interesting concept,
but if you move,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.220
if you collect information, like in,
and we're only talking

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.300
about Shopping Cart here,
so we're collecting like,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.300
let's say a guy wants to order like
four ball caps and two t-shirts,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.990
you know,
so he types it in and it basically

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.050
keeps that number inside of
QuickTime until he hits checkout.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.530
And then when he hits checkout,
we go to a secure form on a web page,

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.770
you know, so that it's,
so we're not really

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.600
breaking any ground there.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.230
I mean, we're just collecting
data inside of QuickTime.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.290
Then we're passing it on.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.710
And, I mean,
if anybody catches the data between

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:26.060
QuickTime and the secure page,
it doesn't really matter because it's

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.700
just like somebody's blank order.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.320
I mean, he's not logging in
or anything like that.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.450
So that's an option that's,
that I can see really catching

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.300
on with people that are doing
movies and things like that.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.480
And then we have chat, which is,
I've seen that before, where people,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.450
and you can do that in
Flash pretty easily,

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.300
and you can use that same
concept from Flash 5.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.850
inside of QuickTime.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:55.060
Then we have the 3D gaming
or interface design.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:03.530
Being able to use Axle or one of
the other 3D components is... doing

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:08.780
3D gaming and doing 3D interfaces
could really be the next leap

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.610
for what we see in QuickTime.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:17.620
I'm really inspired and can't wait
to see what happens with that.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.610
Then we have admin applications, which

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.550
When you think of updating a website,
typically what you'll have is a

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:32.190
front end and you'll go into it
and it'll have all the information,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.520
and then if you're the admin,
you can log in and you can

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.350
alter that information.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.310
Well, usually the back end is different
looking from the front end.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.410
I've kind of always thought
that's kind of weird because

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.500
I want to see my text wrapping.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.940
I want to see the accurate font usage.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.380
I want to see everything that's exact
to the front end with the back end.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.740
And you kind of get
that with Contribute 2.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.450
You can go in,
a client can log in and then

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.200
basically edit the information
right there and he sees the fonts,

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.140
everything is accurate.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.320
But with QuickTime,
you can do the same thing.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.220
You can create the same file
with the capabilities of,

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.730
like, if you wanted to update text,
you could have a flash

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.010
track with editable text.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.860
You could have text regions and
that kind of thing where they could

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:19.900
click on it and alter the text.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.540
And they'll see the font right
there because it's embedded.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.560
And then you could add just a
small button down there inside

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.680
the QuickTime file that says
update to the database and it

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.990
can shoot that information off
and change the actual page.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.770
And all you'd have to do is put
that file behind a secure area

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:40.100
on a server or something like
that to make it security issues.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:52.380
So now we are to the examples,
which is the fun stuff.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.880
I'm going to start with
the beginning project,

00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.430
which is basically using
three applications,

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.780
besides paper and a pencil.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.950
You use Photoshop as the comp,
then we're going to do a little

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.690
We're going to do Flash track.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.780
We're going to build it in there.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.740
And we're going to pretty much
do all our interactivity there,

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.390
but slightly a little bit more in Tattoo,
which is the cheap application.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.070
So basically this is kind of a
something you can just go back.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.200
I mean, if you're working in a studio or
you have Flash or in Photoshop,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.010
you can just do this.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.600
I mean,
it's really easy to make a website.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.200
So let's start the project.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.780
And here's my little sketch.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.490
And that perspective
is just from the photo.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.400
It's not from what I'm
going for with the look.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.310
And so basically what we're going
to do there is up in the top right,

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.600
we're going to do an exit button,
which is pretty typical.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.000
And this is just going to be
like a generic website look.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.690
And then we're going to do a logo,
and then we're going to do like

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.470
a horizontal menu there with
home and products and about

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:54.400
us and that kind of thing.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.970
This is typically what you
would just do and whip out for a

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.700
client that wanted a small site.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.680
And then we're going to do copyright
information and text blocks in

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.690
the middle that have the text.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.950
So we take that sketch and we
kind of mock it up in Photoshop.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.600
And so we got the, like I said,
the right exit button.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.090
We got the simple menu system
and the logo's going to be up

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:19.890
there and that kind of thing.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.810
And so our section title's
going to be like contact us,

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.700
about us, products and home.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.900
That's going to change.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.960
And then our content there
would be provided by the client,

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.900
so we just kind of type something.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.280
At the same time,
typically when we design

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.770
a skin and a layout,
we'll also, in that same file,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.700
do a simple mask.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.700
The mask, everything where it's black
is going to be shown through.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.610
We just create that little thing,
and that's how it's going to be cut out.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:55.090
And then we do the drag mask,
which is obviously where the

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.310
cursor can actually grab stuff.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.120
So you want to make sure
your buttons aren't covered.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:04.940
I mean, I've had people that I've
explained kind of how to do this

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.890
real simple to do it and then
not uncover the buttons in Flash,

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.720
and they're clicking on it going,
"Why is my buttons not working?" It's

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.600
because you didn't like uncover it.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.750
So that's a good thing to keep in mind.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.770
Sometimes people spend days
just clicking on something,

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.180
going, "I can't figure it out.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:22.190
The scripts aren't working." And then,
okay, the...

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.250
The theory is,
and normally I don't even sketch this up,

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.460
but this is just for you guys
so I can show you how the

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.690
thought process is going.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:31.500
We're going to do a Flash movie.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.500
So we're going to create this in
Flash and we're going to export it out.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.260
And it's going to be the same
canvas height and everything

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.740
of our Photoshop comp,
but without the top layer.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.460
Because one thing inside of like
a tattoo is that you can't like,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.860
the Flash file is going
to have to be on top.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:57.890
And so if we have a sprite
that's going to be on in there,

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:57.890
this is an exit button.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.330
It's going to not show up
because it's underneath.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.200
If we put Flash in the background,
it doesn't function correctly.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.400
It's important to remember that you have
to leave some space and then create a

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.990
sprite for the exit button and then a
sprite for the background that you're

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:18.090
going to have not fill in with the
Flash document because it's shorter.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:23.090
Then you're going to have the skin track.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.150
Basically, it's going to be four tracks.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.760
And so here we're cutting out the
Photoshop comp with the header,

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.060
which is the background of
where the exit button is.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.290
And while we're doing this,
we're kind of measuring, like in pixels,

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.140
how far we're going with everything.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.090
So we can recreate when
we do our flash document,

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:42.660
the exact height and everything of
just the bottom portion of the comp.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.400
And then we have the exit button,
which will cut that out.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.730
And we kind of leave a little room.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.040
We don't go right up to exit
because we want the cursor to be

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.890
able to have a little play there.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.870
You don't want to go real tight with
your exit button because people will

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.740
click around it and not quite hit it.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.850
Just kind of a courtesy thing.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:05.900
And then we have, we go to Flash,
which means we take the Photoshop comp

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.540
and we paste it into the

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.220
The actual timeline,
which we can export that out as

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.410
PNG or JPEG or whatever and do that.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.580
And basically what we're going
to do here is we're going to

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:22.200
recreate the Photoshop comp,
because we don't want to use images.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.200
I mean, a lot of stuff is just
gradients and things.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.200
We can just recreate it in
vector form inside of Flash.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.180
And so we set our time canvas
up and we set our frame

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.200
rate and that kind of thing.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.200
And we start recreating it.

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:41.750
And what we-- And here's a real simple
basic preloader because we're going--

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.790
say we're going to put this on the Web.

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:49.550
Since QuickTime is progressive,
you don't necessarily have to analyze

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:53.560
the amount of information being
downloaded and everything like that.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.540
What you can do is in the main
timeline of Flash-- and in Flash,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.950
if you're familiar with it,
you can have multiple movies

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.360
and movies and movies,
so it kind of goes down in a hierarchy.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.800
And what we're going to do is we're
going to create two frames basically,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.140
a frame one and a frame five.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.170
And those are where our action
script on our main timeline is

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.470
going to just work and live.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.850
And so on the first frame,
we're going to have a play action

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.930
just in case they have autoplay
turned off or something inside of

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.140
QuickTime because that is a preference.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.230
And you got to be careful about
that because we don't want them

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:27.900
to sit there in a loading loop.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:33.280
And then we're going to have frame five,
we're going to say stop.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.480
And in Flash,
the-- the actual QuickTime player

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:44.090
will react to whatever scripts
are in the main timeline of Flash.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.790
But they won't necessarily-- I mean,
you can't stop the playhead

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:52.470
necessarily inside of a lower Flash--
or inside of a lower movie instance.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.940
So you can't really go-- if you put a
stop inside a movie that's in a movie,

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.150
it's not going to stop the main timeline.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.380
So this is where we
need to keep the script.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.020
And then everything else,
you'll notice in the frame five

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.660
there where the playhead is.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.580
Is that the logo, the buttons, the text,
everything,

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.440
those key frames are in frame five.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.980
So before frame five,
what we have is just--

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.390
Well, here's my play script.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.430
And what we have is a loading animation
with just that little loading thing.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.380
It's just blinking.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.270
And that's a movie we just created,
and it just sits there

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.400
and runs in a loop.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:33.210
And so what will happen is, hopefully,
is that when the user goes to the site,

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.700
they're going to see this loading
loop that says loading until

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.390
they get the site to come up.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.110
And so we try and keep our amount of
memory that we're using and everything

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.630
down low in the first loading loop
so they can see that right away and

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.390
wait for the process to complete.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.900
And that works because of
the progressive download.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:37:04.230
Because once QuickTime can play
all the way to frame five and stop,

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:11.400
It's loaded because all our
content begins in frame five.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:17.830
Basically, the preloader is set there
in frame one because when you

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.810
view a QuickTime file online,
you see the little progress bar go

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:27.380
and it'll play up to the point in
the frames of where you can view.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.400
It's a very simple
looping system that way.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.390
Here it is.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.990
Here's the loading.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.200
There it is once we get to frame five.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.170
That's the concept we're going for.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.960
We're going to keep all our content.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.700
You could throw photos
and everything in there.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:55.700
It would actually load in that loop
form until it can actually make it.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:59.190
This is before we put our skin
applied to it so we can actually

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.530
see the process of what's going on.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.120
Alright, so then we open Tattoo,
which again, it's $23,

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.610
so it's not much of an
investment to play with.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:10.970
And so,

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.400
I kind of like it because it's so simple.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.390
I can explain it quick to people and
they get it and they can start doing it,

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:19.010
especially if they're
Flash designers and they have no

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.280
background in doing QuickTime.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.080
I can give it to them and say, "Here,
do this and this and this," and they just

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.400
immediately jump in and start building.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.350
It's kind of useful in that,
but it is limited.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.400
If you're going to do anything serious,
definitely go get Live Stage,

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.750
but if you want to play around
with some interactivity,

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.970
this is an easy way to go.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:43.700
Now, the upper left-hand side,
we have the setScan, the setMovie,

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.860
and the addButton, right?

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:46.860
Well...

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.440
I kind of like this even because
this is such a simple workflow

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:55.190
because you can set the skin,
which means when we did our comp,

00:38:55.250 --> 00:39:00.950
we exported out say the background or
the masking pictures with the drag mask

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.960
and the regular mask in the background.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.700
And so we set the drag mask and
the actual mask up inside of the

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:15.340
skin info box and that's pretty
easy because you can just set

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.240
there in view and then set image.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.320
So it's really simple and
easy to add the whole skin.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:28.680
And then here we are, we're pasting in,
we're hitting set button.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.550
And set button is kind of a
deceiving thing because we can

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.820
set sprites and things that way.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.200
So we're actually setting
a background thing.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.900
We're not actually going to,
the background header,

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.440
because if we didn't,
it would just show black or white

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.510
or whatever the background color is.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.060
But we're actually setting that
up without any actions on it.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.260
So it's a button, but it's not a button
because it has no action.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.670
So it's not going to have a rollover
finger or anything like that or

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.740
anything indicating that it's a button.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.040
And so we can use that
kind of as a background.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:05.120
And then we add the exit button,
which the exit button...

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.000
Basically just needs a
simple action added to it.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.140
And why we're using Tattoo is because
we want to add an exit button.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.180
That's really the only
reason we're using it.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.000
And the skin.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
But you could still use that just
with QuickTime Pro and using XML.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.960
And so that's, you know,
freely done easily.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.930
And it's listed out how to
do it on Apple's website.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.480
But this makes it easy and quick and you
can get that exit button in there because

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.870
you don't want to not do an exit button.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:38.760
And I think everybody always says, "Wow,
people can just quit or they

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.490
can just close the window."
But users don't like that.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.960
They like to see the exit
button and we can't get past it.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:52.600
So having--using Tattoo in that
way gives you that ability.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.330
And you'll notice down there in
the actions we say close window,

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.300
which is kind of funny because of
the gradient that's going over it.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.090
But at the very bottom
you can see close window,

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.080
and that's where you set the actions.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.090
And so it's really easy.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.410
I mean, you just click on a
thing and say actions,

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.290
close window.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:13.890
And then we have the actual,
I'm going to show the project.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.510
So I'm going to move to

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.600
[Transcript missing]

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.940
I mean, you could obviously see how
you could brand that with,

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.430
I mean,
you could have a custom cut thing and

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:45.120
then you could have print material that
has a custom cut and you could have,

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.450
you could just kind of go
across all the boundaries.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.710
I mean, you could have such branding all
the way across all your materials.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.640
So, it's just amazing what
you can do with that.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:59.810
And what we did was we set up
a movie clip in there that,

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:06.580
a movie instance that basically moves a
small playhead around with all the text,

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.380
which we're going to come
back to that a little,

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.070
in a little bit.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.900
Okay.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:26.360
All right, the next thing,
it actually has two pieces to it,

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.970
this example.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:28.170
And, you

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:34.120
Basically, the first piece is that it's a
little technique I kind of made.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.750
I don't know if anybody
else is using this.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.850
It'd be interesting to find out.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.980
I kind of conceptualized this when
I was doing some stuff because when

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.980
I was first starting out in LiveStage,
I was putting all these

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:49.960
actions on the events,
the event tracks, the track events.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.900
And so I kind of got overwhelmed
by putting so many on and trying

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.190
to do all this different stuff
and keeping track of which buttons

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.880
are which and that kind of thing.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.140
And back then when I was
using LiveStage 3.5,

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.340
which is even more difficult to
figure out which buttons are what,

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:08.340
but the

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:16.510
I came up with this concept which
first off we set the global variable.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.520
I don't know if you can quite see that,
but first what we're doing

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.690
is we're setting the global
variable and then we're

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.930
we're actually pulling,
we're setting the variable from Flash.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.750
So what we're going to do
is we're going to analyze a

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.740
variable from the Flash track,
and then we're going to run an

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:34.560
if statement on it just to say,
does action set equal 1?

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.480
And if it does,
we're going to do a closed window.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:43.130
So this is kind of how you can create
a closed window inside of Flash,

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.300
but not,
and just reuse this sprite track in your

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.480
project because it's running on idle.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.260
So it's just like this guy's
watching the Flash track,

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.220
and he's sitting there,
and as soon as it says close, he goes,

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.510
close, and it closes.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.590
And so in Flash,
I can just paste this track in there,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.420
and I can create
Flash interactivity and everything,

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:10.160
and all I have to do is say
root variable equals action set,

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.070
or action can equal 1,
and then it can close,

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.520
and the other track automatically
closes the QuickTime file.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.510
And basically I've done like a...

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:23.780
I have a master sprite track which
has this idle script on there and

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.620
just keeps running all the time.

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.120
It has 16 different actions.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.490
When I'm making a new
project inside of Flash,

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:36.590
all I have to do is say,
"Action = 3," and I got documented.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:42.590
As soon as that happens,
my sprite track automatically closes and

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:42.990
I don't have to go into Live Stage and
add functionality or anything.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.800
This is the second part of this.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:56.710
What I'm adding here is
a smoother way to close.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:45:00.840
You saw earlier when
I closed that other file,

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.800
it just blinked, it was gone.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.150
From the days of doing
director and everything,

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:11.450
when we exit out,
the professional way to do it was

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:15.800
to have some kind of animation,
or say the address, or say thank you,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:15.800
or something like that.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:20.380
And kind of allow the user to exit
the material in a smooth manner

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.710
instead of just blinking off.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:28.790
This is kind of that same concept
but in an interactive QuickTime.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.560
What we're going to do here is
we're going to tell a movie to play

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.110
when they click on the exit button.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.560
We're not going to actually
set the action variable or

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.120
have it in live stage to close.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.610
So what we're going to do is we're
just going to have an animation

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:43.800
happen on the exit button.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.870
And so in the last
frame of the animation,

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.940
What's going to happen
on the exit animation?

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.430
When it animates all the way through,
on the very last frame we're

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.690
going to say stop for one thing,
just in case the action doesn't work.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.700
You don't want to keep it looping.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:07.490
Then we're going to say the
root variable action equals 1.

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.490
Then

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:11.850
What happens there is that's going
to execute that sprite track and it's

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.110
going to close the action at that point.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.200
So it doesn't have to be on a--it's
not really set on the button.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.200
It's set on the animation.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.190
And I'll show you that real quick.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.560
So what we get there is
just an opening animation.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.440
This is a very simple
CD-ROM we did for Warner Bros.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.010
Jazz.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:43.290
I had some rollovers, it was interesting.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.980
No sound, no video, no anything.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.700
It was just completely used as
an interactive solution that,

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.080
I mean, you could have used Flash here,
but we wanted to go QuickTime so

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.270
we could actually brand it.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.690
And this was the cover of the CD.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.800
I basically took a photo and just
clipped it out and there's the CD.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.570
So it was a real simple project.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:03.570
And we did this like two days,
it was easy.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.750
But on the close action,
we wanted to do a little something extra,

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.650
and we did do this in two days,
so don't give me a hard

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.160
time about this animation.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.870
It's real simple.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:16.190
Wee!

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:16.740
Okay.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:17.640
So there we go.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.500
I mean, it clipped right off.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.200
So let's look at that again.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:20.480
Wee!

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.170
There it goes.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.600
The animation is open,
which is just Flash.

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:27.600
And then we close it.

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:28.660
Wee.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:29.360
Okay.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.840
So you see the difference between saying,
"Okay,

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.940
here's my website," and the close it.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:37.940
It just kind of goes away
like any other application.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.070
You can actually do a little more,
and it's fun,

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.600
and it gives a little more feel to it.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.110
And that's just a kind of a professional
polish kind of thing that you would do.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.110
I'm going to go back.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.690
Now we're going to try and
do a little dynamics inside

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.060
of-- and this was Flash again.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:10.400
I apologize if no one wants to hear about
Flash because that's my background and

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:16.470
I think it's just so easy to jump into it
because so many people already know it.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.470
Let's see.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:22.240
Loading variables.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.680
You don't necessarily
have to pull an XML.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.000
I mean,
that's kind of daunting to some people

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.800
because they necessarily don't have
an XML system or they're not really

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:32.000
used to writing an XML document.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.240
But, I mean, if you're a developer,
you probably are.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.010
But if a simpler user, I mean,
you might need something simple.

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:42.010
So you want just a simple text document.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.090
So what load variables will do is it
will pull in and assign variables,

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:51.320
and these are just text,
these variables like strings, and

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:56.530
They're going to just set in
the variables inside of Flash,

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:04.700
and then we're going to display them on
our lower level hierarchy of our text.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.700
And I'll show you how we're
going to try and do that.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.700
Now,
you necessarily don't have to use text.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:10.700
You can actually use database.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.700
And I'm using PHP and MySQL here,
but you can use anything.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.700
Because any--I mean,
as long as Flash or QuickTime,

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.730
the Flash track in QuickTime is
returning with the proper

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.700
string format and everything,
you'll be fine.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:27.660
So it doesn't matter if you're
using ASP or WebObjects or

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.700
any of that stuff to do it.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.680
But here we're going to show how
to do it with just a text document.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.700
And so we're going to
call the text document,

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.680
and then we're going to
just pull in the variables.

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:37.700
That's easy.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.790
And then we're going to
do the same on approach2,

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.700
which we're going to hit the
document in the document.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.180
And the document actually looks
at the database and then feeds

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.700
back to the QuickTime file
the proper text information.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.700
So that's a simple concept.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.980
And then this is what the text
document is going to look like.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.090
And this is what my little
demo looks like right now.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.700
Text one, text two, text three,
that kind of thing.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.910
And those are the basic text
that's in that big block.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.000
So we can build all this and then
the client can come to us and say,

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.190
"Well,
here's our text finally the day before

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:17.140
we need to publish it." And we can go,
"Okay, paste it in the document and

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:21.010
we're done." We don't have
to go back in to each frame,

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.730
is that a flash or inside of
QuickTime and add all that in.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:31.680
Here is how we're doing the sub,
the movie instance.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:34.620
We have, you see the headers there?

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.710
That is actually the home

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:41.500
Yeah, okay there.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:46.190
You can actually see we're
highlighting the first header frame.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.680
And you see how Home has a box around it.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.670
That's our little header.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.200
So in each frame we've
labeled what section we're in.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.710
And we're just going to move the playhead
around to move different sections.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:04.000
Here is a continual frame
throughout all the sections,

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:05.690
which is the text block.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.210
What we're also doing here
is we're using dynamic text.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.000
You can make it out
towards the bottom there.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
It says "var text page." That's
just what we're going to set.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.850
That's what sets in the script,
which is the up top frame layer.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:29.000
Here we are embedding the
fonts into the Flash document.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Then we're going to
export out as QuickTime.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.990
We get this.

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:38.200
Let me go run over
there and show you this.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:49.950
First,
I'm going to open up the text document.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.360
And there's our text.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.640
And as we move through it,
you can see how at the

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.460
beginning of the document,
it's opening and doing the load

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:03.790
variables on the text document,
and it's pulling in the information,

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:09.390
and then basically on the movie instance,
inside of the main timeline,

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.750
it's moving and saying,
apply variable one,

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.120
or text one to the text block.

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.320
And so you're just kinda adding in
the text every time you move around.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.700
And all the text is just
held in the root timeline.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.040
And if you were doing
something like this,

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:28.840
you could easily use Live Stage to
pull the variables out and use

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:33.120
them in some other form or alter
them or do anything with them.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.630
But for this example,
this is just a simple way to do it.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.940
And so let's change the doc--
change the document slightly.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.930
Let's say in the home page, let's say--

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:52.390
say my new page,
and then we're going to do like, blah,

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:53.080
blah, blah, blah.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.880
We'll just do a bunch of text.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.690
Save.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:56.200
Dink.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.360
OK.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.460
We close this.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.460
We open it back up, and there it is.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:05.500
And it's that fast and easy to use.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.210
So instead of doing this
big XML formatting and

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:12.100
worrying about all that,
this is just the fast, easy,

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.000
simple way just to get texting quick.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.470
And you can use this
dynamically to control,

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:21.080
say, what images you're going to load,
or what movie in a movie

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.890
you're going to use,
or anything like that.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.460
And you can call that flash
track inside a live stage,

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:29.980
and it can actually pull in
and tell the tracks what to be.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.440
And you can use it in your Q script.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:36.770
So it's a real simple way to
get dynamic information in.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:01.340
I hope that seems easy for everybody.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:01.630
OK.

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:05.240
So that takes me to my links.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.550
Now, I put these links up on my--on a
little subsection of our website

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.270
but I don't know if that's
OK but it may still be there,

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.920
it may not still be there
by the time we get out here.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.540
But the Flash 5 tutorial
and samples basically,

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.080
those are--those are three
great sites to go to,

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:25.470
axcrypt.org and Ultrashok and FlashKit.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:30.680
I mean, if you go to those sites,
since we're using Flash 5,

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.880
we're talking about--it's had years
and years of buildup for people

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:40.920
putting .fla files up there that you
can just look at and learn from and

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:46.560
so those are tremendous resources to
use which I'm hoping that as we go

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:52.600
further with QuickTime interactivity
that we will gain larger-- Yeah.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:55:01.220
--amounts of tutorials and just sample
coding files that are uploaded on the

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.400
web and that we can go to to look at for
like live stage and things like that.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.290
And there's not--not that there
isn't those are--there already but

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:11.630
to have the magnitude of even those
three sites and then we're just

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:15.680
coming three Flash sites right there
is that you could go--we could have

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.700
a ton more and really advance this.

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:22.130
And then I have basically Hot Scripts,
which most people already know

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.890
from if they're doing PHP and
ASP and stuff and looking at other

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:30.300
people's scripts and using open
source PHP and things like that.

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:35.430
Which they actually have a Flash--I think
they have Flash tutorial links and

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.750
FLAs that you can download there too
as well to learn from to see how you

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:44.380
can hit a database and that kind of
thing if you want to really make your

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:44.380
QuickTime do some amazing things.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:51.300
QuickTime.org has some great ones.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.150
Obviously,
Stagedoor at TullyHip is the place to go.

00:55:55.190 --> 00:56:01.300
There's the simple URL for
the Apple MediaSkins.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:08.300
EZedia has some great tutorials on using
QTI to do some interactivity with too,

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.940
so you should check that out if
you're moving through and looking

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:13.300
for different applications to use.

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:17.550
I can't stress enough,
I think TullyHip is leading the way as

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:23.290
far as really producing professional
tool to do the most advanced work.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.300
Then Inspiration,
which is a site that we did called MOVTV,

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:31.300
which basically all it was
done for is to inspire people.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.930
We did that back in 2001,
so don't give me too much of

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.050
a hard time for how it looks.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:45.310
What I was trying to accomplish with that
site was trying to inspire people to say,

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:49.040
"Well, you know, I can skin something,
but what can I do beyond that,

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:56.450
or what can I do with that?" And so that
site is really built inside of QuickTime.

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:01.250
And basically some example
files like a clock.

00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:04.760
A clock necessarily doesn't
work perfectly all the time,

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:06.830
so I need to update it.

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:10.590
But it's still a fun site to look at and
I still like some of the looks of some

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:12.800
of the visuals and flash work done in it.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:16.980
And then QuickTimers.org,
which is like tons of examples

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.900
there for just interesting
interactivity and everything.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:24.900
And then TotallyHip Showcase,
which they have a great showcase

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:28.690
that shows all the most of the
best material that I've ever seen

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:30.900
done in QuickTime Interactivity.

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.400
And then we have a couple
of design resources.

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:41.260
I just want to throw these in because
I really want to see the level

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:43.620
brought beyond where we are now.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.430
And I think it really
could go a long ways.

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.200
And if you're surfing around
looking at the best Flash sites,

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.960
you're going to be inspired to
create the best QuickTime sites.

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.690
And so I really think
that looking at Linked Up,

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:57.280
which is a great resource,
you see people throwing new

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.600
stuff up there all the time.

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:03.190
And whenever any big design firm or
anybody that's doing advanced work really

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:07.090
updates a look of a site or something,
they throw it on there.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:10.890
And then you have Designs Kinky,
which is necessarily not known

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:14.830
as the best resource site,
but I really like it just because the

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:18.170
people that choose the material that
gets posted up in their news section,

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:19.040
they update it every day.

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:24.940
Talking about where people have updated
a design site or something like that.

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:28.090
You can really get some
great inspiration there.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:33.000
And SurfStation, which is a larger design
portal kind of site,

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.100
which we've really seen a huge
increase in design portal sites.

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.620
So if--I've only chosen three.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.100
There's so many.

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:48.800
If you go to like Stereotypography,
I think it is, you can choose and it can

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.890
pull like kind of like--

00:58:51.170 --> 00:59:00.030
pulls in information from
all these different sites so

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:04.830
you can keep it in one place.

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.010
That is it for me.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:06.010
Oh, okay, great.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:06.010
Yeah, I can do that.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:06.010
Switch back to...

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:22.430
Back then we were doing
jumbled imagery and stuff,

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.590
which was kind of trendy,
so bear with me.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:30.000
And then we have the launch thing here,
which we did our little Q logo,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.810
which was kind of fun.

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.850
So here's MOV TV,
which I really like the same look.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:41.790
I'm probably going to do like
MOV TV 2 or something like that,

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:45.080
and just kind of play around
and take this further.

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.390
But you have indicators like drag.

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:48.730
So this is the drag.

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:51.880
And of course, I mean,
it was really funny because

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:54.830
when we got this up,
and it was on Designs Kinky

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:57.940
and all these kinds of sites,
and it was linked.

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:01.210
And people were like, wow,
I can't believe this.

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:04.480
And then all these flash designers,
they were like, oh, my gosh.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.200
didn't jump in and start building,
which I'm--

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.100
Missed the point completely because
that's what it was there for.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.500
These are different examples.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.730
Some of them are kind of extreme.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:17.860
Here's my little about.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:23.900
Basically these buttons
launch other QuickTime movies.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.200
The about has a little content
and a little thing there.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.320
It's kind of twisted because
you can actually turn text and

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.920
flash and everything so you
can do some really wacky stuff

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.920
and really be creative with it.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.750
Then this was an ad to favorites,
which probably still works.

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:54.000
I don't know though,
this was made a while back,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.150
so I'm not sure if that's
going to still work.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.410
Experiments.

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.600
What's so funny about this is that...

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:09.010
I like to just play around and do
some crazy stuff and I thought,

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.510
"What is the craziest calculator
I can make?" And this is it.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.500
And most of the time, I mean,
this is way bigger than the 640x480,

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.440
so most people never even
see this stuff down here.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.500
So, well, not that most people
even use 640x480 anymore,

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.830
but anyway, on some laptops and stuff,
it's hard to see because

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.590
you can't really,
you know, it's not like a web

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.470
page where you scroll,
so you can't go further than that.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:37.490
But this does some
simple math and things.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.500
So, wee, broke.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:40.500
Okay.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.500
I didn't put very much
error handling in there.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.360
I wasn't really that
concerned at the time.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.500
And then this is like a surf bar.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.500
This takes you to
different sites and things.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.580
So, and then these are friends
of ours that have sites that,

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.500
and this was just,
this was a different concept.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500
I was just like, well,
what can we make useful?

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.360
And so, I was thinking, ah, a surf bar.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.890
It's just basically a links bar that
just kind of floats above everything.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.580
and Alex Ogle, Alex Ogle, Alex Ogle,
Alex Ogle,

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:22.210
Click on the web browser and it will
show you a web page in the background.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.100
This is a design company
and it's really great.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.050
That's an example there.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:38.100
Then we have a floating ball.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:38.100
Basically what this does is it uses

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:41.550
I wanted to show something around,
so I needed an excuse

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.600
to make it interactive,
so I made it a clock.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.400
It looks like your system clock
and just kind of feeds it back in.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.990
It shows the seconds and
everything and then it has the

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:53.720
year and everything in there.

01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:12.700
[Transcript missing]

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:26.700
That's a movie TV.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.710
And then, I'll show you this too.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.710
One minute.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.710
I'll just go to my website real quick.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.710
Oops.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.740
We actually have a QuickTime version
of our site coming out soon,

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.500
so it should be interesting.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.070
We're trying to move all the same
content over and trying to keep the

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.000
design active throughout everything.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.520
Let's see,
let's go to the creative section.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:50.550
I'm sorry I have to go through
this because I can't remember

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:56.120
my exact URL for launching this,
but here's the beautiful mistake player.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:08.810
This is a custom cut player for a band.

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:08.810
This is all pulling in dynamically.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:22.700
[Transcript missing]

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.080
You can move through there.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.340
I took some of these photos at a
concert and it was kind of fun.

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:34.220
And then music videos,
which this is the kind of shotgun

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.690
way of loading in multiple movies.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.640
I mean,
you can click on both of these and you

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.020
can see the progress bars coming down,
which and then I can still go back

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:47.710
to like tour dates and check that.

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.400
So, there it is.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:55.070
So, I can sit there and read
while it's downloading.

01:04:55.410 --> 01:05:00.000
I mean, it's a very simple concept,
but it's just like tabs in Safari is

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.980
how I explain it to people.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.900
Because if I want to load ten pages
up all at the same time so that I can

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.710
review them after they're already loaded,
which doesn't really matter much because

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:11.970
we're all on high bandwidth anyway,
but for the slower connection people,

01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:14.920
it's really great because
you can load everything in.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.610
You can just read for a while
or do whatever it takes to

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:20.440
allow the time to go by.

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.680
Because we're all set on slow bandwidth,
and we've watched movies

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.290
just load and load and load.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.140
And you thought,
can I click something else,

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.560
or can I open up another window?

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.080
And this is just an
inherent way to do that.

01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:42.060
Then we of course have MOVTV on
our site and everything.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.900
But I think that's about it.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.550
I hope everybody enjoyed
viewing that stuff.
