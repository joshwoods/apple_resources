WEBVTT

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.560
All right, so hello, everybody.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.470
My name is Joseph,
and I'm here to show you the introduction

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.140
to Final Cut Pro HD demonstration.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.160
Now,
I'm actually following this up with the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.570
advanced Final Cut Pro right after this.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.460
So assuming I don't lose my voice,
how many people are still planning

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.370
on sticking around for that?

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.200
About half of you.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.900
Okay, so that's good to know.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.160
So when I go through this one,
what I'm going to basically be

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.660
doing throughout this demonstration
is building an entire project,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.940
and I'm going to be skipping
certain steps during this demo,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.520
which I will cover in the advanced demo.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.010
And then when I get to the advanced demo,
I will have to redo some of the steps

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.440
to get to kind of where I left off,
but I'll go over them a lot more quickly,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.600
assuming that since
it's the advanced demo,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.300
most people know some of
those more basic features.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.880
So if you are going
to watch both of them,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.740
there will be just a
little bit of overlap,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.480
but I'll try to keep that
as minimal as possible.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.780
But first, before we get to the demo,
let's go through a few slides here.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.600
That's me.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200
I'm Joseph Linaschke.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.210
I'm the Technical Marketing Manager at
Apple in the Pro Apps group,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.890
and I run a group that is responsible
for creating all the demo content for

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.820
all the Pro Apps for use worldwide.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.070
So that's all the retail stores,
the trade shows, the road shows,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.840
et cetera.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.240
So anywhere you go and you
see the demos of the Pro Apps,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.780
chances are it's my
team that created them,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.820
so kind of fun.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.670
So let's go right into it.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.340
What's Apple all about?

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.390
Well, you all know, obviously,
Apple's all about innovation,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.500
and one of the latest
pieces of innovation that

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.120
we had is Final Cut Pro HD.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.200
Now, I'm going to get into the HD side
of this in the advanced demo,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.420
because clearly HD is
an advanced feature.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.520
But for now,
I just want to go through some

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.860
of the basic underpinnings of
Final Cut and where it's being used.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.660
Over a quarter of a million
people are using Final Cut Pro.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.540
How many people out here
are already using it?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.410
Quite a few of you.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.750
Okay, so you guys,
plus almost a quarter million more,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.660
make up that number.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.420
So we've got quite a few users out there,
which is great.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.320
Really good for us.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.800
And it's being used all over the place.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.470
Places like in standard broadcast houses,
ABC, Channel 4 News,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.310
that sort of thing is using it.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.610
Recently used on the movie,
the Coen Brothers movie,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.230
The Lady Killers, if you saw that,
that was cut on Final Cut.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.340
Also Cold Mountain was
cut on Final Cut Pro.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.900
Quite a few films out there and
that list is always growing.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.450
The episodic show Nib Tuck,
if you've ever seen that,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.480
that's cut in Towerland Final Cut Pro.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.270
It's actually shot on film,
even though it's broadcast

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.980
standard definition,
regular TV.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.660
It's shot on film,
telecinated down to an HD format,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.270
and then brought further down
to a standard definition format,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.380
cut on Final Cut Pro and
output for broadcast.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.970
That workflow means that in
the future they can go back

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.530
up to HD if they ever want to.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.380
And since they use Final Cut,
they'll be able to use the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.580
same software throughout and
it'll actually be pretty easy.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.660
I have a video that I want to show you,
which,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.410
how many people were in the keynote?

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.480
I'm assuming all of you saw the keynote.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.640
So this video is going to
sound a little bit familiar.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.670
This is the video that we produced for
the NAB show as a demo reel of what our

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.940
customers are doing with the application.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.890
Let's go ahead and switch
over to the computer.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.870
Let's go ahead and switch
back to the machine.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.780
I'm going to stay on there.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.340
So, because I know I'll get a lot
of questions about the reel.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.720
First off, I'll say,
one of the most common questions is,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.660
was that created entirely with
Motion and with Final Cut Pro?

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.640
Well, it was cut in Final Cut Pro,
and Motion was used in it,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.060
but it was not done entirely with Motion.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.480
I'm only saying that to lay
down the point that it's not

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.980
all about Apple-only tools.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.940
We, of course, rely heavily on you guys,
on the third-party developers,

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.030
and there's a lot of third-party
applications and plug-ins and

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.420
effects and so on that were used
in the production of that piece.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.610
So, it's not all just about us,
even though we tend to turn out

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.120
a few really cool things here.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.340
So, clearly, that also is not just
about Final Cut Pro.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.520
You saw all the apps covered in there,
DVD Studio Pro, Logic, Final Cut Pro,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.420
Shake, and Motion.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.690
If you guys saw,
if you missed the Motion demo

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.160
earlier this week,
it's a shame.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.600
It's a fantastic demonstration
that was on Wednesday.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.320
Later on today,
we also have a Logic presentation and a,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.670
what's that?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.630
Music thing.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:02.960
Logic.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.790
Logic, I said that.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.040
DVD Studio Pro,
that's what I wanted to say.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.320
A DVD Studio Pro presentation
this afternoon as well.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.690
Alright, so back to this.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.740
So the reel that you just saw,
another kind of really

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.940
interesting thing about this,
you're watching it in HD.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.420
That was a high-definition image,
720p HD at 24 frames per second.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.240
This is not high-def projection,
so it was scaled down

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.040
for this resolution.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.180
But the really interesting thing
is that that was actually playing

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.180
off of the Final Cut Pro timeline,
off of the internal hard drive.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.850
Just one.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.770
The internal hard drive on a G5.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.630
Which tells you that you can do, today,
high-definition editing with

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.800
this new DVC Pro HD format
off the internal hard drive.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.790
A single internal hard drive on your G5.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.020
And actually,
everything I'm going to do today

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.990
is off this internal drive.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.860
I, frankly, couldn't be asked to
bring up my RAID today.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.480
So that's why we're just
running off the internal.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.640
The RAID will give you
a lot of advantages.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.980
For example,
more streams of real-time HD.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.800
Obviously,
it will give you faster speed in general.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.210
And, of course,
clearly a whole lot more storage.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.020
Three and a half terabytes
of storage under your desk.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.030
Which is a nice thing to
have when you're doing HD.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.100
But, for today's demo,
this is all run off the internal.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.060
So let's go ahead and get started
with Final Cut Pro itself.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.900
I'm going to introduce you to
the application with a brief

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.080
tour of the interface here.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.080
Let's get a couple things open.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.100
And also a brief explanation
of the standard workflow.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.460
Now,
Final Cut Pro HD is simply the name of

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.100
the newest version of Final Cut Pro.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.100
It's Final Cut Pro 4.5 Final Cut Pro HD.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.100
The HD name we just added on
with the most recent release.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.100
Just to remind you.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.100
We really drive the point home
that this release is all about HD.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.070
High Definition.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.090
However, that doesn't mean that we've
left everybody else behind.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.090
We still handle all
formats in one application.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:46.100
So you've got DV, Standard Definition,
Uncompressed, High Definition, and so on.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.680
And you can even do
film if you incorporate

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.980
Cinema Tools into your workflow.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.170
And we're not going to go
into all of that right now,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.090
being the introductory one.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.170
But the point that I'm making
here is that regardless of

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.100
the format you're working in.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.100
Again, Standard Def, DV, High Def,
whatever.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.100
The workflow is identical.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.050
You have the exact same interface.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.100
You have the same set of tools.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.050
It's the same 999 piece of software.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.100
So your options here are
really quite limitless.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.210
If you get into this business,
you get into this industry,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.100
starting with DV as many people do.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.100
Move into a broadcast space and then
eventually move into High Definition.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.100
Unlike some other competitive tools,
there is no huge learning curve

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.070
to go from step to step to step.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.070
It's all there.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.100
It's all the exact same tools.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.100
Now, the demonstration I will be
doing today is High Definition.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.080
But this could be just
as easily DV footage.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.100
So let's briefly talk about the workflow.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.090
How you get your stuff into
the computer to start with.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.100
Let's just start with DV.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.930
Let's assume that we're mostly
going to be talking about DV today.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.100
So you've all seen DV cameras.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.080
You can buy many DV cameras
from Circuit City or Best Buy.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.100
They're as cheap as, you know,
like $500 or maybe even less these days.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.100
Of course,
the DV cameras go up quite a bit.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.100
You can get the 3-chip
cameras from Sony and Canon.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.100
They're really, really nice.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.080
Get up to a couple thousand dollars.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.010
But regardless,
it shoots the same format, DV.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.380
So DV is a digital format,
digital video format that is recorded

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.100
under those itty bitty little tapes.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.100
I'm sure you've seen those before.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.100
There's actually different flavors of DV.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.100
There's DV cam,
which is slightly higher quality.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.100
But don't worry about that.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.100
We'll just think DV as general DV.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.100
From your camera,
you have a FireWire port.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.020
Or if you're in a studio environment,
you'll have a deck,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.050
a DV deck that has a FireWire port on it.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.160
And the way, of course,
that you get your DV footage from the

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.100
tapes into the computer is over FireWire.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.100
It's as easy as plug and play.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.790
Just plug the deck or the camera
straight into the back of your

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.100
G5 or your laptop computer.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.830
Final Cut Pro.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.100
Bring up something called
the Login Capture Window.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.100
And you start capturing your footage.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.100
Now, it's not quite as simple and
straightforward as iMovie.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.100
iMovie is dead easy.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.650
You just hit Capture and it automatically
goes through your tape and it selects

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.100
every shot and individually marks that
shot and puts it in a little bin for you.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.100
And that's great for the
consumer side of things.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.100
But this, of course,
is a professional application.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.950
So you have professional tools to
do your logging and capturing with.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.390
Now,
the term Login Capture generally means

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.700
that you are going to log a clip,
meaning you're going to

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.090
look at the tape and say,
I want from here to here.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.100
And then I want from here to here.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.100
And then from here to here.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.100
And then you're going to capture later.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.090
Something called a Batch Capture.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.560
So you say take all these logged
clips and now capture them

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.960
while you go have a cappuccino.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.280
So the whole point is that you sit down,
go through an hour of tape or 10 hours

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.100
or 100 hours of tape or hopefully have
your assistant editor doing that for you.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.100
And that's not fun.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.030
You mark down each clip that you want.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.100
You mark this is a good take.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.090
This is the best take.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.100
This one is halfway decent.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.050
Maybe it's good.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.100
Make your little log notes in there.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.650
And then just capture them all at
once and just have somebody feeding

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.100
the tapes into the deck for you.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.100
So that's your standard procedure
of getting your content in.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.050
That's your video footage.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.530
If you're talking about
bringing in graphics,

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.970
well,
you just drag and drop your graphics in.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.100
Text and titling we'll get
into here a little bit.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.020
Everything else that you do is basically
just drag and drop into the application.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100
So let's get a quick
tour of the interface.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.570
This is the standard
Final Cut Pro interface for working

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.020
with widescreen footage here.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.100
You may rearrange the
windows however you like.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.990
I'll actually probably rearrange
my windows a couple times

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.090
throughout this demo to accommodate
the work that I'm doing.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.100
But this is a pretty standard layout.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.150
On the top you have the
viewer and the canvas,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.890
which you may also hear referred to
as the source and record monitors.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.090
On the bottom we have the
browser and then the timeline.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.040
So let's start with the browser.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.100
The browser is where all
of your media is stored.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.100
All the video that you've captured,
any video you've imported,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.100
any graphics you've brought in, sound,
etc.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.960
It's all stored in here.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.090
And I can just expand this
window out a little bit.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.100
And you'll see here that it
works basically like the Finder.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.100
I have various folders or as they're
called bins inside of Final Cut Pro.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.090
Each one of those bins can be nested.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.100
It's just like in the Finder.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.100
You can nest them and
nest them and nest them.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.100
And you can color code them as well.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.100
So you can tag them with
labels if you want to.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.380
Over on the right side here,
you'll see there's quite a bit

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.070
of information about the shots.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.100
So let's just select any clip on here.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.100
You'll see I've got a comments column.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.100
I have duration.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.020
That's obviously how long the clip is.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.420
The current marked in and
out points where the in and

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.090
out point is on the timeline.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.100
And this just goes on and on and on.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.090
And there is a huge,
huge amount of information in here.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.100
As you can see in there,
there's just column after column.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.100
We're not even looking
at all of them here.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.090
These are the ones that
I've hidden right now.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.560
So there is an absolutely huge
amount of metadata embedded in

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.080
every single video clip that is
exposed inside of Final Cut Pro.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.160
Now,
if you're working in a screen like this,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.100
and this is pretty low
resolutions by editing standards.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.050
This is only 1280 wide,
so we really don't have

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.050
a whole lot of workspace.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.850
And as you can see,
my browser is so narrow,

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.910
I can only see one column in here.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.920
In a more traditional
working environment,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.100
you'll have two screens.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.100
In a professional environment,
you would usually have two screens.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.080
And this browser would take up
the entirety of another screen.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.100
Now,
it doesn't have to just be one window.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.060
You can actually go in here
and open up the browser.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.100
Let me find a folder in here
with a bunch of media in it.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.100
Let's see here.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.100
I'll take this one.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.100
Just double click that.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.100
It will open to a separate
window if I want it to.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.030
I can even choose to view that as small,
medium, or large icons.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.470
And when I do that,
I can obviously see what that

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.100
clip is a lot more clearly.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.100
So you'll find if you have
that extra working space,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.100
let's say you've got, I don't know,
a 30 inch in front of you

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.100
and a 23 off to the side.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.030
As we all do, of course, right?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.010
You've got plenty of
space to view your clips,

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.100
lay them out, spread them out,
however you want to.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.250
Just on that note,
if you really want to set up

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.100
like the ultimate editing setup,
get one of those 30s in front of you.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.100
Those things are so cool.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.000
Get one of those 30s in front of you
and then you have 23 on each side.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.090
Three displays.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.100
Now, why on earth would you
want that much space?

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.070
Well,
having the 30 in front of you clearly

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.950
gives you enough space to have your
video and canvas up and a really big,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.950
wide timeline.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.100
In fact,
the 30 inch display is so high resolution

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.930
that you can have two 720p HD clips up
side by side at 99%. If you do the math,

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.880
you actually should be able to
get to 100% but there's a little

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.100
bit of interface in the way.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.030
So I'm actually talking to
our engineers about that.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.090
I'm going to see if I can
get that taken care of.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.920
But you have enough pixels for
two HD pieces side by side.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.100
That's kind of cool.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.460
And then you've got a massive
timeline on the bottom and then

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.050
on your 23 inch off to the left,
you put all of your browsers.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.100
You can open them up
into multiple windows.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.100
All the space you could possibly
want to see all your clips.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.910
And then on the right side,
you have your video out.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.790
Now, what you saw,
the way I played this back

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.090
earlier was full screen.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.100
Now,
since we only have one screen up here,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.100
when I go into full screen mode
or when I go into video out mode,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.090
let's just close this.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.760
If I go into video out mode,
just hit the keyboard shortcut,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.100
it fills up this screen.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.200
But if I had a second display up here,
then you'd see this image on the second

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.100
display filling up that screen and I'd
still be able to work in my canvas,

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:18.100
my viewer and everything.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.070
And be able to watch it on
that second screen over there.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.290
That's actually a new
feature in Final Cut Pro HD,

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.090
something called digital video out.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.950
We are basically sending the video
signal out over the DV port or

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.100
DVI port into a second monitor.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.610
And if you go downstairs actually
on the second floor where they

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.100
have the 230 side by side,
you can see that setup.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.370
They do have it set up so that
you can see the video full size

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.100
on the 30 inch monitor as well.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.690
But anyway, so there's your ideal setup,
30 and 223s, you go.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.800
Okay, you don't need all that,
but it's really cool if you can get it.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.740
All right, so there's a quick
summary of the browser.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.500
The viewer itself,
this is the viewer up here.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.640
Any clip that I open from the browser,
let's just go ahead and

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.420
open up a shot here.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.940
I double-clicked on a
clip in the browser.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.740
It opens to the viewer.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.960
The viewer is where I make
my editing decisions.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.510
So let's say that you've captured
a 30-second shot of whatever,

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.600
somebody running down the beach.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.050
And you don't want to use
that whole 30 seconds.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.900
It's just too much footage.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.520
So you need to make a select out
of that or mark an in-point and an

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.680
out-point to define what portion of
that clip you actually want to use.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.520
Well, the way that you do that is
within the viewer window here.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.760
You simply choose the position we want.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.900
Let's just say, let's get something a
little bit more animated.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.910
There we go.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.330
So let's say that I want to
start the shot right there.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.250
Now, to mark an in-point,
I have multiple ways of doing it.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.820
I can click the little button on the
UI right there to mark the in-point.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.770
And that triangle there
pointing to the right,

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:40.170
that way.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.000
It's been a long night.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.880
Pointing that direction is your in-point.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.980
That's saying this is where
I want to start the clip.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.050
Anything before that will not
get used when I drag this onto

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.490
the canvas or into the timeline.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.000
Now, you do have non-destructive
editing in Final Cut Pro.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.460
That means that anything you do,
you can always undo.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.470
There's never any destruction to the
original clips on the hard drive.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.180
So I can go in here and say,
only want this one second piece.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.550
And then a year from now,
I really wish that I had that

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.150
second that I shot before it.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.540
Well, it's still there, assuming,
obviously, you don't go to the hard

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.750
drive level and delete them.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.270
But anyway, so that's how you mark.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:12.850
And in-point.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.400
There's keyboard shortcuts as well.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.320
I could go in here and tap the
O key to mark an out-point,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.480
the I key to mark an in-point.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.310
And put the in and
out-points wherever you want.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.080
And once they're defined there,
you can drag them around if you like.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.740
Lots of different ways
to do the same thing.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.360
And you'll actually find
that in Final Cut Pro.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.730
There are lots of ways
to do the same thing.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.780
So if you want to use the mouse,
you can do that.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.100
If you like menus, you can do that.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.490
Keyboard shortcuts, you can do that.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.200
In fact, Final Cut Pro 4 introduced
a mappable keyboard,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.100
which means that you have the ability now
to go in here and change the keyboard.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.180
And you can do that.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.660
You can change your keyboard layout to
accommodate your own personal tastes,

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.060
which I've found to be incredibly useful.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.070
If there's a command that you use all
the time that the engineers didn't think

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.780
you would use all the time and you want
to assign a keyboard shortcut to it,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.170
great.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.880
Or maybe you're coming
from another system.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.320
You're used to Premiere, for example.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.420
And in Premiere,
the keyboard shortcut to mark

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.780
an in and out is different.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.530
And you just don't feel like forcing
your brain to learn the new one.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.450
Remap it.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.250
Remap the keyboard to
work the way you want to.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:08.890
All right, so back over here.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.380
Once you've marked a clip in the viewer,
again, marking it,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.800
meaning marking your in
points and your out points,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.170
to add it to the project,
you simply drag and

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.580
drop it onto the canvas.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.920
I can drop it onto the canvas
or directly onto the timeline,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.340
and I'll just put it here kind
of in the middle of the timeline,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.340
and you'll notice that it
is a little bit shorter.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.980
I have not used this
part of the clip here,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.840
so that part of the shot is missing,
of course,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.840
because I've marked the in and the
out on there to trim that down.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.390
And if I double-click on this clip,
it'll open it back into the viewer,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.820
and before I do,
you'll notice down here where

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.030
the in and out is marked.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.260
It's just a smooth, plain bar,
if you will.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.730
If I double-click on it, it opens up,
and you see little tiny

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.750
sprocket holes on there.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.850
The sprocket holes are
telling me that I'm opening

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.360
it directly from the timeline.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.100
So if I make a change
to this clip up here,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.660
it's going to affect it on the timeline.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.980
So for example,
if I go in here and I move the out point,

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.620
you see the out point just
changed on the timeline as well.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.030
If I drag it back out,
it goes out on the timeline like that,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.440
too.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.350
So I now have the ability to
continue to make my changes,

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.340
my edits, within the viewer directly.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.820
All right, so that's getting stuff
onto the timeline.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.350
There's obviously lots
of ways to do that.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.140
As I mentioned with Final Cut,
there's multiple ways to do everything.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.470
I drag this directly onto the timeline.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.420
I can also drag onto the canvas itself.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.250
And when I do that,
I get a series of options in here.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.730
I have an insert, overwrite, replace,
fit to fill, and superimpose edit.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.710
Now, we'll go through some
of these as we work,

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.640
but the primary ones you'll
use is insert and overwrite.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.570
So let's just very quickly
see what that means.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.380
Let me open up a different clip in here.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.200
So here's another sunset clip.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.740
If I put the play head at
the beginning of this shot,

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.460
so it's before the bird shot there,
and I drag this onto the

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.250
canvas and I choose overwrite,
it will literally overwrite that clip.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.350
That second clip is now gone.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.650
It has been taken over by the first one.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.760
If that first clip had been longer,
let's just go ahead and stretch the

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.280
duration of that out a little bit,
and I'll actually shorten this one

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.900
just to really show this clearly.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.130
Again, the play head is at the
beginning of the clip.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.940
If I drag this onto overwrite,
it overwrites as much as it needs to,

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.390
and then the rest of the
other clip is still there.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.820
So that is an overwrite edit.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.580
It will overwrite.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.710
It's a destructive edit.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.660
Overwrite anything
that's on the timeline.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.340
The other most common
edit is the insert edit,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.760
which will basically push the media
that's there out of the way to make

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.430
room for the clip that's coming in.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.980
So I go insert edit.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.810
You can see on the timeline it pushed
that bird shot over a little bit

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.780
and made room for the one coming in.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.460
So there's two different
standard common edits in there.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.690
And then the others, like I said,
we'll get into a little bit more later.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.860
Over on the right hand side
I have my tool palette,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.770
your standard arrow,
all the different tools, your slip,

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.250
slide, ripple, roll tools, zooming tools,
your crop tools, distortion.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.910
We'll get into some of these.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.020
We won't hit all of them in
this introductory course,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.740
but there's all the tools that you
would need to access are there.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.070
And then down here on the bottom
right you have audio level meters

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.140
showing your current audio levels.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.180
So when you're playing back
you can watch there and make

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.470
sure that you're not peaking.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.400
You'll see here that
you have negative 12,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.260
which is just as it starts
to go from green to orange,

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.520
minus 12 dB is actually the digital zero,
if you will.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.020
You don't generally want to go over that.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.080
And if the little lights flicker red,
then you're peaking.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.340
And if you're doing digital audio,
that's generally considered

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.100
a very bad thing.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.970
It'll sound horrible when
it goes back to tape or even

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.400
coming out of your home speaker.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.550
So you'll definitely want to
keep an eye on your audio levels,

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.670
and that's what that's for.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.330
All right, so before I get into
the actual demo itself,

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.580
we have any questions
about the interface?

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.860
And let me preface this by saying,
feel free any time throughout this demo.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.220
to holler out questions.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.860
Kent.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.200
Okay.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.270
Only that one instance.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:45.430
So if I had this clip on
the timeline multiple times,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.910
let's just paste that down there again,
and I open the first one,

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.640
change the out point of that.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.580
Can I hear you?

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.660
Change the out point of that.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.210
It only changes that one instance of it.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.870
Cool.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.440
You're welcome.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.610
You can also...

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.180
That's not in Express.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.950
Okay, I'll give a real quick overview
of what is not in Express.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.320
Express is DV only.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.830
So you have a majority of the tools set,
but you can only work in DV footage.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.140
The question is about
Final Cut Express versus Final Cut Pro.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.940
Final Cut Express does not include
live type or soundtrack to auxiliary

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.700
applications that accompany Final Cut.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.040
Obviously,
it does not include cinema tools either.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.580
And when you get into the
compositing side of things,

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.940
you have the majority of the compositing
tools in Express that you have in Pro.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.030
And you'll see me use quite a
few of those compositing tools.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.480
But you do not have a
compositing timeline,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.170
which means if you want
to do advanced composites,

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.940
it gets really tricky in Express.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.320
For that kind of stuff,
you really want to go with Pro.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.370
You also don't have the ability
to... I think logging capture

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.070
is a little bit different.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.380
I think that you can't log
multiple clips and capture later.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.830
I think you can log one
clip and capture at a time.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.490
So you can't log a series of offline
clips and then batch capture them later.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.740
Those are the primary differences.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.200
Yeah.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.120
Okay, so the question's in reference to
frame rate differences and how you're

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.600
capturing between 30 frames per second,
standard NTSC, or 2997,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.200
and Panasonic's 24 frame or
23.98 frames per second format.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.480
Basically, when you do your initial
setup in Final Cut Pro,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.330
you have something called an easy
setup that brings up a list of all

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.600
the different setup options that you
have for all the different formats

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.480
that you might want to capture.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.590
And if you add third-party capture cards,
and this gets into more

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.350
of the advanced stuff,
but as you add third-party capture

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.970
cards like a Kona card or the
IO box or the CineWave card,

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.070
etc., you'll have additional
options to this list.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.990
And you can see on here that
you have different frame rates,

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:47.380
different formats represented,
different codecs, and so on.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.610
And so basically,
all you really need to do for 99% of

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.620
the time is choose the preset here,
and it will automatically set your frame

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.450
rate and everything to the right space.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.900
If you have some custom setting
where you're going to kind of just

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.460
go into something that we have.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.160
And if you hadn't thought of,
then of course you can customize

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.230
these and make whatever you want.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.360
Does that answer your question?

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:03.910
Great.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.430
Okay,
let's go ahead and get on with it then.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.360
If you're going to stick
around for the advanced one,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.370
I can go more into 24-frame
stuff when I get into there.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.400
I'm just going to actually revert
this project so I can start clean.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.300
And we'll start by building the piece.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.850
Now here,
let's go ahead and play back the final

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.370
piece that I'm going to be building.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.080
Now again,
being the introductory course here,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.400
I'm not going to spend a whole
lot of time on some of the more

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.770
advanced functions of this.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.400
I'll skip over them and I'll
just point out when I do.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.400
I'll say I'll cover this
more in the advanced area.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.430
But this is the basic project
that we'll be building today.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.560
So that's the piece that
we're going to be building.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.910
Now, this piece, obviously,
is not going to win any major awards.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.540
It's pretty simple.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.640
But just to drive the point home
of how flexible Final Cut Pro is,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.320
again, this is all HD.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.400
This is all 720p DVC Pro HD format,
which is the Panasonic HD format.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.930
I edited this piece in the
course of two evenings,

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.760
maybe three, call it three evenings,
from about maybe 10:00,

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.320
11:00 at night until about 2:00 in
the morning at my parents' house when

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.750
I was on vacation on my 17-inch laptop
with an external FireWire drive,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.390
a little 800 drive,
one of the little itty-bitty baby ones.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.400
That's all that I needed to do this.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400
Okay, and some headphones.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.320
That's it.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.520
So the music was created in soundtrack.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.400
No comments if you hate the music.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.400
I'm not a musician.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.380
I'm not even a drummer.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.220
.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.700
Those who know Phil,
the guy who-- Phil Jackson,

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.950
the guy who will be doing our
demo later today for Logic.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.240
He's--I just stole his joke, but hey.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.860
Anyway, there you go.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:40.860
So...

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:50.130
The Final Cut Pro HD is a full HD,
ready for broadcast,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.040
or print back to film,
whatever you're going to do, piece,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.520
and it was edited entirely on a laptop.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.180
That's kind of cool.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.350
That's really saying something there.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.280
All right, so let's go ahead and start
building this project up.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.520
So first thing I'll do is
go ahead and add my audio.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.550
Now here's the audio track.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.960
Audio track was created in Soundtrack,
and I'll go into how it was

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.590
created in the next demo.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.440
I'll actually open up Soundtrack
and show you the piece there.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.690
But this was the music that
was created in Soundtrack.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.260
Actually,
let's just launch Soundtrack real

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.960
quick and have a quick look-see at it.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.320
You want to see it?

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.450
Yeah, all right.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.370
I won't spend a lot of time in there.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.400
There we go.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.300
So, Soundtrack is really designed
for creating music for video.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.710
I kind of did things a little
bit backwards here in that

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.480
I created the music first,
and then I went and

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.580
started doing the video,
and I went back and forth,

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.560
back and forth,
back and forth throughout the process.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.700
This final piece actually doesn't
even have the video in it,

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.400
but if the video were in here,
it would be playing up in

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.990
this little window here.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.310
But the reason I'm showing it
without is more to show that this

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.810
is how I originally created it.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.190
I did create it without the video,
and then I cut the video

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.500
to match the music.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.290
Did that make sense?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.800
All right, so here's the piece up here.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.160
As you can see,
it's a fair number of layers,

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.100
but not a huge number.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.200
It starts off with a simple bass guitar.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.590
You'll see there's a
little drop two octaves.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.820
Can we bring the levels up just a little?

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.090
All right.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.930
You see the different pieces coming in,
little symbols and tambourine rather.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.260
There's four different
upright bases on there,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.780
all playing different pieces,
and each layer in here is

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.090
a different loop pattern.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.940
You'll also notice,
let's go ahead and open up

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.900
the bottom part of this.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.230
There's actually a tempo adjustment here.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.740
Things got just a little bit faster
here for this tempo adjustment.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.820
And then towards the end here,
the tempo is going to drop considerably.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.680
and that's all done inside of Soundtrack.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680
Right?

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.890
Not too bad.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.320
So enough of that.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.270
Let's just go ahead back to the app.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.500
So that's how this music was created.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.380
So back into Final Cut Pro.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.020
So here's the project as an AIF file.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.520
From Soundtrack,
you simply say export stereo mix.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.820
Takes everything,
mix it down to a single stereo pair,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.100
bring that into Final Cut Pro.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.840
You can actually export out
every individual track or layer

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.810
inside of Soundtrack as its
own individual stereo pair,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.100
and then reassemble that entire
project inside of Final Cut Pro,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.760
or more importantly,
reassemble that final project

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.400
in another application,
so for example Logic.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.340
So if you use Soundtrack
as a scratch board,

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.480
if you will, or maybe as the editor,
you want to create this musical piece,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.640
you have an idea of what you want.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.370
Soundtrack is designed
for video type people,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.540
not really audio people.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.740
So you go in there and you create
something that sounds like what you want.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.240
And then you hand it off to your
musician and he takes that project,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.800
opens it inside Logic and goes, okay,
now I know what he wanted to do,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.260
but I think this will be a little better.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:36.940
Let's change that.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.750
Let's add an effect here.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.420
Let's throw this half away
because he's obviously an idiot.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.590
And just go on and on
and build the project.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.270
So it's a collaborative
workflow in there.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.060
But anyway,
here we have the piece brought

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.650
back in as a single stereo mix.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.680
So the first thing I want to do in here
is mark a couple of important instances,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.590
or important occurrences
on this project here.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.400
The first one I'm going to
mark is the pitch change.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.430
If we listen to it,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.740
It's the same pitch and then a
little bit of a pitch change.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.700
So I want to mark that
pitch change in here.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.830
And you can see it very clearly,
what's going on in here,

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.380
and I can go ahead and zoom into that
a little bit more if you want to.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.470
That black bar represents the
timeline or one frame of video.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.670
We're talking about audio,
but we're in a video space,

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.490
so we need to think in
the terms of frames.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.120
And even though there's
a lot of audio happening,

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.860
you can see the waveform all over the
place in the course of that one frame,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.820
that is the one frame that
I'm actually looking at.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.090
And if I want to cut
on a particular frame,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.620
I can just drag this back and forth,
as you can see.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:39.200
Now let's just say-- I'm going to zoom in
just a little bit more-- let's just say

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.080
that I really wanted to start the cut,
let's just say right there.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.670
But if I drag this back and forth,
you'll see that I can't get to that

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.480
because it's snapping to the frame.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.820
Well,
Final Cut Pro actually has subsampling

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.060
on here where I can go down to 1/100
of a frame by holding down the--

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.220
I thought it was the Command key.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.500
Oh, there we go, Shift key.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.760
I can just drag this in and
go down to 1/100 of a sample--

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.860
1/100 of a frame on there.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.220
So I can get down to very,
very accurate trimming on my audio.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.300
If I hit I right now
to mark an end point,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.620
the entire audio project will
slip that fraction of a frame

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:12.980
to accommodate that edit.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.270
So that way, if you have, for example,
a pop that you're trying to get rid of,

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.300
or you want to start on the beat,
but the beat really starts there and you

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.040
don't want that half of a frame involved,
you can cut that

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.000
accurately if you want to.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.110
Let's just back out of that a little bit.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.570
So there is the beat of the Shift pitch.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.220
Let's just go ahead in there,
and I'm going to mark a

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.160
marker by tapping the M key.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.860
If you notice,
this tiny little thing happened up here,

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.520
that little guy right there,
and that's a marker.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.520
And that marker is just a tag for me,
so that I can reference that later.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.470
I know where something is.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.530
And if I want to modify that
marker to put a name on it,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.540
I can do that as well.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.510
Tap the M key again,
and I can type in here

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.240
something like pitch change.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.520
So now I know that that pitch
change has happened on there,

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.910
and that's where that marker is.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.280
So I've got that pitch change on there.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.340
Let's just go ahead and, well,
actually I had another

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.400
pitch change on here.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.760
I'm going to scrub forward a little bit.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.040
Let's see, I went a little too far there.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.130
Let's zoom back into that.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:13.700
So there we go.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.830
There's that other pitch change.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.460
So once again, I'll go in here and add
another marker right there.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.790
So now I have two markers
added to my timeline,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.960
or to my audio.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.270
I'm going to go ahead and take this
and add it onto the timeline itself.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.790
And as I add that on there,
you'll see the two markers in place.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.390
So now I know where
those pitch changes are.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.350
Now why did I do that?

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.040
Well, I want to cut my video project here
so that some of the cuts or something

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.790
happens on those pitch changes,
on those pitch shifts,

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.260
and at least now I know
exactly where they are.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.470
I don't have to keep going back over
and over again to try to find them.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:42.840
All right, so that's in there.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.720
Let's go ahead and zoom into
that portion of the timeline a

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.500
little bit and add my first clip.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.360
So here's the first video
clip that I'm going to add.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.780
Nice little purple flowers in here.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.840
As you can see, it's quite long,
and I don't actually

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.820
want the whole thing.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.790
Now I showed you basic
marking in and out,

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.530
how we just go in and mark
an in point and out point,

00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.200
and there's our edit.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.250
What I'm going to do now is mark the
in and out a little bit differently.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.180
I'm going to mark it by actual duration.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.690
I'm going to type in the
exact duration that I want.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.020
If I look back down here on the
timeline and I park the playhead

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.320
at that first marker there,
you'll see that the duration right now

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.670
of that whole project is four seconds
and nine frames up to that point.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.860
Now I want to add this shot on there,
but four seconds and nine

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.910
frames of this purple flower
is going to get really sleepy,

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.510
so I want to cut this in half.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.780
So I'll cut that in half.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.090
Give or take, we'll call it two
seconds and four frames.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.700
To mark two seconds and four frames,
I'm going to go up to the duration window

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:35.870
in the viewer and simply type in 2.04,
two seconds, four frames.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.160
Hit return,
and it automatically places an out

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.030
point at the appropriate location.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.020
Now let's just say
that... Let me undo that.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.020
Let's just say that I know that
I want my clip to start right there,

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.020
and then I want it to be two
seconds and four frames from there.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.020
I'll mark an in point on that position,
and then go up here and mark 2.04.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.020
2.04.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.080
Hit return,
and it marks the out point appropriately,

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.960
so now I have a two second
and four frame piece.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.390
So there's a lot of different ways to
mark your ins and outs on here to get the

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.020
exact duration of the shot that you want.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.020
So here we go.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.020
We've got this piece on here.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.020
Let's just go ahead and drop
this right onto the timeline.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.940
Now I'm dragging this onto the timeline
this time instead of using... the

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.770
canvas for a pretty good reason.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.780
The reason being the playhead is
out here in the middle of nowhere.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.290
If I drag this onto the timeline,
I can position it exactly

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.780
anywhere that I want.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.780
Let me undo that.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.750
The playhead's still over here.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.630
If I use the canvas overlays,
then it's going to position it

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:28.780
where the canvas playhead is.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.770
So that's something to keep in
mind when you're doing your edits.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.450
Drag and dropping on,
whether you decide to go to

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.100
the canvas or to the timeline,
will oftentimes just depend

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.670
simply on where your playhead is.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.870
What's the out point?

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.900
It didn't.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.530
The play had moved.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.920
Shush.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.560
He works for me.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.140
I can tell him to shush.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.300
This is Kent, by the way.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.890
He did the motion graphics,
the motion demo earlier this week.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.770
Stellar job.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.220
Alright,
so there's that first shot on there.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.540
It's two seconds and four frames long.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.740
Let's get on with things here.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.940
I'm going to open up this next shot,
this golden wheat,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.480
and I'm going to mark an
in-point and an out-point at

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.200
a very specific time code now.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.440
So somebody's given me,
the senior editor or whatever,

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.870
the director has given me time code.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.250
I want you to lock in from this point on
time to that point on time on this shot.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.000
And I have notes over here in my comments
of where I'm going to mark those,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.040
and I can see that my current
mark is supposed to be,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.420
one of the disadvantages of
having a much more narrow screen,

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.720
it can be hard to see
your notes sometimes.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:33.030
I want to put this one at 2 hours,
15 minutes, 44 seconds, and 20 frames.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.330
That means that this tape came
off of a much longer shoot.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.710
So let's just go ahead up here,
and I can, of course, type that in.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.870
So 2.15, .44, .20, hit return,
and the playhead moves to that position.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.860
It didn't mark an in or an out point,
it simply moved there.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.540
Because that top right window up there,
that top right dialog,

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.100
is showing me simply the
current position in time there,

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.400
where the playhead currently exists.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.340
And by typing in a number,
I'm telling the playhead to go there.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.400
So the playhead's there,
let's go ahead and mark an in point,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.370
and then I'll do the same
thing for the out point.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.520
I'm going to go up here and type in 2.15,
.48, .23, hit return, and that puts the

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.690
playhead where I want it,
and I'll mark the out point there.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.480
Let's go ahead and drop this
piece onto the timeline,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.680
right about like so.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.140
There we go.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.660
And then I'm going to take this
Japanese lantern shot in here,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.630
it's already pre-marked,
so let's just go ahead and drop

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.850
that onto the timeline as well.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.900
So let's see here,
I've got a couple of shots in here,

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.440
we can play it back now
to see what it looks like.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.520
You see there's a little
focus shift in there.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.470
And a focus shift in there.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.070
Those focus shifts are actually
pretty cool video events,

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.500
so I may want to line those up
with some of my audio events.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.820
So let's go ahead and take
a closer look at that.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.230
I'll start with this
Japanese lantern shot.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.400
I open this up, drag the playhead around,
and I'm going to look for

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.620
that focus shift there.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.830
And you can see it's right about here.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.120
That occurs over time.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.100
It's not a one-frame instance,
so this is going to be

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.750
a little bit sloppy,
but that's all right.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.190
So I'll just pick a couple
frames into that focus shift,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.320
so let's just say right about there.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.290
And again,
I'm going to add a marker down there.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.140
When I add the marker onto this clip,
since I had opened it from the viewer,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.620
you'll see that the marker has been
added to the clip on the timeline itself.

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.580
Now,
this marker is one of my beat changes,

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.630
right, or one of my occurrences in audio,
so what I want to do is

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.850
line up these two markers.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:20.600
Pretty easy.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.420
To do that,
I use something called the slip tool.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.750
Now, the slip tool is a fairly
interesting tool in the way it works.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.760
Let's say that you have
a shot that's this long,

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.120
and you've marked an in-point
here and an in-point here,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.290
or an out-point there.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.050
So you've got just this piece
of the clip that you're using,

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.620
and let's just say that
it's one second long.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.000
Now, the slip tool allows me to change
the content of that clip without

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.150
changing the duration of it.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.080
So, for example,
the clip is five seconds total.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.670
I've chosen a one-second piece of it.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.320
It's almost as if that
one-second piece is a window,

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.720
and I'm reaching through the window,
grabbing the entire clip,

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.330
and sliding that clip back
and forth like this to see a

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.170
different one-second piece of it.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.260
So the slip tool,
is going to simultaneously change the

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.560
in-point and the out-point without
changing the overall duration.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.480
So that means that I can go in here,
grab the slip tool, which is right here,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.680
position that on... I'll just grab
the marker itself and drag it over

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.200
like that to line up those two pieces.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.550
And now when I play this back...

00:39:17.300 --> 00:40:07.200
[Transcript missing]

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.100
Let's talk very quickly
about transitions.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.100
Let's go ahead and add
another shot on here.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.100
I've got another piece of video I'm
going to add to my timeline in here.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.100
And I'll start with a
very simple transition.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.720
A cross is all between these two clips.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.690
There's lots of different ways to
add transitions to your project.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.140
You always have something
called a default transition.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.000
The default transition,
straight out of the box,

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.030
is the cross-dissolve.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.380
Clearly one of the most common
transitions used in video and film.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.590
You can change the default
to be whatever you want,

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.500
but for now we're just going
to leave it at cross-dissolve.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.590
If I wanted to apply my
default transition between

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.660
these two edits in here,
all I have to do is control-click on it

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.000
and choose add transition cross-dissolve.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.340
If I change the default
to be something else,

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.690
for example a wipe or a page peel,
whatever, it'll show up add transition,

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.030
etc.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.060
So I go ahead and click on that and
it adds that transition in there.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.700
And since this is all in real time,
without rendering I can simply...

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.020
Play that back.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.700
Now that's a simple transition,
a simple cross-resolve.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.880
There are loads of transitions inside
of Final Cut Pro that you can work with.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.740
And if I open up my effects tab here,
which has mysteriously disappeared.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.460
There we go.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.340
There's my effects tab.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.750
Let me go ahead and put this down
here in my browser where it belongs.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.140
In my effects tab you can
see video transitions.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.980
I have loads of them to choose from.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.840
I actually have quite a few
third-party ones in here.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.720
Eureka is from third-party developers.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.980
The CGM ones are from
third-party developers.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.170
Hopefully Joe Maller is not in
the audience because I don't

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.600
think I have his filters loaded.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:38.470
It's on my other machine, I promise.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.720
But there's a lot of
third-party filters in here.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.950
And then of course our standards,
dissolves, and irises, and maps,

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.450
and so on.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.650
And if I want to experiment
with any other transition,

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.820
I don't actually have to
go in here and delete this.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.460
I can simply, let's say a wipe.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:53.080
I'll go in here and take this band wipe,
drag and drop it on, and it replaces the

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.040
existing cross-resolve,
and I play that through.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.360
Bono experiment with some more.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.100
Do something like an edge wipe,
drop that on there,

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.100
see what that looks like.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.620
wants something a bit more interesting.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.440
Let's go for a page peel in here.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.360
Drop that on there.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.360
Okay, if you ever use this in
real production work,

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.640
I guarantee you'll be fired.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:41.900
[Transcript missing]

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.140
All right, so there's my cross dissolve.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.230
Let's go back over here and move
on into some basic compositing.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.310
All righty.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:53.460
So let's see, here's the first shot that
I'm going to add in here.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.760
It's already pre-marked in here.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.140
Nice shot of the Bay Bridge.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.840
Let's just go ahead and
drop that onto the timeline.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.820
This time I'll drag and
drop it onto the canvas,

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.340
since the playhead's in the right place.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.260
Doesn't overwrite.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.900
Drops it on like so.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.590
And then I'm going to
take this next shot,

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:11.120
which is the Golden Gate Bridge again,
but obviously a different time of day.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.360
And I'm going to composite this
on top of the original one.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.490
So here's my original shot.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.160
You'll notice that the one that
I've currently opened doesn't

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.440
have any in and outs marked on it.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.440
And if you look up here,
you'll see the total

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.440
duration is five seconds.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.020
Now if I was just to take this
and drag it onto the timeline,

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.420
you'd see that it is longer
than the shot underneath.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.380
Now I can do this.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.870
I can just drag it on like that
and then drag the playhead back,

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.280
or drag the out point back to trim it up.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.190
But that's two steps.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.760
And why do something in two
steps when you can do it in one?

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:42.590
And the way you do that in one step is
by having the playhead over any shot.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.800
So for example,
this Golden Gate shot here,

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.140
I can take this shot, drag it over,
and choose superimpose.

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.680
What superimpose will do is-- position
that clip on top of the one underneath

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.400
it and trim it to fit automatically.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.800
Now if I already had an in
point marked on that clip,

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.340
it would match the in
points and then trim it.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.900
If I had an out point marked,
it would match the out points

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920
and then trim the rest.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.060
But the point is that it makes
it fit with just one step.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.820
So now I have these two shots
stacked on top of each other.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.860
At the moment,
since there's no transparency, opacity,

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.820
or anything applied to
this top shot in here,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.500
you're seeing only the top clip.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.400
And that's what I'm going to change.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.860
And this is where we get into
some basic compositing here.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.770
So let's start by changing-- changing
the in point on here to match a beat.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.600
Let's listen for a good
beat in here to cut it to.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.680
I think right there.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.680
So let's just put the
playhead right about so,

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.590
take this, and drag it over like that.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:39.860
So now I am looking at first this shot,
and then the nighttime shot.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.490
Now right now, this is no different than
having one shot after another,

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.170
because once again,
we're seeing the entirety of this clip.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.260
But let's go ahead and get into
the compositing part of this,

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.540
and you'll see how these things
are going to all come together.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.450
Basically what I want to do is I want
to see both of these shots side by side.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.550
I'm going to crop them and
reposition them on the timeline

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.880
so I'm seeing both of them.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.480
However, if I take this bottom shot right
now and I crop it and reposition it,

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.010
it's going to be cropped and
repositioned up here as well.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.680
And for this first part of it,
I want it to remain full screen.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:09.590
So to make sure that I don't
affect the entire clip,

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.740
I'm going to take something
called the razor blade tool,

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.920
go down here on the timeline,
click on there, and slice that clip.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.400
I've now cut it in half effectively,
and I can position this clip elsewhere.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.350
I can move it around,
do whatever I want to it,

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.600
and it is treated as a separate piece.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.260
You'll notice, however,
that when they're together-- OK,

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.660
I am going to kill myself on that.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.440
You'll notice that there's little red
arrows in here pointing at each other.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.030
That tells me that this
is a seamless break,

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.040
that there is unique time
code or progressive time code

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.160
between these two frames.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.760
So for example,
the last frame on that first clip

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.060
is frame 70 and then first frame
of the next one is frame 71.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.000
They go together,
and that little red marker

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:46.700
there shows me that.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.320
And I can actually go in here,
Control-click on that,

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.500
and say Join Through Edit,
and it will heal that break.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.800
It's kind of nice.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.730
Back to work here.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:57.170
Let's go ahead and take this first shot
here and do some basic compositing.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.840
Now again, I'll spend a little bit more
time on this in the advanced one.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.860
I'm going to go through
this fairly quickly here.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.380
This top shot is sitting right here.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.010
I can just drag it around in the canvas,
position it wherever I like.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:10.330
What I'm going to do is take my cropping
tool and crop this shot in a little bit.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.450
Let's just crop it like so, like so,
bring this down a little bit,

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:19.020
and that down a little bit, like that,
and position it about like that.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:19.570
There we go.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.480
And the bottom shot,
the one underneath it,

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.140
I'm going to do the same thing.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:25.330
Let's slide it over like so.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.920
cropping it a little bit.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.740
Looks like I need to crop this in.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.710
Just very quickly go in here and do this.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.580
So now I have these two shots
on the timeline side by side.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.400
So now if I play this back.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.040
I've got the two shots of the bridge.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.990
Now, that was all manual,
just clicking and dragging

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.700
to get those in there.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.230
If I want to get a little
bit more control into that,

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.020
I, of course, can.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:54.000
Let's go ahead and open
this up into the viewer.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.580
There you see the shot on its own
against a transparent background.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:00.010
If I click on the Motion tab,
you'll see all of my actual controls,

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.740
numeric controls.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.640
So, for example,
my cropping settings in here,

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.490
my basic positioning settings, and so on.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.520
So, if I wanted to go in here and
numerically change some of these,

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.240
I could,
but we'll just leave it as it is for now.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:10.870
That's close enough.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.360
So,
there's that shot all set up in there.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.900
But I do want to make
some more changes to this,

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.680
so let's go ahead and listen to it again.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.180
And there's another beat,
and I want something else

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.150
to happen on the next beat.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.980
So, let's see, what am I going to do?

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.010
Let's go ahead and
take these pieces here.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.150
I'm going to copy and paste.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.820
I pasted right where the playhead was,
so now I have a duplicate of those.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.080
And I'm going to take that
second set and nest them.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:39.010
If I go under the sequence settings here,
I can say nest items.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.980
What nesting items does is
it takes any number of clips.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.600
This can be two clips,
it can be a thousand clips,

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.100
and it collapses them
to one single piece.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.630
Now, for all intents and purposes,
looking at it on the timeline,

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.130
it's going to appear as a single clip.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.980
But the beauty of Final Cut Pro is,
since it's non-destructive,

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.100
I can double-click on that nest
and open it up to a new timeline.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.080
That new timeline shows me
everything that I had nested.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.170
I can make changes in that,
close the nest,

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:05.080
back to the original timeline,
and all the changes will be updated.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.730
So, in here,
I'll just call this the Golden Gate Nest,

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.390
hit OK, and as you can see,
it is now showing up as a single

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.160
clip on the timeline in there.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.080
If I double-click it,
it opens up into a new timeline

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.940
or a new project there,
a new sequence, excuse me,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.630
and you can see the two
clips that I nested.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.300
Let's go ahead and close that.

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.870
Back to this piece,
and I'm going to do some

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.450
work on this shot here.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.930
So, the work that I want to do
is to apply a filter to it.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.260
You know,
you haven't seen me apply filters yet,

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.220
and this is definitely getting
into more of the advanced stuff,

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.420
which I'm actually going to skip
past a lot of for this demo.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.450
But just to show you what I'm
going to do and where I'll be

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:42.700
spending time in the next demo,
if I go into my video filters here,

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.270
somewhere, you know what,
I actually have it saved off right here.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.420
There we go, replicate.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.290
I'm going to take this replicate filter,
drag and drop that onto there.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.090
I'm going to put a
replicate function in there.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.280
I'll then take that replicate
function and over time,

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.460
and I'm just going to
do this very quickly,

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.770
but again, we'll spend time on it later.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.190
Add a couple of markers on there.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.030
Increase the complexity
of that filter over time.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:13.660
So now we go the two shots, replicate it,
replicate it again.

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:15.860
So that's the more complex
compositing effect.

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.500
And again, I'll spend more time on
that in the next session.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.520
Let's know, no it shouldn't be,
let's just find it.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.590
Replicate.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.300
It lives, oh well, okay that one does.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.440
I don't think that's
the one I used though.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.040
Stylize, there you go.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.900
The CGM filters do have a more
advanced replicate filter,

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.530
but I'm pretty sure I just
used the basic one here.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.840
All righty.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:39.550
So there's that.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.520
Let's take a look at the time remap tool.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.180
This is a lot of fun.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:47.010
Did any of you guys see the quick
time intro presentation Frank Casanova

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.140
delivered on Tuesday morning?

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:50.970
Only a couple of you.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.300
Okay, good.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:52.380
So this won't be too repetitive.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.410
This next piece is what I actually
demoed in that presentation,

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.860
although I did go through it very,
very quickly there.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.560
I'll spend just a little bit more time,
not a whole lot here.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.950
Again, this is something more
for the advanced segment.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.940
But here we go.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.070
Here's that shot of the pool break.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.380
And as you can see, it's just a nice,
clean little pool break shot on there.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:15.120
I've already pre-marked exactly
the point where the cue hits.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.510
If I back up one frame,
you see it's right

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:18.480
before it's going to hit,
and there's the hit.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:19.970
So I've got that break marked.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.120
And if I scrub forward in the
timeline a little bit here,

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:27.460
Let's see here,
I need to find the position where

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.850
I want to actually mark that break.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.220
Let's go ahead and listen to this.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.190
Okay, that beat right there is where
I want to mark that break.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.570
So let's go ahead and zoom
into that a little bit.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.490
There it is right there,
and I'll position this

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.160
clip on the timeline,
and then of course just slip that back.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.140
So, oh, I forgot to mark the break.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.570
Silly me.

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:56.940
There we go.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:57.270
Is that it?

00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:58.970
There we go.

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:02.750
Mark the break, and I can mark it on
the audio clip itself,

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.550
drag this into place here,
and let's just slide those over

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:08.480
so that they line up like so.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.110
There we go.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.000
Okay, there we go.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.760
So, there's a little gap in here.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.960
I'll come back and fill that up later.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.430
What I really am concentrating now on,
though, is, of course,

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:21.150
this shot and the fact that that
break lines up with that beat.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.790
If we keep listening to the music,
and of course you saw me play this

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:27.800
in full screen in the beginning,
so you know what I'm going to do in here.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.830
But if you listen to it,
you'll hear a repeat of

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.120
that heavy beat on there.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:52:21.000

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.670
So let's go ahead and I'll put a marker,
and this time I'll just put

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.340
a marker on the timeline
itself instead of on the clip.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.050
It doesn't really matter
where I'm going to put it now.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.080
Let's put it on the timeline.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.120
And I'm going to end up
having something happen there.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.140
Now before I go in here and I start
remapping the time on this shot

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.630
to make that beat line up twice,
or make that break rather line up twice,

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.800
I want to make sure that
after the break here,

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.280
the balls do continue to go
out for a little bit before

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.270
anything funky happens to them.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:49.410
So let's just scrub back
here really quickly,

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:52.680
scrub forward a little bit, and I'll say,
no, that's far enough.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.670
I want to make sure that they
play at least to that point,

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.440
so I've just added
another keyframe there.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.770
And then if I drag forward to that next
beat and I click on here and drag back,

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.940
what I'm doing here in remapping time is
dragging that frame backwards to get that

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.850
break lined up just perfectly like that.

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.980
So now the break is hitting twice.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.580
Now what's just happened here?

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:14.600
Let's take a look at
the graph underneath.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.380
This is time versus the actual frame.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.740
And notice that if this line was to go
from here to here in a straight line,

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.240
that would be normal time.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.860
As it goes up in here, though,
you'll see that it goes down.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:25.970
Well, anything downhill is
actually moving backwards,

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:27.690
and I can also see that
by these red hash marks.

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:29.180
Red hash marks tell me
I'm moving backwards.

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:33.640
So I'm moving backwards from this
position back to the break again.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.280
So technically, that's what I wanted,
except that it doesn't look

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.750
that good because the cue ball
never goes back to the stick.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.140
So let's go ahead and go
somewhere in between this shot,

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:50.570
add one more keyframe,
and back this shot up so the

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:52.020
cue ball is just at the stick.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.740
Let's say right about there.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.360
Good enough.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.300
And play that again.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.440
Too bad, pretty easy.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.490
HD, real time.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.320
High definition,
doing that kind of timing mapping

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.560
in real time is totally unheard of.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.480
That's kind of fun.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.070
All right, moving on.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.240
How much time do I have for this?

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:14.980
Not much.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.960
All right.

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:18.330
Keep your questions coming as we go.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.360
Basically,
the way that the timing works on this,

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.740
by the way, I've got 20-odd minutes left,
about 21 minutes left.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.450
Supposed to spend about the last 10,
15 minutes doing Q&A.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.970
But if you keep your
questions coming throughout,

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.530
then I can keep going up to the end.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:33.110
If you feel like you're going
to have questions at the end,

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.460
then I'll need to stop
a little bit early.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.880
So what do you think?

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.940
Questions throughout,
or do you have questions that

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.490
you're holding to the end?

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:57.600
[Transcript missing]

00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:58.740
Doesn't that look lovely?

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.920
Sets that down on the cup.

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.220
There we go.

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:02.240
So it's a nice long shot on there.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.000
It's already marked on the timeline here.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.180
And I need to put this on a
specific spot on the timeline.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:08.670
So let me just check my
notes here and see where am

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:09.580
I supposed to put this thing.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.280
This is the great thing about Final Cut.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.290
Your little comments column gives you
all your hints that you need for a long

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.330
demo like this to see exactly what in
the world you're supposed to do next.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:22.370
All right, so... I have no idea where
I'm supposed to put this.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.520
Excuse me.

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:28.020
Excuse me while I figure out what I did
at 3 in the morning two months ago.

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.660
Oh, here we go.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:32.950
Look at that.

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.280
Put it at... There's my time code.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.020
I knew it was in there somewhere.

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.620
All right, I have a note in here of where
I want to position this in time.

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.320
This little time code readout here is
the time code of the timeline itself.

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.960
So once again,
as I drag the playhead back and forth,

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.560
you see that updating,
or I can go in here and type in a number,

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.090
for example, 3003,
to position the playhead

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:49.990
at a specific point.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.010
So there's the playhead at that point.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.420
I'm now going to take
this shot and add it.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.750
Just do an override edit.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:56.580
It adds it on there.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.820
And if I zoom into this,
you'll see that we have a gap in there.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.120
That is actually intentional.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.970
What I'm going to do is
fill that gap with a slug.

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.430
Now,
that just puts a black nothing there.

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.670
Now,
I could technically just leave it open,

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:11.250
but gaps in the timeline is
generally considered a bad

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:12.910
idea for a number of reasons.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.870
One of the most important being
that it's entirely too easy to,

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:18.980
let's just say I left that gap blank,
to take this and slide it

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.830
backwards later in time and not
realize that I had shifted it,

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.440
because there's nothing
keeping it from moving.

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.700
If I, however, have that slug in there,
it makes it a little bit

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.160
harder to move that back.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.680
A lot of my ripple and roll effects,
the kind of things that would work,

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.680
the kind of things that would move
things on the timeline will say,

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:33.270
"Yo, can't do it.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.140
There's something in the way."
So that's why I put that slug in there.

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:39.580
It also would allow me to do a transition
if I wanted to between two shots.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:40.820
And I'm not going to
do a transition here.

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:44.140
I'm actually going to use the pen
tool to simply do a quick fade to

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.920
black on the end of this shot here.

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:50.970
That pen tool is my opacity ramp,
and if I step through this,

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:54.860
you'll see here that, step through,
step through, there we go,

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:56.790
it's now fading to black over time there.

00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:59.230
So it fades to black into that slug.

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:08.160
All right, so there's this shot here
of the cappuccino cup.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.660
So I have a couple things
that I want to do in here.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:15.400
You'll notice that, well, first of all,
him putting the cup down is missing.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.120
But if you remember
from the original shot,

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:20.420
there's actually a long time between
when he picks that cup up and

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:21.860
when he sets it back down again.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.300
And frankly,
we don't want to sit there and

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:25.030
stare at the newspaper all day,
so we're going to,

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.340
it's not Sunday morning after all,
we are going to trim that shot out,

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.030
trim that gap out of there.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.270
So let's just go ahead and play this.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.980
And I've stopped it, now I'm moving,
using the arrow keys,

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.420
moving one frame at a time.

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:39.210
And I'm going to position the playhead
just where the cup exits the frame.

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:42.720
Once again, with my razor blade tool,
I'm going to go down here and cut that.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.550
Now, what I'm doing is separating the
first half from the second half.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.650
And now the next thing that I want
to do is use the slip tool again

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:52.870
to slip that shot to choose a
different in-point and out-point.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.750
Remember from my description before,
the slip tool does not change

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:57.950
the duration of the shot,
but it does allow me to change

00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.870
the in-point and out-point of it,
again, without affecting the duration.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.540
So let's go ahead and take the slip tool,
click and drag on there.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:06.600
And as I drag this,
you'll see up in the canvas that I have

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.400
two windows that popped up showing me
the new in-point and the new out-point.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.500
And so I'm going to drag this back, back,
back,

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:16.400
until I get to just before the cup comes
back into picture on the in-point there.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.360
So there's, again, the in-point.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.320
Let's drag that up right about so.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.420
And now if I play this back.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:26.300
I've created a jump cut.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.210
A jump cut means that I've
cut a piece out of it,

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.190
it's just jumping forward in time,
and there's a simple

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.010
little edit on there.

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:33.920
In fact, I think I'll slide that
forward just a tiny little bit,

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.340
make that look a little cleaner.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.340
Sure.

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.370
Question, go ahead.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.000
Ah, keyboard shortcuts.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.320
The love of keyboard shortcuts.

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.200
How am I switching between tools
so quickly was the question.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.150
There are lots of tools in here.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.760
If I hover over any one of them,
it will tell you what

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:49.620
the keyboard shortcut is.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.490
Selection tool is A.

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:53.530
So I tap the A key, boom, it grabs that.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:58.250
The slip tool is S,
so I tap the S key and it grabs that.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.860
In fact, if I hold out on here,
you'll see that the

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.600
time remap tool is SSS.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.100
So, there's keyboard shortcuts
that are combinations of keys,

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.100
so tap the S key three times.

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:11.490
You may have noticed that that just
changed to the time remapping tool.

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:13.790
So, there you go,
that's how you change that.

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.820
And once again, if you want to change any
of those keyboard shortcuts,

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:19.970
you can using the handy-dandy
customized keyboard shortcut tool.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.280
Let me just talk about this real
quick since we're in here again.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.590
Let's say that I wanted
to change that slip tool.

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:27.630
I go in here and I search for slip.

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.180
There's the slip tool.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.890
Current keyboard shortcut is S.

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.250
Let's go ahead and unlock the
keyboard and let's say that

00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:36.700
for some strange reason I want
to make it control shift F12.

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.000
Let's just drag that over here.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Drag that onto control
shift F12 and there you go.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000
It now has both S and control
shift F12 as the keyboard shortcut.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.500
Kind of handy.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.080
You want to get rid of that.

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.100
We just go poof and off it goes.

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:50.100
Alrighty then.

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:50.630
So, here we go.

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:51.150
Back to this.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.850
So, I have this shot here.

00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:00.200
You may remember from the original
playback of the final piece that I'm

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.780
going to have three graphical elements,
three frames of that cappuccino

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.180
cup coming down into play.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.240
So let's go ahead and set that up.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.070
All of the work that I'll do is going
to be based off of this shot here.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.860
If I open this shot into the viewer,
you see once again it's from

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.720
the timeline because of the
little sprocket holes there.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.750
I'm going to choose a good frame.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.840
Now I know that I want three.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.030
I want three individual frames
of this cup coming down,

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:23.640
so I need to time them intelligently.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.870
Let's just go ahead and choose
that frame as my first frame.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.610
And then under,
I believe it's under modify, there we go,

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.070
I can choose something
called make freeze frame.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.020
What make freeze frame does is
it takes that single frame of

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.620
video and it makes it a still.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.180
So I now have a still
of that frame in there.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.640
You see if I drag the timeline,
or drag the playhead,

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.680
nothing's happening in there.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.400
So there's that still.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.830
So let's go ahead and add
that still onto the timeline.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.080
So drag that onto there.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.120
Boom, like so.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.240
And it is clearly really, really long.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.630
And there's that first shot on there.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.180
So I've got that in place.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.820
I do need to shorten
that up a little bit.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.800
So let's just go in here and
trim that down a little like so.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.040
Zoom back into this
portion of the timeline.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.150
And let's see again what that looks like.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.240
Okay, so we're off to the good start.

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:14.580
I now need to get the additional
frames that I want on there.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.540
So back to this shot,
and I'm going to fly through

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:17.540
this part of it here.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.860
I'm going to go down to about there,
hit Shift N,

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:22.340
which is the keyboard shortcut,
to make that still frame,

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.020
and I'll choose Superimpose
so that it adds that still

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.270
frame above the original one.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.700
Let's go ahead and hide that.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.910
So now I have the second
still frame right there,

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:35.470
and I will then target just this track
so that the next time I do a superimpose,

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:36.980
it goes on top of this one.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.390
And let's go back to this shot,
grab the third frame,

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:44.220
let's say right there, Shift N again,
and Superimpose, edit that.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.060
So now I have all three of those
shots clearly on top of each other,

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.160
not a whole lot going on there,
so let's go ahead and space

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.830
these out a little bit so that
they're happening over time,

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:53.460
like so.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:57.970
Except it looks like I got
them in the wrong order,

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:00.020
so let's go ahead and
position that like so,

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.550
and that one down there,
and that one there,

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.890
and shorten this one here,
and lengthen that one there,

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.270
and I think now I got them right.

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:05.630
Let's see.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.360
There we go.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.200
So now they're in the right order.

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:11.050
Kind of on the beat, close enough.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.220
Let's just go ahead and trim that
to the beat a little bit better.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.800
I can see, looking at the audio on
here on the timeline,

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.460
that I'm not quite on the beat,
so let's just go ahead and

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.230
position the playhead like so,
drag those out,

01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:21.350
and that should match a little cleaner.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.060
Excellent.

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:23.410
All right.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.760
So now I need to set up the whole
graphical element part of this.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.700
Again,
something I'll spend more time on later,

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.050
but let's just fly through this.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.200
Let's see here.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:34.460
I'm going to take this shot and
do a little cropping on here.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.210
You saw me do that before,
so let's just not rearrange

01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:38.410
the entire UI here.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:39.950
Let's reset that.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.770
There we go.

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:44.460
With my crop tool,
I'm going to shrink that down.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.890
I want about a third of
the frame taken up in here,

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:48.560
like so.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.410
And if I want to get these
out of the way to hide them,

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.560
I can just do that by hitting Control-B,
and it hides those other shots.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:55.480
So now I no longer have
those other ones in the way.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.650
I'm only concentrating
on this first shot here.

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.980
So that looks pretty good.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.330
Let's go to the second one here,
make sure the playhead is over it,

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.040
and reveal it.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.170
And let's go ahead and
crop that in again.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.220
I keep doing that.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.400
This is, by the way,
a really cool feature in Final Cut Pro,

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:09.140
even though I keep
dragging it accidentally.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:12.150
The ability to grab any
seam between windows and

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:14.480
rearrange the size of your UI.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.510
Isn't that kind of handy?

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:17.620
That's kind of cool.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.260
All right.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.630
Reset that back to normal.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.690
Arrange to up.

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:24.460
There we go.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.600
All right, where was I?

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.990
I need to crop that shot down,
so let's just go ahead and

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:34.480
bring that shot in like so,
reposition it like so,

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.410
and then the third one, of course,
I need to do as well.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.900
1, 2, 3, clip, clip, like this.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.160
Ah, there we go.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.600
Drag that over.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.040
Okay, now this could be a lot cleaner,
and I will spend more time in

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.520
the next demo making it cleaner,
but this is good enough for now.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.560
So there's my three shots,
and here's how they're playing it.

01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:54.980
Not too bad, huh?

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.570
That's kind of cool.

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:56.570
On the beat.

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:01.180
So now I need to colorize those shots,
so to do that I'm going to once

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.340
again just give you a quick
little taste of how that works.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.300
Let's go ahead in here
and open up my tint tool,

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.460
which I already have saved off.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.780
Drag that onto here,
open up the tint tool,

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.560
into the filters tab,
and change the color of this.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.250
And of course using the color picker
I can make that any color that I want.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.850
Looks a little hideous there,
let's drop this opacity

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:21.450
down a little bit,
like so, so now it's kind of red.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.520
And then,
quick little advanced tip for you,

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.660
I'm going to take these
next two shots on here,

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.870
take this tint tool,
and drag it onto those so it

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.440
applies to those other ones as well.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.980
Now since the opacity level
is set for that first one,

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:34.350
it's now set for the second one,
and if I don't want to

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:38.060
change anything but the hue,
I can go in here and quickly change

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.580
the hue of these next three shots,
and I end up with that.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:55.600
[Transcript missing]

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.300
Well, they were never actually
created in the Finder.

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.000
They only exist inside of Final Cut Pro.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.500
So they actually require the
original video clip to be

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.860
present for them to access that.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.200
They're simply looking at a single
frame of video from the original clip

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.860
on the hard drive and then saying,
play just this one clip

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.030
for X amount of time.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.110
You said it.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.690
Well, you can't-- if I drag this from
here back into the timeline,

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:22.500
like so, or back into the browser,
it is now an asset in the browser.

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:27.110
However, it does not exist on the hard
drive as a separate clip.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.220
If I wanted to make it a
separate clip on the timeline,

01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:29.780
I could.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.170
I can simply go in here and say export
and use QuickTime conversion and

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.220
convert that to a TIFF or PSD file,
whatever you like.

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:38.240
So I can do that as well.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.240
All right.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.160
Great, 12 minutes left.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.400
How are we doing on questions?

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.140
Anything else while
I jump to the next one?

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:48.590
In here?

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.200
Well, when you were changing the color.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.280
OK, I was simply double-clicking
on the clips.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.780
Let's go ahead and zoom back into here.

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.090
If I double-click on this,
it brings up the viewer.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.160
There's my Video tab,
and there's my Filters tab.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.530
Now, if I double-click on the next one,
it opens the same shot in the viewer

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.980
and the same shot in the viewer again.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.820
No, there's no way to like solo.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:16.180
You can, well, when you say show it,
you mean show it in the playback

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.140
or show it on the timeline?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.770
In playback, yes, you can.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:21.830
If I go into down here, let's see here,
this is my visible clip.

01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:23.530
If I click on that, it turns it off.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.850
Or if I option click on that,
it turns everything off except that one,

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:29.770
and then I can go in and turn
on just the ones that I want.

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:31.020
There you go.

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:36.940
The question is,
can you add more transitions

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.900
to the control click?

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.700
I presume you meant keyboard shortcut.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.200
No, it only applies to the
default shortcut in there.

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:45.220
So whatever the default one is, is there.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.170
Now you can save out favorites,
and you can have a favorites

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.140
folder where your favorite ones
are more easily accessible,

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:54.260
but they are still only one
accessible at a time under

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.580
the control keyboard shortcut.

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.830
All righty, what is next?

01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:59.640
I have absolutely no idea.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.240
Let's see here.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.260
Simple Graphic Effects Part 2,
I just did that.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:06.140
Complex Adjustment for Transitions,
I'm definitely going to

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.700
skip that one for now.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.910
Let's do a hue shift over time.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.600
Let's do this one.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.980
I'm going to actually open up
a new sequence that is just a

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.090
little bit farther along in this
project since I'm skipping a step.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.440
Just pretend that you saw me
already add this shot in here.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.500
There's the shot of the nighttime bridge,
which is a nice shot,

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.010
but frankly a little
bit boring for too long.

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:29.260
What I want to do to this is add
a color effect to it and then have

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.580
that color effect change over time.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:35.010
This is one of those seemingly
really advanced features that's

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:36.820
actually just dead easy to do.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.200
Let's go ahead and do that.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:41.750
Color Correction,
there's two different color correction

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.560
tools and I will next go into
the other color correction tool,

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.300
but this time I'm going to
just choose under Effects,

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:51.040
Video Filters, Color Correction.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:51.440
Here we go.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.220
There's several of them.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.190
I'm going to choose this one.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.640
This color correction tool,
here's my little visual interface button,

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:58.490
brings up two color wheels.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.640
The first color wheel,
the one on the left, is my color balance.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.640
This applies to the entire image.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.630
Color balance for the entire image.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640
The other color corrector,
which you'll see in a minute,

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640
has three different color
wheels just for balance.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.640
One for highs, one for lows,
and one for black, whites, and mids.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.640
That's what I meant to say.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.640
This one additionally has a hue rotator.

01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:20.740
While I have only one
control over my balance,

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.640
I have an entire control
just for the hue.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.640
If I take this shot,
let's get rid of those lines on there,

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:28.640
if I take this shot and
I rotate the hue on there,

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.760
you can see how the hue of
that shot is changing right

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.640
directly there in the canvas.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.640
If I wanted to do a little
before and after on here,

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.640
I mentioned different window layouts.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.630
Let's go up here and choose
a color correction layout.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.640
The color correction
layout shows me my scopes.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.640
I'm not going to talk about those,
but it also shows me my frame viewer.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.640
Just because this screen is so small,
I'm going to do something horrible

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:48.640
and totally mess up my UI.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.640
Just so that you can see the before
and after there more clearly.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:54.210
As I rotate through the color wheel,
you can see that up here,

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:54.240
I have a little bit of a blur.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.240
You can see that updating
in real time on there.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.240
I can see immediately
my before and after.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.230
Kind of a nice little tool in there.

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:04.240
Let's go back to standard 2-up layout.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.240
I've got this shot in here.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.240
I've rotated the hue.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.240
That's great, but as I said,
I want to have this change over time.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.240
To do that, we keyframe it.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.240
Let's go ahead and drag the playhead
here to the beginning of that shot.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.240
Back to the color corrector here.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.240
I'm going to reset the hue back
to its standard default setting.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.840
Actually, I'm going to go back
to the default setting.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.310
To do that,
the easiest way to do that is simply

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.840
click on the little white ball there,
which resets it.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.780
I will mark a keyframe.

01:09:30.190 --> 01:09:33.840
Keyframes, for anybody who's not
familiar with keyframes,

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.840
the whole idea of a keyframe
is I lock in a position here,

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.840
whether it's a color, or a position,
or a crop, or a scale, or anything.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.840
Lock it here in time,
then I lock it here in time

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.230
in a different setting,
and the computer figures

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.840
out what goes in between.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.840
I've just put this keyframe at no effect.

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:49.840
Then I'll drag the playhead
to the end of this shot here.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.840
I will rotate the hue.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.340
When I do that, since I've made a change,
it automatically added a keyframe for me.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.440
It knows that I want to
put a keyframe there,

01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.440
so it just adds it.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.930
If I change my mind,
I can just go in here and delete

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:03.440
that keyframe easily enough.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.440
I've just added those two keyframes,
one with no effect,

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.440
and then one with a nearly
180 degree hue rotation.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.430
Now if I play this back,

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.740
see that he rotated over time.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.050
Kind of cool.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.880
It's a simple effect,
seemingly complex effect,

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.160
but actually very simple
to apply on there.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.010
All right,
let's move forward a little bit into

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:29.170
basic color correction or standard
color correction I should say.

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:31.450
I have on here this
great windsurfer shot,

01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:33.900
but as you can see it's a
little bit on the yellow side.

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:37.270
So let's just go ahead and add
this piece on to the timeline here.

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:39.210
It's already pre-marked for me.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:41.310
I need to mark in and outs on here.

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:42.670
And, is that right?

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:46.780
Actually I should have marked in and out,
but that's okay.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.590
There's the shot on there.

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:51.090
I want to do some color
correction on there,

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:57.100
so let's just take that shot and add
this time the three-way color corrector.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.150
The three-way color corrector gives me,
as I said before, a lot more control.

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:02.130
I have individual
controls over my blacks,

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:03.490
my mids, and my white levels.

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:06.060
Now what you're looking at
here in these three wheels is

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.820
several different things at once.

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:10.520
You're seeing the color
balance for the black,

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.370
mids, and whites, and you're seeing the
levels for the black,

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:14.920
mids, and whites.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.020
So the difference being you could
have something that is supposed

01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:20.910
to be black that's a little bit
too bright so it looks gray,

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.680
and a little bit too green
so it looks greenish gray.

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.960
So there's two things
that you need to do.

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:26.980
You need to reset the
color back to black,

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:30.270
but until you adjust the levels
it's going to actually look gray,

01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:30.900
right?

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:32.840
So there's two different
things to control in here.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.300
And that's controlled by color balance,
and then underneath that,

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.620
underneath those balance wheels
are the sliders for the levels.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.890
So I'm going to start by
adjusting the color balance.

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:47.620
The white, as we can see in the blue,
is very, very yellow, foggy, muggy, icky.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.990
So I'm just going to go in here and
grab the eyedropper tool and say that's

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:53.420
supposed to be white right there,
and it resets that to white.

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.260
And as you can see,
it's added a whole lot of blue to

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.600
the image to make it look white.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.530
I'll go back in here and do
the same thing with the blacks.

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:02.470
It looks like there should
be some black right about,

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:04.750
we'll just call this black right there.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.760
Click on that,
and I actually really missed that.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.490
So let's undo that,
zoom into it a little bit so I can get

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:13.590
And maybe that really
wasn't supposed to be black,

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.950
so let's find something
that should be black.

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:17.020
How about, that definitely looks like
a black shadow in there.

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.550
Let's go ahead and eye drop her there.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.040
There we go.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.120
That looks a little bit better.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.070
Now, again, I've changed the colors,
but it still looks a little washed out.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.700
So let's go ahead and bring
up our whites a little bit,

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.420
bring up the white levels a
little bit to brighten that up.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.020
And I'll bring my blacks
down just a touch.

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:35.380
And maybe I'll increase
the gamma ever so slightly.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:37.430
And then let's just saturate
it as well to bring some punch

01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:38.640
into those colors on there.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.030
And there's the final image.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.950
If you want to see a before and after,
let's go ahead and bring up the

01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:44.570
frame viewer for a comparison.

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.880
And there's a before and after in there.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.520
Not too bad, huh?

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.470
And that's just quick, quick click.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.130
Almost any shot can be improved with
this color correction tool without even

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:55.530
getting into the advanced settings of it.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.190
Just go reset black, reset white,
adjust levels, done.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.710
And if you've shot,
let's say you're shooting, I know,

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.410
Christmas morning or something,
and talking on the consumer level,

01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:06.210
you're in the same lighting
situation throughout the morning.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.760
You've got the same color
correction that needs to be applied.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.820
So you apply it to one clip.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.500
Figure out what to do.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.720
And then copy that same color
correction to all your clips.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.070
So it doesn't actually
have to take all day to do.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.310
All right.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:17.740
How do you copy it?

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.840
So let's just go ahead and do that.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.460
I've got another shot on here.

01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:21.470
Funny you should ask.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.260
I have another shot on here that
needs the exact same treatment,

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.920
so I'll add this onto
the timeline in here.

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.660
Let's go ahead and zoom back into those.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.530
So this one has the treatment,
this one does not.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.250
There's several ways you can do it.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.200
I can simply go to the color corrector,
grab this tool here,

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.050
and drag it onto this shot, like so.

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.460
Or there's a really cool
little thing in here,

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.860
copy one forward, or the next one over
says copy two forward.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.790
What this does is it will copy
the same effect to the next clip,

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:46.800
or skip a clip and go to the next one.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.890
Why would you want to skip a clip?

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:49.240
Think of the two-up interview.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.710
I interviewed you, I interviewed me.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.900
I've got two shots on there,
back and forth, back and forth,

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:53.710
back and forth.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.540
Well,
I need to apply one color correction to

01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:57.270
this shot and another one to this shot.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.860
This will allow me to instantly
just skip the shot of me,

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.200
for example, and apply the color
correction to the shot of you.

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.650
I just skip over leapfrogging.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.290
So there we go.

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.150
So there's a couple more things
that I do want to do in here.

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:11.100
However, they are going to be saved
for the advanced demo as well,

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:14.110
and that is going to include
titling done with Live Type,

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.960
which is included with Final Cut Pro.

01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:18.720
So I've got about three
minutes and 53 seconds left.

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:23.300
So let's see if we've got any more
questions before I skip out of here.
