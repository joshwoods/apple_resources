WEBVTT

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.190
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.730
I'm Glenn Bullich on the QuickTime team.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.460
Thank you for getting
up and getting in here.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.650
There's definitely a worm
for these early birds.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.230
I'd like to remind you also
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.200
724, QuickTime in the professional media
workflow is a tremendous session.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.670
I've been working on it quite a bit.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.680
Today's session is,
I designed it so that developers

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.350
and engineers could get a sense
of what's going on in Hollywood,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.670
in the motion picture industry,
in post-production and get a sense of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.940
sort of the bloom that's happening.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.570
Clearly, personal computers have had
significant impact in print and

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.020
then on air graphics and television,
but over the last six, seven,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.820
eight years, they've gone into motion
picture creation quite a bit.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.560
So, thank you.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.580
We're really lucky to
have these two speakers.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.190
Anton is at Technicolor and we decided
whether it was Video Guy or the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.160
Director of Technical Services there.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.590
And Scott Simmons runs a company
down in Los Angeles as well

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.820
that's doing some incredible work.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.460
So,
we'll hold questions to the end and we'll

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.290
start immediately so we can get through
this material and I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.300
Anton?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.570
Thank you.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.970
My name is Anton Linecker.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.600
I'm the Technical Operations Supervisor
at Technical or

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.440
Creative Services in Hollywood.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.350
What we're going to talk about
today is how Final Cut Pro and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.190
QuickTime are revolutionizing
the HD workflow in Hollywood.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.250
Pretty much with this seminar,
we'll go over how high definition works,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.780
what the workflow is for it,
how to work with a 2398 project.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.360
Basically,
in the motion picture industry,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.480
we're talking about high definition
as 24p or some people call it 2398.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.940
So that's what we're going to be dealing
with with this particular seminar.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.240
We're going to be talking about how to
offline cut your show and then go into

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.860
an online in Final Cut Pro and how to
think differently about high definition.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.010
What you're not going to learn in
this session is how to code anything.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.300
I'm a video guy.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.350
I'm sorry.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.930
So basically, a little bit about myself.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.380
I give seminars at
Technicolor to directors,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.700
producers, cinematographers, editors,
talking about how to shoot and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.780
edit high-definition footage for
eventual film-out purposes or

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.680
for finishing in high-definition.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.280
And in the process of
doing these seminars,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.220
inevitably,
I talk about the traditional HD workflow.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.270
And with the traditional HD workflow,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.360
People have been doing HD for a while,
and they've been limited to a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.360
certain extent by the technologies
that have been available.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.760
High-definition equipment
is very expensive.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.840
People used to use AVIDs
almost exclusively,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.760
and they set up their whole
workflow based on the film model.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.030
So that means having standard-definition
down-conversion tapes where you

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.340
have your high-definition media.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.370
Because you don't have a D5 deck
or an HD deck in your edit suite,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.390
you will have a facility
down-converted for you to a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.840
standard-definition NTSC cassette.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.640
And so in that process,
you take 2398 media,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.520
and you have to somehow
get it to 2997 NTSC.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.460
And to do that,
you actually introduce something.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.700
You have something called 3-2,
which is where you take

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.170
the fields of the video,
and you repeat them in a 3-2 pattern

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.780
so that you add the six frames that
are missing between that 24 and 30.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.780
I'm going to use the 24
and 30 interchangeably here

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.800
with the 2399 and 2997.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.340
They're in essence the same thing.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.200
So you have this 3-2 pull-down
that's added to your tapes for

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.340
the standard-definition workflow.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.330
And then they basically tape.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.960
You take those standard-definition
tapes and either work in 2997 or remove

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.820
the 3-2 and work in a 2398 workflow.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.540
And that's a couple of steps
in a workflow right there.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.300
You have EDLs, edit decision lists.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.930
We'll talk a little bit
more about that shortly.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.300
But you have to somehow get the
information from your offline cut,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.820
what you've basically been
editing for four or five months,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.750
until your feature is finished,
to the online room.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.260
The online room is where
you do your mastering,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.150
where you take that standard-definition
project and make it into a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.580
high-definition finished master
that you can air or broadcast,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.500
or you can take out to film,
whatever your project entails.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.110
And then another thing about
standard-definition down conversions is

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.440
that you have a change in aspect ratio.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.840
You have your high-definition
tapes are -- they're widescreen.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.820
They're 16 by 9.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.920
Yet when you do a down conversion
to a standard-definition tape,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.450
you're working in 4 by 3,
normal television size.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.780
And you can either work
it a couple of ways.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.740
You can do a squeezed standard-definition
tape where you have -- if you

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.320
look at it on a normal monitor,
people are tall and skinny,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.680
and then they get unsqueezed
to do a widescreen.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.610
Or you have a center extraction
where you only take the center

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.950
information and cut off the sides.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.160
Or you can do a letterbox extraction.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.770
You can do a letterbox extraction where
you shrink everything down and you have

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.000
the black on the top and the bottom.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.520
These particular methods
have ramifications for when

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.670
you go to your mastering,
which we'll talk about shortly.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.920
So, one of the things in talking and
giving these seminars and giving,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.680
you know, explaining the traditional
workflow for the 240th time,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.170
something occurred to me,
is that traditional HD workflow is hard.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.190
It's unnecessarily so.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.160
The entire idea that you have,
that you work at a different time code

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.030
rate than what your master tapes are,
that you have to change

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.970
this aspect ratio,
all these particular parts of the

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.180
workflow make it unnecessarily hard.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.370
And so, I end up having people asking me,
why do we have to work with these 2997

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.520
cassettes when our masters are 2398?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.230
Why are we dealing with 4x3 when
it's actually 16x9 that we shot?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.820
And so, Thank you.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.570
You then have the EDLs,
the Edit Decision List,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.520
that's basically 30-year-old technology.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.820
Ironically,
it's still something we use today,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.210
and a lot of facilities depend on it,
because it has been that kind

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.780
of Rosetta Stone that we use to
talk between editing products.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.250
But an EDL is just a text file.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.260
It's a text file that has timecode
values for your source tapes,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.700
timecode values for your master tape,
and little descriptions,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.780
but it's all text.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.560
Oh, actually, I can go.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.150
They're pretty limiting
because they're text files.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.500
Depending on the format that you have,
you either have two levels of

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.780
video and four levels of audio.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.860
That's an example.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.480
Some have two levels of video,
two levels of audio.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.290
The titles and effects, transitions,
they're only partially supported.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.660
You get a little note saying that you
have a dissolve there of a certain type,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.400
but you don't know if you
have an iris dissolve,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.390
if you have a fade up
or something like that.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.690
That's not actually in there.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.350
And in motion effects,
where you take your video,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.680
you blow it up slightly
or you move it around,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.360
that's not supported at all.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.740
So,
if you're working on modern equipment,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.680
modern edit systems,
you have a lot more control.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.990
You take a Final Cut Pro project,
for example, you have 99 video tracks.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.850
You have 99 audio tracks.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.750
If you take a Final Cut Pro project from
one system and take it into another,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.630
all of the special effects,
the transitions, the titles,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.850
speed changes,
all of those things come across.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.650
And so, if you're working in a
Final Cut Pro environment

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.850
and you want to make an EDL,
you actually have to hold yourself back.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.860
You have to hold yourself back.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.860
And edit in a way so that
the EDL will work nicely,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.860
that it will play nice with
whatever system you end up

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:06.860
going to for your online.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:13.200
So, basically,
you can do a lot of things with this.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.780
We were there,
I kind of came to this little

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.810
conclusion that there should be a
better way to do high definition.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.000
And so,
with the help of the QuickTime team,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.760
the Final Cut Pro team,
and hardware support

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.520
from AJA and Pinnacle,
we've come up with a different

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.710
way to do high definition.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:51.480
And I think it's actually
a better workflow.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600
And better for me means simple,
because I don't want it

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.600
to be a complicated thing.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.600
So, with this particular
workflow is used now,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.900
At Warner Brothers, and 20th Century Fox,
and where HD is really prevalent

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.930
in the independent community,
we have several independent

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.210
filmmakers that are using it,
and Showtime is going to be doing

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.620
three shows starting in about
two weeks for their next season,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.760
using this particular system.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.950
So before I go too much into
what the actual system is,

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.560
I'll tell you a little bit
about the basics of HD,

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:21.430
and why this change,
this paradigm shift is so important.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.690
With HD, pretty much everybody knows the
reason why you want to work with HD is

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.570
that you have great visual quality.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:35.160
If you have an NTSC signal,
you're working with 720x486

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.120
lines of resolution.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.800
If you're talking DigiBeta,
it's 480 if you're DV.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.330
With that,
you can go up to a high-definition

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.800
signal where you're 1920x1080.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.410
So you have drastically more pixels
and lines of resolution to work with.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.190
And the picture is so much nicer.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.710
What you also have is that
NTSC is an interlaced format.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:07.550
And so it draws a single frame
with two fields of video that's

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.670
clocked to our electrical.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800
So we got a 60 hertz electrical.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.730
And so we have 60 fields that come
together to make the 30 frames of video,

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.250
or 2997.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.940
That's kind of an old thing.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.370
So you have these interlaced
fields that come together.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.860
And so what ends up happening
is that you have the first field

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.020
draw half of the information.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.830
And then the second field comes in like a
zipper and completes the picture for you.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.690
With high-definition,
if you're talking about 24 pixels...

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:46.910
...and you have a true whole image
from top to bottom drawn at once.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.240
So it's more filmic in that regard.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.140
And so that's the whole
appeal of working in 24p HD.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.920
That quality comes at a price.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.980
The price is data rate.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.320
And so depending on what
kind of format you're doing,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:09.130
you're talking anywhere from 90 megabytes
a second to 160 megabytes a second.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.140
So that's the appeal
of working in 24p HD.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.040
But that's a lot of data to
get in and off your drives.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.900
And so this is not the type of thing
that you can do off of a firewire.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.040
It's not the type of thing that you
can do off of a single IDE drive.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.040
So at our facilities,
to get a speed like this,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.030
we use an XSERV RAID maxed out.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.950
14 drives RAIDed together
in a RAID 50 to get the data

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.950
rate fast enough to handle HD.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.040
And not only that,
you also have the fact that...

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.100
The data, since the data rate is so high,
you use up a lot of hard

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.700
drive space very quickly.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.200
And so, you take a look at this
difference right here.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.360
Here you have DV, it's rounded up,
but you have DV,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.360
which is a compressed SD signal.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.200
The native format as
it's recorded on tape.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.620
Then you have SD 10-bit.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.350
If you take a DigiBeta tape and
you do a 10-bit uncompressed,

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.880
you're working at 27 megabytes a second.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.740
So, when you do the jump to HD,
you see uncompressed

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.670
HD actually jumps quite a bit.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.560
You have 126 megabytes
a second for 1080p.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.230
And then for 1080i, 2997,
you're talking 160 megabytes a second.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.750
So,
you're chowing through hard drive space.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.440
And so,
uncompressed HD is not really very

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.340
useful or practical for offline editing.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.150
Because if you're a traditional feature,
motion picture, in Hollywood,

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.140
you'll shoot about 60 hours,
70 hours of footage.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.440
And so, at HD,
uncompressed HD data rates.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:51.630
You're talking somewhere on the
lines of 60 to 70 terabytes of

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.300
storage that you need for 5,
6 months while your editor and your

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.840
director is whittling down that
60 hours to an hour and a half.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.100
And so, that's not a practical
thing to keep track of.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:11.800
It's very expensive because you need
to buy XRARs or like large SCSI arrays.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.620
So, working in uncompressed
HD is not practical at all.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.010
So because of that,
the traditional workflow had

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.090
this down conversion mentality.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.460
Since working in uncompressed
HD isn't practical,

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.900
and there was no other
solution available before,

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.850
down conversions was the only way to go.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.140
But you have all the hang-ups
that come along with that

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.970
standard definition workflow.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.440
At Technicolor, we were thinking that we
wanted to stay digital.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.460
We didn't want to go down to a Beta SP.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.600
We didn't want to go down to a DVCam.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.990
We wanted to give them
QuickTime movies delivered on FireWire.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.540
And those QuickTime movies are
direct descendants from the HD.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.680
We'll take D5HD, HDCam,
and bring it in and transcode

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.840
it on the fly to an offline
format that the company requests.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:18.410
And that offline format can be PhotoJPG,
which is very good quality

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.940
but a very low data rate,
very nice for offline editing,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.700
particularly if you have
a lot of hours of footage.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:33.720
We can go to DV and
we'll do it a 16 by 9 DV.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:33.720
We'll go DV50 or--

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:40.170
Since about two, three months,
we can go to DVC Pro HD with the

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.420
new Final Cut Pro HD version.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.440
And so we'll talk a little bit
more about that and show why

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.460
that's an interesting workflow.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:54.010
So with the Final Cut Pro HD media,
we are giving high

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.380
quality QuickTime movies.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.990
The time code that you see in your
Final Cut Pro system corresponds

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.600
exactly to the master tapes.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.620
And so there's no difference between
time codes that you're dealing with.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.580
And so when you go do your
mastering of your movie,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.420
all the time codes line up and
it simplifies things there.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.060
You don't have to change the lists,
go through any kind of

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.800
conversion processes.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.750
Like in Cinema Tools right now,
we have something where you can go

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.440
from a 2997 list to a 2398 list.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.540
You don't need to do any of that.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.580
So the time code comes across exactly.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.230
The data rate is low.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.370
And so it can be as low as 1 50th,
the original data rate.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.880
That's in particular with the photo JPEG.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.840
And it preserves a 16 by 9 aspect ratio.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.420
What's nice about that is that you see
everything that you have on the HD tape.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.090
You can see if there's... There is...

00:16:54.650 --> 00:17:13.150
A light stand in the shot on this side,
whereas if you do a 4x3 extraction,

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.150
you might have missed that.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.150
You can time things so that they happen
properly when someone walks out of frame

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.150
that you know exactly when they leave,
whereas if you have a

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.150
4x3 center extraction,
they would seem to leave

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.150
the frame far earlier.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.340
So, the first show that we did this with
was a Warner Brothers independent

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.070
movie called Around the Bend,
which is coming out, I believe,

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:22.550
in August.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.780
And it was shot on 35mm 4-perf, negative.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:33.430
We telecineated,
meaning transferring to high definition,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.820
to HDD5.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:41.710
We picked D5 because it's a 10-bit media.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:49.800
Then we captured it on the fly from
the D5 and we went to half HD res.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.160
And so the resolution that they
were working at was greater

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.300
than standard definition.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.130
It was 960x540.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.310
It was perfect 16x9.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.240
The average data rate
was 2 megabytes a second.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.300
So we went from 126 megabytes to 2.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.530
And that two megabytes is less than DV,
by the way.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.300
It's not quite half, but it's close.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.840
They edited the whole
show on Final Cut 4.1,

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.130
so it is possible to use
this workflow in 4.1.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.650
Right now, we are on 4.5 or Final Cut HD,
so that's where we -- this

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.070
was a couple months back.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.400
And to view their footage,
they had multiple options.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.650
When they were editing in Albuquerque,
they had a DVI projector

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.390
hooked up to their edit system.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.570
And so when they looked at their footage,
they actually went through the DVI and

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.740
projected it onto a 20-foot screen.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.460
And so they actually edited the movie,
and it looked like

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.450
they were in a theater,
which is very nice.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.480
They also were able to go out
to their 23-inch cinema display,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.110
which was quite nice, high resolution.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.610
And the look is far better than
what people traditionally have

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.430
worked with in an offline situation.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.660
Traditionally,
offline media looks very blocky,

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.910
very low res.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.740
This was far better.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.500
They could see focus.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.970
They had very good color saturation.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:28.280
So, with that particular project,
we've now finished it.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.860
By the way,
we also gave them a CinemaTools database,

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.660
which has all the key code
information of their film,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.990
so that we're able to
do a key code cut list.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.630
But when we went online for
their preview screenings,

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.000
they did HD preview screenings.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.500
I don't know if many of you
are familiar with Los Angeles.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.270
There's a fantastic theater
at the Grove in the Fairfax

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.840
district of Los Angeles.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.990
They had preview screenings in HD.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.510
To do the preview screenings,
the editors gave us a

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.630
FireWire hard drive.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.390
On that FireWire hard drive,
we had a project file,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.320
which had each of their reels.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:13.520
Media managed so that all of the
excess media was clipped off.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.050
And so when we go into
digitize as high definition,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.880
we're only capturing
the stuff that we need.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:24.440
The timecode of that media was
exactly as it was on the HD tapes.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.750
So Final Cut, we edited this on a
Final Cut HD system with an AJ Kona

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.420
card at 10 bit uncompressed.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.270
So it would take in from the D5s
exactly the clips that it needed.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.200
It then also took in
all of the transitions,

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:50.460
filters, color effects, speed changes,
even titles came in perfectly.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.240
And the titles were exactly spaced
where they were or placed in

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.740
the proper space on the screen.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.800
So,
we also did the--we also had them give

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.460
us a QuickTime movie of each reel.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:09.740
And that QuickTime movie had a timecode
burn of the original D5 burned into it.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.730
And we then did a picture in
picture while we were editing it.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.210
So you see right here,
we have one screenshot from the

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:21.740
movie where you can see that we have
exactly the right spot visually.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.570
And if anything should go wrong,
which nothing did by the way,

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.980
but if there was a discrepancy,
for example, you know,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.680
sometimes we have productions where
they shoot and they have two tape ones

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.740
and they didn't name it differently.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.740
And so, maybe we put in the wrong tape
one and digitized from that.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.740
We would have seen a difference
in the top right-hand corner.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.340
And that we would have been able to see,
okay,

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.740
the timecode that we captured was right,
but perhaps the tape was wrong.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:54.740
And so, we would be able to go in
and address the problem.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:00.260
So, if we switch to-- number two,
I'll show a little example of

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.740
having the picture in picture.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:07.740
And we can have it playing so you can see
each and every edit comes in properly.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.740
This is some San Francisco footage
that the QuickTime people gave me.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.700
And so this is a really nice
way to just go through and you

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.850
know that your edit is proper.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.780
You can also go through

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.240
And just step through each shot
and just go to the edit points.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.450
And you can go back and check.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.900
So for going through and making sure
that each and every edit is correct,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.740
it's a very nice way to work.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.200
Previously, what you would have is you
would have a chase cassette.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.990
And you would have a beta SP,
very low res,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.980
that you would run in parallel
and watch on two screens to

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.100
see if everything matched up.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:59.440
This was nice because it let us go in
and we could see on the edit machine

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.080
right away if we had any problems.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.800
I'll just advance a little bit here.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.210
OK, we can go back to slides.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.190
So, in terms of a workflow,
it was very streamlined.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.150
They had to hardly ever make tapes.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.300
When they needed to make a tape,
it was quite easy.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.660
They dumped, in this case,
they dumped their media to,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.470
they bought no extra hardware,
by the way.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.360
They just used a Dual G5
and a cinema display.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.500
They had no extra hardware.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.320
They did have an XR braid,
but they had no video cards, no nothing.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.370
So, in order to make tapes,
what they did was they took

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.100
the photo JPEG sequence,
dumped it into a DV sequence.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.680
It resized automatically
as a letterbox image.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.540
They did a render.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.880
It was less than,
actually more than real-time render.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.780
And with Final Cut 4,
when you play out a 2398 sequence,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:02.260
it adds in the 3-2 again as necessary
to go out to tape when you're DV.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.480
So, they were able to make.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500
So, they were able to make cassettes
for their sound editors,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.530
for their negative cutters,
all that quite easily.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.000
So.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.880
So, in terms of this workflow,
how could we make it better?

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.920
Well, one thing that's really nice
and makes it better is with the

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.800
introduction of Final Cut Pro HD,
we have access now to DVC Pro HD.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:30.140
And DVC Pro HD is really revolutionary
in terms of how we work with HD.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:35.220
It's the same impact as
DV had four or five years ago,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.530
six years ago.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.720
Because before DV was introduced,
editing video was really hard.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:46.100
And you would always have
kind of so-so quality.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.580
You would have a little capture card
with RCA inputs and you'd capture it in,

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.600
you'd get your little QuickTime movie,
and it would be really hard to edit.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.320
And DVC Pro HD was low-res and all that.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.750
Then DV came along, you had FireWire,
you were able to plug

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.090
that into your computer,
you didn't need a video card,

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.250
anything like that.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.130
And you could edit in either iMovie,
Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Express.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.080
And that changed a lot of things.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.050
You had now something that looked
pretty much like Beta SP quality,

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.530
which had been a
professional video product.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.720
And you had easy accessibility to it.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.210
You could have it on your
internal IDE drives and all that.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.260
So, with DVC Pro HD,
you had a lot of things

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.260
that you could do.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.280
You could have it on your
internal IDE drives and all that.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:22.300
With DVC Pro HD, you had a lot of things
that you could do.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.330
You could have it on your
internal IDE drives and all that.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.100
With DVC Pro HD, you have the same thing.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:33.360
DVC Pro HD allows you to edit in true HD.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.700
This is not half-resolution HD,
it's true HD.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:42.890
But you don't have to get hit with
the uncompressed HD data rate.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:49.700
So basically, with 24p DVC Pro HD,
it runs at 5.8 megabytes a second.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.320
As compared to the uncompressed,
10-bit uncompressed, which runs at 126.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.110
So you see a massive data
rate difference between the

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.400
uncompressed and the DVC Pro HD.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.960
The reason for that is the DVC Pro HD is
the same format as the camera,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.490
the DVC Pro HD camera writes to tape.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:16.330
And the heads on the DVC Pro HD camera
can't write 126 megabytes a second.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.500
So they had to find a way to
kind of shoehorn it down to a

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.240
more manageable... data rate.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:27.600
So in their normal state,
you have this DV100,

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.150
where it's 100 megabits.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.580
That's with the small B, not the big B.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.260
Megabits.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.830
And of that,
we then only take 24 frames of it.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.080
It's set for 60.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.390
We take 24.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:48.800
So the other 36 frames get lopped off,
so we save that data rate.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:48.800
So,

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:53.210
If you take a look at the chart
of the differences between HD,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:27:01.020
you take a look at the DVC Pro HD at 24p,
it is only slightly more than DV is.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.740
Now,
for an offline format to traditionalists,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.440
having an offline format that's
5.8 megabytes is still high.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.530
Okay, that's granted because you
are going to use still quite

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.920
a bit of hard drive space.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.820
But the advantages are so great.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.750
You're now editing in complete HD res.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.580
This is not some fake HD.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.400
It's real HD.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.850
You have real-time effects.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.520
You have HD playback through a
cinema display or DVI projector.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.800
Okay,
which if you go back to the computer too.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.710
I got a little bit of black before this,
but... So what I was showing

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.550
before was actually the DVC Pro HD.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.810
Oops.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.830
And so with this format,
I'm actually playing

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.590
off of a FireWire drive.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.230
A little-a-see bus-powered drive.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.510
So, it really changes the rules for HD.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.030
You know, I didn't pull out an XRV RAID.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.680
It's just a tiny little firewire drive.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.630
And we can go back to the slides again.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.630
And if you have that ability,
you can go out with a DVI projector,

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:22.140
project it on a 20-foot screen, edit it,
perfect HD.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.270
You can lay back to the
new Panasonic 1200 deck.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.150
It has FireWire in,
and so you don't need any special cards,

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.740
video cards or anything.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.520
You literally plug a
FireWire 400 into it,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:41.560
and you can lay back your tape with the
same efficiency as you do DV currently.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.700
You can use Compressor
to make standard DVDs,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.510
which is very nice.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.910
They're pristine in quality.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.860
And the minimum system
requirement is one,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.170
PowerBook or iBook.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.420
That has a gigahertz
processor and a gig of RAM.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.350
That's it.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.820
I was editing HD flying back
from NAB at 10,000 feet on

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.080
Southwest on battery power.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200
That's really cool.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.430
And so that's the future
of HD editing now.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.760
So that's it for me.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.300
- Can everybody hear me?

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.200
I guess so.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.680
Good morning.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.710
I'm Scott Simmons.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.280
I'm the visual effects supervisor
for Live Wire Productions.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.180
We do feature films and
large format films as well.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.960
I'm just gonna poll the
audience real quick.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.920
Who has heard of the term
digital intermediate?

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.180
Okay, there's a few of you.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.690
Okay.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.290
This is Roar: Lines of the Kalahari,
which is an IMAX feature

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.020
that we worked on last year.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.510
It's been released this year
and it's doing very well.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.500
I'll give you a little
bit of a background.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.920
It's a giant screen film produced
by National Geographic with

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.500
acclaimed director Tim Liversedge.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:24.990
Tim Liversedge is a very well-known
wildlife documentary filmmaker.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.050
It was shot on location in Botswana.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.780
That's where the Kalahari is,
or part of it.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.820
Nine months of post-production.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.170
That's not all.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:40.690
The DI process, that's also music and
the final part of it.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.180
And digital work,
the DI work was done on desktop systems.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:52.990
These weren't put through very expensive,
proprietary black boxes.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.700
So what is a digital intermediate?

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:02.100
And as a producer asked me,
why isn't it called digital advanced?

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.960
Well, it's an intermediate step.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.200
It's a middle step before
you go to a release print.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:14.660
So that means that every frame of the
picture has been touched by the computer.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.120
That means things that were used
to be done optically or in the lab,

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.300
such as dissolves or
color timing and whatnot,

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.070
are all being done on the computer now.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.930
Basically, what you end up with is
a new color negative,

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.600
and that gets output to an answer print.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.400
Music gets added, obviously.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:45.280
Um, previous IMAX pictures,
everybody's heard of IMAX movies,

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.740
I'm sure, uh, were conversions.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:52.710
They weren't done, you know,
from frame one to the end credits

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.390
as a digital intermediate.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.400
They're conversions of other pictures
that are finished ahead of time.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.470
So this is pretty cool because
this is the first time that,

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:05.320
you know,
something this large has been put

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.230
through this kind of pipeline.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.890
So let's talk about the
workflow a little bit.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.000
All the film was scanned by Imagica.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:21.520
Imagica was a large format
film service bureau.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.490
Each frame was 4096 by 312 resolution.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.600
We just call it 4K.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.900
Each frame is a 10-bit Cineon log file.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.780
For those of you that
don't know what Cineon is,

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:42.130
Cineon is a format that Kodak developed
that basically describes the gamut,

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:48.230
which is the luminance,
the color range of a piece

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:53.730
of motion picture negative.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:33:08.800
[Transcript missing]

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:14.270
So you can imagine by the end,
I think for a portion of the show,

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.990
there was about three
terabytes worth of data.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.900
Get that data in,
we database the scans so

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.960
we know where they are,
where they came from, you know,

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.400
what the lengths of the shots are,
which is really important.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.400
And now here's the interesting part.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.980
So we took those really huge files,
I mean obviously you've got a throughput

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.400
issue when each frame is 50 megabytes.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.380
And what we did is convert
them to 8-bit log QuickTime.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:46.740
So there is a logarithmic
conversion of the 10-bit Cineons

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.400
to QuickTime file format.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.390
Obviously QuickTime file format gives
us the ability to scrub through images,

00:33:53.450 --> 00:34:00.400
we can output proxies,
get things reviewed fairly quickly,

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.890
as opposed to, you know,
a sequence of Cineon frames which you

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.400
can't really scrub through very easily.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.590
easily.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:14.120
Then we had to look at the frames
and clean them and de-grain them.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.540
We'll get into that a little bit better.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.830
And then we had to examine the
shots to see if the pipeline that

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.590
we're putting them through was
actually going to benefit the shots.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.310
And in all but four cases,
we were using QuickTime movies.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.900
So imagine that.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:37.360
We're going from a file format,
the QuickTime movie standard.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.000
It's traditionally used in video or
even high def to something that's much,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.720
much bigger.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:50.190
Something that's projected on a 70
by 100 foot screen without artifacts.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:35:03.760
And we're able to do that with
QuickTime because we've used

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:03.760
it for other feature films.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:03.760
We know we're used to working with it.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:03.760
We know how to get the
best results of it.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:03.760
So the QuickTime movie
is basically a very good

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:08.720
Sub-sample of those Cineon files.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.910
It's the best of those 10 bits,
now an 8-bit.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.120
After examining it,
then we had to do color

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.450
grade and effects.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.620
We'll get into that a little bit more.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.290
We'd render to FireWire drives,
and FireWire drives would get

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.010
shuttled off by hand to CFI,
which is the film recording lab,

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.420
and it's now part of Technicolor.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.390
And we'd get those back and
project them in dailies.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.710
The dailies would go to an IMAX theater.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.520
You've got to see an
IMAX movie in an IMAX theater,

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.250
see what it looks like.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.220
And before we really
got into doing takes,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.130
or final shots, we did some tests.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.830
So we would do Cineon
versus QuickTime tests,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.840
and we would compare what
we were doing to the motion

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.620
picture to the original scans.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.380
And we knew right away we
were on the right track.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.010
Everything was looking really great.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.040
So, there are a lot of challenges
from doing a giant screen picture.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.090
Obviously,
you're dealing with throughput,

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.700
you're dealing with file sizes,
you're dealing with labs, possibly,

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.020
that aren't used to
working with QuickTime.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:29.490
We have to do color grading,
and color grading is more than, you know,

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:33.090
the tint knob on your television set.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:33.090
Color grading is...

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.320
Fixing the shots,
if the shots need to be fixed,

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:44.010
and then creating a look for those shots
that makes it look warm or cool or has

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.060
something to do with telling the story,
time of day kind of things.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.690
Then we added a lot of visual effects,
believe it or not,

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.400
and we'll get into the technology too.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:59.900
So, challenges on this particular motion
picture is the director didn't know

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.700
it was going to be an IMAX feature.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.070
He thought it might be an IMAX feature.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:11.540
And then he started shooting 70mm,
which is the traditional format for IMAX.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.160
And then realized, man,
these cameras are heavy,

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.930
these cameras are loud,
and I can't go within

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.300
20 feet of the lions.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.090
with a 70 millimeter
camera because it just,

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.360
they don't like it.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.690
They will move away.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.640
So he ended up shooting, oh, 75,
80% of the motion

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.630
picture in 35 millimeter.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.720
So there's a problem right there.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.960
How do we get the 35 millimeter
to look like the 70 millimeter?

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.210
Because it's going to end up in IMAX.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.870
He also shot with different film stocks.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.790
Don't ask me what they were.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.850
He doesn't know and we
couldn't figure it out.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:54.880
So we had to kind of balance things
and make things come to a center.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.980
And then we have to conform a motion
picture that was not necessarily shot

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.560
for an IMAX screen to the IMAX specs.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.670
And then because of
the filming conditions,

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:15.900
a lot of what he did was he'd be shooting
in the middle of the day in the summer.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.240
Summer in Kalahari can
get up to 150 degrees.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.590
and he'd have his film
sitting in a cooler,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.820
basically.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.900
And he just grabbed
whatever he could get.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.900
And if he was running out of films,
the PA would go get some more film,

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.680
who knows what it was,
and stick it in there.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.900
So he's not shooting in
the best of conditions.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.840
So there's a few cases where we
had to do some restoration work

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:43.170
because the film had been damaged or,
you know, the three layers, the red,

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:48.440
green, blue layer of the emulsion was
actually starting to separate.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.220
Fortunately, that didn't happen too much.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.410
So let's get into the challenges.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:56.430
35 millimeter film is four perforations.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.840
Runs up and down through the projector.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:05.980
And let's say that's
a 35 millimeter still.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.890
"Seventy.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.980
That's a big difference.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.290
In fact, I like that a lot.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.290
Let's go back.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:21.310
That's 16 times the
area of 35 millimeter.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:27.230
That is a 50 megabyte frame
versus a 5 megabyte frame.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.240
Four to five is usually what 2K is.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.270
And we have to make...

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.560
Look like that.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.470
That's a big challenge.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.110
So how do we do something like that?

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.250
First of all,
we have to reduce the 35mm grain.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.250
We have to identify what's
grain versus texture.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:51.200
We don't want to get rid of grain and
all of a sudden the lion's coats or

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.700
the antelope's coats just disappear.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.840
They don't want it to
look like solid browns.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.700
You still have to have some texture.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.670
Then you also have to
preserve edge detail,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.700
which is the real trick.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.840
Because if you can determine
what the edges are,

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.090
then you're preserving that
resolution of the image versus

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:16.650
noise or grain in this example.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:24.900
So here's an image cut in very,
very close of one of the shots.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.740
You can see the grain.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.390
You can see the red, green, blue.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.110
And believe it or not,
this has been color

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.130
corrected as a first step.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.190
And what we had to do is, you know,
determine what the antlers are,

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.140
the antelope, clear up that sky because
we've got a solid sky.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.440
I mean,
you're really going to see the grain.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.590
And this is what we ended up with.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.440
It's a much cleaner picture.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.900
You can see edge detail.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.150
You can see that there
are antelope there.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:01.150
This one actually has been color
corrected and color graded.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.330
The difference between
color correction is,

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.200
in this example,
if we got film that was sort of blue,

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.490
because he would shoot without a
color correction filter on the camera.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.230
We have to bring it to gray.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.600
We have to create what's
called a gray balance look.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.570
That's important because now
we show it to the director

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.600
and the producers and say,
"Okay, this is what you shot.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.980
This is what you saw when you
were on location." They say,

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.570
"Yes, it is." Then you color
grade it as a second step.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.120
Color grading it is basically, "Well,
we want it to help you tell the

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.590
story." It doesn't look like Mutual
of Omaha's Wild Kingdom necessarily.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.120
We want it to look like a feature film
so everything is sweetened a little bit.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.400
Conforming is another issue.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.330
This is what's called a sacred master.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:55.550
A sacred master basically says,
"This is the area you've got

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.750
to play with in your film."

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.570
So if you look at this,
this is a field chart.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.340
There's two things.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:07.750
That area in the red is credit safe.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:11.220
So if you imagine going to a movie,
like Next Door,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.900
and you watch the credits,
they're going up and down or dissolving,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.760
they're filling the frame.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.640
You can't do that with an IMAX picture.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:23.450
Because where that plus sign is,
is the viewing center of viewing.

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.430
It's not the middle,
it's the center of viewing.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.620
So the center of viewing
in an IMAX picture is about

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.630
a third of the way up.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.580
So that's where your eyes are looking.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.310
And you've got all this extra
space over your head that just

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.080
makes you feel like you're there.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.700
It just sort of surrounds you.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.220
But where the audience is looking,
it's about a third of the way up.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.340
So credits obviously can't
go all the way to the top.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.660
So we're looking for that
sweet spot in the center.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.750
Like I said before,
he's not necessarily shooting for that.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.710
He's not necessarily framing
all of the lions or whatever the

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.890
action is for that sweet spot.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:05.820
So, the center of interest in a picture,
on an iMac or large format picture is

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.590
not necessarily the center of the frame.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.320
So what do we do?

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:15.210
Here's a couple of examples where on the
left we have the guinea hens and their

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:19.340
focus spot is actually about halfway up.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:24.720
And on this shot, this helicopter shot,
obviously the center of

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.270
interest is way up at the top.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.720
So what do we do?

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:30.730
We switch to demo.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:43.830
So for the guineas,
we have to lower the shot in the frame,

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.100
and here's where the effects come in.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.040
We create a digital extension.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.310
We have to do that a lot.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.100
Same thing for the helicopter shot.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:01.860
In this case,
we're completely replacing the sky.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.100
Everything has to be tracked.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:11.800
So it becomes not just a reframing
issue or a composition issue,

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.400
it becomes a full-blown effect.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:29.050
Restoration,
we have a lot of dirt and scratches.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.050
I think you can see a
little bit up there.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.050
I'll go ahead and play the movie.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.200
This is a pretty good example.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.100
Again, this is just a little part of it,
a little part of that image.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.360
This is much, much bigger.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.440
It's probably eight times larger than
the part that I'm showing you right now.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.040
Like I said, you have dust and scratches.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.950
You've got the emulsion
starting to separate.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.030
We have to correct all of that.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.620
This is part of the digital
intermediate process.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.880
We're just not coloring it.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.180
We're just not correcting it.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.210
We're making the frames as
perfect as possible because

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.220
that's what you're going to see.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.090
It's not happening in any other place.

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:08.790
It's happening in the computers and it's
happening to fix these kinds of things.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.750
Just for fun,
when we had the wrap party for the crew,

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.950
I had a little contest to see
who could figure out how many

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.870
pieces of dirt got cleaned.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.020
We had a little gift
bag of stuff like that.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:31.580
The software actually keeps track of
that because I'm sort of masochistic.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.420
I wanted to know how much pieces
of dirt that we cleaned up.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.740
We cleaned up 583,000 pieces of dirt.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:46.080
Some of that, let's say 100,000,
was removed procedurally.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.470
Procedurally basically means
we had a computer analyze

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.360
the image and sort of fix it.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.060
It's not that simple,
but that's what we did.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.140
The rest of it had to be done by hand.

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:03.150
Over 400,000 pieces of dirt
had to be done by hand.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.560
And here's the reason for it.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.840
Why isn't there software?

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.980
Yeah, there's some software,
but it doesn't work

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.570
like the human eye does.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.100
It'll make mistakes.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.360
And if you make a mistake at 4K,
it's pretty obvious that your mistakes

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.280
are getting magnified pretty largely.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.350
And there's also dust in the shot.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:27.540
There's also heat waves, there's mirages,
there's distortions going on.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.530
So you have to use your eye
to get rid of that stuff.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.730
And that was the major
production part for us.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.080
Can we go back to the other?

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.200
Color grading.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:51.770
Okay.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.350
Part of color grading,
I put stabilizing in there because

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:55.650
I'm not sure where else to put it.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.860
He's shooting on location
in difficult situations.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.150
Not every time is the camera locked
down and also you've got heat

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.240
distortion going on in the image.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.250
So the image is moving around a lot.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.010
If he's flying in a helicopter,
the camera's strapped

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.880
underneath it with bungee cords.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.110
Sometimes the bungee cords aren't
tight enough and you get some

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:16.900
jitter going on in the frame.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.520
So that has to be stabilized
because you want to want the shots

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.720
to look as perfect as possible.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.100
Color correcting, like I said,
we're balancing from gray first

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.400
and then we're creating a look.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.400
Okay, here's a good example.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.470
This is a frame from Original Scan.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:44.250
It's a little hard to see,
but it is dark, it is green, it is muddy,

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:49.030
and this is what we did to it.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.140
So we gray balanced it,
created a color look for it,

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.940
and now you can tell it's
a lioness and her cub.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:02.980
We also output to film quite a lot.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.740
We had National Geographic come
in to see what we were doing,

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.480
and they saw the before
and afters and just gasped.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.820
They just thought,
you can't salvage this.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.580
There's no way you could do it.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.600
Well, we did.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.490
The reason we did is we started
off with the 10-bit Cineons,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.280
full range of the film negative,
and we selected the best part

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.800
of that to work in QuickTime.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:31.070
We also created color boards,
or color panels.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.870
This is basically what you have to
do when you're working in a sequence.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.860
You have to create a color look
that will work from shot to shot.

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.920
You can't work on a single shot and
say it looks good and the client says

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.850
yeah and you're signed off on it,
it doesn't work like that.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.040
Every shot has to cut to one another.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.980
In this case,
we're trying to preserve the color

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:55.830
of the animals more so than the sky.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.060
The sky is pretty close,
but if you turn around and you

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.880
look at the sky behind you,
it's just going to be a different color.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.500
What we have to nail down is
what the texture and color

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.590
of the animals looks like.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.130
Then on top of that,
we do visual effects, shot enhancements.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.200
You saw a little bit of that
before where you just have to

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.820
create extensions or whatnot.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.700
And we also did some all CG-ish shots.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:27.860
The first shot of the movie,
which was a little disconcerting to us,

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.060
was a complete CG shot of a star field.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.100
Star fields are really hard to do.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:35.190
I mean, you have the landscape
and the stars above it,

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.160
and we're tilting down
to the Southern Cross.

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:41.400
Stars are hard to do.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.260
It's really dark.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.240
If you're going to see
compression at all,

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.090
you would see it in something like that.

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.820
But we worked it out
so you don't see that.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:58.980
We did a lot of CG maps,
and we have a cosmic zoom.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.360
Let's go back to demo, please.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.400
Here's another reason you have
why digital media is great.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.700
This is an entire sequence,
but it's one shot

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.090
dissolving into the next.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.630
So all the color grading has to
work from one shot to the next.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.640
And here's our cosmic zoom.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.510
Again, center of interest is
down towards the middle.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.800
This looks amazing on a 100-foot screen.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:36.770
It feels like you're
flying in for a landing.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.250
And speaking of large,
we had to get satellite imagery

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.410
for that part of the sequence,
and we ended up with a texture

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:54.860
map that was 60,000 pixels wide.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.490
That's the Okavango.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:05.240
We're sort of orienting ourselves.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:07.450
Look at the nice sky.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.260
Look at that nice sky.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.530
And that sky is all digital.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:26.640
We do a matte dissolve into another
portion of the satellite image.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:39.140
And we fly past the salt pans and
land right at the watering hole.

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:39.140
Go back to the slides, please.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.190
Here's another special effect.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.700
If you notice, the line is facing right.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.680
Don't know why.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:53.250
The line's supposed to be facing left.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.240
The line wasn't cooperating.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:56.100
Flop the image.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.100
Life's going to be good.

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.600
But this is right after the
opening shot of the stars.

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.520
So this should be dawn,
but it's not dawn.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.910
It should be dawn.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:08.750
So let's combine it with
something like that.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.600
Let's put them both together.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.390
Let's go back to demo.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.830
That's a cool shot.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.600
I like that one.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:38.500
So completely, again,
this is part of color grading.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.380
It's an effect,
but it's also part of color grading.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.240
It's also part of the
digital intermediate process.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.620
You've got a director that says,
you know,

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:48.300
I want a shot that I couldn't get,
you know, and so we created it.

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.680
Can I just go back to slides, please?

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.000
So let's talk about
technology a little bit.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.620
Some surprising things we learned
on this show in particular.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.220
We've done IMAX feature work before.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.840
We've even done stereo work before.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.220
So we weren't really surprised
about that QuickTime could hold up.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.150
I mean,
we've done a slit-scan stereo graphic,

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:21.000
and if you're going to see compression,
you're going to see the 8-byte grid that

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.920
you see in typical QuickTime compression.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.280
You're going to see it
in something like that,

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.290
or you're going to see it in
something like the Starfield shot.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.120
But we were surprised
by some simple things.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:36.230
The Apple 17-inch studio displays were
the best monitors we've ever used.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.900
It blew us away.

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:39.840
Don't know why.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.480
You're better than the
cinema displays we're using.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:43.190
Don't know why.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:47.200
But what we saw on those
little 17-inch displays,

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.290
we saw on the iMac screens.

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:52.830
We're looking at a 17-inch display,
and they're looking at

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.660
a 70-foot tall screen,
and they matched.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.020
You know, we obviously,
we did a lookup table,

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:04.320
hardware lookup table for the monitors
so that they all stayed consistent,

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:09.410
and also kudos to CFI for making
things look like they're supposed to,

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.460
and our film outputs were pretty good.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:16.120
Firewire drives, absolutely a necessity.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.930
We were rendering to the firewire
drives and checking them,

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:22.190
and then boom, they go out the door,
go to the lab, they get recorded,

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.460
they get filmed out.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:27.820
So these large firewire
drives were just a godsend,

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:31.450
because this show was about throughput.

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:33.460
Dual-proc machines.

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:36.440
Software, After Effects,
believe it or not.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.450
Combustion.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.100
There were two other
companies that worked on this,

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.960
Imagica and Sassoon Film Design.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.400
Imagica used some shake.

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.180
And procedural methods.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.460
And I can't stress enough how
important procedural methods are.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.260
Because procedural methods make
you use the tools that you need.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:51.260
And I can't stress enough how
important procedural methods are.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:51.260
Because procedural methods make
you use the tools that you need.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.200
And I can't stress enough how
important procedural methods are.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.250
Because procedural methods make
you use the tools that you need.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.260
that you have and come
up with a new solution.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:01.740
Procedural methods are what we use to
define what is grain versus texture.

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.930
What is an edge?

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.260
What is an antler?

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.530
Stuff like that.

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.900
And we have to work outside the tools.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.760
You're not just using one tool.

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:11.720
You're not just using one layer.

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.710
You're not just using one composition.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:19.080
You're using several that are analyzing,
doing different things to create a whole.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.320
Now,
can software be written that does this?

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.120
Absolutely.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.150
I'd love to see it.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.590
I'd rather, you know,
I'd love to see a plug-in

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.640
that would do all these steps.

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.070
Define the grain.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.710
Define the edge detail.

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.170
That's, that kind of thing.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:38.310
But there's always going to be a place
where you get to a shot and you see,

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:41.640
you know, like I said before,
the emulsion starting to separate.

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.460
You know, those are pretty esoteric and
bizarre things and you have to use

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.970
a procedural method to correct them.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:53.080
Okay, the expense.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:55.180
Obviously, we're on the desktop.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:56:01.840
The expense wasn't so horrendous,
and that makes it pretty

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.760
attractive to producers.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:05.760
If

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:13.180
client wanted us to do real-time 4K
color grading digital intermediate work.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.890
You're talking about,
with the Cineon files,

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:19.980
you're talking about
terabytes of throughput.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.180
Is it possible?

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.540
Yeah, actually,
a couple systems have actually been

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:25.850
made that have been able to do that.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:31.380
The cost for the hardware is
around $300,000 or $400,000.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.380
Software's on top of that.

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:37.090
You start getting a very
big bill very quickly.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.150
Input/output is critical,
so I have to figure out how

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:46.030
to move stuff around and work
with different file formats.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.300
And then, as I mentioned before,
understanding the medium.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.230
If you work smart, you can work faster.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.300
You're not just dealing with a problem.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:57:00.300
And part of the digital intermediate
issue is who is owning it.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.490
Because before, it was different steps.

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:06.130
It's like labs doing this part,
color timers doing this part,

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:09.400
DP's doing this part,
DP's used to using traditional

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.300
chemical methodology.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.800
And who's really owning it?

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.300
And that's the big question right now,
because right now,

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.500
DI's just a big shotgun.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:22.250
We've got colorists who do
nothing but color the film,

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:26.670
create a color look that
don't stabilize the shot,

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.600
that don't dustbust, that could.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.600
But they're real-time.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:32.590
Two-camera.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.600
They're in the UK, usually.

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.600
Playback and color correction
while the client's there.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.590
The client's not going to sit
there and watch you dustbust.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.100
It's just not going to happen.

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.100
But that's part of it.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:47.780
So, the current technology that's out
there in million-dollar suites is

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:53.330
only doing a half of what we had to
do to create a digital intermediate.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:00.160
Okay, so future, what we need,
obviously large files

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:01.900
require a large pipeline.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:08.140
You know, 4K is becoming a new standard
in digital effects work.

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:14.090
Spider-Man was, all the effects shots
were done with 4K plates,

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.330
not 2Ks.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.660
Right now,
the architecture of file throughput

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.170
is a threaded architecture.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:29.800
That means if you're using Cineon scans,
if you want to stay with the full range,

00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:33.200
dynamic range of that film,
you're working with Cineon scans.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.510
They are a sequence of frames.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:38.190
They are not digital video format.

00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:40.130
They are not QuickTime.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:43.680
I would like to see
QuickTime become threaded,

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:49.200
which is basically why a
sequence of frames is necessary.

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:54.120
Because a sequence of frames can be
addressed over the network in parallel.

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.130
The more power you throw at it,
the more real-time effects,

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:01.150
the more throughput that you're getting.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.190
Possibly the new hardware.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.200
The new high-def standard that
is merging with QuickTime.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.490
Seems like it can skip
around quite a bit.

00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:13.200
I would love to see it used in
production in a parallel pipeline.

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:20.100
So you really are getting low data
rates consumption with high throughput.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.180
You can get multiple effects,
color gradings applied to those things.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:28.500
That would be fantastic.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:46.510
Standards 3D Color Lookup Tables.

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.510
What's a 3D Color Lookup Table?

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.510
A Color Lookup Table basically says,
"Alright,

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.510
this is the amount of colors you can use
to display an image." There's software,

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.510
there's hardware lookup tables.

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.510
A 3D Color Lookup Table

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:49.800
is saying that all the
values are interrelated,

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.030
and that's how film works.

00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:55.360
I mean, getting it to a high-depth
finishing station is great,

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.320
but if you really want to work with
the data the way that film works,

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.730
you have to work with a 3D lookup table.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:05.980
And it just means the red, green,
blue affect each other.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.900
If you affect the brightness of red,
you're

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:12.990
In a film 3D lookup table,
something's happening to

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:18.100
green and blue because that's
how the film emulsion works.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.090
Kodak has created a 3D
lookup table fairly recently,

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.300
but it's only available for Kodak stocks.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:33.510
So there's no 3D lookup table that
I know of for Fuji or other film stocks.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.840
Also, because it's new,
it's not a standard.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.910
It's being adopted for a lot
of color grading systems yet.

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:45.610
And then you're faced with the
arcane chemical technology,

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.040
which is how I started.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.800
I started off in an optical lab.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:53.540
I know about optical printers and
keeping the right temperature of

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.340
film suits and all that stuff.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:01:02.990
And there are no direct correlations
between traditional color correcting

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:07.460
methods and film to digital.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.170
Now, some software will say
we have printer lights,

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.570
we can match what's going on in the lab.

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:17.150
That's not necessarily true because
traditional color correction,

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:21.600
if you say you're adding 10 points
of red or adding some red to it,

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.800
you're not cranking the red.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.860
That's not how film works.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.220
But in most,
the software that's available now,

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:33.270
you say, well,
the DP wants you to add red.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.480
Well, you add red to it.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.540
That's not correct.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.860
That's not how film works.

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.560
You're overdriving the image.

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.830
You know, traditionally in a DP,
you'll say, I want more red,

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.460
I want you to add some neutral density,
I want you to do this or that,

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.880
and you can add a list of
criteria for his recipe,

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.030
and still the film will hold up,
it'll still look good.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.420
But digitally,
you can seriously overdrive the image.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:02.120
If the look that's being
required is pretty severe,

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.020
you can overdrive the image.

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:07.440
There's a lot of things
that need to be correlated.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.680
Film bias, you know, how do we do that?

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.480
There's many issues.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.830
So there are a few new technologies as
I wrap up here that are desktop systems.

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:25.040
They're not black boxes
that just do colorist work.

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:27.270
Lustre by Discrete,
it's kind of a black box.

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.540
It's proprietary.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.410
It's a licensed technology.

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:33.320
They don't, you know,
do they really own it?

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:38.270
Only runs on Windows XP.

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:43.140
Luster is sort of an all-in-one
color grading system.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.170
You do your color grading
and you get the results.

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:48.280
So you twist the dials,
you can get a result.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.420
You can't get in backwards and
see what the dials were set to.

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:59.840
Final Touch is a new program,
it's a couple years old, runs on Mac G5s,

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:03.020
incredible throughput.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.840
They're adding more and more tools to it.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.300
It renders in floating.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:20.910
The Big Key of QuickTime is the
ability to create a script for

01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:28.400
what its color correction just did.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.850
Instanciably,
that's being used to send out to other

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:33.900
speed-grade systems so they can go,
well, I can help you render,

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.050
I can help you make
the color corrections.

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.540
But I see as a real advantage
once color standards are set,

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:45.840
if scripts are written from these
color grading applications that

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.960
can be sent to other applications
that do more effects kind of work,

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.080
such as Shake,
then that would be fantastic.

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:59.360
So if you can,
that way the effects people or the

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.160
DP can decide where does this happen.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.630
Do we do effects first and
then color grade or vice versa?

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.400
Which is really important.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:10.640
Because if you're doing an effect
shot on something that color graded

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.390
and made it really spooky and dark,
well, you know, you got what you got.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.390
You don't necessarily have
tracking points anymore

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.390
because the image is too dark.

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:23.400
And I think that's it for me.
