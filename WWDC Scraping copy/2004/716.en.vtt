WEBVTT

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.280
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.360
I'm Glenn Bullich on the
QuickTime product marketing team.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880
Welcome to this session.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.430
Hopefully we can fight the post-

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.390
This session is a little bit new for us,
and I hope it works out.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.450
If you want to feedback either directly
to me by email or in the feedback

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.840
forum or however you'd like to do that,
there have been some online

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.870
campaigns to support product sales,
to support charities,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.360
to support all kinds of things.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.940
Maybe notably something like the
QuickTime movie trailer theater

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.230
and things like that really are
promotional assets for driving business.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.380
And we're lucky enough today
to have a speaker who was very,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.590
very involved in the delivery of
probably the most important and one

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.670
of the most entertaining campaigns
that we've seen on the web to date.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.700
So without further ado,
I will introduce Chris Stocksmith

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.820
with Fallon Minneapolis,
and I'll let him tell that story.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.400
Thanks.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.300
Hello, can you hear me?

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.430
Hi.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.460
My name is Chris Stocksmith and
I work for Fallon Worldwide.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.300
And we are an advertising agency.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
Our home offices are in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.880
And we have offices in New York, London,
Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, and Tokyo.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.280
And some of our clients
include United Airlines,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.160
Time Magazine, Citibank, Virgin Mobile,
and two projects I'll be

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.870
talking to you about today,
BMW and and the islands of the Bahamas.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.580
This session is called QuickTime Sells.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.610
I'm not necessarily
going to be going through

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.290
How to sell QuickTime to your clients.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.980
Rather,
I'm going to be doing a couple case

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.800
studies of two projects that we did that,
you know,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.300
I like to think were pretty successful.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.140
And hopefully they'll,
somewhere along the line,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.880
it'll help you think about
things that you can do for

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.330
your clients with QuickTime.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.580
The two case studies will be BMW Films
that we did for BMW North America.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.770
I imagine most of you
know about that one.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.780
And the other one is
called the Island Hop Tour,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.410
and it was for the
Islands of the Bahamas,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.090
for the Ministry of Tourism,
for the actual nation of the Bahamas.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.710
And I'll kind of go through why we
did what we did and how we did it.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.040
Okay, so first a little background.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.440
BMW at the time in 2000,
traditional car advertising

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.220
had changed quite a bit.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.010
It wasn't quite as
effective as it had been.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.140
The return on investment was
down a bit for a lot of reasons,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.930
and I'll go through those in a second.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.780
And another thing for BMW that year,
they had no significant product

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.630
introductions that year,
and their whole ultimate driving machine

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.780
campaign was kind of being mimicked
at the time by their competitors.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.710
So, um...

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.890
We took a look at our prospective
buyers and what was unique about them,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.740
did some studies.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.760
We found that 65% of
them were online a lot.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.170
45% of them did research for
their buying options online,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.000
so that was all good news for us.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.930
And they were a younger
demographic than in the whole,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.220
which is really important because you
want to leave a positive impression

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.890
about your product when people are young.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.480
Get them to buy early,
build up brand loyalty, all of that.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.940
A good portion of them
had broadband access,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.100
most at work and some people at home.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.550
This is 2000, so step back in time a bit.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.080
They were really receptive
to TiVo and DVRs,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.220
which is another important aspect
when we're talking about this.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.960
They were watching less TV,
and when they were watching TV,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.430
they weren't watching network sitcoms.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.670
So we had to find a different way
to get to our prospective buyers.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.190
And they were avoiding ads,
and that's one of the nicest things

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.310
about TiVo is that you can avoid ads.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200
So we had to find different
ways to get to them.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.420
So our goals were,
with these prospective buyers,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.230
to increase awareness,
increase familiarity,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.710
give them a positive opinion, you know,
so they have a positive

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.560
opinion about BMW,
and kind of get the whole

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.430
BMW exhilaration thing through to them.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.340
I don't know if many of
you have driven a BMW.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.880
I own a Mini Cooper S,
which is manufactured by BMW.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.380
And a little side note,
it really is quite a driving experience.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.300
When we first got the car,
my wife is from, I live in Minneapolis,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.460
we live in Minneapolis.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.400
My wife is from Littleton, Colorado.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.320
And the first year with the car,
we wanted to drive it out

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.180
for Thanksgiving and show
it off and all of that.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.960
And we're driving across Nebraska,
and it's kind of drizzling out that day.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.430
And it was 32 degrees, right at freezing.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.950
But the first year,
we were driving across Nebraska,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.420
and it was kind of
drizzling out that day.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.420
And it was 32 degrees, right at freezing.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.420
But the first year,
we were driving across Nebraska,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.420
and it was kind of
drizzling out that day.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.480
And it was kind of
drizzling out that day.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.680
And the road was
insulated from the ground,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.490
so it wasn't freezing up at all.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.820
And when you drive a BMW or a Mini,
you can really, it's a real tactile feel.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.390
You can feel the texture
of the road in the car.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.840
You know, the way I'd almost describe
it is kind of like,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.110
you know, you're on gravel,
it's kind of a , you know,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.910
you're on concrete, , you know,
you can feel it.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.130
You can actually feel the
texture of the road in the

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.760
steering wheel and in the pedals.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.870
And so we're driving across Nebraska,
and we hit these overpasses that

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.710
have no insulation underneath them.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.150
you know, the air was blowing under them,
and all of a sudden it'd be like...

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.410
and I knew right away
that I was driving on ice.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.710
I think it's the best safety feature
of BMWs and Minis that most people

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.760
don't get is that when you're
driving on ice you can feel the road.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.820
That kind of exhilaration,
that kind of driving experience

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.300
we wanted to help get across
to our prospective buyers.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.800
I believe it was Goldeneye.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.940
We had a Z3 prominently
placed in the film Goldeneye,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.400
James Bond film.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.000
And we got really good
response from that.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.990
You know, there's a lot of good
driving scenes with it,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.320
and people really responded to that.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.900
So that was another thing we were
thinking about when we were planning

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.780
what we were going to do for BMW.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.820
The prospective buyers weren't
intimidated by the internet.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.000
They weren't necessarily
techies like you and I,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
but they weren't intimidated by it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.990
They were willing to download a plug-in.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.250
They were willing to get new
experiences through the web because

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.040
they were using it as entertainment.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.150
So the big idea, what we called it,
it was no one,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.720
we couldn't say BMW's new project.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.640
We couldn't even say BMW the big idea.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.750
It was just the big idea,
and everybody knew, oh, the big idea,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.830
you know, gotcha.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.560
The idea was to create a series
of short films and to make

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.760
them only available online,
or initially only available online.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.520
And a really interesting thing about
this is that in order to do it,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.910
we needed to flip the
traditional advertising model.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.500
Traditional advertising,
you spend 10% of your budget on

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.290
your production of your ads and
your print media and all of that.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.880
And then 90% of it is spent on media,
paying the networks and the

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.740
magazines and whoever to,
you know, to.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.830
So you're gonna push your message
out to who you wanna sell to.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.160
With the big idea, the BMW film thing,
we took our budget and we were

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.820
gonna spend 90% on production
and only 10% on the media.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.950
So our goal was to create something
really interesting that people

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.330
would go and seek out online.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:01.070
And being that we had a big budget,
we could go and we could get first class,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.780
you know, A-list directors.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.510
So the hire was created.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.200
And the talent that we
were able to recruit.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.960
Now, the whole idea about it,
let me step back a bit.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.410
The whole idea behind this was that
the car wouldn't necessarily be a

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.490
product placement as much as a car
would be a character in the film.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.040
So a lot of these films
have chase scenes,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.970
you know,
the cars are featured prominently,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.240
but the cars didn't necessarily,
you know, we didn't have to show the

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.390
new glove compartment or,
you know, there was no list from BMW that

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.680
you have to show this thing,
this thing, this thing.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.020
It's just that the cars needed
to be a character in the film.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.280
Otherwise, we could be as creative
as we wanted to be,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.680
you know, kind of carte blanche on that.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.060
So the first person we
approached was David Fincher.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.480
Did Fight Club and Seven and a
very technologically gifted man.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.580
And he was going to,
we were approaching him to originally

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.990
be a director of one of the films,
but he really grabbed onto it

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.510
and he ended up being executive
producer on the whole series.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.690
Other directors, John Frankenheimer,
he did the Manchurian Candidate,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.200
the original one,
they're making a new one now.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.060
And Ronan,
which is a Robert De Niro film.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.800
It's got a great chase scene in it.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.900
And actually,
we used that chase scene when we

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.700
were pitching the whole idea to BMW.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.570
So he was kind of a no-brainer.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:30.240
And then Ang Lee, just Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon was really hot at the time.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:37.600
And then we, to add some authenticity or,
we had some foreign directors,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.990
Juan Carwai and Alejandro Gonzalez,
and I always say it wrong, Inarrito,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.980
Inarrato, sorry.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:50.160
But a couple foreign directors, you know,
young up and coming and, you know,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:10:05.000
[Transcript missing]

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.740
The first thing you notice physically
about this lady is her eyes.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.300
"Bright blue eyes.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.420
It's rare to actually see those eyes
because they're usually covered up,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.290
but when you do, it's worth it."

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.550
The next thing you notice is her hands.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.820
Strong, powerful, yet feminine hands.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.620
But the real heart stopper
that this woman has in her

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.070
galaxy of talents is her voice.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.620
Her billion-dollar voice.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.510
She's a legend in her lifetime.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.900
This is the chief of Giddy Heights,
few have he caught.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.000
She's unrivaled in her world.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:32.400
[Transcript missing]

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.560
Glenn, a manager for seven years.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.170
No backbone on the man.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.350
Not a problem, sweetheart.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.500
We will work it out, okay?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.200
But he gets paid enough not to have one.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.090
Coffee!

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.050
I want my coffee!

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.370
It better not be cold.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:50.800
Piping.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.420
Piping hot.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.890
I'm so over black.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.830
This'll do.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.100
Take me to the venue.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.930
I'm sorry, I'm booked for someone else.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.200
Yeah, right.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.100
Just take me to the venue.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.700
What venue?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.500
I am gracing this armpit
of a town for one night.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.740
If you also think I'm gonna know
the name of the venue in El Armpito,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.400
you're sadly mistaken.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.190
You are the driver.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.690
You are supposed to know.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.110
We're going to the palace.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:41.480
We?

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.560
Listen,
my bone-from-the-neck-up driver friend.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.710
I suggest you put your foot down,
and next time do your homework.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.640
Okay.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.620
Fine.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.720
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.280
I'm coming with you, ma'am.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.340
Then get on the roof and hold on tight.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.220
Out!

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.000
"Follow behind." "Good idea, tough guy.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.990
What are you waiting for?

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.340
Let's get out of here
before he gets in the car.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:17.000
I don't want him following
me!" "Okay." "Don't lose them."

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.370
Why are we going so slow?

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.380
Excuse me?

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.990
You deaf as well as stupid.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.780
I said why are we going so slow?

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.340
People are waiting for me.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.540
Well, Mom,
I wouldn't like to put you in any danger.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.210
Don't man me, smarty pants.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.900
The shame you're driving
isn't as smart as your mouth.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.470
I thought I told you I don't
want that car following me.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.230
Huh?

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.940
So smart as to answer that,
aren't you smarty pants?

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.590
Would you excuse me for a second?

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600
Hello.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.600
Hey, she doing okay?

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.580
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.580
I'll take care of her.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.600
No rush.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.570
Show her the sights.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.600
Give her everything I paid you for.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:34.600
[Transcript missing]

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:14.820
So, things we can get away with online
as compared to on television.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.020
You know, on television,
you always see cars race up to like 60,

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.130
65 miles an hour,
and then all of a sudden

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:20.870
the speedometer stops.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.460
Here we could, you know,
push a car any way we wanted to.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.780
You know, you can't, you know,
show cars getting shot up by

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.580
machine gun fire and things like
that in traditional advertising.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.400
So we had more liberties that way, too.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.000
Okay, so, that was Star.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.560
So the first season
was pretty successful.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.850
We made a benchmark on what
would be a proper return for

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.590
the investment on all of this.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.260
We figured 3 million views would do it.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.730
If we did that,
we would be happy and BMW would be

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.720
happy and we all agreed upon that.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.940
And in the end,
we ended up having 13 million

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.210
views by the end of season one.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.060
So it was pretty successful
by our standards.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.990
And the best part about it was that
we got to do a the second season.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:15.180
So season one,
that should be BMW Films player,

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.790
not a layer.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.840
We built a player using
Macromedia Director.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.060
So it was a standalone piece of software,
and it would load

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.980
QuickTime movies into the player,
and then you would get added features,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.660
DVD-type features like subtitles.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.760
You could look at the car that
was featured in that certain film.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.540
and it was good for tracking.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.100
You know, we could track if a person
who downloaded the player,

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.100
what films they had watched.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.490
Had they watched all the films?

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.000
Did they watch them all the way through?

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.250
Did they go to BMW and look at a car?

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.770
Did they check out the
car inside of the player?

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.620
Things like that.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:57.300
One of the disadvantages of this was,
is that people could download the

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.600
movie and then not necessarily
view it in the BMW Films player.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.550
They could actually view
it in anybody's player.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.840
Which was, you know,
which in the back of our

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.940
minds was a little weird,
but that's where

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.060
technology was at the time.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.560
That's what we could do.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.550
And you know how it is,
you download something,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.200
then there's a new file on
your desktop and you just,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.250
you know, you pop it open.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.160
You don't necessarily, you know,
load it into the player the way you

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.780
learned how to do it the first time.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.970
And these are coming
out every couple weeks,

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.190
you know,
just to keep hyping them a little bit

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.200
more rather than all coming out at once.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.120
And the press was ridiculous,
especially when, you know,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.080
when that Madonna one broke,
it was a really big deal.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.680
So for the second season,
this is where we discovered

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.820
Live Stage Professional and we
realized that Live Stage was a really,

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.850
really great tool.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.290
It's a QuickTime authoring software,
those of you not familiar with it.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.340
And not only is it great
for tracking metrics,

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.740
you know, how often people look at films,
you know,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.840
sending information back to us about
people's viewing habits of these films,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.340
but it was also great because
you could put a flash layer

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.470
into the QuickTime movie.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.480
And it was really, really great for,
you know, added interactivity.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.900
This was great for us because we're,
you know, Fallon Interactive,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.710
we have a lot of great flash
developers and it speaks right to us.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.590
So,
and me being a flash developer by trade,

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:21.270
I was given the task of, you know,
learning how to use Live Stage Pro and

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.180
then incorporating the two together.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.080
So the second season,
each movie is actually,

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.040
the player is built
into every single movie.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.940
So if you downloaded the movie,
you could put a flash

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:32.940
layer into the movie.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.200
So if you downloaded the movie,
you got the skin,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.280
you got all the added DVD features,
the subtitles, the tracking was built in,

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.030
and there were added car features
so you could take a look at the car.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.350
And the added weight, you know,
was minuscule compared to the actual

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.070
film because the films are big.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.400
They were like, you know, 60, 70,
80 megs.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.990
And so, you know,
like five to six megs added on so

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.390
we could add all of these other
things to help sell the cars,

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.390
to help brand it,
to help keep the BMW idea there.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.400
to us and to them.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.520
Okay.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:18.600
[Transcript missing]

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.620
So this is a player, obviously.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.120
Let me close this other one.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.110
Let me hide this.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.420
So completely branded,
it's got all the added information.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.760
It's got the-- well,
I can look down here.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.790
It's got the credits built right into it.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:46.880
Plays a movie, make it full screen.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.990
You know, volume controls,
you can change the bass,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
change the treble, all of that.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.070
And then you can turn your captions on,
and there's director's

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.840
commentary built in too.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.000
So this is all built
into one QuickTime file,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.460
so it's kind of a neat way
to be able to put a lot of

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.910
interactivity into your movie.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.120
I know what I wanted to show you.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.600
So the second season,
there was a new product rollout.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.240
It was a Z4 Roadster.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.150
And all three films-- we did
three films the second season.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.610
All three films had something
about the Z4 Roadster.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.060
And this is probably
one of my favorite ones.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.830
This is the third film.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.350
It was filmed in Las Vegas.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:53.800
And so we worked with Mark LeFevre,
who's a photographer in Minneapolis.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.000
And we put a car mount on a Z4.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.740
And on the other films, you know,
there's a car mount on the front.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.060
And then the second one's
got QTBRs built into it.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.580
But basically, it's a big car mount unit.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.370
And then we had to Photoshop out
all of the added stuff.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.600
And this is all controlled in live stage,
so it's pretty neat.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.740
It's a neat way to see the car.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.260
Okay, so that's kind of how the
second season came about.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.940
So, can we go back to the slides, please?

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.220
BMW Films was pretty successful,
as I'm sure you've all

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.640
probably heard of it.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.940
We figure we got 26 million
in free advertising.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.060
There was a lot of press.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.680
250 broadcast stories that we know of.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.250
I'm sure there were probably more,
but 250 that we actually tracked.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:52.890
More than 750 stories in print,
and more than 350 stories

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.780
in online news sources,
I guess.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.390
To date, 63 million,
over 63 million views.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.820
And people are still downloading this.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:03.760
So this lives on.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:09.460
It's not like a traditional TV campaign
where it runs until they decide

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.400
they don't want to run it anymore.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.090
So it's still helping
put the product forward.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.150
BMW is really happy about it.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.730
And we won a ton of awards,
kind of the two big

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.780
ones being the one show,
which is kind of the Oscars

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.330
of the advertising world.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.320
We won best in show.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:30.730
And at Cannes, for season one,
we entered Cannes,

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.700
but we didn't win anything.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.550
And there was a big controversy,
because it was one of the biggest

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.750
things that happened in the
advertising world that year.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.920
There was a big controversy.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.600
Everybody was like,
why didn't it win anything?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.670
And the main reason was
that it didn't fit into any

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.630
traditional advertising category.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.180
So the next year,
they added a new award for something that

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.470
would be kind of breaking new ground.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.860
Groundbreaking, I guess you would say.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.150
They added a titanium lion,
and we won that for the second season.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.060
So it's kind of cool when they make
an award based on something you did.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.360
So that's BMW Films.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.000
The next thing I'll talk about
is the Islands of the Bahamas.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:18.530
The Bahamas, fairly new client to us,
last year about the time I came to

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.270
the Worldwide Developers Conference,
and I'll talk a little

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.750
bit more about that.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.450
Last year I came to the
Worldwide Developers Conference,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.870
I was a guest of Glenn's,
and I went to a presentation

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.240
by Michael Schaff,
I don't know if any of you,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.800
I'm sure you all know of him.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.650
He's a guy who wears a top hat,
and I think this year

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.120
he's got a funky beard,
and he's got the kind of red mustache.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.650
You know he's brilliant,
works for a place called Idle Hands.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.760
I think he is Idle Hands, isn't he?

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:45.380
What's that?

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.020
Small Hands.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:46.870
I'm sorry.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.390
Sorry about that.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.780
I went to his presentation last year,
and it was really great.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.920
He showed this demo of the
Los Angeles subway system,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.170
and the way it worked is you had the
map of the Los Angeles subway system,

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:04.210
and you could kind of scroll through it,
and you could click on certain stops.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.830
When you clicked on a stop,
a QTVR would pop open,

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.840
and you would be standing at the station,
underground,

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:12.290
like you just got off the train.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.350
You could look around and take it all in,
and then he had nodes built into it,

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.860
and you had your exits,
and you could click one of two exits,

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.520
and you click the exit,
and you had another QTVR,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.830
and you're standing on the
street above the subway,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.200
where you would get out,
knowing where you were.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.010
You could look around, and it was really,
really fascinating.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.160
I'm like, wow,
that's really a neat use of live

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.290
stage and QuickTime and Flash.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.030
Really what I thought
was I could do that.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.050
It was very impressive.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:50.320
I went back to Minneapolis,
and one day I get a call

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.580
from the Bahamas team,
and they're like,

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.840
"We need someone to come down
and talk about banners with us."

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.850
Pretty much any ad campaign we do,
there's always banners

00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:59.720
to go along with it.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.400
I think that's pretty normal.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.020
I went down to this meeting
to talk about Bahamas banners.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.260
They told us the whole
idea for the TV spot.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:13.740
If we can go back to the demo machine,
I'll show you the TV spot that they were

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.260
describing to me that finally came out.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:29:53.100
[Transcript missing]

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.500
Can we switch to the demo machine,
please?

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:04.370
So I went online and I found some
QTVRs that I could borrow to just kind

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.430
of use as a piece of theater so we
could get it in front of the client.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.980
So here's kind of a,
the logo of the Bahamas is kind

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.530
of a map of the Bahamas in theory.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.170
So I click on this island and...

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.670
"You know, and then there's a location.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:20.870
Bang, you're there.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.310
So that's kind of the idea.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.760
You know, golf course,
we were talking about vertical markets.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.640
You know, I mean,
this is obviously not in the Bahamas,

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.680
but you know, it gets the idea across.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.880
And we didn't really have any, you know,
we're in Minnesota,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.460
so there aren't many Bahamians around,
so I just used myself to..." "This is

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.730
where the person would pop up and talk
about something great about the Bahamas,

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.140
and how I'm a unique
person in the Bahamas,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.890
and how you should come here.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.490
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah."

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.680
So that was basically the idea.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.940
So we built this prototype and
got it in front of the client.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.310
And what a great client.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.360
They just got super excited about it.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.120
So they went back to Parliament and
asked for money for it.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.460
So that's cool when the client goes,
when they start throwing

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.190
money at you to do something.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.650
We can switch back to the slides.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:13.620
And at one point, the TV,
the budgets were really tight,

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.540
and the TV got postponed,
and the print got postponed.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.240
The thing that didn't get
postponed was this project.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.710
So right there,
I kind of consider it a big victory

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.580
when something like that happens.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.770
So the Bahamas Island Hop Tour.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.750
So we started putting
an estimate together.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.230
And because this was going
to be done with found money,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.960
and we didn't know,
they wanted to know how

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.940
much it was going to cost.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.810
than the cost.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.400
And we didn't want to say, you know,
$2 million.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.370
We wanted to be really careful about it
because we really wanted to produce it.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.680
We thought it was really something
special and kind of groundbreaking.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.570
Well, I shouldn't say that,
but I like to think it is.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.970
I'm sure there's other things
out there that are cool too.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.760
But so we really wanted to do it.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.210
So we started thinking about
how we were going to do it.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.550
And I'm a filmmaker,
so I've got kind of experience

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.760
in independent film.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.860
So we used that to our advantage.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.740
I was going to direct
all of the interviews,

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.840
and we were just going to have a
cameraman with us and a sound guy.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:24.490
And we talked to Mark LeFevre,
who had done the motion VR, we called it,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.600
on that BMW film I just showed you in
Las Vegas in the back of the car thing.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.060
He had done that for us,
and he'd been doing stuff with

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.160
us in BMW for like 10 years,
you know, tons of QTVRs.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.520
He's just a great photographer,
and he's the kind of guy

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.310
who really embraces QTVRs.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.840
He's got a really nice
relationship with Panascan,

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.980
who are, they make a QTVR camera.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.520
So we talked to him,
and he started putting an

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.470
estimate together for us.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.360
So we started picking locations.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.280
We found that for the bigger
islands we wanted to do two

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.930
locations on each island,
and for the small islands we

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.330
just would do one location.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.800
So 22 locations all
together we figured out,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.170
and we needed to coordinate
all the interviews,

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.760
so this was kind of a challenge.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.090
And then we had to put together a
crew and we had to coordinate travel,

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.710
and Lefavor Pictures,
Mark Lefavor and his team came in

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.000
real handy for that because they're
used to traveling around the world.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.510
But this was kind of unique because we
were going to go to really 16 islands.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.680
They say 14 islands,
but we were going to go to 16 islands.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.860
Because Harbor Island and Eleuthera
are right next to each other,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.730
so they kind of consider
them as one entity,

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.790
but really 16 different islands.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:37.440
And we had to put together a schedule,
and we had hit 16 islands,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.670
and we figured it would
take about 23 days.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.760
And that's with no breaks.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.120
So we didn't get any days off.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.340
And I tell people that
we worked every day,

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.460
we worked so hard,
and we were in the Bahamas for 23 days,

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.180
and nobody seemed sorry for me.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.300
Nobody has much sympathy.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.990
But really, you know,
you would work a really long day,

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.860
but at the end of the day,
when you can go out and hang out

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:05.350
on the beach for a little bit,
it really recharges your

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:09.530
batteries pretty quick.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.360
So it was hard work.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.820
And I'll tell you about
just one of the days we had.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.350
We were on Long Island,
and we were scheduled to shoot

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.820
at two places on Long Island.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.100
In the morning,
we were going to shoot at a

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.240
place called Dean's Blue Hole.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:27.160
And a blue hole is basically
a big pit in the ocean.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.610
I think it's created by glaciers.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.460
I'm sorry, I don't know how it's created.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.390
But Dean's Blue Hole is the
deepest blue hole known to man,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.380
660 feet.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.320
We had to do an interview with a dive
master who was going to be there with us.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.390
So we had to set up the
location for the QTVR,

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.120
shoot that, do the interview,
shoot a lot of footage so we

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.880
can splice stuff together.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.430
And that day, later on in our shoot,
we were doing some underwater shooting.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:52.290
We were doing some underwater QTVRs.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.250
They weren't going to be cubic.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.100
They were linear QTVRs that we
used in underwater digital SLR in a

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.480
housing and on a tripod underwater.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.440
And we were also shooting
video underwater.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.360
So we needed to test our cameras.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.680
In like two weeks,
we were going to be shooting.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.760
And we were going to actually shoot that.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.980
I mean, the cameras had been tested,
but not in the field.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:11.920
So we had to do that.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.320
And then later that afternoon,
we were going to a place

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.510
called Max's Conk Shack.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:19.750
I don't know if you know what conk is,
but it's that big-ass shell

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.840
that you put up to your ear
and you can hear the ocean.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.250
That's conk.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.310
And they prepare it in so many
different ways in the Bahamas

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.940
because they're everywhere.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.460
And it's really good
the first dozen times.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.460
But everywhere we went, everybody's like,
oh, you know, Americans.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.300
You know, give them conk, you know.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.120
And I'd never need to eat conk again.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.090
I mean, it's great,
but I never need to eat it again.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.200
I've had quite a bit of it.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.870
So we had to go to Max's Conk Shack,
and we were going to shoot a QTVR there.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.520
And we were going to do an interview.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.180
So it was a really busy day.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.200
So let me just show you some of the stuff
we ended up shooting at the Blue Hole.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.680
So if we can switch back
to the demo machine,

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.040
please.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.500
So first I'll show you
the... This is the blue hole.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:27.900
[Transcript missing]

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:37.800
[Transcript missing]

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.440
So it's kind of neat, you know,
you can go right there and bang

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.470
you're there and start looking around,
you know, taking it all in.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:55.500
[Transcript missing]

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.550
My name is Joel Fries.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.760
Behind me you see Dean's Blue Hole.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.100
It is the deepest measured
known blue hole in the world.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.360
The ledge,
actually you can climb upon the rocks

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.980
and jump right into the blue hole.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.180
Diving in the blue hole is
unique as if you were diving in

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.090
a tunnel going straight down.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:17.030
We have a large variety of dives from
the blue hole here to coral reef dives

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:21.100
to wall dives and shark feeding dives.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:25.090
So divers, we invite you to come to
Long Island and do some diving with us.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.410
So, you know, we shot all of that stuff,
and then we had to do the, and we went,

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.710
he's a dive master,
so he took us down to do

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.390
the camera test underwater.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:36.210
I didn't go personally.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.480
But we were kind of running behind.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.670
And, you know,
it was kind of a big deal locally,

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.630
I guess,
because people kept showing up and

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.280
checking out what we were doing.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.100
And one of the guys who came out,
this old guy named Leonard Cartwright,

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.790
went to my producer, Julie, and said,
you know,

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.790
you guys should really come out,
check out my cave.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.640
You know, my cave is really cool.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:56.780
You should come out.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800
You should check it out.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.440
You probably want to shoot there.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.860
It's really cool.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.930
And he was really nice,
and he hung out all day

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.280
chatting with everyone.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.590
I was kind of like, well,
we could maybe swing by there,

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.410
but we're running out of
time and we really got to get

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.650
to this Max's conch shack.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.040
We're about two hours behind schedule,
and I said to Julie, okay, forget it,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.180
we can't go there.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.750
And she goes,
I already told him we would.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.050
Please, can we just go by there?

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.600
So the QTVR team was tearing down
and packing up all the underwater

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.420
camera housings and things like that.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:29.820
And I said, okay.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.900
I was really mad, because if we failed,
if we didn't get our

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.060
next shot done that day,
we would only have one

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.590
shot on a long island,
and the out-island promotion board would

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.450
be pretty mad if that were the case.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.860
So I said to Julie, all right,
it's on the way,

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.460
let's just take the video team,
we'll go there and we'll check it out.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.550
So we went there and can we
switch back to the slides please?

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:07.660
We went there and we
walked into the place.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.490
We had to walk through the
caves for a little bit,

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:10.360
for like 10 minutes.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:15.820
It was like that scene in
Indiana Jones with the big ball.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.280
The cave was just beautiful and
there was this light coming in

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.060
through these holes in the ceiling.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.340
It was simply gorgeous,
one of the most beautiful

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.810
places we had been there yet.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.370
I turned to Julie and said,
"You've got to call the

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.020
QTVR team and get them over here.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.820
We've got to try to shoot three
things today." There was a rickety

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.100
ladder going up into one of the holes.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.700
She's like, "My cell phone won't work."
She had to climb up the ladder,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.100
went up there, called them up,
gave them directions.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.190
They came by and Mark walked
into it and he said,

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.690
"Yeah, we've got to shoot this.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.840
We've got to shoot this."
We did our interview.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.850
We interviewed Leonard.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:51.980
Then we left.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.100
We went to the conch shack
to start our interview there.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.990
Then Mark Lefavor could join
us later with the QTVR team

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.030
and shoot the QTVR there.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.090
We shot the interview.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:07.020
I'll play the interview for you quickly.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:13.840
We are at Catrice Caves in Hamilton.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.940
These caves were found by the Indians,
and we found pieces of Indian pottery

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.820
and markings on the walls.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.780
We used the caves as a hurricane shelter.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.160
In the early '30s, you could have got the
whole community in here,

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.290
and you could hardly tell that
there's a hurricane going on outside,

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.730
except for you could look
out and see the trees moving.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.600
We'd spend days on it sometimes.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.120
We had a lot of fun.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.170
I was a kid at the time.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:43.940
We played catchers and hide and seek,
and we had a lot of fun.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.250
My name is Leonard Scott Wright.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.440
This is my playground.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.170
So yeah, you see he's a sweet old guy.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.130
He was just wonderful.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:55.140
So we shot that, and then we moved on.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.150
And Mark LeFevre and his team,
an interesting thing about these caves

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.190
is that they're filled with bats.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.640
Just filled, filled, filled with bats.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.100
And so, of course,
they're filled with bat guano, bat poop,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.430
you know.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.700
And back in the 30s,
they used to take the guano

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.880
and shovel it out and send it
to the United States because

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.520
it's a really high power,
it's a really good fertilizer.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.360
So there's brown soil everywhere,
and it's basically bat guano.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.980
So LeFevre and his assistant,
when they were shooting it,

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.660
basically they used a Panascan camera.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.420
I'll talk more about it later.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.290
But it's basically a glorified
scanner with a big Mamiya medium

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.980
format wide-angle lens on it.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.940
And they would scan a certain area,
and there was this light coursing in.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.940
But you couldn't really capture the
light unless there was dust in it.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.250
So they took their shirts off,
wrapped them around their faces,

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.000
and then went around the place,
and they'd wrap all of this bat guano.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.250
So there's all this bat
guano floating in the air.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.780
And then they got really beautiful,
they called it god light, you know,

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.960
these beams of light, like,
shining through.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.210
So they had to do that
all throughout the cave.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.100
So I'll show you that real quick.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:09.810
So this is the QTVR they shot,
and there's the god light.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.600
Bad poop.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:29.080
And right up there, when they were down
there for the hurricanes,

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.500
they would see the trees
moving and all that.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:38.110
So they shot that and they
really had to haul ass over to

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.590
the conch shack where we were.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:45.590
And we showed up at the conch
shack and you know it's cool.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:51.740
But you know the thing about QTVRs
is that it's all the way around.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:57.500
So pretty much the whole panorama
was beautiful and then there

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.960
was like a car up on blocks.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.460
And you know various things like that.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.300
And it's not necessarily
what you want to,

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.110
you know what I'm sure the Ministry of
Tourism was looking for in promoting

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.720
the Bahamas was a car up on blocks.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:42.300
[Transcript missing]

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.380
Another thing that was in the shot,
you know, the conch shack, you know,

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.160
they had these, like,
windows that open up like that,

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.620
so then you get, like, shade and...

00:43:50.800 --> 00:44:40.300
[Transcript missing]

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.250
So yeah, this is a Panascan camera,
just kind of the head of it.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.230
And it ran into,
he had a 17-inch PowerBook.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.130
But basically,
it's got like that periscope,

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.450
so the lens is always right
at kind of the pivot point,

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.010
and it spins around.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:45:00.770
And it takes about a minute and a half to
two minutes to scan all the way around.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:03.890
So if you have someone in the shot,
it's like, you know,

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.560
photography of days gone by.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.300
They had to be real still.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:12.420
And this kind of ran, in most cases,
this wasn't a problem.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.920
But we did run into one situation
where it did become a problem.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.510
Nassau, one of the biggest
tourist places in Nassau,

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.620
is something called the Straw Market.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.400
And it burned down
about two years before.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.470
So they were in a temporary housing
while they built the new Straw Market,

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.770
which should be done, you know,
2008 or something like that.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.600
And it's basically this
big industrial-sized tent.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.870
And, you know, we tried to find the most
picturesque place to shoot there.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:46.490
But, you know, it was going to be hard
to polish up that turd,

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.740
you know.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.120
It wasn't really that beautiful.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:54.160
That was the nice thing about having
a QTVR and a corresponding video to

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:58.820
go with it because you could kind of,
you know, if one turned out fabulous,

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.770
then, you know, the two of them together,
you know,

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.080
kind of raise the whole sum of the parts.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.500
But I'll show you the
QTVR for the straw market,

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.720
so if we can switch back
to the demo machine,

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.480
thank you.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.170
Glenn Bulycz, Chris Stocksmith

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.380
And it's funny,
because we were there all afternoon,

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.800
and we were setting up all afternoon.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.440
And this guy right here,
everybody was kind of following his lead.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.980
Everybody had to sign a
release to be on this thing.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.660
And we even had someone there from
the Ministry of Tourism kind of

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.450
strong-armed people a little bit.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.800
This guy didn't want to sign a release.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.800
And once he signed a release,
everybody signed a release.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.180
And I think everybody
got like $50 out of it,

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.860
but they all wanted to be paid,
basically.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.010
But here's one of those situations.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.010
And Panascan's working on a new camera,
well, updating the firmware,

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.670
so it shoots much faster.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.480
So people only have to be still for
a second rather than for like 15

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:49.960
seconds while it's going past them.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:54.840
But you can see we kind of get into some
areas where people are a little blurry.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.160
And there are the blue tarps
I was telling you about.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.120
And we made this one
more of a linear QTVR.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.780
I don't know why I'm showing
you the worst of all the QTVRs.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.960
It's still good,
but we really had to go through

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:13.170
a lot to make it what it is.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.990
I'll show you the interview
that went along with it.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.680
I think it's the best
of all the interviews.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.700
It's my favorite by far.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.740
So I kind of compensated for it.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.290
Good morning, darling.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.210
How are you doing?

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:28.220
And can I help you?

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.200
"The market is a delight, a real delight.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.600
My favorite thing about being
in the market is meeting people.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.590
I enjoy talking, I enjoy camaraderie.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:45.600
I just love it.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.590
It's fun to be here.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:51.420
A normal day is actually fun." "All
of the craft baskets are made here

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.190
and made just by the store vendors.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.600
As you can see,
I'm working on one right now."

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.560
My name is Bridget Humes.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.410
Come on down and visit
all of us at the famous,

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.600
world-famous

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.950
Our lawyers spent some time
trying to figure out if we could

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.620
have Mickey Mouse on there,
and I guess it was okay.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:22.330
Um, now, you probably noticed that most
of these videos are only like...

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:44.300
[Transcript missing]

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.440
So we were done shooting
all of our content,

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:54.620
so we came back to Minneapolis and
put our team together.

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.790
And Nate Hintz,
he was a designer on BMW Films,

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:59.070
the second season, and I worked with him.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.070
Then we had Jim Park, a Flash developer.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.350
Andy LeMay,
another great Flash developer.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.120
I'll probably talk a
little bit more about them.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.260
We hired our director of photography,
Ben Kruger, to be the editor,

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.110
because he was familiar with the footage.

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.500
Mark LeFevre did the
retouching on the QTVRs,

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:17.100
and then Russ and myself.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.340
Flash and QuickTime put
together into LiveStage.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.370
One thing, there's,
right now the Flash plugin is Flash 6.

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:32.310
Inside of QuickTime,
the Flash plugin is Flash 5.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.460
So we all had to step back about
a year and a half and develop

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.970
for Flash 5 to incorporate the,
you know,

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:42.620
we'd have to produce a Flash 5 Swift to
incorporate into the QuickTime movie.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.500
So it's kind of like
jumping into a time machine.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:51.550
And the intro for the Island Hop,
Andy LeMay, he's one of our really

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.620
gifted Flash developers.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.710
He's a PC guy.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.190
and he's really, really gifted.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:06.590
So he built this really great intro
that's got like a map of the Bahamas

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:12.120
and little bouncing arcs and then
clouds kind of moving independently and

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.110
there's shadows and shimmering water.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.680
Really, really impressive.

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:19.480
And I'll show that to you quick so if
we can go back to the demo machine.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:40.100
[Transcript missing]

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.460
But I'll show it to you in QuickTime.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.300
I'll show you the newer version.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.370
Trust me, it was really cool.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:48.060
But we, he built it,
and once we put it into QuickTime,

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.460
it worked fine on the PC.

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.120
Did not work very well on a Mac,
which is weird because then all

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.970
of a sudden a QuickTime movie
kind of clunking along on a Mac.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.490
But the reason for that is
Macromedia doesn't build a really,

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:05.090
it's kind of the bane of,
as a Flash developer of our existence,

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:09.710
that Macromedia doesn't really have
a great plug-in for Flash for Macs.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.460
So we had to strip a lot of the
really neat stuff out of there.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.610
So basically the clouds all move together
and there's just one hopping arc.

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:20.530
But let me show you the
finished piece here.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.920
Can we go back to the
slides for a second?

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:32.600
[Transcript missing]

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.320
So that's basically the
intro we wound up with.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.010
And it was kind of a last-minute
decision because we couldn't get it

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.120
working properly on the old iMacs.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.150
You know, we couldn't get it playing,
you know,

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.100
and you've got to develop for everybody,
so.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.590
But, um, um...

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.650
So it has kind of a great interface.

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.640
You know,
you've got the whole rollovers here.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.050
You can select an island
and just go to the island.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:35.500
[Transcript missing]

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:45.460
and you noticed that we scripted the
QTVR that when you first get there,

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.400
here I'll do this, see you're taking off,
you're jumping somewhere else and

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.620
here you are landing somewhere else.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.370
So let's go back to the lighthouse.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.920
And then we've got the sound built
in so you can hear the wind up there.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.600
And it was kind of scary up there.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.170
That's my favorite part right there.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.700
And then here's our interview.

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.240
And you noticed when
the QTVR first opened,

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.660
we have it so it's automatically panning,
so people realize that it's

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.510
not just a still image.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.910
and then the interview
to go along with it.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:25.100
My name is Vernon Malone.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.520
I live here in Hopetown.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.320
I run a grocery store and a bakery.

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.140
I'm a marriage officer and a lay
preacher in the Methodist Church.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.440
One favorite thing about my life?

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.730
I guess living here,
being fortunate enough to live

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.240
in this part of the world.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.980
I think that would be one
of my favorite things.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:46.060
No matter how much money you
have when you live on an island,

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.830
there are things that you can't buy.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.600
I will have it and give it to you.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.200
It's not for sale,
but people will share it with you.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.360
So the true island experience is here.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.240
The Hopetown Lighthouse is one
of the last three in the world

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.700
that are fired by kerosene.

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:03.110
It's 120 feet above sea level.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:04.520
It has 101 steps.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:09.800
The keepers have to wind the
mechanism every 90 minutes.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.750
The light is visible for 19 miles.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:17.780
There are five flashes and then a rest,
and that would be the only lighthouse

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.970
in the world that would do that,
and that's why you can

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:23.430
identify it from 19 miles away.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:31.000
So that was a pretty good day,
as you can tell.

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.230
So this is a QuickTime movie.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:35.660
This is nothing more
than a QuickTime movie.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.400
I mean, Flash is already built
into a QuickTime movie.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.820
This is interactivity that
you can get into one piece.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.020
If they have the QuickTime plug-in,
it's all there for you.

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.500
Using LiveStage,
it's just an incredible tool to

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.400
put all of this stuff together.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.560
"Is there anything else
I wanted to show you on here?

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:57.870
Oh, if you are online,
that's what the temperature is right now.

00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:00.500
You know,
so that's all dynamically built into.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.890
And we were going to build
more dynamic things into it,

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.960
but we just didn't.

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:08.260
We didn't have the infrastructure
in place that we could leverage,

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:12.800
and the Bahamas had run
a deal with Travelocity.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.870
So if you wanted to book,
you had to go to Travelocity

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.110
and do all of that.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.790
But we were going to
build in a booking engine,

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.810
and we were going to have
things automatically update,

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:23.190
like specials at local
restaurants and things like that.

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:26.600
But the infrastructure just wasn't there,
and the budget wasn't there.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.630
So that would have been pretty cool.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:33.580
But again, this is just a QuickTime movie
with some really cool flash

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.140
in it and some great content.

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.980
I don't think this would have
happened if I didn't know

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.160
what we were capable of doing,
and I guess that's the biggest thing

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.000
I want to get across to people today,
is that there's a lot of

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.400
stuff here you can do.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.830
And it pains me to think of all the
Flash developers out there who want

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:53.780
a skill that makes them unique,
because there's a ton of

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.540
Flash developers out there.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.010
They want something that makes them,
look at me, you know.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:01.860
I've got this real great
thing in my toolbox that I can

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.570
do that no one else can do.

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:06.360
And Live Stage Professional is that tool,
because it's not that

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.570
complicated of a program.

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.940
You know, it's complicated,
but it's not that complicated,

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:14.970
but it really helps you
leverage your Flash experience,

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:16.030
coupled with QuickTime.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.950
You know, I mean,
it's so much greater than

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:18.970
the sum of the parts.

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:22.560
If we can go back to the slides, please.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:30.440
As far as the editing goes, again,
we hired Ben Kruger,

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.570
who had shot the stuff.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.400
He's a film student.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.060
We were film students together.

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:36.860
We hired him to do all of the editing,
and we did all the

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.380
editing in Final Cut Pro.

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:42.580
Now, at Fallon, we have Avid Suites,
so we had Avid Suites available to us,

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.110
but they bill out pretty, you know,
they're pretty expensive,

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.010
so Ben could basically
just work on his laptop,

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:51.380
and because all of the source
footage was already mini-DV,

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:54.380
we weren't, you know, losing anything by
working in Final Cut Pro.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:58.910
So, and it also great support
for the camera we used.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:03.740
We used a Panasonic 24p camera, so,
and also great for the budget.

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:10.920
So in conclusion, you know,
we've got all these incredible tools,

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.040
LiveStage, QuickTime, Flash,
Final Cut Pro.

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:18.670
You put them together,
you can really do some incredible stuff.

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.670
It's

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:20.630
and I guess that's what
I'd like to leave you with.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:27.360
Guillaume is here from Totally Hip,
and he can help answer any questions

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.170
you may have about live stage.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.880
And I guess we'll do Q&A now.
