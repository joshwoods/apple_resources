00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.700
[Transcript missing]

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.590
I swear to God I just saw the
same number of hands go up.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.660
Okay, that's just creeping me out.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.100
All right,
so as I said in the first session,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.980
my demonstration today,
including the last session,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.930
is one single project that I'm building.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.580
In the last session,
which was introduction to Final Cut Pro,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.840
I touched on the basics and invariably
went a little bit deeper than I probably

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.750
needed to on a lot of those things just
because there's a lot of interest in it.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.650
This time,
I'm working with the same project.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.190
I'm going to spend a lot more time
focusing on the more advanced stuff,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.740
and I'm going to try and go through
the more basic stuff much more quickly.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.620
Clearly,
there's going to be a bit of overlap,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.000
potentially even a bit more
overlap than I said the first time

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.110
because there were so many advanced
questions in the first session.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.450
Hopefully,
I won't put anybody to sleep here talking

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.360
about some of the same stuff over again.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.960
But with that said,
let's just go ahead and get going.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.720
So, advanced Final Cut Pro, that's me,
Joseph Linaschke.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.750
I'm the technical marketing manager at
Apple for the Pro Apps Marketing Group.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490
What that means is my team is
responsible for all the demo

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.180
content that goes out worldwide.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.600
We also do all the presentations,
so if you go to NAB or Macworld

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.820
and see a Pro Apps demonstration
or the upcoming SIGGRAPH,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.680
that's us.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.050
So, that's my background and where
I come from and why I might maybe

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.700
potentially know what I'm talking about,
although no promises.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.460
All right, Apple, innovation.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.990
This is what obviously
Apple is all about,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.340
and of course one of our most recent
innovations is Final Cut Pro HD,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.340
high definition.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.470
Now,
Final Cut Pro HD is the newest version.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.010
It's version 4.5,
and it is the one that gives

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.260
you access to the new HD format,
DVC Pro HD.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.120
And I'll get into quite a bit
more on that in just a moment.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.660
But just a very quick
little introduction here.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.110
Over a quarter of a million
Final Cut editors out there.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.280
I'm almost afraid to ask,
but how many people are

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.400
using Final Cut Pro?

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.580
Awesome.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.460
How many aren't?

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.860
If I see the same number of hands,
I quit.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.930
All right, so maybe we'll get a few
converts out of this.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.870
So a quarter of a million
editors out there,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.670
and a lot of them have
actually paid for it,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.510
which is great.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.840
So who's using it?

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.280
Places like ABC, KTVX, and ABC affiliate.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.950
They use it for all
their news broadcasts.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.450
Obviously this is just a tiny little
sampling of where it's being used.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.390
But an example in the broadcast space,
an example in Hollywood, Lady Killers,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.480
one of the more recent
Coen Brothers films,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.980
was cut on Final Cut Pro.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.830
Also Cold Mountain, a massive one,
a Cate Award nominee,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.130
didn't quite make it but almost there,
beat out by Lord of the Rings,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.600
yeah couldn't compete with that,
was edited with Final Cut Pro.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.530
That's Lady Killers and Cold Mountain.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.990
Television show Nib Tuck is
edited with Final Cut Pro.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.310
They have a format or a workflow
format that starts from film.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.410
They actually shoot on 35mm film,
telecine that to an

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.530
uncompressed HD format,
and then take that down to DigiBeta

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.850
and then to DV for editing,
and then they relink back to their

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.120
DigiBeta for final broadcast.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.300
And that means that in the future,
if they manage to get

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.960
syndication for HD broadcast,
they can go back and relink or

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.100
recut to the original HD tapes
and broadcast the same show in HD.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.480
So that's one of the
advantages of Final Cut Pro,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.340
giving the ability to go from
format to format like that.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.080
It's the same app the whole way through.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.300
So let's take a quick look at a video,
and then we will come

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.360
back to slides this time.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.000
This video is something we
produced for NAB this year.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.080
This is a sampling of what our customers
are doing with all of the Pro products.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.160
So this is Final Cut Pro, DVD Studio Pro,
Shake, Logic, and this is the video

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.080
that introduced Motion.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.790
Let's go back to the slides, please.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.340
We absolutely love that piece.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.840
It was produced for us right before NAB,
as I said,

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.830
obviously highlighting all the Pro apps.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.510
One of the questions I get a lot is,
was that produced entirely

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.470
with Apple software,
or was it all Final Cut and

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.740
Shake and Motion and so on?

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.770
And the answer is no.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.000
No, we didn't.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.040
It was a lot of--it
was Cut and Final Cut,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.200
and Motion was used, and Shake was used,
and so on.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.940
But we also used a lot
of third-party apps.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.460
The only reason I bring that
up is to highlight to you guys,

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.840
as our third-party developers,
that this is really important.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.500
You know,
we really need your guys' stuff.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.340
After Effects is using this,
Photoshop is some Illustrator work,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.890
and tons of stuff from Adobe,
tons of other smaller third-party

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.310
company filters and plug-ins
and so on were used in there.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.840
So it really is spread throughout.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.760
So I say that just so that you don't
look at something like that and think,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840
"Well,
what am I doing?" You are doing the stuff

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.050
that allows us to do things like that.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.600
So that's awesome.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.840
All right, so let's get into,
on the topic of third-party,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.750
some of the third-party developers on
the hardware side of Final Cut Pro.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.080
Companies like AJA, Aurora,
Blackmagic Design,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.720
and Pinnacle Systems are all
making third-party capture

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.150
cards for Final Cut Pro.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.430
Now, Final Cut Pro on its own is,
without anything else, up until recently,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.040
was DV only, right?

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.810
You had to have some kind of
third-party capture card to get

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.980
other formats in there besides DV,
whether it was standard

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.560
definition uncompressed or
high definition uncompressed,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.140
required a third-party capture card.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.540
Now, with Final Cut Pro HD,
things changed a little bit

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.300
because now we have the ability
to capture HD over FireWire,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.820
but that's a very specific format of HD,
and I will talk about that a

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.990
little bit more in a moment.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.000
That does not mean that all these
third-party cards are no longer relevant.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.470
In fact, they're extremely relevant.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.280
If you're doing standard definition,
first of all, you still require a

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.520
standard definition card.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.760
If you want to capture standard
definition uncompressed,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.520
AJA makes a couple of options.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.750
They have the Kona SD card,
SD for standard def.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.420
They also have the IO,
which is a great FireWire box that allows

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.260
you to capture standard definition,
8 and 10 bit uncompressed over FireWire,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.760
which is just awesome,
and that's something

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.190
that we released at NAB,
I guess that must have been last year.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.680
Aurora makes a card that
specifically designed to handle

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.550
24 frame per second editing.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.420
So if you're doing a film
edit at 24 frames per second,

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.260
this will allow you to view your
film edit on an NTSC monitor

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.180
at 30 frames per second,
and a true NTSC at true 30 frames,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.880
and it'll do that pull-up automatically
so that you have that type of

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.340
a preview on the NTSC monitor.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.660
Blackmagic Design is making some very,
very cost-effective capture cards,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.580
very simple, not a whole lot to them,
simply SDI,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.680
that's a serial digital interface,
in and out.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.150
Very low cost,
and that's basically all it does is it

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.440
gives you digital interface in and out.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.350
If you want analog interfaces,
you need to add options onto it,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.180
but if you're just looking
for serial digital,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.020
it's quite possibly the
lowest cost way to go.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.180
And then Pinnacle's kind of the
other side of the game there.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.440
They have one of the more
higher costing cards,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.680
but obviously with that
you get a lot of features.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.070
So their standard definition card gives
you a huge amount of real-time effects.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.180
They also have an HD option,
where you have an HD breakout

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.600
box that gives you the ability to
capture uncompressed high definition.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.150
Now someone had asked me beforehand,
with the Final Cut Pro HD,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.570
does that mean they no longer
need their Pinnacle HD card?

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.400
Well no, because Final Cut Pro HD,
the whole thing about HD in there

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.640
is the Panasonic DVC Pro HD format.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.640
And again,
I'll touch more on that in a moment,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.640
but what I want to mention here
is that all of our current,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.770
well not all,
but the current HD cards from

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.640
Pinnacle and from AJA will allow
you to convert HD cam footage

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.820
on capture into DVC Pro HD,
which means you can now edit it in

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.600
real-time in Final Cut Pro software only.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.600
So these cards are still very viable.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.600
If you're not shooting
with a Panasonic camera,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.330
you can still use the other HD formats,
convert using these cards into

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.590
the native DVC Pro HD format.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.180
Some of the other stuff that
goes on with Final Cut Pro,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.930
obviously things like
QuickTime and FireWire,

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.030
huge technologies in there.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.650
XML support,
that's our big third-party link

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.680
to get out to the outside world.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.430
XML is a way to export and
import in Final Cut Pro,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.140
and just about anything can
happen when you go down that road.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.950
Discreet, obviously,
does things like combustion,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.220
and we work with combustion via XML.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.040
Companies like the BBC using it.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.520
And then Grass Valley is one
of our more recent partners,

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.260
and back at NAB, we had this ad running
all over the place.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.760
What's a file between friends?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.490
Once again, using the XML architecture,
we're able to transfer files or

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.780
projects from Final Cut Pro into
the Grass Valley news edit system

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.600
for immediate broadcast to air.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.550
So you now have an end-to-end
solution that we give you editing

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.280
in the field out to broadcast.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.620
So you now have an end-to-end
solution that we give you editing

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:15.920
in the field out to broadcast.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.880
all working together.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.050
So HD, once again,
is what Final Cut Pro HD is all about.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.800
Now just to clarify,
Final Cut Pro HD does not lose

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.360
any of the previous features.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.890
It still has DV editing,
standard definition, uncompressed,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.470
and so on.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.920
In fact, Final Cut Pro has pretty
much always done HD.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.730
The only reason we added HD under
the name on this was to really bore

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.960
home the fact that we are talking
about this new real-time HD format.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.380
Now let's talk for a moment about
standard uncompressed HD editing,

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.320
the way that you're used to
working before Final Cut Pro HD.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.760
You shoot in a camera-native format
that is either HD cam or DVC Pro HD.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.200
These are the two standard
HD formats out there.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.950
HD cam is from Sony,
DVC Pro HD is from Panasonic,

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.250
and they are the makers of the two
primary digital HD cameras in the world.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.010
You would then capture that into
Final Cut Pro using one of the

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.770
cards that we mentioned earlier,
but you would capture it

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.320
into an uncompressed space.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.400
Now that has made sense.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.480
In that process, you're effectively
decompressing the image,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.700
but you're not actually
adding anything to it.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.920
So what happens is a lot of
people missed out on the fact that

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.780
HD tapes are not uncompressed.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.260
The footage that goes on
the tapes is just like DV.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.380
DV is not uncompressed.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.120
It's a 4 or 5 to 1 compression.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.010
So you have a massive amount of
compression that's happening in the

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.710
camera before it ever goes to tape.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.540
So if you take this HD cam or
DVC Pro HD tape and you capture

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.960
it into an uncompressed space,
you're not gaining anything.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.560
You're actually taking that,
moving it into an uncompressed space.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.010
And by the time you get back to tape,
you will have suffered

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.990
a generational loss.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.490
So the next step in here, of course,
is to go back to tape,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.760
so into your camera native HD,
and that recompress,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.350
and there's where your
generational loss is happening.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.140
Now that's just a silly way to go.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.620
We'll come back to kind of the
new solution to that in a moment.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.800
While I'm talking about uncompressed,
I want to talk about the

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.830
hardware requirements.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.110
Obviously, a very high-powered G5,
a ton of storage, for example,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.920
the XServe RAID or any other
RAID solution out there.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.410
You need a third-party capture card,
the Kona card, the Pinnacle card,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.060
and so on.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.860
And you need a HD broadcast monitor.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.940
These things don't come cheap.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.710
They run about $40,000 to $60,000,
depending on your options,

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.480
if that's for a TV.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.700
of expensive.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.180
I know, it's crazy.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.700
And this is what you need to do
uncompressed high definition editing.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.470
Well, let's go back to the way that
we were talking about it.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.450
And slide--oh, this is right.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:31.820
Okay.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.900
So, this is the way that it used to be,
right?

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.480
Uncompressing and going back
to the native HD format,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.270
but what we've done is we've
replaced that entire process

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.790
with a FireWire cable.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.980
This is FireWire A,
the standard default every

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.060
single Mac ships with
FireWire A type of a FireWire.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.100
Not B, not the really fast stuff,
standard FireWire.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.230
It's unbelievable that we can
actually do HD over FireWire.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.470
Now, how in the heck does that work?

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.240
Well, what it does mean before
we get into how it works,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.290
it means that your hardware
requirements change dramatically.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.010
G5, you can now capture and edit from
an internal drive using FireWire and

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.720
using the new DVI video out function,
you can actually preview

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.340
on an Apple Cinema display.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.010
Now, this is not a color accurate
display for broadcast.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.500
It's an RGB versus YUV, right?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.660
So, this means that you cannot do your
final color correction on this.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.500
But it does mean that you can
outfit a studio with ten HD editors

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.490
and you can actually do your
final color correction on this.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.500
So, you can have a studio
with ten HD editors,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.500
each with their own HD monitor
and not break the bank.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.230
You can have just one of those
$60,000 monitors in your color

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.100
correction station and everybody else
gets one of these monitors to be able

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.500
to preview their HD at full screen.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.500
So, that's some of the way we've
saved on the cost on there.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.900
Let's go back to the native
DVC-Pro-HD format and why

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.500
this works over FireWire.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.100
So, first of all, it is camera native.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.760
There's no recompression.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.500
I touched on that.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.480
We're shooting in DVC-Pro-HD,
capturing DVC-Pro-HD, editing DVC-Pro-HD.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.870
So, there's no recompression.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:49.760
You can also use the same format.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.780
This is the same HD that you've
been using since day one.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.390
422, color space, YUV,
it's a professional HD format.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.070
You also have multiple sizes
and frame rate options with

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:03.400
the Panasonic DVC-Pro-HD codec,
including 1080i, which is 1920 by 1080,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.060
720p, 720 by 1280, 24,
30 and 60 frames per second frame rates.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.060
And actually, the Panasonic camera,
something called the VariCam,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.890
allows you to alter that
frame rate on the fly.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.700
Pretty cool feature of that.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.560
The data rates of this HD is
a surprisingly low 5.8 to 5.9.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.220
So, that's, you know,
a pretty good feature.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.420
So, you can actually use that.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.370
You can also use the Panasonic
5.8 to 14 megabytes per second.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.450
You're thinking, wait a minute,
that doesn't make sense.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.520
DV is only like 6 or 5
or something like that.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.380
How can this be HD?

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.180
Again, it's a compressed format.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.570
Before you think,
I don't want to compress my footage,

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.820
remember what I was saying earlier.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.690
It's already compressed.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.030
That's how it was shot to tape.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.780
In fact, if you wanted to shoot
true uncompressed HD,

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.660
there is no tape format
in the world for that.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.240
D5 is the traditionally
highest quality HD tape format.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.830
A D5 is compressed 2 to 1.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.500
Most people consider that to
be the highest quality and

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.320
it's actually compressed.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.990
The only way to shoot, well,
let me back up for a second.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.900
There actually was a deck produced
that was fully uncompressed.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.490
It's called a D6.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.520
There's like three of them in the
world and George Lucas has all of them.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.110
We don't even talk about that.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.760
If you want to shoot
truly uncompressed HD,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.480
the only way to do it is to take
a camera with an HD-SDI output and

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.710
plug it straight into a G5 with
two XRV raids striped together

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.410
because you need that much bandwidth
and you capture straight to disc.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.270
We've done it.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.530
It's really cool.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.920
It looks great,
but at any for everybody and

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.010
it sure as heck isn't portable.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.840
That is not the traditional way to go.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.880
You shoot to tape and off you go.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.090
All right.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:21:13.900
[Transcript missing]

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.320
Obviously,
this is all a huge breakthrough in value.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:22.280
You have a HD editing system that
essentially costs less than $5,000.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.100
That including the deck and the camera,
but we're not talking about shooting,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:25.860
we're talking about editing.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.560
So under $5,000,
you have everything you need

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.100
to edit high-definition video.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:53.300
[Transcript missing]

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.020
The price of this thing, well,
$9.99 for Final Cut Pro HD,

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.740
and a $3.99 upgrade from
the previous versions,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.630
but it is a free upgrade
for Final Cut Pro 4 users.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.960
I had somebody ask me earlier,
I just bought 4, now you have 4 HD.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.840
It's the same thing.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.330
Just run software update, it'll download,
and off you go.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.720
Alright, enough of that.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.380
Let's get into the good stuff.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:13.950
Any questions?

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.430
Oh, by the way, question-wise,
feel free to shout out questions

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.370
while we're going here.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.800
We have a total of 75 minutes.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.840
I've got 55 minutes left in this demo.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.750
I can save time at the end for Q&A,
which I'm going to at least

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.720
save like five minutes,
but we can save more than that.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.660
But I encourage you to shout
out questions as they come up.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.660
If you're close to the microphone
and you can step up to it,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.140
great.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.330
If not, just shout it out at me and
I'll repeat the question so that

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.930
it can be recorded onto tape.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.200
But feel free to ask questions
throughout this project.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:42.200
Thanks.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.170
There's the actual reel
that we played back in HD.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.770
Let's just go ahead and close this out.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.760
And here is the project that
I'm going to be building.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.140
I'm going to go ahead and play
this back to see the piece that

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.020
we're going to be building.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.910
Again, as I mentioned in the beginning,
this is the same project

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.480
that I did in the last demo,
but I'm going to this time focus

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.230
on the more advanced features
and less on the more basic stuff.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.010
So let's just go ahead and
take a quick look at the final

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.190
piece that we're creating here.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:26:46.100
[Transcript missing]

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.800
And if I want to isolate that search down
or narrow the search down a little bit,

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.810
I can go in here and command
click on these various

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.330
buttons to refine the search.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.000
Let's just say drums clean.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.170
Let's go for some clean drums.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.840
Now I have 568 drums that have
been tagged as clean drums.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.130
If I want to refine that even more,
clean intense drums down to 42.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.640
And you see where we're going here.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.450
All right,
so that's basically how you go about

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.590
finding the pieces that you want.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.520
So regardless of whether you have
an idea in your head of what you

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.360
want to create or you're just
going completely blind at this,

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.290
you can just go in and start
clicking around and just spend all

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.030
day clicking on different samples,
find something you like, and go, ooh,

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:38.890
I like that vibe.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.820
Let's build off of that,
and then start to stack the pieces.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.530
Now, the way that you add pieces into
the project is simply drag and drop.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.910
I take this little club beat here and
just drag it onto the timeline like that.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:48.910
Or let's go ahead and scroll
down in here a little bit.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:29:00.700

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.650
You can see like this first upright bass,
it dropped two levels there,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.880
dropped like a quarter octave
or something like that.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.700
I don't know, I'm not a musician.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.900
Little tambourines in there.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:25.000
[Transcript missing]

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.010
If you're using the Pro HD,
you can export this as a stack so

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.900
that you can actually play the music.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:39.500
It's a standard stereo mix-down
pair of all of this mixed

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.610
down to a single stereo file.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.320
Bring that into Final Cut and edit.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.510
And that's what I've done and
I'll show you that in a second.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.050
Or you could export this out as
a stack so that you can actually

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.060
give every individual file,
every individual instrument rather,

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.440
as a separate file off to your musician.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.150
Then the musician can reassemble
those in Logic or Pro Tools,

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.970
whatever they're using,
and further enhance your work or throw

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.750
it all away and start from scratch.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:15.430
So what I've done in here is I've
chosen export mix that exported out

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.970
that mix as a single stereo file,
which if I go back to Final Cut,

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.610
I already have in here and there
is that stereo file in there.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.500
So I'm not going to spend a
whole lot of time on the basics,

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.910
but I do want to fly through
building some of these pieces.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.040
So I'm actually going to move
really fast for a couple steps here.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.340
I want to build up the
basics of this project.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.420
Again, being the advanced course,
I'm assuming that people understand

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.640
the basics of marking in and out
points and doing stuff like that.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.840
So I'm just going to go ahead and fly
through it so you can see me building it.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.020
And of course,
I'll talk through what I'm doing.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.560
But feel free, once again,
to interrupt me if you want to go, wait,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.640
what did you just do?

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.100
Feel free to interrupt me on there.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.350
So I'm going to start with
a blank canvas on here.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.540
Blank canvas on there.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.800
Take this double treble beat on here,
and I'm going to find the pitch

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.700
change that is somewhere in the
first measure or second measure.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.770
There's the pitch change there,
so let's just go ahead and

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.880
zoom into that on the timeline,
and I will mark that pitch change.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.820
By tapping the M key,
I've just added a marker on there,

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.330
and I know that that is a pitch change.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.060
And if I play this
forward a little bit more,

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.980
I'll find the second pitch change,
which should be right about here.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.780
There we go.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.380
So once again,
zoom into that to make sure

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.550
I have it accurate there,
add a marker on that

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.930
place on the timeline,
and then take the entire audio track,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.560
drag it onto the timeline like so.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.040
Now I have this audio on the timeline
with the two markers applied at the

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.700
pitch change so that I know that if
I want to edit to those pitch changes,

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.980
those markers are already in place there.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.450
So let's go ahead and get our
first piece of media on there.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.530
I have this great indigo
flower shot in here.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.980
I can mark in and outs manually on there
by simply tapping the I and the O key

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.820
on the keyboard to mark my in and outs,
or let's go ahead and clear those out.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.580
I can make a final duration by
simply typing in a number up here.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.070
So in this case,
I'll say two seconds and four frames.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.420
And I know I want two seconds
and four frames because if

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.910
I look down at the timeline here,
the first beat is at four

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.380
seconds and nine frames,
and I want about half of that.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.600
So cut it in half, give or take,
call it two seconds, four frames.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.470
There's a two second, four frame shot.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.180
That I've now added
to the timeline there.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.160
This golden wheat shot,
I'm going to also mark

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.060
an in and out point.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.700
This time I'll do it numerically
in the sense that I know exactly

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.240
where the in and the out should be.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.960
Someone's told me where they go.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.110
This little window up here
shows me that readout.

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.410
So let's just go up here and
type in the time that I want,

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:24.560
which is two hours, 15 minutes,
44 seconds and 20 frames.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.370
Hit return, and the playhead jumps to
that point just like that.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.850
Now you're thinking,
why on earth is this clip listed as

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:33.390
15 hours long or whatever it was,
or two hours and 15 minutes long?

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.780
Well, this is a piece off of a tape.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.580
And generally when you're shooting
in a professional environment,

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.650
every new tape is going
to have a new hour on it,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.230
so that you have no chance
of duplicate time code.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.160
So every single tape,
if you're going to shoot 100 tapes,

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.340
the hour is one through 100.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.190
And you will take that hour one tape
and pop it in and start recording.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.270
And then when you are
capturing your footage,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.090
if you see something
that comes from hour two,

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.160
15 minutes,
you know that that is on tape too.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.510
There's no question about it.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:00.990
So that's why you have the
long time code on there.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.820
So let's just go ahead and
mark an in point right there.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.620
And I'm going to put my out point
at a specific point as well,

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.500
which let's just rearrange this
so I can see my notes in here.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.860
This is a nice little function in here,
by the way,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.620
the ability to resize and readjust your
interface by simply dragging on any point

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.920
between the interface windows in there,
which is kind of cool.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.590
Let's shrink that down a little bit.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.040
When you're on a small working
space like this is here,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.150
that becomes very, very handy,
because otherwise you'll

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.040
just always be lost.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.330
All right, let's go ahead and type
in the new time there,

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.180
215, 48, 23, hit return.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.420
It brings me to that point on that clip,
mark an out point,

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.200
and then just drag and drop that
directly onto the timeline as well.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.360
So now I have these two shots on here.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.670
And let's go ahead and
take this last shot,

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.700
the Japanese lanterns,
drop that on there as well.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.690
Notice this last shot here
has a cool focus shift in it.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.470
Now I want to take advantage of that
focus shift to line it up to an event,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.340
in this case an audio pitch change,
a musical pitch change.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.600
Let's go ahead and open this
clip into the viewer here,

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.300
scrub through it,
and I'll look for that focus change.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.140
It's right about there.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.260
Now the focus change
obviously happens over time,

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.200
and the musical beat is
happening on an instant.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.340
So we're going to have a
little bit of slop in here,

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.860
but let's just go ahead
and put that marker,

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.420
let's say, right about there,
just partway into that change.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.620
I'll add a marker on the timeline there.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.070
And if I want to edit that marker by
simply tapping the M key a second time,

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.560
I open up my edit marker,
and I can add in here text, for example,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.490
focus shift, and now I know that that's
where my focus shift occurs.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.170
Going back to the timeline here,
you'll notice that I have on here my

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.600
clip with that marker that I applied,
and then this marker on the audio track

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.580
showing me where that pitch shift was.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.700
I want to line up those two instances,
so to do that I will use the slip tool,

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.100
which I simply grab from here,
click on that marker,

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.640
and drag the two markers to line up.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.220
Now the slip tool very briefly
allows me to essentially reach

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.500
in through a window of time.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.580
If I've got a five second long clip,
and I've marked one second of that,

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.610
I'm reaching into that one second
and changing the content of that one

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.010
second without changing the duration.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.600
By doing that,
I'm effectively changing the in point

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.580
and the out point simultaneously,
but all I'm seeing is the final output,

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.310
the final in and out,
and I don't have to deal with

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.280
the stuff in the background.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.800
So if I look at this now playing back,
it should line up on the beat somewhat.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:16.660
There we go.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.940
All right,
so now I have those clips in there.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.480
I think that works out pretty well.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.500
Let's go ahead and move
on to the next piece.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.960
Next thing I want to do
is talk about transitions.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.980
Obviously, transitions,
you've all seen them in Final Cut Pro.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.340
You have your basic default cross-resolve
transition in here that I can add,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.210
or I can go into my effects tab,
open up my transitions folder,

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.750
and get through any of
these other transitions.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.020
Notice in here, I actually have quite
a few third-party ones.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.510
I think Joe is in the audience this time.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.500
Sorry, Joe,
I don't have yours installed on this one,

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.350
but there's a lot of
third-party filters out there,

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.890
third-party plugins for Final Cut Pro,
which is just great.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.030
Absolutely great.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.540
Actually, some of my favorite ones
are from third-party.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.190
Let's just quickly take
a look at how these work.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.800
I can go ahead and
change any of these out.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.680
For example, try Diamond Iris.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.690
Just drag and drop that
on and play that back.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.280
I want to try a channel map on here.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.790
Let's see what that looks like.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:03.840
Drop that on.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:39.800
[Transcript missing]

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.650
This is a G5 2.0, right?

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.890
These aren't 2.5s, right?

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.350
It's 2.0?

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.300
2.0.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:45.920
2.0, yeah.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.920
This is a 2.0.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.690
All running off the internal hard drive.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.570
I threatened to bring my RAID up here,
but frankly, my back couldn't take it,

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.660
so I decided not to.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.630
I'm doing this entire demonstration
off of a single internal drive,

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.690
not even a stripe drive,
just one internal drive.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:07.400
[Transcript missing]

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.400
Alright,
so there's basic transitions in there.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.890
Let's go ahead and take a look
quickly at some basic compositing.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.870
The shots that I'm going to work
with are this shot here of the

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.570
Golden Gate Bridge and that one.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.130
I'm going to go ahead and take this
first one and add it onto the timeline.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.140
And of course if I play this through,
it's just playing back normally.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.840
What I want to do is composite
this shot on top of it.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:32.060
Now if I take this shot and I just drag
it on top of the timeline like that,

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.200
you'll see that it's actually
bigger than the shot underneath.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.340
So I can trim this back manually,
but that's a multiple step way to do it.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.120
So instead of doing that,
I'll go back up here with the playhead

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.070
above the clip that I'm working with,
take this shot, drag it on,

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.490
and choose superimpose.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.460
That automatically trims the shot
to match the one underneath it.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.400
So now I have the top shot exactly
the same size as the bottom one.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.640
And if I want to go in here
and change the end point,

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.620
I can simply click and drag like that.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.150
And find a position to put that.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.240
Let's just go ahead and line it
up with this next bead in here.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:37:59.950
I think that's where I want it.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.520
So what we've just done here is
effectively like any other edit.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.460
It doesn't look like there's any good
reason to have multiple clips on here,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.830
but this is where we're going to get
into the compositing side of things.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.890
What I want to do is have both of these
images on screen at the same time.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.080
So to do this, I need to get into
some basic compositing,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.730
cropping, repositioning, and so on.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.940
Now if I crop and reposition
this bottom clip here,

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.630
it's going to affect the entire clip.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.350
I don't want the entire clip affected.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.270
I want the first part of
the shot to be normal,

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.100
so I need to use my razor blade tool.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.610
Tap B on the keyboard to
bring up my razor blade.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.980
Simply add a little slice right there,
and I now have this shot.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.060
I don't want that behaving
as a separate piece.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.860
So if I go in here and
I start editing these,

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.040
I can edit them separately
from the first part.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.240
So let's go ahead and take
this top shot on here,

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:47.000
and I'm going to go into wireframe
plus image mode by tapping

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.180
the W key on the keyboard.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.660
That means I can see both my image
and the wireframe simultaneously.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.630
If I wanted to go in
here and reposition this,

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.390
I could do that.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.000
I can scale it however I like on here.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.830
If I want to go in here and grab,
for example, the distortion tool,

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.740
I can do that and distort that image.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.160
And this is all going to
play back in real time.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.220
Let's just go ahead
and take a quick look.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:05.960
Let's get that in there.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.650
Distort like so, and I can play all
this back in real time.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.900
So that's pretty good.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.090
Now,
motion allows you to actually make those

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.750
kind of changes while it's playing back.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.610
Motion's unbelievable.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.820
But obviously,
motion is all about motion graphics.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.100
So this is a video editor,
so we don't quite go

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.560
into that realm in here.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.020
But you're going to see that
I actually have a considerable amount

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.000
of motion graphics and compositing
tools built right into Final Cut Pro.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.370
So let's just go ahead and
reset these two because I've

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.930
kind of messed them up there.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.400
And a way to reset
your functions in here,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.980
instead of having to go into
the motion tab and reset,

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:43.260
reset, reset, I can simply take a clip,
control click on it, and choose, oh,

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.230
where is it?

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:44.920
I know the keyboard shortcut.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.350
Here it is.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.380
Remove attributes.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.030
Remove attributes brings up
a dialog that says remove X,

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.780
Y, and Z.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.640
And in this case,
I can remove basic motion and distortion.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:55.290
I don't have filters or speed effects
or anything else applied to it,

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.740
so you can see that they're grayed out.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.230
Let's just go ahead and say remove
basic motion and distortion,

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.520
and it'll set that back to normal.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.940
And I'm also going to do the same
thing to the clip underneath.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.620
Hit the keyboard shortcut to
remove basic motion on there.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.720
All right,
so both these shots are back to normal.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.700
Let's go ahead and take that shot,
bring up my crop tool

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.630
by tapping the C key,
and I'm just going to crop

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.260
that image in like so.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.680
Now, I can, of course,
do this manually as I'm doing here.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.610
I can go in here and just
adjust these like that.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.620
Or if I want to get a little
bit more control over it,

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.730
over here in the viewer,
if I click on the motion tab,

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.510
you'll see that I have
access to my cropping,

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.420
basic motion controls, and so on.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.280
So I like to work with solid numbers
when I'm doing this sort of thing

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.110
because it makes it easier if I'm
going to calculate changes later

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.650
for me to do the math in my head.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.410
So I'm just going to go in here
and punch in some solid numbers.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:40.780
I'm going to go ahead and crop
the left side just down to three,

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.550
and I'll bring the right side up to N52,
and then I'm going to crop the

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.320
top and bottom both down three.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.570
So there you can see I've
got exactly the right crop.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.120
It's exactly cropped on the
top and bottom the same amount.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.900
I know exactly where I'm headed here.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.120
Let's go ahead and take the shot
underneath and do the same thing.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.840
I can, once again,
go in here and do these numerically,

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.930
or I can just drag them.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.430
Let's just go ahead and
grab that crop tool again,

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.410
drag these shots.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.980
Now, you can see here that I'm going
to need to reposition this shot.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.390
So let's go ahead and crop in this side,
reposition that shot over like that,

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.760
crop it in about like so,
and bring that down and

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.910
this one up to match.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:16.360
And once again,
I do actually want the tops

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.500
and bottoms to match on here.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.980
So let's just go ahead and
open that up into the viewer,

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.220
into the motion tab,
and under the crop controls

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.990
on the top and bottom,
I'll put in exactly three and three.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.530
So now I have exactly the
right numbers in there.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.170
All right, so that looks pretty good.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.630
It's fairly well centered in here.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.910
And if I play this back now,
you'll see that we're obviously

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.350
going from the one shot to the
two up in a basic composite.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.100
So now on to the next step.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.650
I really like the effect
that I've got on here.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.650
What if I want to replicate that effect?

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.500
I want to have it go
to those two squares,

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.170
and I want to have it go to four squares,
or eight squares, or 16 squares,

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.450
and just keep on repeating down.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.250
And I want to have that
happen on the beat.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.980
This is a fairly complex amount of
compositing that we're about to do here,

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.150
but as you'll see,
it's really quite easy to

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.540
do inside of Final Cut.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.680
I'm not going to affect
my first stack here.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.230
I really like the way those are playing,
so I'm going to leave them alone,

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:07.400
but I'm going to copy,
just hit Command-C to copy,

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.970
and then Command-V to paste.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.460
And what I've just done here is
put a duplicate copy of that,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.840
so now I'm seeing the same
thing playing back twice.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:18.410
I'll then take this new stack of clips,
and I'm going to nest them.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.150
Nesting them allows me to
take any number of clips,

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:24.960
no matter how complex it is,
and flatten it down to a single file.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.860
Now when I say flatten,
it's only flattened in the visual sense,

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.860
because you can double-click on
that new nest on your timeline.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.160
And it will open up into a new
project and show you the entire

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.130
sequence that you had built before,
no matter how complex it was,

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:38.160
it's all there.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.130
Which means you can go back
in and edit that at any time.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.640
Now there's other solutions out
there that do a similar effect

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.780
where they collapse everything,
but once you've collapsed it,

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.060
you're toast.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.160
There's no going back and making changes.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.630
So what we've done is allowed
you to simply take a stack,

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.970
now obviously this is very simple,
just two clips.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.480
But I'll take that,
and I'll say nest items,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.160
and I'm going to call that
just Golden Gate Nest.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.910
And I hit OK.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.160
And it adds a new stack.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.600
It adds that nest to the timeline,
so now there's a single

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.980
clip on the timeline,
and if I double-click on it,

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.020
there is the nest that I just created.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.160
There's those two clips.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.090
If I want to make a change to it, I can.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.070
Let's go ahead and close the nest,
go back to the main shot on here.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160
There we go.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.160
And once again, it's a duplicate.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160
Nothing's changed visually in here.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.080
I simply have one shot on here.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.160
But the reason that I did this
is because now that it's a nest,

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:26.160
I can apply a filter to an entire nest,
to an entire series of images at once.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.500
So let's just take a look
at this from a really simple

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.160
perspective for a second here.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.110
So let's just say I'm
doing color correction.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.150
I've got a huge stack of images
that haven't been color corrected.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.160
They're composites,
and there's all kinds of text effects,

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.160
and just all kinds of stuff going on.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.830
And the client looks at it and says,
"That's really great,

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.130
but I want the whole thing
to be bluer." Thanks.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.160
So that means you've got
a thousand clips in here.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.160
You have to go individually
color correct each one.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.490
Well, with the nesting function,
I can take all those clips,

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.270
nest them into a single clip,
and apply a color correction

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:55.040
to the nest itself.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.000
And then any change that I make
will be applied to that nest.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.150
So that's basically what
I'm going to do here.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.110
But I'm not going to do color correction.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.160
I'm going to use a replicate filter.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.160
So let's go ahead and
find the replicate filter.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.160
I've got it saved off here as a favorite.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.150
Here it is, my replicate filter.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.000
And by the way,
all your effects are stored over here,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.160
of course, in the effects tab.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.080
And they're stored somewhere
here in video filters.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.160
And if I couldn't find the
one that I'm looking for,

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.160
I'd say, "Oh, I know there's a replicate
filter somewhere,

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.370
but I don't know where it is." The find
function inside Final Cut Pro will

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.140
also find filters and effects.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.380
So I can go in here
and type in replicate,

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.160
hit return, and it shows me that I have a
replicate in my CGM effects.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.160
And I have another one
in my stylized effects.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.160
So I've got two replicate
filters in here to choose from.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.000
Kind of nice.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.160
All right, so let's go back over here.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.080
I've already saved out
the replicate filter.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.160
I'm just going to drag
this onto the nest itself.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.090
And as you can see,
it's immediately applied

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.160
its default setting,
and it's replicated that.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.160
Now, this is a little tip in here.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.160
If you're used to doing filters
and effects in Final Cut,

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.160
you're used to adding
an effect to a clip.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.050
And then you can double-click that
clip into the viewer and access

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.160
the filters and effects tabs,
right?

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.160
So if I double-click
on the CG nest in here,

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.130
it's simply going to open the nest.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.160
Well, where's my filter?

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.760
If I open these up,
you'll see the filter's not

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.110
applied here because it hasn't
applied it individually.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.160
So what happened to it?

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.160
Well, let's go back to the timeline.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.100
And what you need to do is actually
open this object into the viewer itself.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.160
Now, I can do that multiple ways.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.160
I can simply drag this
up into the viewer,

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.160
and it opens it into the viewer.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.160
And now I have access to the
filter that I just added.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.070
Or I can control-click on
here and say open in viewer.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.220
And the shortcut for that is
to simply hit Option-Return,

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.160
and it will-- That's the wrong one.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.150
Maybe it's Command-Return.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.500
You know, you think you know everything.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.200
Command, return, option, option,
double click.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:36.630
That was it.

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:37.670
I knew it was something like that.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.100
Option, double click.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.180
We'll open that up.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.840
But this is a perfect segue.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.960
I meant to do that.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.560
This is a perfect segue into one of the
great new functions of Final Cut Pro,

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.600
and that's the mappable keyboard.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.420
I obviously don't remember what
the keyboard shortcut is for that,

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.500
and maybe there isn't one.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.520
Let's find out.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.570
I'll hit option H, because I do remember
that keyboard shortcut,

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.900
to bring up my mappable keyboard.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.450
This was introduced in 4.0,
Final Cut Pro 4.0.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:02.020
This allows me to remap
any keyboard function.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.120
Basically, anything that's in the menus,
I can change the keyboard shortcut,

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.790
or apply a new one,
or put one where there

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:07.690
didn't used to be one.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:12.960
I want to find open in viewer,
so I'll just type in open in viewer,

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.140
and apparently there is no keyboard
shortcut available for that.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.840
Sweet.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.710
That's why you have to
control-click on it.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.180
We knew that.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:20.190
There we go.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.640
Anyway, in here,
if you wanted to change the

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.480
keyboard shortcut for anything else,
since I'm in here,

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.520
let's say you wanted to change
the keyboard shortcut for

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.540
something as simple as open.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.580
You see on here it's listed as command-O.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.420
That's your standard
default keyboard shortcut.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:35.680
If I look over here at my modifying tabs,
there's the command, there's O,

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.700
there's the open command.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.440
Let's say that I want to change that.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.590
I want to make it command-option F9.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.570
I don't know why, but you do.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.580
I can take this open command,
let's unlock the keyboard here,

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.340
take that open command,
drag that onto here,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.390
and now you see command-O and
command-option F9 are available

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.140
with keyboard shortcuts.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.170
If you change your mind,
you can simply take that and drag it off,

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.040
and off it goes.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.640
You've changed the
keyboard shortcut again.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.380
You can save keyboard shortcut
layouts if you want to,

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.420
which means if you're working
with multiple editors,

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.040
you can have different
layouts for different editors.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.220
Also, this means that if you are coming
from an alternate editing system,

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.540
for example,
you're coming from Premiere or

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.750
you're coming from the Avid,
and you want to use the same

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.480
keyboard shortcuts that you've
been using for the last 10 years,

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.000
you don't have to learn everything anew.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.400
You can reprogram this, or actually,
if you look around on

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.660
the net a little bit,
you'll find pre-built custom

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.750
keyboard layouts that people have
created and shared on the net,

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.910
and you can just download those,
load one in, and then off you go.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.350
All right.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.080
Let's go ahead back on to the edit here.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.000
We're back to having this
nest open in the viewer by

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.380
simply saying open in viewer.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.670
There she is, and here's the filters tab.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.880
The filter, by default,
this replicate filter,

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.260
had applied a two-by-two replication.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.480
You can see I've got two instances
horizontal and two instances vertical.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.630
What I want to have happen is,
roughly on the beat,

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.090
I want to have it go from two
replications to three replications.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.840
This is key framing of filter effects.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.120
Down here in my timeline
inside of the viewer,

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:00.960
because you always have a
miniature timeline in the viewer,

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.580
I can scrub the playhead.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.830
You'll notice as I do this,
it's scrubbing on both the

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:06.790
canvas and the timeline as well,
so I always know exactly

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:07.490
where I'm looking.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.080
I'm just going to split this
roughly down the middle here,

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.870
say right about there,
and I'm going to add a keyframe.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.830
Simply click on these little nubs
there to add keyframes to it.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.100
Now, initially, nothing happens.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.930
The default setting was two and two,
and I've locked a keyframe

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:20.820
in there at two and two.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.340
But if I advance forward one frame,
so with the keyboard, just the arrow key,

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.890
advance forward one frame,
I'm then going to go

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.520
ahead and punch in three,
and three.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.350
I'll just use little arrows there
to punch that up a little bit,

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.860
and I've now gone from two
to two to three by three.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.220
Now, this could be anything,
and this could be any number,

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.890
and most of these filter effects
you can gradually do over time.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.010
Now, the replicate filter,
there's nothing between

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:44.880
two and three replications,
so it's going to jump

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.310
immediately from two to three,
which is why I went ahead and just did

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.170
that second keyframe one frame forward.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.300
But if, for example,
you're doing a Gaussian blur from

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.950
one pixel blur to a ten pixel blur,
if you put that out with

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.980
100 frames in between,
it's going to stretch that blur

00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.280
effect out over 100 frames.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.060
If you put in one frame after the other,
it's going to effectively go instantly

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.290
from that low blur to the high blur.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.540
All right, so there I have that low blur,
I'm sorry, the two by two replicate

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.960
followed by the three by three.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.080
Let's go ahead and play that back
and see what it looks like now.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.760
"Okay, that didn't work.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.800
What happened?

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.060
Did it work or just didn't play?

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.750
I think I may be exceeding
my real-time capabilities of

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:29.780
playing off the internal drive,
so I'm just going to drop

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:33.700
the quality here from high to
medium just to play this back.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:34.150
Let's see what

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.080
There we go.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.820
Did it do that the first
time and I just missed it?

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.620
Yes, I'm a pro.

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.210
Can you tell?

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.490
All right, so there we go.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:46.400
Back to high quality.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.820
That's much better.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.900
OK, so there's your basic-- sorry?

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.940
He asked about the timeline.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.290
Why did it just turn orange up there?

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:00.960
This color bar up here is representative
of your real-time status in here.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.520
Real-time in earlier
versions of Final Cut Pro,

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.800
from version 2 and version 3,
you either had a green bar,

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.100
which meant it was real-time,
or a red bar,

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:12.220
which meant it had to be rendered,
or a dark blue bar that said

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.050
it was already rendered.

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:15.510
He asked about the timeline.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.720
Why did it just turn orange up there?

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.890
Why did it just turn orange up there?

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:19.460
Real-time in earlier
versions of Final Cut Pro HD,

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.340
you either had a green bar,
which meant it had to be rendered,

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.810
or a red bar that said
it was already rendered.

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:23.870
So those are your three choices.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:26.140
Then we went into real-time extreme,
RT Extreme with Final Cut Pro 4.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.090
RT Extreme, as I mentioned earlier,
allows you to change the quality

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.270
of your image playback and gain
or lose real-time capabilities.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.920
So green bar still means
it's a real-time effect.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.730
If you have a dark green bar,
that means it's a guaranteed,

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.830
full-quality real-time effect.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.570
Full-quality meaning that it
doesn't even have to render

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:37.470
before it goes out to tape.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.410
Now, there's not a whole lot you
get there on today's machines.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.090
The next generation of
machines will give you more,

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.020
and so you'll have to make sure
that you have a real-time effect.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.760
So, for example,
now I can do things on a G5,

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.640
like take high-definition footage,
apply color correction to two clips,

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.240
and it crosses all between them,
and never have to render,

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:55.970
not even before it goes back to tape.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:57.540
So this isn't real-time preview.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.340
This is full-quality real-time.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.140
Once it goes to that bright green bar,
that means it's real-time,

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.390
but does require rendering
before output to tape.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.140
The orange bar means that
you're in RT Extreme land.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:10.040
This is saying, whoa,
ain't promising nothing here.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.270
You may drop a frame,
your quality may be a little bit shoddy,

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.020
but we're going to do our job.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.230
So, for example,
if I go back to this effect here,

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:23.080
you'll notice that it
went orange in there.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.460
It is saying that it's going to do
its best to play back in real-time,

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.660
and in this case, it's no problem.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.740
It's doing it fine.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.380
It may have actually
skipped a frame in there.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:29.830
Who knows?

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:30.570
It doesn't matter.

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:31.510
We're seeing it play back.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:33.250
It's keeping up-to-date
the whole time in there,

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:34.850
and I know because it's an orange bar.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.860
Now,
I could keep applying effects to this.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.520
That bar will effectively never
change colors as long as I'm

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.050
adding real-time effects to it.

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:44.000
I could add 30 filters on here,
and it'll still try to play back.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.020
Now, clearly,
you're going to hit a threshold

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.800
where it's no longer going
to be able to play back.

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:50.910
It's going to stutter really bad,
but it's going to keep on trying,

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:54.140
and again, the faster your machine,
the more you're able to do.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:57.790
So, that's the significance of the
colored render bars up there.

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:01.980
Does nesting affect performance?

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.040
I'm not quite sure how you mean.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.980
If you take a nest and you render that,
you can then apply filters and

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.870
effects to that rendered nest.

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:13.360
And so let's say that I take 50
effects and I apply them to a nest.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.780
That ain't going to put
it back in real time.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.820
But I collapse the nest, render it,
and then apply color

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:18.000
correction to the nest.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:20.110
I can do real-time color
correction on that nest.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.630
So by using nests,
you can improve performance of

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.960
things that have just gotten so
complex it's bogging the system down.

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.990
Is that what you meant?

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.470
You can nest nests.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.750
Yes, you can do multiple nests.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:33.840
There's unlimited nesting.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.560
Just go to your heart's content.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.550
All right,
so there's that effect applied on there.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:41.420
Let's see what's next in the list.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.410
All right, time remap.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.250
I did this one in the last demo,
but since obviously some

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.060
of you haven't been here,
we'll do this one again.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.060
This is a fun effect in here.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.780
You may have remembered
from the beginning when

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.740
I first played back the shot,
you saw the pool break hit twice, right,

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:56.720
twice on the beat.

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:58.330
Here's the original shot in here.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:01.280
It's playing along, pool ball breaks,
and off it goes.

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.180
And what I want to do is apply
this time remapping effect in here.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.250
So first thing I need to do is figure out
where to put that break on the timeline.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.540
So let's have a listen to the music here.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:31.400
[Transcript missing]

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.910
Okay, there we go.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.320
So let's just go ahead and put a
marker on the audio clip right there,

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.400
and then take this shot,
drag it onto the timeline.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.590
Now I can put this wherever I want.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.150
Obviously I want to line up
those two markers like so,

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:44.920
so now when I play it back...

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.390
We're seeing that.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.360
Now I said that I want to have that beat,
the break happened twice,

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.320
again on the second beat,
so let's listen for the next

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.570
round of that beat in there.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.710
Music

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:53.100
[Transcript missing]

00:56:59.160 --> 00:56:59.900
So off to a good start.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.720
I've got the break
happening twice on the beat,

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:04.360
but the ball, the cue ball,
is not going back to the

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.590
stick between those shots.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.090
And I really want that to happen,
so we're going to add one more key

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.740
frame in here in between these two.

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.020
So I've got the key frame
there saying I want to make

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.570
sure my balls go out that far.

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:16.710
And then the key frame here
saying that's the second break.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:18.710
Let's go ahead and put one in between.

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:21.400
Click and drag,
and I will carefully drag that back to

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.780
just about where the ball hits the cue.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.050
Let's go right about there.

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:25.580
Perfect.

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.280
And once again,
you can see it's going down steeper.

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.930
It's going forward now,
but not quite at full speed.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:33.080
And let's just see what it looks like.

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:41.000
Cool, huh?

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.970
Question?

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:43.780
Interpolation types.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:47.300
So you can do, what do you call it?

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:49.600
What do you call that
kind of interpolation?

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:50.160
I forget.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.170
Time remapping tool.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:51.930
Frame blending.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.440
Yeah, you have frame blending
that you can turn on or off,

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.560
and an effect like this
is absolutely critical.

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:58.380
You have it on,
it will look like rubbish.

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.900
Certain effects you'll find
that you want to turn it off.

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:03.870
It just depends on what you're doing
and the speed of the speed change,

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:05.730
whether you want frame
blending on or off.

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.950
The type of interpolation it uses,
I have no idea.

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:08.600
I'm not an engineer.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:08.600
I see it.

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:12.540
Oh, okay.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.340
So the question is, can I go ease in,
ease out on here?

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:14.840
Yes, I can.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.590
I can simply go down here and
control click and choose smooth,

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.420
and there it will ease in, ease out.

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.350
Let's go ahead and smooth
both of those points in there.

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.470
And now as I play that back,
it'll be a little...

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:44.100
[Transcript missing]

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.710
The question is,
is the time change adjusting

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.810
being applied to all tracks?

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:51.790
No, this is clip specific.

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:54.810
So if I wanted to apply an effect
like this to multiple clips,

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.830
I would nest the clips and then
apply the time change or the

00:58:57.830 --> 00:58:59.570
time remap to the nest itself.

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:03.430
All right, let's move on here.

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:06.780
I wanted to spend a little bit
of time on-- let's see here.

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.000
Do I want to do-- let's see here.

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:09.250
Since we're-- how are we doing on time?

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.820
We've got 20 minutes total.

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:13.100
As I said in the beginning,
I love to have the questions

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.530
come flying at me throughout.

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.320
Is there a number-- can I see a
show of hands how many people were

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:19.070
holding questions off to the end?

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:54.100
[Transcript missing]

00:59:55.000 --> 01:01:10.600
[Transcript missing]

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.900
All right, so back to this.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.680
Where were we?

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.540
I wanted to apply something
on this beat there.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.640
Let's make sure we get the beat lined up.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:18.420
So right about there.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.330
I'm going to go ahead and take this shot,
and I'll just do an overwrite edit,

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.980
applying that on the beat like so.

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:28.120
So as you can see there, that shot,
it's the duration I like.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.160
I've preset the duration so
I don't want to mess with that.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.450
But you'll see that I'm missing
the whole part where he puts

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:34.790
the cup back down again.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.560
He's holding the cup,
he's having a drink, yada yada.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.620
We don't want to look at all that.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.450
We want to cut that out.

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.900
So let's go ahead and
scrub using the keyboard,

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.040
just the arrow keys.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.550
I'm going to scrub to the first
frame where you can't see the cup.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.620
Tap the B key to get
the razor blade tool.

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.990
Cut that so that I've
now trimmed that shot.

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:53.300
Using the slip tool,
tap the S key to bring up the slip tool.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.680
I will click on this and drag
backwards and backwards and

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:59.550
backwards until I see the end point,
the end frame,

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:03.120
which is that top left inside the canvas.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.190
Once I see the cup on there,
I'll know that I'm at the right spot.

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.460
So let's keep dragging, dragging,
dragging.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.160
There it is.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:07.640
Whoa, too fast.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.380
Crap, come back here.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.830
Let's see here.

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:12.060
There we go.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.020
Right about there.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.200
I want it just before that
cup comes back in the picture.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.630
I let go of the mouse and
once again with the slip tool,

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.110
I have changed the end point and
the out point simultaneously without

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:23.100
affecting the overall duration.

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.080
And now I've just created a jump cut.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.690
The next thing I want to do is
add some motion graphics effects

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.220
to the end of this shot here.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.600
I'm going to add a few stills you
may remember from the final playback.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.760
Let's actually just take a quick
look at it so you can see ahead of

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:40.040
time what I'm going to be building.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.190
I'm going to build this.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:03:25.900
[Transcript missing]

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.300
So let's just go ahead and
shorten that up to about like so.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.590
So now I have that clip, that duration.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:38.730
So there's my first frame of
the still in there of that cup.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.020
Let's go ahead and zoom
back into these shots here.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:41.900
I'm going to open this up.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.060
I'm going to grab my second frame.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.440
Let's go about halfway down on the cup.

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:47.050
Shift N again makes the still frame.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:49.540
And this time I'm going
to choose superimpose,

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:53.700
which will superimpose that shot,
the new one, on top of the original one.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.630
If I hide that using Control B,
you can see the difference

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.660
between the two.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.080
Obviously I can just delete that.

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:00.500
And undo it to do the same thing.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.400
Control B, by the way, is a very,
very handy shortcut to very

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.040
quickly hide any group or any
number of things on the timeline.

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.860
Someone asked me in the last demo if
you can hide an entire track at once.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.960
Yes, that's what this little
button right here does.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.060
It hides that entire track.

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.310
So if I want to hide all of track two,
I can do that.

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:18.510
And if I Option click on it,
let's scale this down so you

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:20.280
can see the whole thing at once.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:20.840
There we go.

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:23.810
If I Option click on one of these,
it hides everything but that track.

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:27.420
So there's lots of little keyboard
shortcuts like that nested away in here.

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:27.650
All

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:59.000
[Transcript missing]

01:04:59.400 --> 01:04:59.660
There we go.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:00.620
There's my little stepping stone.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.460
Now that's the first part of it.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.650
As you saw before, I need to crop these,
so I'm seeing all three of them at once,

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:07.020
and apply a color effect to it.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.400
So you saw me do cropping before.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.320
There's really nothing different in here.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.730
I can go in here, open up this shot,
or just position the playhead

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:16.390
over it on the timeline,
and using the cropping tool,

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.980
I can go in here and crop this
and position it however I like.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.080
Now let's just say that you're
doing this sort of thing,

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.650
but you're doing it over and over
again for the same type of work.

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:25.500
Basically,
I'm going to create the same effect

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.680
multiple times with a similar shot,
and I really don't want to have to do the

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:32.820
same cropping and repositioning and color
effects over and over and over again.

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:37.420
So what I want to do is save the crops
and save the motion effects as a preset.

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.060
Well, you can do that in something
called a motion favorite.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.750
So if I select this clip here,
let's just say I want to save the

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.620
settings that I've got right there.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.940
I can go up here and say effects,
make favorite effect,

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.320
and that's going to save all
the effects associated with

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.700
that clip into a little file.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.730
In fact, let's just do that,
and if I go back to my

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:56.240
effects tab in here,
up to the top, favorites,

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.920
I've got quite a few in here,
but where's the one I just created?

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.900
I don't know which one it is.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.620
Oh, one cappuccino should be.

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.740
Oh, that's favorite effects.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:05.270
That's the wrong one.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.080
Where do we keep those?

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.290
They're somewhere in here.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.670
I don't remember where they saved them.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.160
That's hysterical.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.260
I have no idea where that saved it to.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.520
Oh, well, anyway,
they saved them somewhere in there.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:15.830
You'll find them.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:18.600
So once they've been saved,
you can reposition them or

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.100
put them wherever you like,
and I've done that already.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.980
If I look under here,
under my graphics effects,

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.050
you'll see I have my motion
favorites that I've already saved.

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:26.880
Saved off.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.310
So there's three different
motion favorites that I've

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:30.770
created for these three stills.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.570
If I drag this onto here,
it's going to overwrite the effects

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.600
that are on there and reposition
it exactly as I had set up before.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.000
So since I don't want to go through
repositioning all these over again,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.180
I'll simply take still two and
drag it onto still two on there.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.960
So there's the second one applied,
and let's go ahead and put the

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.850
third one on there as well,
like so.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:51.300
So now I'm seeing all
three of these like that.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:08:30.900
[Transcript missing]

01:08:36.100 --> 01:10:04.500
[Transcript missing]

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:07.340
Just drag that right onto
the timeline like so.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.460
And I want to add a
color corrector to it.

01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:10.860
Now,
I went through this very quickly before,

01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:13.060
but I want to spend a little bit
more time on color correction.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.490
If I go into Video Filters--
Color Correction,

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:19.600
Color Corrector Three-Way--
that applies that three-way

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.690
color corrector to this clip.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.490
And here we have my full color corrector.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:29.440
This gives me access to
color values for the blacks,

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.430
the mids, and the whites,
and also the levels to the black, mids,

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:33.140
and whites.

01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:35.300
I'll explain a little bit
about the difference in here.

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:38.080
Let's say that you have something that's
supposed to be white-- a white shirt,

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.700
a white wedding dress, whatever.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.980
It looks a little bit dingy and dark,
and also looks a little bit yellow.

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:45.170
Well, that's two different things
that you need to correct for.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.470
You need to get rid of the yellow,
and you need to brighten it up.

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:51.880
So two separate controls handled
by two separate controls.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.260
You have over here your color adjuster,
and then underneath that, the levels.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.550
So in this case, you can see the white
is very yellowish dingy,

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:01.080
and the blacks are a little
bit kind of funny as well.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.420
So let's go ahead and
work on changing this.

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:06.860
The easiest way to do it-- is
to use the eyedropper here.

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.960
Now, I can go in and change
these by hand if I want to.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.990
I can simply drag this around and
look for the right color space,

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:13.660
or let's just reset that.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.210
By using the eyedropper here, I can say,
these white waves there should be white.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.490
Let's just click on that
and reset it to white.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.900
And if you notice up here,
what's done-- what has just

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.070
happened is the little color
dot has pushed towards blue.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.090
We have added blue,
which of course is the

01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:29.900
same as taking away yellow.

01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:32.800
So by doing that,
I have just fixed my whites.

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.100
I need to fix my blacks as well.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.260
Let's go ahead and grab the eyedropper,
and I'll click on something

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.000
that should be black.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.630
Let's say that shadow right there.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.920
And it warms the image up a little bit.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.390
It was looking a little bit cool.

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:45.880
And I know that to be true
because of my black levels.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.100
Now that they're accurate,
my black is actually black.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:49.940
I can see that my image
is a little bit too cool,

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.840
and I'm now back to a
more normal looking shot.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.570
Now,
if I want to adjust the levels on here

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.620
as well to make the white to actually
white and the black to actually black,

01:11:57.650 --> 01:12:00.450
this requires a little bit more
technical know-how to do it right.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.900
Now,
I can go in here and just drag these,

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.170
right?

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.940
And I can do that and go, oh,
isn't that a pretty white?

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:06.500
That white is definitely blown out.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.760
And I know that it's blown
out if I go up here to my view

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:11.060
and I turn on range checking.

01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:12.680
Let's take a look at excess luma.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.740
I can see these little red lines
on there showing me that I'm

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.370
definitely blowing out this image.

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.280
It's way too bright.

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:19.520
So if I bring down the
sliders a little bit,

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.900
let's bring it down,
you can see those changing

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:22.560
from red to green,
red to green.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.420
Let's get rid of all the red.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.530
And you'll also notice that little
yellow exclamation point telling

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:28.200
me that I'm definitely blown out.

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:30.480
So if I bring this down,
keep bringing it down,

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:32.520
that turns into a green check mark.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.760
The green check mark
tells me that I'm OK.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.640
Green check mark with the little
up arrow tells me that I'm

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:39.000
within the top 10% of white,
which is actually where you

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.320
want to be for your pure whites.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.120
You want to make sure they're within
that top 10%, and you'll be set.

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:45.160
So there I have perfect whites in there.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.080
Now I need to do the
same thing for my blacks.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.640
Now if I do my blacks,
we're not going to see any

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.540
kind of a warning on there,
because the blacks will

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:51.960
just crush to black,
and that's how they're

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.780
going to broadcast.

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:55.920
But I do want to make sure that
I'm not losing any data in here.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.980
This is where the scopes come in handy.

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:00.100
Let's go ahead and rearrange
my window layout here.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.200
Go to my color correction layout.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.780
And here I have my video scopes.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.190
I have four different
things I can view at once.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.370
A vector scope, a histogram,
a waveform monitor, and an RGB parade,

01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:11.680
which is effectively a waveform monitor
split out individually for the red,

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.860
green, and blue channels.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.100
Now actually,
all I'm going to concentrate on

01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:15.050
here is the waveform monitor.

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.180
So let's just go ahead and
view just the waveforms.

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.300
It's a bit more visible.

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:20.280
And if I look at this,
I can see right here that

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.190
I'm crushing my blacks.

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:23.710
Look at all that data that has
been slammed down to the bottom,

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:26.300
and you can see a whole
bunch of junk down there,

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.340
a bunch of pixels that have
been pushed down to the bottom.

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.760
And if I take my black
levels up a little bit,

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.340
I can spread those back out
and restore all those blacks.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.560
And if I go too far-- you can see
that I'm now nowhere near black.

01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:38.060
My blacks are going to be gray.

01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:42.120
So what I want to do is make sure that
this is set so that-- and I can do this

01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:45.480
by clicking the little arrow tool to
go really accurately in there-- I want

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.760
to make sure that my blacks are just
touching the black levels on there.

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:50.040
Same thing with the whites.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:53.360
As you saw before, I can blow it out and
see the warning up here.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.770
If I bring the whites up in here,
it'll go beyond that space and

01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:58.510
shows me here that I'm blowing out.

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:00.460
Now it doesn't crush the
whites like blacks crush.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.260
They just get blown out.

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:03.260
So you see a little bit of
different feedback in there.

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.220
Let's go ahead and bring that down.

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.430
So now not only here am
I seeing that I'm safe,

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.920
I'm also seeing that right there.

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:11.760
So that's how you use your
video scopes in a nutshell.

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.140
There's clearly a lot
more you can do with them,

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.020
but that's a real quick overview of them.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.220
The frame viewer here allows
me to do a before and after

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.730
side by side of the shot.

01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:20.980
So there's your original
and the color corrected one.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.280
And as you can see,
it's quite a dramatic difference there.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.620
Let's open that up a bit.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.060
Quite a dramatic difference
there of the before and after.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.910
This right here, by the way,
is a really good example of why you

01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:33.890
definitely need a 30-inch display.

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:36.130
.

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:38.330
I'll tell you what I told the last guys.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.910
What you really need is a
30-inch and then two 23s.

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:43.650
I'm going to tell you why.

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:45.830
So you've got your main
workspace on your 30-inch.

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:49.930
Your 30-inch display is wide enough
that you can see two 720p images,

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:52.760
720p HD images at 100% side-by-side.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.250
Well, actually 99% because the UI gets
in the way just a smidgen.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.650
Technically, there's enough for 100%. I'm
talking to the engineers about that.

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:01.590
I'm going to see if we can
get that changed a little bit.

01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:03.480
But you can see effectively
the entire HD images,

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.480
two of them side-by-side.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.880
You have a massive amount
of space for your timeline.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.660
Your second HD monitor is where
you put all your browsers.

01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:12.800
Because no matter how much space
you have on your main screen,

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:16.200
you are always going to want
the widest timeline possible.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.350
So this screen could be a mile wide,
and I'm still not going to want to keep

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:22.870
my browsers on here because I'm going
to want this timeline to be really,

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:23.760
really wide.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.520
So I take my browser,
shove that off onto the second monitor.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.770
And if it's as big as a 23-inch monitor,
you've got a lot of space to have

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:32.760
multiple browser windows open,
view it in icon view and list view,

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.030
and you can stretch them out so you
can see all the metadata and so on.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.610
And then the third monitor
is for your video out.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:41.360
You saw what I talked about in
the beginning with the slides,

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.830
the HD preview of the video out.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.890
And that works, of course,
with DV as well.

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:47.000
You can do video out to your DVI monitor.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.910
And in this case,
I had it playing full screen

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:51.310
on this primary screen,
but if you have a second screen,

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.230
it plays out to there.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:54.790
So there's your 30-inch with
all your workspace on it,

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.080
your palettes over here,
your video out over here.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.140
Doesn't that sound like a good way to go?

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.590
We all need one.
