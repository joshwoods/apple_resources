WEBVTT

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.660
Well, good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.050
Welcome.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.680
Session 719,
QuickTime Pro in Your Workflow.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.400
I'm Aimee Nugent,
product manager from Apple for

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.200
the Core Media Technologies.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.280
And I'm here to welcome you today
to a session by Francesco Schiavo.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.470
We're very lucky to have him.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.500
He's been involved with QuickTime both
professionally and as an educator

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.820
for more years than I think he
would prefer I don't reveal.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.650
So everyone, please extend a warm
welcome to Francesco.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.300
And we'll have a great
session and do Q&A at the end.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.670
FRANCISCO SCHIAVO: Thank you very much.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.740
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.100
First of all,
let me get used to the microphone.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.210
So that's the first thing.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.420
It's going to take me a
couple of minutes to do that.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.130
But what we're going to do today,
or my plan for the session is to

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.620
raise awareness that QuickTime is
involved in most of the multimedia

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.850
productions that you might be doing
or other people might be doing.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.140
Sometimes it's under the hood
and people don't know about that.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.090
But in most cases, that's what happens.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.400
Another thing that I want to cover is
what you can do with QuickTime Pro that

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.030
you could do in other software,
but you don't necessarily need

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120
to do it in that software.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.840
An example is having to go to
Final Cut Pro to edit or to put together

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.600
a series of slides or a series of images.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.760
You could do that with
QuickTime Pro without having to wait

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760
for the long boot of Final Cut Pro.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.020
I mean of QuickTime Pro.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.710
Final Cut Pro.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.230
Sorry about that.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.450
And in some cases,
QuickTime Pro is actually faster

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.570
to use than those applications,
just the example of booting up

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.820
Final Cut opposite to the player.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.340
So what you will be learning in this
session is what is QuickTime Pro,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.560
how and when you may want
to use QuickTime Pro instead

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.700
of other applications,
and how it's also involved

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.370
in the typical workflow,
which goes from acquisition, editing,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.980
authoring, and displaying the media.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.800
So QuickTime is involved
in all of those cases.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.300
And I have a few tips and tricks here
and there that do relate to the workflow.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.190
So because it's workflow,
my topics are going to be

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.760
jumping all over the place
from editing to-- or rather,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.600
from acquiring to editing, authoring,
and deployment.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.560
And therefore, I'm going to be using a
number of applications,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.760
Final Cut,
a lot of it with QuickTime Player,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.600
and so forth.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.000
So I'm going to be jumping back
and forth between applications.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.260
So this slide represents that
Final Cut Pro-- not Final Cut Pro.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.980
QuickTime Pro is involved
in the whole process,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.260
from the acquisition to deployment.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.920
This slide originally came
when OS X was released,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.300
or announced actually.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.020
And one of the important things
that I want to point here is that

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.960
QuickTime is right on top of Darwin,
which means that it's very,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.710
very close to the OS and relatively
apart from the applications.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.070
And the reason why I'm saying this
is because think of QuickTime as

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.360
a big engine that a number of
applications can get access to.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.690
So keep that in mind.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.420
In terms of QuickTime,
what is QuickTime Pro?

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.800
QuickTime Pro is not just a player.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.920
You've gotten a number of
descriptions about what QuickTime is

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.850
and what QuickTime Pro is.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.830
But one of the things that it
does is unlocks the professional,

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.020
as they call it,
capabilities of the QuickTime player

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.720
and the QuickTime plugin,
as well as preview.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.920
So how many people knew that
preview was part of QuickTime Pro?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.640
So how many people knew that?

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.170
But once you get a
license for QuickTime Pro,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.920
you can actually do
exporting out of preview.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.920
For the most part, it is not that useful.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.630
There is one feature,
which is to export what they

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.980
call a QuickTime image file.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.770
And you can do that with QuickTime Pro,
or with previewing QuickTime Pro.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.880
Now in terms of the workflow,
and in terms of acquiring assets,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.700
as you should know by now,
and if you don't,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.470
I'm telling you right now,
QuickTime has a really wide gamma

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.250
of file formats that it can import.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.860
Over 200 media types,
which means that you could be

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.430
bringing in Flash or JPEGs or
TIFF files or PIC files,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.170
text, video of course,
even AVIs and so forth.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.910
So in terms of the acquiring process,
it's not only the acquisition

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.300
of digitizing video,
but also bringing in existing

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.540
files that you may have.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.200
So how is QuickTime Pro involved,
or how is QuickTime involved?

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.260
And I have this other slide which has
a better representation how all of the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.150
applications get access to the engine,
the QuickTime engine,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.250
that is under the OS.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:38.300
And I think at this moment I'd like to
switch over to my machine over here.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.380
And what I'm going to do here is
I have my eyesight running here.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.850
And I've got this really simple
application that I downloaded

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.000
from the developer site at Apple.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And if everything works
all right... Uh-oh.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.060
Okay, this was working before.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.880
This little application, what it does,
it just gets access to the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.220
digitizer in QuickTime.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.400
And the reason why I'm showing you this,
guys,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.020
is because it's a very simple application
that gets access to that layer,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.240
that QuickTime layer that
I showed you earlier.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.340
And it's QuickTime the one that
should be doing the digitizing.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.700
Now in this case, I'm seeing not to be
having too much luck here.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.620
So I'm going to quit that.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.560
And I'm going to ask you guys
to switch over to the slides,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.290
please.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.770
Okay,
so what I was trying to show you here is,

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.110
it was that the application
was getting access to the

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.180
QuickTime engine through the rendering,
or actually doing the capturing

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.350
and the acquisition of the assets.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.210
But this is another example
that I'd really like to show

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.860
in terms of bringing media,
or how QuickTime gets to

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.400
acquire media that doesn't
necessarily need to be video.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.430
So, has anybody tried opening a PDF file,
for example, with a QuickTime player?

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.060
Well, that's something that you can do,
and the important thing that

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.500
I want to stress here is that
it is QuickTime the one that is

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.390
doing the opening of the PDF file.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.680
So if I could switch
back to the demo machine,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.310
please.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.490
Thank you.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.060
Now what I have here,
this is Final Cut Pro.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.010
I've got a timeline
there with two .db files.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.700
But rather what I want to do is I have
another PDF file on the hard drive.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.880
This is the developer documentation
for QuickTime 6 on a PDF document.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.060
As you can see, it has a number of pages.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:54.410
It's the documentation
for QuickTime 6 on a PDF.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.540
One of the things that you could do,
you can actually drag and drop

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.390
the PDF file into Final Cut Pro.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.080
And now you have a PDF in Final Cut Pro.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.070
I'm not exactly sure
why you want to do that.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.330
There may be some cases where
you actually have sources

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.020
coming from a PDF file that
actually has a number of pages.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.270
But again,
the stress that I want to do here is

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:22.020
from the acquisition point of view,
I'm acquiring a PDF file into

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:27.420
the Final Cut Pro application,
and I can dump it into my timeline.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.900
That's a little bit wide.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.510
Let's just zoom back from here.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:43.680
So now as you can see,
I have a PDF document inside my timeline.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.880
So can I switch back to the slides,
please?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:56.220
This is what I was trying to do
with acquiring video from HackTV.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.060
HackTV is a free application that you
developers can download from Apple.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.380
It's meant for developers
as an example of code,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.790
how they can integrate the
digitizing capabilities of

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.480
QuickTime into their applications.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.450
I'm not a programmer.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.370
Rather, I'm a content creator.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.460
And for content creators,
if you guys want to try that application,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.720
you can download it.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.840
It's really tiny.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.880
And for example, plug in your eyesight
or another video camera,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.420
or if you have a digitizing board,
you can use that to capture

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.620
content with QuickTime.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.210
Now in terms of acquiring assets,
I had mentioned the idea of

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.640
bringing in a series of images.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.330
And what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to import a series of images

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.240
that were taken from a still camera.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.240
So this is not video.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.700
It's rather taken from a still camera.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.100
So I'm going to ask if I can
switch back to the demo machine.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.880
Thank you very much.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.810
And import media.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.150
So I have here a number of
pictures that were taken outside

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.870
of my window in Vancouver.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.980
Look at just one of the pictures
and let's see the actual size.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.360
It's a really large image.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:29.460
And this is a typical time sequence,
or timeline sequence, that was--

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.180
is the executive director of
the QuickTime Pro project.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.740
He's the executive director
of the QuickTime Pro project.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:36.740
He's the executive director
of the QuickTime Pro project.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:36.740
He's the executive director
of the QuickTime Pro project.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:43.200
is going to make a time lapse
movie with a QuickTime Player.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.900
If you wanted to do
this in Final Cut Pro,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.730
you could bring all of the
images into Final Cut Pro,

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.700
change preferences,
change the settings for how long

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.090
you want individual images to be,
or still images to be,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.900
and then lay your images
onto the timeline.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:04.200
In this case, the process is going to
be slightly different.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.610
Back in the QuickTime Player,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.410
There's this option under
the file pulldown menu that

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.500
says open image sequence.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:15.100
And the idea here is just to select
the first image in the sequence.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.800
and have all of them sequentially named.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.800
So in this case, it's captured 0091, 92,
and so forth, all the way to 165.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.770
So I'm only selecting the first image,
and Final Cut Pro is asking

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.250
me what frame rate I want.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.960
Now, I could go for the typical
frame rate of video,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.560
which would be roughly
30 frames per second.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.400
But instead, if I do that,
I'm going to have a really,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.100
really short movie that
is going to play really,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.000
really fast.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.230
So instead of doing that,
rather what I'm going to do is I'm

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.480
going to switch to six frames per
second and have that movie a little

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.750
bit longer so each frame stays just
a little bit longer on the screen.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.710
So off it goes.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.280
And as you can see, it's a huge, huge,
huge image.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.590
Maybe the easiest way to do
this is to try to resize.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.900
So in this case,
I was able to acquire my series of

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.470
images into a linear QuickTime movie.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.280
It's really large.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.260
Let me just bring it to half size.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.900
[Transcript missing]

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:37.800
Oh, there you go.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.130
That's a nice day in Vancouver,
one of those days that didn't rain.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.610
So you have to take pictures of a
day that doesn't rain in Vancouver.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.960
Really.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.880
Any Canadians, by the way,
in the audience?

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.160
Right on.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.390
Well, happy Canada Day.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.930
All right.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.030
In terms of a brief tip
that I have for you guys,

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:03.640
when you're acquiring content from
Final Cut Pro or with Final Cut Pro,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.220
is, as you guys know,
when you're shooting your content,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.080
before you shoot,
you should have your videotapes striped,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.170
which means having timecode
laid onto the videotape.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.930
So when you start shooting,
you don't have a broken timecode.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.130
So if I can switch back to the slides,
please.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:32.040
So a little tip that I have for you guys,
when you're working with Final Cut Pro,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.360
or rather if you have Final Cut Pro,
to stripe your tapes,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.190
you just use this little feature in the

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.970
edit to tape option under Final Cut Pro.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.900
By pressing on that
little tiny black button,

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.410
what it would do is it would
print black frames onto the whole

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:55.600
tape and would actually lay down
a timecode track onto the tape.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:01.760
So when you go shooting with that tape,
don't get broken timecode.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.690
And this is very important when
you get into the acquisition

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:10.180
process and when you go and capture
your content into Final Cut Pro.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.320
That way you won't have
problems with broken timecode.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.840
So that's it for the acquisition content.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.670
Now I'm going to talk about the editing
process in the QuickTime Player.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.860
And instead of doing the typical thing
of actually showing you how to copy

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.400
and paste frames and fast forward or go
frame by frame in the QuickTime Player,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.320
rather I'm going to refer you to
the help system in QuickTime Player.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.700
Another thing that I see,
I see Linda Wyman here,

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.060
so I can always refer you
to her book on QuickTime,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.960
which talks about editing
with QuickTime Player.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.460
But rather what I want to focus is
the concept of reference movies.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.300
One of the things that is great
with QuickTime that sometimes is

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.710
misunderstood is that QuickTime can work
with what is called reference movies,

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.180
which means that the media
doesn't necessarily need to

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.340
be duplicated onto the drive.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.480
You can actually have it written
only once onto the drive.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.860
So this would be an
example of what you can do.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.200
The idea of reference movies is
that you can have the media written

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.870
only once onto the hard drive.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.040
And depending on where it comes from,
you can actually take that same media to

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.350
different applications without having to
re-render the media or without having to

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.960
duplicate the media on the hard drive.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.720
So if I'm going to show you
a quick example of that,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.320
I'm going to show you a
quick example of that.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.280
So I can switch back to the slides,
I mean to the demo machine please.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.200
Thank you.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.290
So what I have here is a movie
that is actually made out of,

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.140
I don't know how many
images were in my folder,

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.090
but it's a series of images.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.960
And when I play it,
it's actually making a reference to each

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.760
one of those files onto the hard drive.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.560
So a typical process would
be to actually save or export

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.750
this movie as a self-contained,
which by doing that would actually

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.560
duplicate the media on the hard drive.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.560
It would keep my original images,
and then I would actually make

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.160
a new copy of this large movie.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.860
But rather, one of the things that
I can do now is save

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.100
[Transcript missing]

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.900
referencemovie.mov.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:35.090
And in this case, what it's doing,
or what it did-- let me just go back

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.920
to the finder here really quickly.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.060
It made this document that if
you take a look at the file size,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.450
it's really, really tiny.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.830
Only 44K on disk.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.050
And the reason for that is because
the file itself is actually making

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:56.400
a reference to each one of the
documents of the QuickTime movies.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.390
I have a problem with your microphone.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.390
Can I switch you out?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.820
Alright so, oh, I sound different.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.810
Do I sound older?

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.500
I sound louder, I think.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.500
Okay,
so what I was trying to show you here

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.010
is the reference that this document is
actually making to all of my picture

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.470
files elsewhere on the hard drive.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.300
And as you can see here,
in the QuickTime-- or rather,

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.500
in the movie properties window,
I can see all of the files

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.480
are actually being referenced
from this original document.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.340
Now, the whole idea of this-- doing
this in terms of a workflow

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:53.420
is I don't need to duplicate,
I don't need to make a new really

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.500
large file to be able to take it,
for example,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.800
what I had in my slide before,
into Compressor or into

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.440
After Effects or into anything else.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.390
What I can do...

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.800
is the person who will be
presenting this session.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.330
I'm going to show you how to
use QuickTime Pro to fill in

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.800
the gaps in your workflow.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.220
I'm going to show you
how to use QuickTime Pro

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.120
and use that as my source,
instead of having to render or

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:22.790
having to save as a new copy of
the document onto the hard drive.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.000
So if I can switch back to the slides,
please.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.870
So this is what I just did in this case.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:34.130
I saved what QuickTime calls "saved
normally" or "as normally," which

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.700
means making those reference files.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.470
Now, another thing that you can do,
or to put it more in typical

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.300
cases with Final Cut Pro,
is doing the exact same

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.640
process that I did,
but rather with Final Cut Pro.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.510
So if I can switch back
to the demo machine.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.900
This is my Final Cut Pro timeline.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.920
And I have-- let me get rid of the
PDF and zoom into my timeline so

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.900
it's actually a bit more interesting.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.510
So what I have here is two DB files.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.500
and some titles.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.870
And let's say that we want to compress
those things so that we want to maybe

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.640
take them to After Effects or maybe
take them to another application on

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.150
the same machine for compression,
maybe Squeeze if you want to use

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.380
Squeeze for delivery on the web.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.500
I'm going to do a reference movie
out of Final Cut Pro in this case.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.490
And the process would be to
go into the export option

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.070
Select QuickTime Movie,
which they changed the

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.000
wording in Final Cut Pro 4.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.000
Get rid of all of that noise.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.160
And this is how you
make a reference movie,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.000
so it doesn't take as much drive space.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You simply uncheck that thing.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.100
Where it says Make Movie Self-Contained,
you uncheck that thing,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.900
and you uncheck that
Recompress All Frames.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So by doing this,
it's going to be saved into my folder.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.890
Actually, let me put it onto the desktop.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.590
Well, you didn't even see the progress
bar because it went so quickly.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.260
The only thing that it did, it wrote--

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:26.290
A really tiny reference movie,
even though it has a Final Cut Pro icon,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.300
it is a QuickTime movie.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.670
And if you take a look at the files
that this thing is being referenced to,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.950
it's actually referenced to my sequence,
to my DB file,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.100
and to my .mov file that are
elsewhere on the hard drive.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.170
And the whole media is here,
everything is here.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:49.190
But if I take a look on the finder,
the file size of this little tiny

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.300
reference movie would be comparable
to the one that we had before.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.300
A little bit larger, one megabyte.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.210
There's something rendered in there.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.410
So as you can see,
in terms of our workflow,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:07.570
you can save a lot of drive
space by using this method here.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.870
So can I switch to the slides, please?

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:17.040
So that's how you can make
reference movies on Final Cut Pro.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.840
One important thing about
reference movies-- well,

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.240
I'll mention it later,
but this works great only when

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.410
you're working on the same machine.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.380
This is the making the reference
movies out of the QuickTime Player,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.630
which does exactly the same thing,
just slightly different interface,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.710
slightly different wording,
but it does the exact same thing.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:38.640
Now, a few tips on editing for QuickTime,
particularly for deployment.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.270
Most of the QuickTime that
you're going to be doing is

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.080
going to be for web deployment,
or it's going to be

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.320
for CD-ROM deployment,
or for DVD,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.830
which means compressing the content.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.240
And this, to tell you the truth,
doesn't have to do much with

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.130
QuickTime Pro as per se,
but it has to do with video,

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.560
digital video in general.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.560
And definitely what you want to
do is avoid changes on the screen.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.060
That would be the best way of
summarizing all of that stuff

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.600
that is on the slide here.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.500
So, in two words, avoid changes.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.000
If you have fast motion,
or if you have fast text,

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.530
or if you have scrolling text,
you may want to avoid those.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.050
Same thing with dissolves
and complex transitions.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.540
Those are going to have a terrible
impact when you get to the

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.560
compression part of your project.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.020
project.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.300
Now, another thing also related
to editing has to do with

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.900
previewing DV in full resolution.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.900
Has anybody actually noticed?

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.400
You have a DV file,
you open it up in the QuickTime player,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.400
and it looks really bad,
really pixelated.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.330
I get this a lot of
times with my students.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.400
They see their files,
particularly the one with text,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.200
or the files that have text,
and those are the files that I made.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.480
So if I can switch back
to the demo machine,

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.310
please.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.570
What I have here is the 2db
files that I showed you earlier.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:04.640
Let me do some housekeeping here.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.560
There we go.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.150
And I don't know if you guys can notice,
particularly you guys in the front here,

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:18.600
you're going to notice that the text
looks kind of blurry on the edges,

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.530
which in this case is a DB file.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.860
But don't be scared.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.240
All the media is actually there.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.350
You don't have to panic.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.640
You don't have to go and render
this humongous file with maybe the

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.060
animation codec to get the quality
that the DB file should have.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.360
In fact, the quality and all the data
of your DB file is there.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.980
What QuickTime does, rather,
for the sake of speed and playback speed,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.150
real-time playback speed,
is it sacrifices some of the

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.490
quality so it can play in real time.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.700
So if you guys want to really check
out the quality of your files--

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.580
and this is just for previewing
purposes-- what you can do is turn

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.350
on a property of the video track.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.760
So what I did here is I went
into the Movie Pulldown menu

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:09.340
on the QuickTime player,
get movie properties,

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.400
This is a property for the video track.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.480
One of the things that
you're going to see,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.400
it's a .dv file, 720 by 480 NTSC.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.670
And there's this option that
says "Quality." And by default,

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.400
it has that high-quality
checkbox disabled.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.680
When you turn it on,
now you get to see the

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.400
full quality of your video.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.040
Now, in this case,
you can actually see the

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.400
interlaced of your .dv file.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.400
That's actually the reason
why I used this example here,

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.380
to show how the interlace
disappears or not.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.400
And take a look at the edges of the text.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.920
I'm not sure if you guys at the
end can actually see the detail.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.460
Here I have another example.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:57.040
And it's happening--it's
doing the exact same thing,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.890
which is just showing a preview mode

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:20.200
[Transcript missing]

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.360
Most cases,
when you're previewing your content,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.300
playing it back on the QuickTime player,
you don't want to have that enabled.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.150
Because by enabling that checkbox,
what you're telling QuickTime to

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:32.110
do is give me the data,
regardless of the frame rate.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.300
So by enabling that
high-quality checkbox,

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.980
what QuickTime is going to do
is try to render every single

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.300
field of every single frame.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.300
And therefore taking more CPU.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.300
So it's great just for
previewing individual images,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.400
making sure that the quality
and your edges and your text is

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.300
as sharp as you're expecting.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.410
But for playback purposes,
it's much better to disable it as

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.300
the default is and just play it.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:02.120
That will give you the
full-time rendering or full-time

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.140
playback on QuickTime player.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.300
Okay.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.210
So where am I?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.240
Okay, now let's move on to the
editing side of things.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.510
So if I can switch back to the slides,
please.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.660
For the authoring,
QuickTime Player is relatively

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.100
limited in terms of authoring,
but you can still do

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.370
some of the authoring.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.770
And one of the things that I personally
love about the QuickTime Player is that

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.500
it could be an excellent learning tool.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:43.660
An excellent learning tool by seeing
what other people have done in the past,

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.500
or with their own files.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.580
So what I'm going to do here is,
if I can switch back to the demo machine,

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.410
I'm launching Safari.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:59.650
and I'm going to go and download one of
the movie trailers from the Apple site.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.380
And to tell you the truth,
it really doesn't matter, well,

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.690
it sort of matters,
which file I download.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.240
But I'm going to wait for--
I'm not going to play.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.700
I'm going to wait for the
whole download to happen.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.740
And I'm going to use
QuickTime Player Pro just to analyze

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.430
how this movie was compressed.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.050
This way I can get a pretty good sense of
what other people have done to get great

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.990
quality video if I don't know exactly,
for example, what frame rate to choose,

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.330
or what data rate to choose,
or what window size to choose.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.600
So I'm going to use
this as a learning tool.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.300
It's going to take a few more seconds.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.330
Actually, we may be able to play it.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.590
So if we can get sound for this machine,
off it goes.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.660
Look what I've become.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.980
I sometimes don't talk to
another living soul for days.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.800
I trust no one, nothing.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.420
It's grief for a life wasted.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.000
Will Graham was the hardest
man I've ever known.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.500
And I've known a few, believe me.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.400
Where are you going?

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.120
I don't know.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.100
What do you think he will do?

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.700
He's changed.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.500
Has he?

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.260
He won't be back.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.020
Davey!

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.900
Davey!

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.900
What did he do?

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.900
I've got to find Will.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.900
I don't know where Will is.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.900
Davey, are you there?

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.690
He's got to know.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.000
His brother's back, asking questions.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.500
I'm looking for David.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.500
He's back.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:42.990
I've just seen him.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Don't ever underestimate Will Graham.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.500
He's a fierce man.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.500
He'll go the distance.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.000
He's killed people.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.500
Why are you here, Will?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.500
You know why.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.500
I want to know why he
died the way he died.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.000
It was suicide.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
But you're not sure, are you?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.600
Was there anything that
sounded odd to you?

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.540
No one knows what happened.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.680
What could he possibly find out?

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.210
Tell me.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.300
There's nothing to tell.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.170
Don't lie to me.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.380
He's dead.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.540
Does it matter?

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.680
It matters.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.240
What kind of man am I looking for?

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240
He's scum.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.830
Just like his brother.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.650
People like us don't change.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.290
You're wrong.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.700
You're wrong about most
things most of the time.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.000
Someone's going to die.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.660
You left all that behind.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.500
Leave the city.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.800
Go back where you can breathe.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.420
If you stay, it'll destroy you.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.720
What are you doing here?

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.320
Okay, so there you go.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.580
You have a really nice movie
compressed by somebody else,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.270
and let's say that you want to
work with your own content and

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:09.240
try to at least learn what these
guys have done with their file.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:15.400
So what I'm going to do here is save this
file as a QuickTime movie or as a source.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.510
It really doesn't matter that much.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:25.800
[Transcript missing]

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:32.290
A number of information or a number
of pieces of data about this movie.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:40.770
I'm going to get that movie
properties window again.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.640
There's information
about the annotations.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.760
Particularly, I'm interested in the video
track and the sound track.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.630
So for the video track,
we can find out the format.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.800
So in this case,
we're learning that these guys

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.800
use a Sorenson Video 3 codec.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.800
There may be reasons why
these guys chose maybe to use

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800
Sorenson 3 instead of MPEG-4.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800
We can also see the size.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.670
It's 480 by 360.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.430
So in terms of our workflow,
we can actually get those numbers

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.740
down and maybe use them as a
tryout to see how it works out.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.800
Frame rate, in this case,
the movie is 24 frames per second.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.800
And if you were to
download the smaller movie,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.540
usually you would get to see
something like 12 frames per

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.800
second for the encoded version.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.600
A little bit of a note here.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.410
That doesn't necessarily mean
that if you shoot your DV file

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.700
or your content with video,
you should compress to 24 frames.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.330
In this case,
their compression is done to 24

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.240
frames basically because their
source is a film that was actually

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.580
shot at 24 frames per second.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.710
So if you're going to
be working with video,

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.480
rather, you should be working with
multiples or sub-multiples,

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.960
rather, of the original frame rate.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:55.640
So if you were working with video,
it would be 30 or 29, 97, 15,

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.590
and so forth.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.600
Another thing that we can find here,
this is most important,

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:06.300
is the data rate that these
guys chose for the video.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.520
And in this case,
they're using a data rate

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.800
of 180 kilobytes per second.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.100
Now, you have to be a little bit
careful with that number here,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:20.300
because QuickTime Player traditionally,
and has always since ever,

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.300
provided the data rate
in kilobytes per second.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.690
And when you're dealing with networks,
you're actually dealing

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:26.800
with kilobits per second.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.270
So there's an eight-fold
difference in here.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.340
So if you wanted to get that
data rate in kilobits per second,

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.280
you would have to actually
multiply that by eight,

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.090
which is a really, really high data rate.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.300
That's why the video looks so nice.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:48.300
I'm going to come back and talk
about that data rate in a minute.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.650
Now, for the sound side of things,

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.700
We can also find out the format.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.610
In this case,
it was compressed with QDesign Music 2.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.770
That was the codec that was used.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:06.160
They decided to go mono for some reason,
I guess, to save bandwidth.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:11.430
And maybe the reason to use QDesign
2 and Sorenson 3 that these guys

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.670
chose was to be able to be compatible
with older versions of QuickTime,

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.180
for example, QuickTime 5.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.600
More information regarding the movie,
or regarding the soundtrack,

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:26.670
is the sample size,
which is 44.1 kilohertz.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.450
For some reason,
QuickTime doesn't tell you

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.000
anymore the sample size.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.970
Most likely, it's 16-bit.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.600
As to per the file size or the data rate,
we can see that the sound part

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.640
of the movie takes 2.1 megabytes,
and the data rate of the soundtrack

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.250
is 15.6 kilobytes per second.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:50.540
So in terms of a workflow again,
what you could do is take these numbers,

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.350
take them into your movies,
and try compressing them

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:57.040
with those settings,
and at least it's a great starting point

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:03.860
as to per what you should be doing to
tweak your settings for compression.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:10.030
So if I can go back to the slides,
please.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.040
So this is what we've done.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.240
We've used the movie properties to
learn from somebody else's work,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.260
which is a great tool.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:26.400
Now, one of the things that-- or one
of the options that you have

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.630
in the QuickTime Player when
you're compressing content,

00:34:31.300 --> 00:35:31.700
[Transcript missing]

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.960
is the director of the
QuickTime Pro team.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.730
He's going to talk about how
to use QuickTime Pro to fill

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:46.180
in the gaps in your workflow.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.540
So let's say that I want
to compress this movie,

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.540
that I want to make this movie,
that right now references

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.240
all of my single frames.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.960
Let's say that I want to make
a web version of this and

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:05.090
target an audience that is maybe
running at 200 kilobits per second.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.090
Actually, I should know what data rate
I'm going to be targeting.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.690
Let's say that we're rather going to
target somebody that is running on a 350

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.100
kilobit per second bandwidth connection.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.240
So I'm going to save
this onto the desktop,

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.450
and I'm going to call it Web Movie.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:29.540
I'm exporting as a movie
to QuickTime movie.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.530
Now, in this case,
I went through the file export option,

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.540
which means that I'm gonna recompress.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.480
I'm gonna make new media out of this.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:44.200
Click on the Options button to
choose the different settings.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:52.200
Let's say we're targeting
a 350 KBps audience,

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:56.200
somebody that would be on a
fairly good ADSL connection.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.360
I'm going to change the size
of this humongous movie to

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.200
something more manageable,
like 256 x 192.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.310
So that's going to be a
relatively small size,

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:13.200
but should yield really nice
quality for a 350 KBps data rate.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.300
Now I'm going to change
the settings for the video.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:23.140
And there are a ton of codecs
that are available for you,

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.600
depending on what you want to do.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.340
So for deployment,
most of the times you would want

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.130
to focus on either Sorenson 3 Pro,
if you do have the Pro version,

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.740
and another great
alternative is to use MPEG-4.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.730
So I'm going to use
MPEG-4 for the time being.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.670
Now, frames per second.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.770
In this case,

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.810
My frame rate,
I don't know if you remember,

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.570
but my frame rate was actually
six frames per second.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.100
So I'm going to leave it at best.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.390
And what best does,
it actually leaves the original

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.870
frame rate of the movie as is.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.300
So it'll maintain the
original frame rate.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:06.790
If my source was actually video,
it would be kept at the original 2997.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.730
Now, these two options down here are
usually a point of confusion.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:17.740
Now, who doesn't know what that
keyframe every-- frames mean?

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.740
Everybody knows?

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.740
Okay, a few of you guys don't know.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:27.740
Well, that keyframe every 24 frames
actually has to do with the codec.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:31.480
What the codec does is it tries
to analyze one frame and then the

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.740
consequ-- the following frames.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.740
So if there are no changes
in the following frames,

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.740
or rather if there are a few
changes in the following frames,

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.110
what the codec does is it just
saves those changes without

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.640
having to save the full frame.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:49.740
So keyframe every whatever number,
what it does is it actually refreshes

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:54.990
that original frame of video,
so it has a new starting point for

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.710
comparison of the following frames.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:03.510
As a rule of thumb,
every 10 seconds is perfectly fine.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.040
So if I'm running at 6 frames per second,
and I want to keep it

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:10.380
at every 10 seconds,
I would want to enter--

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.810
in this particular case,
I want a keyframe every 60 frames.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.680
Now this is where the
rubber meets the road,

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.750
as they say.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:27.060
And it has to do with the calculation
of the data rate for the video.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.880
So I'm going to switch
over to the slides,

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.890
please, and do a little bit of
an explanation here.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.700
So here we go.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.840
It's a little bit of math.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.400
It's really basic math, so don't worry.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.690
We said that we wanted to target a
data rate of 350 kilobits per second.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.880
So that means that we're
going to have audio and video

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.870
that when you add them up,
it should add up to about

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.500
350 kilobits per second.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.700
Now, in this case,
I split it up in 310 kilobits per

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:07.360
second for the video and about 40
kilobits per second for the audio.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.210
Now in this case, I'm kind of like--

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.440
Maybe what I should do is I should
open up a DVD movie instead

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.700
of the slides that I have here
because they don't have any sound.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.860
Actually,
I don't have anything with sound.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:26.930
But anyway, so in a typical situation,
I'm dividing here 310 kilobits

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:31.200
per second for the video and 40
kilobits per second for the audio.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.200
So when you add them up, it goes to 350.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.060
Now, the problem is that the
QuickTime interface,

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.890
here where it says limited data rate,
it says limit data rate to

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.400
whatever kilobytes per second.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.230
But we were doing our calculations
in kilobits per second.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:57.340
So the secret here is to divide
the 310 kilobits per second that

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.400
we had or that we want to target.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:07.400
If we divide that by 8,
that gives us 38.75 kilobits per second.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.310
So that's the number that
we have to enter in the

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.770
QuickTime player user interface.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.100
If we were to enter 310,
it would actually give us a

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.050
movie eight times as large as
what we would be expecting,

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.900
which is not what we want.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.120
So this is a typical point of
confusion I've seen throughout

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.180
the years from my students.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.970
They enter the 310 and boom,
the movie looks amazing, definitely,

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.900
because you have an eight times
the battery that you're expecting.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.710
But the file size is just
undeliverable over the web.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.900
So if I could switch back
to the computer here,

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:49.460
what I would be entering in this case,
it would be that 38.75

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.840
kilobytes per second.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:58.770
That should match up to the
310 kilobits per second.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.360
So that's a very important step
that I definitely wanted to mention.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.100
When delivering the content over the web.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:14.450
Now in this case, I don't have any sound,
but if I was to use this,

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.400
let me actually try to get a
movie that does have sound.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.400
To show you the interface.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.680
And I think this one does have sound.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.310
Or at least it has a soundtrack,
even though it has no sound.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.720
File, export.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:36.910
Onto the desktop options, we set MPEG-4.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.670
Now this would definitely relate
to the slide that I had before.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.240
I said sub-multiple of
the original frame rate,

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.400
so I'm going to drop it down
to 15 frames per second.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.040
Rule of thumb of a
keyframe every 10 seconds,

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.780
that'll be around 115.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:43:02.720
And the battery that we had specified
was 38.75 kilobytes per second.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.620
Now for the sound side of things,
I'm going to use MPEG-4 sound,

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.580
which is top notch,
particularly at lower data rates.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.530
So where am I missing?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.030
Here we go.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.980
Apple MPEG-4 Audio.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.660
And this is kind of weird because the
video did give me the option for the

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:26.600
data rate in kilobytes per second.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.920
But when you get into the audio codec,
in this particular case, and I think it,

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.930
actually most of the audio
codecs would actually allow

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.600
you to enter the data rate.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.580
This is where it says bit
rate in kilobits per second.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.540
So QuickTime Player is a little bit
confusing in this case by giving you

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:48.590
one data rate or one unit in one case
and another unit in another case.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.600
So watch out for that.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.710
Now from the slide that I had before,
I said that the audio would take about,

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:58.170
or would take 40 kilobits per second,
plus the other 310 from the

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:02.540
video to add up for the 350.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.160
So I'm selecting 40 kilobits per second.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:11.880
And what the bit rate really means,
it means how much data is it going

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:17.060
to be taken to store the sound,
which is very different

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.900
to the sample rate.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.310
The sample rate has to do for
those audio guys to how often

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:27.230
is the computer actually storing
a sample from the original file.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.910
And one of the things that the
QuickTime player does in this case,

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:36.490
it actually shows you in in bold,
what would be the optimum

00:44:37.200 --> 00:45:41.400
[Transcript missing]

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:46.120
Now this is also kind of
confusing because I have a sample

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.000
rate over here and I also had
another sample rate over here,

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.380
so that's somewhat confusing.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.860
So I'm matching them,
making sure that they do match.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.900
And I'm going to let go.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.020
So I'm going to compress this movie.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.740
It won't take that long onto the desktop.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.750
It's just a few seconds long.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.690
But what I want to see is
if my data rate -- whoops,

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.050
was that the one?

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.520
Yeah, that was the one.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.840
I forgot to change the size, remember?

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.590
That's why it looks so bad.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:19.850
But file size-wise,
it should be my 350,000.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:25.690
is the creator of QuickTime Pro.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:25.690
He's the founder of QuickTime Pro.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:25.690
He's the founder of QuickTime Pro.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:30.120
Appropriate for the whole
movie should be the full size.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.060
It's actually lower.

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:36.750
Let me get the calculator
just to actually do it right.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:47.390
And we have the 36.1
kilobytes per second.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:51.560
To get that into kilobits per second,
we would need to multiply that by 8.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.200
And in this case,
it's 288 kilobits per second.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.590
So the movie itself ended up being
somewhat lower from what I was expecting.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.560
So that's definitely good,
because it would definitely

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.440
match the audience,
the target data rate of the

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.060
audience that I was looking for.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.260
And it would not take that
much space on my hard drive.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.500
Now, mind you that this is a demo
with a really short movie,

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:18.200
so that's why the numbers
are relatively off.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:19.900
There's no audio?

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:23.700
That's true.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:24.700
There was--there's no audio there.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.910
Well, there is an audio track,
but it's silent, which is weird.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.680
That's another point
of why it's so small.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.240
Thanks a lot.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.950
Now, another thing is,
in terms of the workflow,

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.690
a huge element is AppleScript.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.080
And I really hope that you guys
had gone to the AppleScript session

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:51.140
that was earlier today,
because AppleScript is most important.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.710
Especially if you're an AppleScripter,
you can do amazing stuff

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.360
with a QuickTime player.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.060
So if I can switch back to
the slides really quickly,

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:03.540
In this case,
Apple provides a series or a collection

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.440
of Apple scripts already written,
which are great.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.470
Surprisingly enough, they had not updated
them since QuickTime 5,

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:14.500
but nevertheless,
they are very much useful today.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:18.410
So that's the URL where you can
get them from the Apple site.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:23.850
Just go apple.com/applescript/quicktime,
and you'll be able to

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:26.390
download this really,
really powerful collection of scripts.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:35.860
So what these scripts do is--
they are divided in a number of--

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:39.410
is the director of the
QuickTime Pro project,

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.200
and he is the director of
the QuickTime Pro project.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.220
He is the director of the
QuickTime Pro project.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.170
He is the director of the
QuickTime Pro project.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.640
Please.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:53.970
Thank you very much.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.060
Now, in this case,
I downloaded earlier the

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.900
Apple Scripts from the Apple site,
and another thing that I did is

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:05.440
in the Apple Script folder of the
Applications folder on your Macintosh,

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.300
there is this thing that says,
"Install Script Menu." When you

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.370
run that little tiny app,
it provides you with this little

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:18.150
tiny Apple Script pull-down menu
that now appears throughout the OS.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.660
So let's see.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.570
Let me, what am I going to do here?

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.880
Let me see if this is a small movie
that I had done earlier or not.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.940
Come on.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.900
Come on.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.590
What I want to do is I want to apply
a couple of Apple scripts that have

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:48.100
already been pre-written for me,
or for us actually.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.100
Okay, this thing is not responding,
so let me try that again.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.170
Okay, hopefully this is going to work.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:12.240
Doesn't seem... Hey,
my cursor turned into a beach ball now.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.020
Go figure.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.200
and the machine is somewhat sluggish.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.040
Anyway,
one of the scripts that has been--

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.260
or that has been provided for you
is-- this is another question that

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.820
I had the other day at the lab.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.700
Somebody was asking how to
make a movie save/disable,

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.840
so that when you put it on your website,
people view it, but they don't save it

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.000
onto their hard drive.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.480
That's a feature that
QuickTime Pro offers.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.160
And there are a number of ways that
you can get access to that little flag.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.620
One of them is using Live Stage Pro.

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.490
Another one is, if you're running OS 9,
you can do it with a little free

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.040
app from Apple called Plugin Helper.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.540
Or you can also do it with Apple Script,
which is what I'm going

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.400
to try to do here.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:03.240
But somehow,
this thing is not working for me.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:08.110
So let me try that again.

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.300
Okay,
I'm not going to compress the movie.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.340
What I was going to do is I was
going to compress the movie,

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.000
or use the compressed version,
and apply my Apple script to that.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
But I can apply my Apple script
also to this movie.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.900
So let's do two more things.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:25.700
Apart from making it save/disable,
I want to make it so that when it plays,

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.000
it goes full screen.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
And another thing is that
when it finishes playing,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.970
it actually closes down.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:34.810
So there's no chance that,
or giving relatively little

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:38.980
chance for the user to save my
movie onto their hard drive.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
So now that I have installed the
Apple script extensions here,

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.590
I have this option that says
QuickTime Player Scripts.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:52.130
and some of them,
they are organized by the type of

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.820
functionality that you want to do.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.760
So in this case,
I think it's under properties.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.020
Autoplay is one of them.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.390
So I'm going to change the
autoplay of this movie.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:06.020
By default, any QuickTime movie is
set by off or set to off.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.980
So I'm going to change that to on.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:12.380
So as soon as the movie opens,
it should start playing automatically.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:14.320
Okay.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.440
So that's actually been
applied to my movie.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.790
We said that we wanted to take it
full screen as soon as it started,

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.440
as soon as it launched.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:30.150
So that would be, I think that's another
property of the movie.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.150
Whoops.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.150
Properties.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.150
Okay.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.150
So I'm going to

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:50.300
[Transcript missing]

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.580
This is the screen,
so I want to go full screen.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.220
Okay.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.830
So that sets it to go full screen.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:05.050
And the last thing that I'm going
to do is I'm going to save/disable.

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.510
And I think that's another property here.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:15.590
We also said that we're going
to do auto close when done.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.860
And I don't see that the
Save/Disable is there,

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.770
so Auto-Close to true.

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:37.690
Oh boy,
where was that option for Save/Disable?

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:43.940
Actually, I can do that from the droplet
that is over here in the

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:47.700
Apple scripts that were downloaded.

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:55.140
Apple scripts, droplets, media type,
playback.

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:19.100
[Transcript missing]

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:25.500
And then dumped it into my-- or into
the droplet to make it safe-disable.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:48.600
[Transcript missing]

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:54.540
So now if I open the movie,
it should go full screen,

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.300
it should play the whole thing,
and at the end it should quit.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.250
Oh, it did not.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:16.200
[Transcript missing]

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.000
I want to see if it gives me an error.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.560
It should return an error
saying that I cannot save it.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.500
There you go.

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.960
So at least it gave me that error.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.100
So that means that I cannot save it.

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:29.680
Even if I put this movie on a web
server or play on the plug-in,

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.600
on the QuickTime plug-in,
it would not give me that option that

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:36.470
I had originally as save disabled.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:40.680
So unfortunately, the other scripts were
not applied somehow.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.900
And now that it's been saved disabled,
I cannot apply those scripts anymore.

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:47.100
I won't be able to save them.

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:50.620
But in this case,
the point that I'm trying to make

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:56.030
here is that the Apple scripts
that Apple provides are amazing.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.040
It's an amazing collection.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.060
I don't know if you guys were
able to see the different types of

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:05.340
Apple scripts as I was dragging or as
I was looking for on my hard drive.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:10.800
But there's a ton of Apple scripts
that have been pre-written for you.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.100
And the great thing about these
Apple scripts is that you can

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.850
still go and open them and edit
them or learn from them if you

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:20.260
definitely want to try that out.

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.440
Personally, I'm not an Apple script guy.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.290
Apple script is so easy that I don't
understand it for some reason.

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.500
It's supposed to be too close to English,
but I don't know if my accent is

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.340
the one that doesn't work here.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.370
But nevertheless,
the Apple scripts that have been

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:41.150
pre-written by Apple are perfect.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.360
Okay, moving on.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:48.190
Can I switch to the slides, please?

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.900
So that was AppleScript.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:56.200
Now, in terms of authoring,
mixing media types usually is a

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.380
must when working with QuickTime,
and we're working with QuickTime Pro.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.060
Now, most of the times when you would
be doing advanced authoring,

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.320
you would be using some
other applications like

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:10.400
Live Stage Pro or iShell or some
other applications for your authoring.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.420
But in this case,
what I'm going to do is I'm

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.010
going to make--what I have is
I have a QuickTime VR movie.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.640
All of the stuff that we've
seen before was video and sound.

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.370
But in this case,
I have a QuickTime VR movie,

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:24.380
and I've made this little dumb flash
animation that looks kind of like a

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.680
target that just goes into the center.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.730
So if I can switch back
to the demo machine.

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.490
Thank you very much.

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:34.300
This is what I've got.

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:38.130
I've got two movies here.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.980
One of them is a flash track.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:41.020
It's really tiny.

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:45.140
If we take a look at the
file size on this document,

00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.140
it's just 324 bytes for the SWF.

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:53.020
So this is the typical Flash 5, I think,
or Flash 4 file.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.140
It doesn't do anything.

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.140
It just has a gray background and a
little ball that goes into the center.

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:01.140
And on the other hand,
I have this other QuickTime VR movie

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:04.760
where I want to add this
flash animation on top of the

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.140
QuickTime VR and always stay there.

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.140
So has anybody ever done
something like this,

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:13.030
as in adding flash to a
QuickTime VR with a QuickTime player?

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.080
Anybody?

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.570
Great.

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:16.040
Perfect.

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.140
So this is what you need to do.

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.050
The logic is this.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.140
The logic is to bring the
flash into the clipboard,

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.080
then paste it on top of everything
else onto the QuickTime VR.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.140
Now, if I wanted to do that without
changing the QuickTime VR,

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:37.900
right now I'm on the flash,
so I would go file, I mean, edit, copy.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.140
So that brings it into the clipboard.

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:43.140
And if I wanted to just paste
it or add it on top of the VR,

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.140
QuickTime does not allow me.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.990
QuickTime VR is actually all disabled.

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:50.700
And the reason for that is
because the-- to be able to

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:54.360
have the edit pull-down menu,
you actually have to have a typical

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.140
QuickTime controller down there.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:00.130
You have to have a timeline, which,
of course, QuickTime VR don't have--

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:02.130
QuickTime VRs don't have any timeline.

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:04.120
They render on the fly.

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:09.140
So the secret is to actually
change the controller here.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.980
One of the properties--

00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:15.200
The QuickTime Pro is a
controller that it uses.

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.200
I'm getting the movie
properties for the QuickTime VR,

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.200
and one of the properties for the
movie itself is the type of controller.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.200
I'm going to go to the movie controller,
and I don't know if you noticed,

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.170
but the QuickTime VR controller now
becomes a linear video controller.

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:31.180
If you play it, nothing happens.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.190
It's just whatever it's
seeing at that moment.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.200
But now I can add on
top of this my flash.

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:40.040
First of all,
I wanted to add it on top of everything.

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.200
So I'm going to select
the whole timeline,

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.180
select all.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.970
You see that the whole gray
timeline gets selected.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:53.200
Now I want to add scaled,
which means whatever is in the clipboard,

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.290
make it match my timeline.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:01.600
is the director of the Office of
Data Science at Scaled.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.050
Right now we have the Flash on
top of everything else.

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:08.520
One of the great features
about Flash is that by default

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.560
it contains an alpha channel.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.870
So the gray background,
that's just the background

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:16.770
in my Flash document,
but I can actually turn off

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:20.250
that background by applying
its own alpha channel.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:24.470
So I'm switching to the properties
of the Flash track over here.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:28.000
And one of the properties
is the graphics mode.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.110
And by the way,
to be able to change these

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.870
properties for the flash track,
I still have to have the

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:36.500
QuickTime controller or the
movie controller active.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.610
So as you can see,
there's a straight alpha that

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:46.230
we can take advantage of the
alpha channel on the flash track,

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.660
on the SWF, on the SWIFT file.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:52.100
And two more things
that we need to do more.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.040
One of them is if I was to go
back and change the controller

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.360
back to the QuickTime VR,
I would still not be able

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:04.200
to play it back or have the
QuickTime VR controller or controls.

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.640
As you can see,
I'm clicking and I'm dragging

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.720
and nothing's happening.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.320
And the reason for that is
because the flash track is

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.640
actually capturing the click.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.710
So let me see if I can change that.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.780
I'm going as another
property for the flash track.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.680
It's the only one that
says properties here.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.440
It says mouse capture enabled.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:28.260
If I disable that,
the click is going to go through the

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.000
flash track into my QuickTime VR.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:35.830
So now I have a target.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.880
No, don't shoot.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.400
The great thing about this
whole idea is that because it's

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.460
a flash track on top of a VR,
the VR is actually a

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.600
really high resolution.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.890
I was using the free
application that came with my

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:54.990
Canon camera to stitch this VR,
but if I go full size

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:56.880
or even full screen,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.800
Because the Flash is a
vector-based animation,

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.300
it scales beautifully.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.060
And the VR, being high quality,
it still looks quite nice.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.740
Never mind the bottom.

01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:11.820
So as you can see,
in this case we have the flash track

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:16.160
on top of the QuickTime VR track.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.200
Something that you should
not do is do this on a G4,

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:24.670
because my VR is too large,
and I'm applying this alpha channel,

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:28.460
which adds a lot of CPU.

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:31.730
So that's what I love about this G5,
and that's why I wanted to use

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:33.650
this G5 to show this demo here.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.040
Nevertheless,
on a PC it would actually be

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.600
somewhat smoother than on the Mac,
just because of the alpha channel.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.540
So I hope that you really like that one.

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:48.180
I personally love that example of
just mixing the VR with the Flash.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:53.960
So I've got just a few more
minutes to show something else.

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:57.990
And if I can switch back to the slides,
please.

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:05.740
In this case, I'm talking about Save As.

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:07.740
When you go and save as a movie,
you have the different

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.240
options of Fast Start,
Compress Movie Header,

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:15.080
and what this does,
when you go and save as, what it does,

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.170
it just copies the media of the
existing file into a new file.

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:24.640
Now, there are 15 more minutes.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.530
No, I still have 15 more minutes, right,
Aimee?

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:28.280
Okay.

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:32.370
So, in 10 minutes,
what I want to do is the following.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.800
I want to talk about deployment.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.140
So far, I haven't been able to
get to the deployment,

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:38.800
even though it's most important.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.960
And in this case,
I'm going to aid myself with

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.790
a few more applications,
and this is what I want to do.

01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:46.770
You guys have seen on the Apple site
that when you go to a movie,

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:49.990
in the movie trailer site,
depending on the bandwidth that you've

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.130
selected for your particular machine,
it would give you a small

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:54.680
movie or a large movie.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.780
Well, one of the things that you could
do is use those reference movies

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:01.480
to deploy in different languages.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:08.040
So, what I want to do is,
I have two movies here,

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.910
one in English and one in Spanish.

01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.910
It's the same QuickTime VR that
I showed you earlier,

01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.910
but with text in English and in Spanish.

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:17.640
And what I want to do is I want to
embed these movies on an HTML page,

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.680
and depending on the
language of the user,

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.120
I want either of the movies to play back.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.760
So I'm going to do this really quickly.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.200
First off,
I'm going to show you this slide here.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.990
The applications that I'm going
to use is this application

01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:39.500
called MakeRefMovie from Apple,
which is available on the free tools

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.830
and tips of the QuickTime site.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.410
I'm going to use the QuickTime player
to create a dummy movie,

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:52.170
and I'm going to use this other
application called PageOutX from

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:57.540
Qt Bridge to write the HTML for me.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.800
Has anybody ever used this?

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.360
Or rather, has anybody not seen
that application before?

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.100
Okay, you guys are going to love it
because it writes HTML no problem.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:11.570
Much better than what you would be
able to do with other applications.

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.200
Okay, so.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:18.390
I'm going to start from the
bottom of my diagram back to the

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:22.200
top where I have the two movies.

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:24.900
This is the one in English,
and as you can see,

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.900
it just has text in English on the top.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.900
And what I did is
I brought in a flash track,

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.710
and I've got a Spanish version.

01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:37.730
So this one should be selected either or,
depending on the user's language.

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:41.900
So the first thing that I'm going
to do is that reference movie,

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.900
and the reference movie is
going to select either or,

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.840
depending on the language of the user.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:50.900
And that's where I use the
application called MakeRefMovie.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:56.890
So when you launch MakeRefMovie,
it asks you to save a movie.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.900
In this case, it's a brand new movie
that I'm going to create.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.250
It's going to contain no media,
and it's going to refer to

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:07.900
either of the other two movies,
depending on the language of the user.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:11.610
And I'm going to call
that--how do I call it?

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:18.270
I call it QtSource on my diagram.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.380
QtSource.mov.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:24.060
And this movie is going
to refer to the two VRs.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:29.090
So I'm going to drag both VRs,
the one in Spanish and

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:30.800
the one in English,
and I'm just going to drop

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.330
them into the user interface.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.000
And they appear here.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.790
Now,
this application allows you to select

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:40.300
the type of-- or one of the movies,
either of the movies,

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.400
depending on a bunch of criteria.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.020
And usually people use the data rate,
or the bandwidth available to the user.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:49.000
In this case,
I'm actually going to use language.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.530
So this is the one in Spanish.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.770
You can see the name over here.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.790
This is the Spanish movie.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:58.520
So I'm going to select this movie
only if the user has a Spanish OS.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.460
And I'm going to select
the English version.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:07.830
I could actually leave it unspecified,
pretty much just in any other case.

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.140
And that's pretty much it.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.700
We don't have to do anything else.

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:16.490
By setting those preferences,
we should get either of the movies

01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:18.460
depending on the user settings.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:24.430
So I'm going to quit this application,
save the changes, and it should have made

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.440
the reference movie.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.750
Now this reference movie, if I launch it,
right now it gives me

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.510
the English version.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.010
But if I change the preferences,
I don't know if I can do that

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.610
without an admin password.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.280
If I change the OS to Spanish,

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.200
Up at the very top,
you just gotta love OS X.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.200
Let me get QuickTime Player,
launch it a second time.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.400
No, it should be in Spanish.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:00.430
Hold on,
this thing is not behaving properly.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.770
Anyway, the QuickTime player is in
English for some bizarre reason,

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.810
but as you can see now my
movie opens up in Spanish,

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:14.860
because I changed my settings to Spanish.

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:17.480
So I've got that reference movie.

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:21.430
Now,
if I can go back to the slides please.

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:25.990
So I've got the Spanish,
the English movie,

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:27.680
and the Qt source movie that I've made.

01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:30.240
Now what I need to do is I need
to make a dummy movie that when

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.320
the user clicks on that movie,
then it launches either the

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:39.770
English or the Spanish movie,
which by de facto,

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.620
that movie is going to be the
one embedded into the QuickTime,

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.460
rather into the HTML document.

01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:49.540
So what I've done here before is
I've made-- thank you very much.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:56.880
What I've done here before is I've made
a picked file of the kitchen there.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.380
I'm not going to open it in preview.

01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:59.980
Rather,
I'm going to drag and drop it onto

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:05.090
the QuickTime player to open up the
picked file in the QuickTime player.

01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:09.550
Now, for the embedding,
what I want is the

01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:11.530
QuickTime plugin to initialize.

01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:15.360
Therefore, what I need to embed is going
to be a QuickTime movie.

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:19.400
So right now, it's a PIC file,
but if you go and--

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:22.700
Save As.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:28.170
It wraps the picked file
around the .mov extension,

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:31.580
so it actually turns it
into a QuickTime movie that

01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:38.500
contains a picked file.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:38.500
I should be putting it into my folder
that contains all of the other files.

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.710
And I'm going to call
this file my source.

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:49.310
This is the one that is going to be
embedded in the source tag of my HTML.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.450
There we go.

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:54.500
So this is going to be
what's called a poster movie.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.780
This is the one that is actually
going to be embedded into the HTML.

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.900
The user,
when they click that poster movie,

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:07.260
in effect,
is going to call the source movie.

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:12.320
And that one is actually going to
check if it's in English or in Spanish.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.550
So we've got all the media
from my diagram ready to go.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.460
The only thing that I need
to finish up is the HTML.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:27.780
And this is where page
art comes to place.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.640
And what this application does,
it writes the object and

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.470
the embed tag for you.

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:37.260
And these guys at QT Bridge are
always on top of QuickTime,

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:42.360
way faster and way better than what
you would find in applications like

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:46.050
Dreamweaver that's supposed to have an
embed and an object tag for QuickTime,

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:48.320
which they take forever to update.

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:51.720
These guys on the other
hand are always on the ball.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.040
So I'm going to embed the source movie.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.360
I'm just going to drag and drop
it into my Pager application.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.860
As you can see, it gives me the name.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.220
It figures out the height and the width.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.020
And let's set all the properties.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:12.560
So what we want is
when you click on this,

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.130
to actually have an href.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:20.190
So when you click on the movie,
it should actually target the reference

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:23.720
movie that it's going to figure
out if it's in English and Spanish.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.790
Just going to paste the name over there.

01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:31.440
And you could potentially
go to the QuickTime Player.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.540
Let's go to the QuickTime Player.

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:37.280
So it actually can go full screen,
or the user can take it full screen.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.540
And let me get rid of the controller.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.290
So it will show the code.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.600
There's all the HTML for the
object and the embed tag for that

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.990
particular movie that we've made.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.830
So I'm just going to copy that stuff.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.040
Copy.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.580
I've already made an index page
that doesn't contain anything.

01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:04.230
Let me just open up TextEdit.

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:07.430
And hopefully TextEdit...

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.800
Wow, there's nothing there.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.470
That has to do with the preferences,
I think.

01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:25.620
Plain text.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.610
Okay, let me try that again.

01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:37.820
Okay, that's what happens when you
depend on TextEdit and not BBEdit

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:42.710
for your... The other preference.

01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:45.190
Which one is the other preference?

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:50.360
Yeah, ignore everything.

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.640
Thank you very much.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:56.100
That's a good thing of having
a really live audience.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:56.440
There we go.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.470
So we have all the
HTML that I was expecting.

01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:00.770
So I've got-- I just
have the header there.

01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:02.880
And now I should be
able just to paste my,

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:08.560
whoa, relatively large code that
contains everything else in there.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.640
And as you can see,
it already wrote the class

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.410
ID for the ActiveX control.

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:17.000
It wrote the source, the height,
the width, and the embed tag for the

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.170
whole thing all over again.

01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:20.290
Save.

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:26.140
So, when you launch that,
you click on it,

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.260
it figures out that I have
my computer in Spanish,

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.240
and it gives me the Spanish version.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:36.350
On the other hand,
if I change the settings

01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:40.110
of the computer to English,
which I should,

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.960
When I click on that,
I'm expecting to see the English version.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.540
Ooh, still the Spanish version.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.840
Let me quit the player.

01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:52.210
Let me quit this thing, too.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:02.200
[Transcript missing]

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.400
Thanks, Francesco.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.740
So-- Can you go to the slides, please?

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.950
About quarter to 5:00.

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.600
There are buses coming for
the campus bash tonight,

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:19.310
which you'll meet downstairs.

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.940
You don't have to rush to get down there.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:23.800
So if you have questions for Francesco,
maybe what we can do is we

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.720
can take them off stage,
maybe out in the hallway, take a few,

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.700
and then you guys can head down and
have fun tonight down in Cupertino.

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:30.760
Thanks again, Francesco.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.490
Thank you very much.
