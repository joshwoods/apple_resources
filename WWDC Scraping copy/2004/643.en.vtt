WEBVTT

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.420
So I'm really impressed that you all
made it here after lunch on Friday.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.200
That's just total 100%
commitment to this.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.120
So my name is Brian Croll.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.440
I'm the Senior Director in
charge of product marketing

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.480
for our system software,
Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server, Xcode,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600
as well as the QuickTime side.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.870
So what we're going to be here today,
I'll just give you a general premise

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.060
of what we're going to talk about.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.240
So how many people here heard
some cool stuff this week?

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.340
Well, that's about 100%. That's good.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.940
That was the whole point.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.940
So I'm happy about that.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.690
How many of you want to come back
and tell your organization about it?

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.400
Okay, just about everyone.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.650
So now, the big question is,
when you go back,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:17.600
[Transcript missing]

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.910
Unfortunately,
that was 100%. So what this session

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.970
is all about is some of the things
I'm going to share with you,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.480
some of the things I tell people
who are new to the Mac platform,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.010
and to try to get people to see things
maybe through a different light.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.830
So that's the idea of
this whole presentation.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.400
So I'm going to walk through a
number of the things that you

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.500
may hear when you get back.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.500
When you say Apple to a lot of people,
this is the tape they're

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.980
running in their mind.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.940
This is, for a lot of people,
the last time they ever saw a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.400
Mac look something like that.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.450
So the whole problem is to take
this old image of what Apple stood

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.490
for and what the Mac was all about,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.490
And change it to this.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.580
And to make it up to date.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.360
To really, fundamentally move people's
image of what Apple's all about.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.400
So we're going to walk
through that today.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.950
So now, if there's one thing that I found
to be really effective in getting

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.500
people to really understand at the
core what we're doing at Apple,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.220
is to just get this phrase down
and to really understand it.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.300
The power of Unix,
the simplicity of the Mac.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.300
Power of Unix, simplicity of Mac.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.910
If people can get this idea, this is,
by the way, our little marketing tagline,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.280
but it's also our strategy.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.400
This is what we're doing.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.940
A lot of people ask us,
"So what are you doing in the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.190
future?" If you know this rule,
you can kind of derive what

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.430
our next steps are going to be.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.740
Because we're going to take the
power of Unix and how that evolves,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.540
and we're going to make it really easy.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.080
This is a fundamentally new
strategy from Apple that we

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.990
adopted about five years ago,
and now we're really

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.000
bearing the fruits of.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.190
So once again,
if there's one thing that if

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.640
I were going to go out and tell
people out there in the enterprise,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.480
people who don't understand
anything about Apple or the Mac,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.990
this is the one thing I'd
really want them to get.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.670
So you're going to hear things like this.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.810
So the kind of comments, you know,
you come back and you're talking

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.360
to people about Apple and
what's going on with the Mac,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.320
and you hear a lot of people say, well,
Macs are just too expensive.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.720
Anybody heard that?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.120
Okay.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.680
Well, you know, the key thing here is
that's what people think,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.390
but when you really dig under the
covers and you look at the solutions,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.390
there's some pretty surprising

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.980
You know, surprising things going on.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.600
First of all,
a lot of people forget about the eMac,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.600
right?

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.740
We have a really good entry price,
you know, $800 for an entry-level Mac.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.290
I get people who say, you know,
Apple really should go out and

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.580
do an under-thousand-dollar Mac.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.290
And you sort of say, OK,
we'll get right on that.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.120
And with us.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.600
That's true.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.280
But this is something that people
don't really even know about,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.990
that the EMAC even exists.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.750
So this is something that we really
want to make sure people know about.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.960
The next one that's pretty
interesting is Mac OS X.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.100
$129 for an upgrade.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.560
We come out with OSs very frequently,
so for a lot of people it feels

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.800
like we're doing upgrades quite
a bit and getting $129 a year.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.050
We understand that.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.250
But if you compare that against
everybody else out there in the industry,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.580
so for instance if you look at XP Pro,

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:20.250
I got a little laugh there.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.250
That can be quite a bit
more expensive than $129,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.250
easily $200 after all sorts of discounts.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.250
The point is, the software is also very,
very inexpensive comparatively.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.250
Go to the server.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.500
For an upgrade,
$1,000 for unlimited client license.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.800
Now, the key thing when you're talking
to people about our pricing,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.800
you've got to really understand
this does not include any cows.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.310
This is all you can eat.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.060
Once you get this, you're done paying.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.600
There's no fees for directory entries.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.260
There's no fees for
accessing a web server.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.520
There's no fees for
accessing a file server.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.780
So again, the price when you add
it up is really good.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.120
So, you know, what's also interesting is,
you know, Linux is cheap, right?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.010
If you were to buy the
standard edition from Red Hat,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.800
that would be less than this, right?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.880
Because it's so cheap?

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.970
Go to the website in which you
see Standard Edition Server is

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.570
$1,495 from Red Hat.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:42.950
We even compare favorably against the
leading Linux distribution out there.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.950
That's an interesting fact.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.950
The price here is really aggressive
compared to the rest of the industry.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.950
If you want 64-bit

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.400
Red Hat.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.110
You gotta add another 500 bucks.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.740
The price there is $1,992.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.900
Don't exactly understand
the 92 part of it,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.010
but that's what they went with.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.690
So the point is, is when you look at the
acquisition costs were really,

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.100
you know, really nice price.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.410
You all know about the XSERV,
which is a killer price.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:15.040
For $3,000 you get a really functional,
incredibly jam-packed 1U box.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.080
It's amazingly competitive
in the industry.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.390
So again, good price there.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.460
I mean, this is ridiculous.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.550
There's only one number that you
have to tell people about XR of

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.840
RAID when you go back to your company.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.320
What that number is, is three.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.370
3 dollars per gigabyte.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.200
So when you look down the
feature list of the XServe rate,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.490
the first feature is that
it's 3 dollars per gigabyte.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.500
The second is that it's
3 dollars per gigabyte.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.500
And the third is 3 dollars per gigabyte.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.540
That's the thing that it just
blows the industry away here.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.040
Now of course we make it
up in all the accessories,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.370
right?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.060
Because we charge so much
for the fiber channel.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.230
I'm being very facetious here.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.000
499 dollars for a host-bus adapter.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.500
And that even includes the cables,
which can be 100 bucks from other people.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.240
So when you put together the
solution here with the XServe

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.000
rate plus Mac OS X server,
it's pretty incredible.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.240
Oh, and one thing I did
forget to tell you is,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.540
so how much extra is the software?

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.780
with XRiv-Rite.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:51.300
[Transcript missing]

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.700
Okay?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.160
You know, $1,000 to hook into a SAN.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.650
You know,
everyone else out there is around

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.540
three times that for just the
acquisition cost of the software.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.690
So again, when you put it together
-- we've done a lot of,

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.560
you know, price comparisons -- and
put a SAN solution together,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.800
a workgroup SAN environment, you know,
workflow -- I mean,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.740
we have four or five different
workstations participating in a SAN.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.900
We're going to come out at about
half of everybody else out there.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.960
So again,
we've really put together an incredibly

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.560
compelling product lineup here.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.900
Now, you kind of look at it and say,
"So why in the world are you

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.120
pricing it at that point?"

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.500
If we're a third of everybody else,
obviously you could price it higher.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.490
But that's not our strategy.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.740
This is something I think you
want to bring back to people.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:45.490
Our strategy is to take these
incredibly powerful technologies,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.900
bring it down in price,
and get it out to a

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.280
large number of people.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.180
If you look at what we've
been doing in the pro market,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.920
across all of Apple, with Final Cut Pro,
with all the application

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.500
suites we have out there,
with the SAN, with the Mac OS X Server,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.330
is to take incredible power,
bring down the price,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.500
make it accessible by ease of use,
and drive it to higher volumes.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.500
We popularize those technologies,
and that's what we're all about.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.500
Our bet is if we can bring down
the price on a SAN solution,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.500
there are going to be a lot of
people who are going to buy it.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.500
If we're a third of everybody else,
obviously you could price it higher.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.500
But that's not our strategy.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.500
This is something I think you
want to bring back to people.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.500
Our strategy is to take these
incredibly powerful technologies,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.500
bring it down in price,
and get it out to a

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.500
large number of people.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.070
There are going to be a lot more
people who are going to deploy it.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.440
And that's what we're all about.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.870
So again, when people sit there and say,
"I'm going to buy this,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.620
I'm going to buy that,"
and I'm going to say,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.640
"No, I'm going to buy that,"
and they're going to say,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.500
"No, I'm going to buy that."

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.910
"It's too high cost.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.210
We just don't see it that way at all.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.950
I think this is something that
you really want to get back and

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.210
have people look under the covers
and get the facts behind it."

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:51.820
Max for proprietary, right?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:51.820
Well, you know, this has a lot of,
you know, there's a germ of truth here,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:51.820
right?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:51.820
Is in the early 90s,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.920
A lot of IT managers were actually going
around and search and destroy missions.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:14.200
[Transcript missing]

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.540
Well, as you all know,
this is just now factually incorrect.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.880
And this is the best kind
of objection you can get.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.650
Because you can just go and say,
take a look at it.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.490
You know, there's no argument.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.920
The entire innards of
Mac OS X are built on standards,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.820
and we're going to
continue in the future.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.150
You know what's really interesting
is what we do is if we see something

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.430
that's not standard in Mac OS X,
we go back and we make sure

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.820
that we change it over to be
a standard implementation.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.190
You know, you look at where we've
gone from NetInfo to LDAP,

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.820
okay?

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.810
We're going to drive everything
towards the standards.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.980
Because that's not where
we're going to add value,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.820
by owning a proprietary
protocol or file format.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.820
We're going to add
value by making it easy.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.610
Go back to the old thing.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.810
Power of Unix, along with its standards,
is the simplicity of Mac.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.500
Okay?

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.820
So that's just not our strategy.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.870
We're going to make things standard.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:12.900
I'm going one step further.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.300
You know, it's really interesting,
as I've been going around talking to a

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.800
lot of people interested in open source,
what I find is a really actually pretty

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.370
interesting phenomenon out there.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.640
People are looking for an
alternative to Microsoft.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.680
And the reason why they're looking
is they just have this feeling of

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.600
being locked in to a single vendor.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.580
And once you're locked in,
you have no flexibility.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.800
If you have one vendor
and they raise your price,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.340
you pay more money.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.270
It's that simple.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:54.680
What people want is to have one network
with multiple flavors of computers.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.640
In the past, industry standards,
networking standards,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.070
were the way people wanted to
go down and make this happen.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.150
But if you look at how
the industry evolved,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.710
industry standards really didn't do it.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.890
It was too hard to make it
integrate and make everything work.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:22.180
Why people are excited about open
source is because open source is a way

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:27.300
of doing a practical implementation
of a standards-based network.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.900
Because if one vendor uses
an implementation of TCP/IP,

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.560
for instance,
that's identical to the other vendor,

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.560
what are the likelihoods that
it's going to work together?

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.460
It's very high.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.500
It's the same source code, right?

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.680
So it's going to work.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.320
That's the power of open source,
is if everybody is using

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.000
basically the same source to
do network interoperability,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.640
it's much easier for the
vendors to make it work.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.660
It's the same thing goes
with file compatibility.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.200
If we all can see what the source is,
that makes it possible for

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.100
Apple to be compatible with Sun,
which can be compatible with IBM,

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.940
which can be compatible with HP,
which is compatible with Linux,

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.500
which is compatible with Solaris,
which is compatible with Mac OS X.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.710
So open source is a beautiful way,
it's a great mechanism to

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.370
enforce industry standards.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.920
This is what's gaining
momentum right now.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.100
This is where we play.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.260
If you look at what we
have as open source,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.370
this fits perfectly into the scenario.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.540
All the infrastructure and plumbing
of Mac OS X is entirely open source,

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.600
as you all know.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.600
The kernel networking, file systems,
the commands and libraries,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.600
you go up to the rendezvous technology,
open directory, KHTML,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.600
the CDSA architecture,
the printing architecture,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.580
all based on open source.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.810
That means when it comes to
interoperability and compatibility,

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.600
we're going to play extremely
well into the world.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.490
And that's generally what
I'm hearing everybody wants.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.300
You go up to the server,
and actually in the server where

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.780
there's over a hundred open source
projects in Mac OS X Server,

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:14.560
Apache, Samba, JBoss, MySQL, Postfix,
Squirrel Mail, Mailman, OpenLDAP,

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.990
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.200
So again, the summary idea is we can make
the world compatible when we

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.900
go down that open source path.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.180
We can make a single network.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.280
We can have compatible file formats.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:33.280
The other very momentous decision
from Apple in compatibility and

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:39.490
going down an open world is to embed
Java in every single copy of Mac OS X.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:17:25.600
[Transcript missing]

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:31.260
So will the PowerBook work
on my Wi-Fi network?

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:37.820
"It's funny because
people generally think,

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.000
'Well, is it really going to
work?' And so you say,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.640
'Yeah.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.810
Wi-Fi is the same as airport,
same as 802.11.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.150
Of course this is going to work.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.870
We have that up.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.150
Well, yeah, you can also add,
if you can get it to work,

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.980
your Windows system.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.800
But after the weekend trying
to figure out the drivers,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.980
once you get it to work,
it will actually fit

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.880
into the 802.11 world.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.680
We'd love to make that easier,
but we don't see that as our business.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.900
So the idea is, of course it's going to
work on your 802.11 network.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.000
Then you go down and you say,
I get this question all the time.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.940
Okay, yeah, yeah, that works,
but could I put a

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.630
Linksys router in there?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.680
And you go, "Yeah, you know,
we eat that for breakfast, lunch,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.520
and dinner.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.040
No problem." Right?

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.590
So absolutely, positively, yes.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:36.300
So I know you all know this,
but I'm amazed how stating the obvious

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.200
can be a total enlightening experience
for a lot of the people out there.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.460
Especially in the management ranks,
right?

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.800
A lot of people just have bad,
bad ideas embedded in their head.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.310
So again, I walk through this example and
people are usually pretty stunned.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.900
Pretty amazing.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.220
This sounds really great.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.280
Oh man, the Macs look wonderful.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.160
I love this idea of an easy-to-use Unix.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.040
Seems pretty cool.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.780
But oh,
this is never going to fit my network,

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.610
right?

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.860
No way is it going to fit my network.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.200
Get this all the time.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.790
I hear this everywhere.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.790
Well, you know, nah, not quite.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.440
It's going to definitely
fit in the network.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.300
Matter of fact, the beautiful thing is,
is you go out there in

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.430
the world right now,
and an awful lot of the

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.760
corporate networks out there
are based on Internet standards,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.360
right?

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.880
On standard, you know,
Unix-based file systems, you know,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.240
all across the home directories,
you go to printing, mail, security,

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.970
media, all those different
architectures are generally,

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.780
you know, the infrastructure you'll
find in a large company.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.180
And we're going to fit
into that environment.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.940
It's our native environment, right?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.200
It's not a matter of being compatible,
because a compatible sort of implies

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.500
that you have to do something to hook in.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.810
This is our native environment.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:02.690
This is our language.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.270
And that's what we're going to speak.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.970
Again, you know what I find?

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.390
Is a lot of people really have not
gotten it in their head that the

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.600
Mac is probably going to be easier to
integrate into a Unix-based environment

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.540
than any other platform out there.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.800
Because again,
it's a native architecture.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:18.800
And the thing that probably
doesn't work is that the Mac is

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:18.800
not a native architecture.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:24.740
So, the thing that people love is the
idea from their big honking database

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.100
down to their laptop that they're
going to have one architecture

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.720
based on one set of standards.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.260
That's usually pretty
attractive to people.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.770
Again,
this is something that is a subtlety

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.980
that a lot of people don't really get.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.990
So, yeah, fitting into a Unix-based
network is going to be a breeze.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.550
What about Windows?

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:50.490
Well, here an interesting thing
happens is because of the

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.010
wonderful world of open source,
right?

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.030
With Samba 3,
with all the work people have done

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.230
to integrate Unix environments
and Windows environments,

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.880
we tag along right into that.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.350
And we make it really, really simple.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.050
to hook in this environment.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.100
And as you've been hearing
today and over the week,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.020
with Tiger for instance,
we're adding even more

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.060
window compatibility.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.280
We're going to continue
to chip away at this.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.080
And we're going to make this a very
simple environment to plug into,

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.100
all the way from login authentication,
going to Active Directory with

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.580
our Active Directory plugins,
making this much simpler to do,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.350
handling the vast majority
of architectures out there,

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:38.220
with home directories stored on SMB,
shared folders, Exchange plugins now.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.470
We're getting much better at integrating
with an Exchange environment,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.120
obviously down printing,
and all the way through the web.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.530
So the point is we're working like
crazy to make sure that we can integrate

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.370
nicely into the Windows environment.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.440
And you know something?

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.110
It's working.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.490
I go everywhere and I see people
pulling this off on a day-to-day basis,

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:03.290
where they have Windows infrastructure,
they have one set of user accounts

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:07.120
you can log into from both a
Windows environment and from your Mac.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.800
A very nice, seamless environment.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.750
So we're doing this.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.530
So again, Mac is designed to fit into any
kind of architecture out there,

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.760
any kind of network.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.240
From a Unix base, matter of fact,
you know, on the Unix side,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.720
is if it's not working
in your architecture,

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.050
that's a bug, right?

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.270
And we need to go fix it.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.270
That's the way we think of that.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.420
And also on the Windows side,
we're going to go drive like

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.410
crazy to make sure it works.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.210
So again,
this came from our market research.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.900
We went out and we took a hard look
and found that it turns out there's

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.760
a lot of people with Windows.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.410
ecosystems.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.480
We thought it was a good idea to
maybe plug into those environments.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.790
We didn't spend a lot of
money on that research.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:59.800
"Anyway, so the next thing is,
and this is one that I love, this one,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.030
you know, but if I go with Mac,
what am I going to do

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.950
about my Office apps?"

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:19.400
You would not believe how many times I go
and talk to people who run an IT shop

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:25.340
that are unaware of the fact that you
can actually get Microsoft Office from

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.620
Microsoft and actually run it on the Mac.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.700
You know what's really funny?

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:35.160
I was talking to a customer recently,
really smart, very good customer, really,

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.740
really sharp person.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.200
And they're asking,
"So how are you going to handle

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.480
PowerPoint and Excel and so forth?"

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.690
Does OpenOffice or StarOffice
run on your systems?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.800
Yeah, OpenOffice runs.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.770
Are you worried about
Windows Office compatibility?

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.800
Yeah, that's the problem.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.800
Why don't you buy Office?

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.520
It's available?

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.710
Yeah, that's an option.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:11.720
The point is that you really have to
make sure people know that this is there.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.770
You're going to find that
people just don't know this.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.800
You may assume you've been here,
you've seen it.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.790
A lot of people haven't
gotten through their head.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.800
And you know what's really interesting?

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.800
A lot of people believe this
is the best version of Office.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.960
Matter of fact, the way I look at it,
in a lot of ways,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.750
I think Mac OS X is a test bed for
what they're going to do with Longhorn.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.800
So I actually think you're
seeing Office for Longhorn,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.700
is the way I look at it.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.820
Because a lot of the transparency,
a lot of the interesting new features

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.490
they're testing out on the Mac,
I think are going to wind up

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.800
in the other Office over time.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.730
So as you see this quote,
generally people love the

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.360
collaboration features,
the compatibility with

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.650
Office for Windows,
the performance stability

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.800
everybody loves.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.010
What I love about this is, you know,
this really gets it down

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:00.940
to an interesting thing.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.160
The other fascinating thing,
there's a subtlety here, is headline:

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.710
Microsoft ports Office to Unix.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:15.220
You don't think of it that way,
but they actually do have an

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.280
Office that runs on a Unix.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.030
All right, so clearly we have Office.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.700
The other one is, well, OK,
they got Office,

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.420
but there are no other applications,
right?

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.360
12,000 applications for Mac OS X.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.660
12,000.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:34.000
We're four years into this,
and we've got 12,000 apps.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.930
And now what you're seeing
is the turning point is a lot

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.380
of these are Mac OS X only,
focused on Mac OS X,

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.160
taking full advantage of
what Mac OS X has out there.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.600
You know, really across the board.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.980
You know, you're talking about, you know,
from the productivity apps,

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.160
the publishing, science, you know,
enterprise apps,

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.840
a lot of exciting announcements, IBM.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.900
You know, this week, Oracle with,
you know, their 10G platform,

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.640
the leading edge,
cutting edge applications

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.200
showing up on Mac OS X.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.280
And a lot of these are new.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:11.020
Because of the Unix underpinning,
what we're seeing is this influx

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.960
of interesting applications.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.720
You know, you think about it.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.720
Oracle is a big enough application to
crush any operating system out there,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.750
and it's running beautifully on Mac.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.100
So look at this.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.600
You know, one of the things when you're
looking at the health of a platform,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.500
especially in the operating system world,
the real indicator,

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.100
the harbinger of the future,
is what are the apps people doing, right?

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.580
Because nobody buys a
new operating system.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.740
You buy an operating system to run apps.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.280
This is probably the most
important slide in a lot of ways.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.020
You're going to see.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.580
Is our developer
connection is going wild.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.160
Look at that.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.390
Developers gone wild.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.190
New video.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.350
So four-fold, over four, right?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.380
Probably around four and a
half in the last four years,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.380
new developers, unbelievable.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.550
And you know what's great about this?

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.600
We haven't seen the
fruits of this labor yet.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.160
These are all people who are
busily writing things now that

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.400
are going to be coming out later.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.040
So what I think you're going to see
is an incredible explosion of apps.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.900
Now, what's even cooler is because of the
technologies we've put in Mac OS X,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.560
the apps that they're
going to be creating,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.090
I think,
are going to be the most innovative apps

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.350
you're going to see in the industry.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.520
So not only is it going
to be a lot of apps,

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.260
but you're going to get a bunch of
apps where you can only do certain

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.410
capabilities on Mac OS X and
you can't get it anywhere else.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.680
When you look at the whole, you know,
just looking at our

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.140
announcement with Tiger,
think about it.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.540
With core graphics,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.900
Can you imagine the kind of
interesting things people are

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.600
going to be able to do with that?

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.100
With our whole core
data that we introduce?

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.790
That's going to be another amazing thing.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.560
So we're creating a platform
that I think is going to spur

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.750
another level of innovation,
and you're going to see an incredible

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.290
set of applications showing up.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.720
So not only is it volume,
it's also the quality of the apps

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.290
I think are going to be incredible.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.670
So, the other thing to always have
at your fingertips if people are

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.100
worried about the number of apps
is the Macintosh Products Guide.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.020
First of all, it's a great website.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.880
I mean, it's really, really handy.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.090
And you can go there and
find just about everything.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.100
I'm going to leave this up so
if you need to copy it down,

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.940
you can do that.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.100
But go there, check it out.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.100
This is where you find all the different
solutions available on Mac OS X.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.060
There are 12,000 different
solutions there for you to look at.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.100
So, there's probably
something you need there.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.100
So, it's guide.apple.com.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.630
Okay, the other one,
you ever heard this one?

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:50.960
Macs are not for serious computing.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.600
Not really, right?

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.900
What we're seeing,
which I think is one of the most

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.170
interesting and most exciting things
right now going on in Mac OS X,

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.960
is not only is it not
for serious computing,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.310
it is the

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.100
It is the system for serious computing.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.300
The absolute leaders in this industry,
this is a picture of James Gosling,

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:25.310
the inventor of Java,
Sun CTO of the Java division over at Sun.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.380
He loves his PowerBook.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.130
He loves Mac OS X.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:35.800
This is one of the leading
application developers in the world.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:41.010
Go to any open source conference
and what you're going to start

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.670
seeing is over half the people
showing up with their PowerBook.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.240
Go to our friends at Slashdot and
take a look through the boards.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.600
You're going to see tons
of talk about Mac OS X,

00:29:54.690 --> 00:30:00.470
because this is the favorite platform
for the leaders in the industry.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.870
So when you hear someone say, oh,
this is a wimpy platform,

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.670
it's only for artists,
we'll get into that in a second.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.100
Not true.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.400
They're really behind the times.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.040
This is the place for people
who are on the cutting edge.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.450
And the reason why is very,
it's really obvious.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:23.900
It's an open source environment.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.460
You get all the tools you need.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.820
We give the tools away with Mac OS X.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.870
Plus, you get to run all
your productivity apps,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.360
and it just works.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.990
So, you know,
what's really interesting is

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.540
developers don't want to be sysadmins,
right?

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.820
They want to develop code.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.360
So, it's just easy.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.440
They don't have to worry about it, right?

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.640
And then the other thing that's, I think,
killer is when you go to a high,

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.220
really leading-edge technology platform,

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.890
It's available on a mobile system.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.540
You can take it with you.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.700
It's available on your portable.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.600
And again, that's something you just
can't get anywhere else.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.760
So I showed you this, you know,
the increase of growth.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.440
I think this is sort
of a fascinating thing.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.720
So it's growing like crazy.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.220
So where's the growth coming from?

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.000
Take a look at this.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.840
If you look in 2001,
the people who identified themselves

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.790
as being interested in Unix,
Linux, or Darwin,

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:35.160
it was 19%. So it's 19% of a smaller
base than you got in June 2004,

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.540
where 34% of the people
identified them as Unix,

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.810
Linux, and Darwin developers.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:50.690
That's a really interesting shift in
the makeup of our developer community.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:56.740
Again, this is for power users,
this is for the hardcore technologists,

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.880
the lead developers on the

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.260
So how about computation?

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.520
I don't even have to say anything here,
do I?

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.920
With Virginia Tech being number
three supercomputer in the world,

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.210
you know what's really amazing?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:15.800
Think about it.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:20.900
Five years ago,
if I stood up there and said, "You know,

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:20.900
in five years,

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.950
The third fastest supercomputer in
the world will be an Apple computer?

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.700
I don't think that would have
been a credible statement.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:37.200
But lo and behold, that's what happened.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.200
And again,
Mac OS X really helped get us there.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.200
Now, that was Virginia Tech.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.360
Well, we're going to keep it coming.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.250
So now we have Colsa coming out
with some incredible thermodynamic

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:54.260
simulations that they're going to be
doing with just unbelievable-- I mean,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.830
the kind of numbers we're
talking about is teraflops,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:03.870
25 teraflops is just an ungodly
amount of floating point performance.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.540
And look at the price down there.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.260
That goes back to that
original statement.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.390
The reason why everyone's
going towards the Mac for these

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.600
supercomputers is the price tag.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.990
A lot of times,
the other kind of supercomputers out

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.370
there are literally over $200 million.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.060
and they're doing it for like five,
ten million dollars putting

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.940
together these projects.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:29.140
So the price performance here
is just earth shattering.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.770
So we are getting the most
sophisticated technologists in the

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:38.520
planet building the most significant
technologies on our platform,

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.740
on Mac OS X.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.140
And all that does is just
makes Mac OS X even better,

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.510
because we're really pushing the envelope
and will continue to make it even,

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.720
even better because we
have customers like this.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.220
So again, unbelievable power.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.310
And then I mentioned
earlier about Oracle 10G.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.560
I mean, you know, Oracle on a Mac.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.580
I mean, you know, that's something like,
I mean, again, five years ago,

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.730
that was kind of like Bambi vs.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.730
Godzilla.

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.060
You know,
where the big foot just comes down

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.760
and you kind of have this picture
of a flattened pancake of a system.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.600
But that's not the way it is today.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:22.790
With Mac OS X running on our G5s,
we can eat this database alive right now.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.130
No problem.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:30.420
So again, a really big seed change
in what Mac is all about,

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:34.780
what Mac OS X is all about,
and the ability to handle the

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.340
most challenging computation
out there in the world.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:42.400
So this is another one I love.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.890
Well, we would switch to Mac, but boy,
we're going to have to

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:47.340
retrain all our users.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.320
You ever heard that?

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:52.740
Everyone,
we're going to retrain our users.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.290
OK.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.140
So the irony here is you
know who's getting trained,

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.940
don't you?

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.640
It's the teacher.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.780
My point here,
I'm being a little facetious,

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:14.420
but the idea that a third
grader can sit in front of a

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.610
Mac without any instructions,
without a lot of help,

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.730
and sit down and get
it and figure it out,

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.270
kind of indicates that the
majority of people's employees

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.000
could probably handle it as well.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.200
Now, of course,
there are going to be some

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.990
phone calls in the beginning of,
you know, "There's only one mouse button.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.790
Which one do I hit?" You know,
those kinds of questions.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:42.540
But, you know, the point is, you know,
it takes a little while to get used to,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.340
maybe like two days,
three days to get used to.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.600
There may be some calls generated.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.000
But, here's the interesting part.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:53.950
Everybody I know who's implemented on the
Mac systems in their company has noted

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:59.250
that after that initial startup period,
what ends up happening is you

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:05.420
actually end up getting like the
help desk requests just die down.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.480
And there's actually three letters
in my mind why that's the case.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.540
And those three letters are DLL.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:24.740
You've obviously felt the pain.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:29.360
The point is,
once you get rid of a lot of that cruft,

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.200
it does get a lot smoother sailing.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.160
I think this is something that
people have to really think about.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:39.770
Maybe there's a little training up front,
but in the long haul,

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.770
your help desk is just going to go down.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.460
How about this one?

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.040
Have to retrain administrators.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.040
What I love about this is, you know,
I have one answer to that.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:37:02.880
So you look at that, and the point is,
if you know Linux, Solaris, HPUX, IBM AX,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.160
if you know any variant
of Unix out there,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.260
if you know Irix,
you're going to sit down in front of

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:13.050
Mac OS X and fool around for about a day,
and you're going to kind of get it.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.240
Right?

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.760
I mean, it's not that different
than everything else.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.420
I mean, LS...

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:43.200
[Transcript missing]

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.360
It's like,
I don't know how you're supposed to.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.640
So it's really interesting.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.180
I have people say, okay, well,
I'm going to remote log into some

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.740
other machine to show you that,
you know,

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:52.520
and they have to go through their paces.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.270
But what I find is really funny is within
10 minutes when I put this in front of

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:00.300
somebody who understands Unix or Linux,
they go from grumbling and not believing

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:05.140
it to then coming back and going,
ooh, this is kind of cool, right?

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:09.200
And what's really funny is you'd think,
you know, a lot of times I find funny

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.260
when I demo to this crowd is,
you know, you go in, you show them, like,

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.400
all the really amazing graphics
that you can do on Mac OS X.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.650
You know, you show them, like, expose.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.320
You show them all sorts of cool,
you know, all the neat stuff.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.350
And they look at it, and they go, oh,
that's okay.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.450
And then you bring up a
terminal with green text,

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.530
and they go, ooh, that's cool.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:30.800
laughter

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.180
Go figure.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:37.980
Okay.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.690
So the point here is, again,
the learning curve is pretty, you know,

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.440
it's a really good learning curve.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.220
The other beautiful thing about it is
all the kids coming out of school today

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.370
are all really versed in the whole Unix
infrastructure with Linux and so forth.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.260
So there's a big labor pool out there.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.510
You know what's also cool about
this is that what we're finding is,

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.950
I've heard this phrase
bandied about a lot,

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:04.990
is we're mainstreaming

00:39:05.100 --> 00:40:17.000
[Transcript missing]

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.730
And by the way, just as an aside,
this is really, you remember that third

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.600
grade teacher earlier?

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.340
We actually have really designed a lot of
the server admin and all the admin tools

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.950
to apply to that school teacher setting
up a network inside of their classroom.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.710
I mean, that is a design center here,
so we really try to

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.140
make it that easy to do.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.230
And I think, you know,
we've done a pretty good job of that.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.900
We have another product, ARD,
Apple Remote Desktop,

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.640
that is another just incredible
tool that makes it easy for admins

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.850
to do all sorts of cool stuff.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.540
Here what you see, you know,
as we're looking at another session,

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.250
Joe's PowerBook, right?

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.540
You can do all sorts
of really cool stuff,

00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:00.260
you know, software distribution,
asset management, remote administration,

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.640
remote assistance.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.680
You know, if you have a couple
Macs in your department,

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.310
you want to make sure that
you have remote desktop,

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:11.670
because that's the best way to
administer Mac OS X desktops out there.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.580
The reason I bring this up is
when you show this kind of a

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.870
tool to people who are used to
the more Windows-oriented world,

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.000
you know,
the light bulbs go off and they go,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.460
this is really cool.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:27.390
Again, you know, that retraining cost of
administration goes way down

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.190
when they see tools like this.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.380
The other thing I wanted to mention out,
I don't know if you all know about this,

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.390
but there's migrating to
Mac OS X server from Windows NT,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.360
really interesting document.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.060
I don't know,
has anyone seen this before?

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.680
Okay, not a lot of people.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.240
I would really,
really recommend you go check this out.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.060
You know, again,
migrating from Mac OS X server

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.550
from Windows NT,
because what it does is

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.850
this is just a page from it.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.650
It literally goes through
the screens and says,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.160
here's what you see, you know, in NT,
here's what you're going

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.490
to see in Mac OS X.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:03.330
So it really speaks to the people
who know the whole Windows world.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.360
So we've gone a really extra
step here to make it easy to

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.570
get past that retraining issue.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:13.400
You know, you can just move right over,
we do the translation for people.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.980
Okay, now what I want to talk about
is one of the killer things.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.780
When you put it all together, again,
we're talking about skeptics.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:28.150
If you have anybody in your organization
that's doing any kind of technical work,

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:32.920
any kind of, you know, Unix environment,
this set of slides, I think,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.520
really kind of nails it for people.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.320
is you have, let's see here,
I haven't had time with this clicker.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.460
There we go.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.110
This is PowerPoint, okay, on Mac OS X.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:54.300
This is a Java application,
SAP front end,

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.990
all running on the same machine,
PowerPoint, SAP.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.920
And this is an X11 application.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:10.680
So we have Office, Java, X11,
all on one machine.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.600
Go find me that anywhere.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.740
This is a unique
offering in the industry.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.680
Nobody can do this.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.390
I've been actually working
in the Unix world for,

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.070
I hate to admit it,
but almost 20 years now

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.670
in the commercial world.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:35.030
This is a screen that literally I've
been waiting for like 15 years to see,

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.700
right?

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.230
Where you have Office coupled
with a Java environment,

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.980
coupled with powerful
technology applications,

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:47.700
all running in a really
robust Unix environment.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.440
For an awful lot of
people in the industry,

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.670
this is unbelievably exciting.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.200
And when they see this,
it really changes the

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.700
way they view about it.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.700
So it really comes together
as the dream machine.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.690
And you layer Apple, you know,
ease of use on top of it,

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.700
the legendary Mac OS X.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.700
You know what's funny?

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.700
Because it's a computer
that's actually fun to use,

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.400
and you can do your business with it,
and you can do your

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.700
productivity applications.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.520
And when you put it all together,
and you can take it with

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.310
you on your portable,
what I've found is, again,

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.980
talking to skeptics,
I can usually really get

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.480
their curiosity going here.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:23.500
Especially if you ever hear
anyone who's talking about,

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.690
you know, or if your company says, "Hey,
I want to know what you're doing."

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.120
Or if your company is thinking
about going to Linux in any way,

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.690
shape, or form, right?

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.470
You've got to look at this.

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.850
Because in a way, this is like, you know,
I think the 22nd century version

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.700
of Linux in a lot of ways,
right?

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.500
Okay?

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.700
So we've got it all here.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.700
And again, the spirit of this is, I mean,
you all know this,

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.800
but I'm trying to give you some of
the things that I found when I talk

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.570
to people really get them excited.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.620
And a lot of it's stating the obvious,
right?

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.700
I mean,
this isn't really particularly profound,

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.700
but what I found is when
I go and tell it to people,

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.700
it really makes it a lot easier for
them to get over the hurdle to the max.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.590
So when I look at it, you know,
fundamentally,

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.700
when you go under the covers,
and you do the work,

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.680
you actually go through the
exercise of pricing things out,

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.570
which you will find is
max R cost effective.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.200
Okay?

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:24.600
When you put it all together,
software and hardware, layer in the CALs,

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.300
and then if you really
wanted to get fancy,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.140
then you start estimating
the kind of help desk,

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.800
the kind of administrative costs on top.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.960
But I'm just talking even on just
straight ahead acquisition costs.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.180
We're going to be very competitive.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.500
Max are open.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.000
Ironically, we're just about the most
open platform out there as far

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:45.900
as the whole infrastructure,
open source, you get your hands on it,

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.980
you can do what you want with it,
all the standards throughout

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.280
the system are there.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.460
We're going to fit in the network.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.740
Matter of fact, one of my favorite tests,
I have a friend who just convinced

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.300
his startup to go down the Mac path.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.470
It was a bunch of software developers,
and they were all privately

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:08.080
using their Power Books.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.540
Their management, their IT guy,
didn't want them to do that.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.660
So what they did is they cut a
deal with the guy and they said,

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.870
"If you can't tell,

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:18.940
It's a Mac on the other
side of your network,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.560
right, that's plugging into your network?

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.100
Will you let us do it?

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.600
And he said, that's a deal.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.800
And what was really interesting is
just recently with the Panthers,

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.400
you know, Active Directory integration
as well as being able to handle

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.020
an Exchange server much better,
they finally got over that hurdle.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:39.590
And actually, the IT director said, fine,
as long as I don't know it's

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.260
a Mac on the other side,
perfectly fine,

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.600
and it worked beautifully, right?

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.790
So it just plugs in, right?

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.700
Office on the Mac.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.340
Yep, it's there and it's compatible.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.860
And it's a genuine copy from Microsoft.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.890
12,000 apps.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:03.790
Tons of apps available.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:12.540
They're absolutely powerful
systems for very serious computing.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.780
Now, you know what's also interesting,
right?

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.980
It's only for artists.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.080
Well,
you know what's wild that's going on?

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.780
I think a lot of you probably are
participating in this right now,

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:27.730
is with the whole move to digital,
especially high definition,

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:31.690
these are the most challenging
applications of today.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.790
These applications demand the most

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.140
from computing, the most from storage.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:42.640
They beat on the storage infrastructure
more than any other apps out there.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:45.390
So the interesting part is,
is where Apple normally is,

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:50.010
is in the very highest end
of the performance scale.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:53.590
This shouldn't be a surprise.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.340
They're easy to manage, easy to use.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:00.020
Again,
that retraining boogeyman out there,

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:04.740
I think, is largely something that we
can vanquish fairly simple.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:08.720
Again, my third grader can
handle it pretty well.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:10.970
We think you guys can handle it.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.600
So the point is, we go through this.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.620
A lot of really obvious things to say,
worth saying when you go back and

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.530
you want to talk to people about
integrating Macs into your environment.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.330
But there's one last thing that I wanted
to talk about that I haven't hit on,

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:29.550
is the security aspect.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:38.680
Turns out right now there is a huge move
of people who are just kind of two views.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:42.810
One view is the amount
of money they spend

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.590
A lost time due to viruses is phenomenal.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.360
Just the amount of
downtime due to viruses.

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:55.970
People have lost,
literally major companies

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:57.570
have lost a whole day.

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:15.420
of operations due to handling a virus.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.420
You realize that could be the
whole profit for a quarter?

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.420
That one day?

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.420
That's a risk that's a
really brutal risk to take.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.420
So, you know,
a lot of people are sort of saying,

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.420
do I have to do this?

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.420
Right?

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:18.720
So what's going on here,
the other half of the people

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.300
are sitting there and saying,
is it smart to have a monoculture?

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:24.610
I'm sure you've all heard this argument.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.570
It's saying, look, just like in biology,
if you have

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:51.750
All the wheat is identical.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.750
One fungus can come and wipe it all out.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.750
There's no redundancies,
there's no variety.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.750
It's extremely vulnerable.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.750
Same thing goes if you have one
architecture in your company.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.750
One virus can come in and shut it down.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:50:58.600
[Transcript missing]

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.300
You know,
it's because the volume is small.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:02.490
Right?

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.880
It's a small part of the market.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:08.130
As a result, if I'm a virus writer,
I'm not going to go after that.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.410
I'm going to go to the big stage,
which is the 95% of computers

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:13.420
out there that are Windows,
right?

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.450
You hear that a lot.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:19.020
To that I say, hey,
we'll run that experiment.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:28.540
We'll take the 25% market share and
we'll see if we're secure or not.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.100
Maybe we'll be, maybe we won't.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.060
But we'll run that exercise.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.980
The point is, at the end of the day,
it doesn't really matter why.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:41.920
We have not yet had, knock on wood,
nobody's perfect.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.410
We haven't had a major virus yet.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:52:15.600
[Transcript missing]

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:20.230
The best way to stomp out bugs
is to have somebody do peer

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:22.260
review and look at your work.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.930
Have some other eyes look at it.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:26.630
You guys have all done,
you either develop code or

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:30.120
done engineering projects,
and you see things from one angle.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.200
Somebody else comes along and
they'll look at it from a very

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.420
different angle and find an error.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.550
Well,
that's what open source is all about,

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.320
is peer review,
having other people look at the code.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.780
And that's something we think
has really been effective for us.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.000
We get ahead of it.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.510
Matter of fact,
we find that a majority of people warning

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:53.790
us about a potential flaw comes from
outside of our development organization.

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.800
It's someone else
looking at it and saying,

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.760
"Oh, look at that.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.800
That could be a problem."
These are theoretical,

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.800
but we get to fix them ahead of time.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.730
So we have a lot of eyes looking at that.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.160
Contrast with a proprietary approach
where you have to trust the vendor

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.650
and that particular development
organization to get every single bug.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.790
You just have to trust the vendor.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.800
You just have to trust
that they're doing it.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:21.800
And you also know that there's no outside
kind of auditing going on of their code.

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.760
It's only that one organization.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:28.510
And you tend to get a pretty single
view of the world from that standpoint.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.800
So we think that's been really good.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.150
The other interesting thing
is we also built Mac OS X from

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.800
the ground up to be secure.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.800
And that's also paid dividends.

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.250
You know, a lot of ways,
we had the advantage because

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.800
Mac OS X is a new operating system.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.030
We can develop that after we knew about
the whole internet and we knew about a

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:49.740
lot of the potential flaws out there.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:53.800
So we could build it in as we
built Mac OS X from the ground up.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.010
So as a result,
when you look at the things we

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:59.750
built in as far as secure setup,
all our ports are closed

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:01.790
right out of the box.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:11.770
The services are off.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:11.770
I have a customer I was talking
to who was at a university.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:11.770
He

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.230
So what he does,
he goes into the server room,

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:20.500
installs a computer,
gets it up and running, gets it going,

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:26.500
walks back to his office, sits down,

00:54:27.700 --> 00:57:32.300
[Transcript missing]

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.600
When you go back,
I try to run through some

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.440
of the things I've heard,
some of the myths I've encountered,

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.940
try to give you some comebacks to that.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.470
But at the end of the day,
I think when you kind

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:47.080
of sum it up and say,
it's all about the power of Unix,

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.500
the simplicity of the Mac,
whenever I get to people to

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.370
really have that light go on
and that's what they're getting,

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:55.320
people generally really get excited.

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.860
I love going sitting down.

00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:02.280
My favorite person to go talk
to is the absolute skeptic.

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.650
And whenever I go through a demo,
I can usually get them

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.280
turned in about a half hour.

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:11.130
And again, it all comes back to it's all
about the power of Unix and

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:12.390
the simplicity of the Mac.
