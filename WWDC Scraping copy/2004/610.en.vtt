WEBVTT

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.650
Hi there.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.120
My name is Ray Kiddy.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.190
I'm in the WebObjects Engineering group.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.120
And we're here to talk about JBoss,
the J2EE container that is

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.720
shipped with Mac OS X Server.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.720
And we're

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.700
Just FYI, probably the level of the talk,
it's kind of hard to describe

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.800
in the terms in the catalog.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.050
This is an introductory probably
talk about JBoss itself.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.210
For instance,
we can talk about setting up

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.290
the connection managers to
talk to the Apple CDSA system

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.980
to get secure authentication.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.780
And that by itself would
take several hours.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.260
So we're not going into extreme
detail on any of these kind of things.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.300
Probably if you're here because
you use Mac OS X Server and you

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.580
deploy Java applications or you
build some Java applications and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.190
are needing to move them to a more
serious deployment environment,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.120
you've heard of JBoss,
you've looked at it, it's confusing.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.030
You can read some of this
documentation and it makes my

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.230
eyes go blurry when I read it.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.720
Some of the Sun documentation.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.920
It's just famously,
you go catatonic reading it.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.250
But if you're at that point,
you can read the magazines.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.500
They don't explain anything.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.200
You can read some of those articles
and you can come out of it thinking,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.520
well, I know some more buzzwords,
but I know zero more information.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.060
There's no more knowledge that I know.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.260
So I'm hoping to get you past
the first hurdle in deciding,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.060
yes, this is a realistic sort of
deployment scheme to look at.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.700
And on Mac OS X Server,
we think we've made it a lot easier.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.610
So if you're already ready to
ask me questions about your

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.010
XML descriptors and problems you're
seeing in cross-configurations,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.740
that's probably not the kind
of thing we can go over here,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.180
but I think most people are
not quite up to that point.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.600
And to go into a very advanced
talk would take quite a while.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.440
So JBoss is ready to
take on the enterprise.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.140
Really, businesses are taking open
source tools very seriously now.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.160
JBoss has managed to
make a name for itself.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.740
It's known.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.890
The promoters of it are very outspoken.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.900
The enterprises are realizing
that they want to not be

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.220
locked into certain platforms,
that they want to not be

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.800
locked into certain tool sets.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.680
And so they're looking for these kind
of solutions where things are available.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.670
Even college kids can get this,
and they can find people who

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.680
know this moving forward.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.930
And, you know,
it helps to have somebody who actually

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.930
comes from a research firm that
the enterprise people listen to.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.930
So we put this on.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.900
So another marketing-oriented slide.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.580
Sorry about that.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.890
But I wanted to show that
this is published by JBoss,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.030
but it's by a third party.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.160
So you can have a bit of faith in that.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.970
Between 2002 and 2003, the deployments in
enterprise of JBoss doubled.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.390
It was pretty significant growth.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.860
This one, as a development environment,
or for developing J2EE applications,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.150
JBoss is actually the most popular.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.760
So what that means is that
people out there may be

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.680
deploying on other J2EE servers,
but they have JBoss available.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.860
It's free, so they have it.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.330
And the people writing the
applications are familiar with JBoss.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.290
So going forward, those people,
as they become more senior,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.840
make decisions eventually.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.740
And JBoss has some legs
in terms of lasting,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.370
because the new people
coming in are using it more.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.900
We'll get off the marketing slides soon,
I promise.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.210
Again, for the future,
JBoss is moving forward very quickly.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.980
Now, Apple has the latest
version 3 on its servers.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.460
Version 4 is, of course,
much talked about by

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.280
the JBoss organization,
but it's still very new.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.360
Cutting edge, as in you will slice
your hand if you use it.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.900
So we're not putting that on
every server we ship out the door.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.200
But JBoss has done a really good job
of having the documentation is a lot

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.500
more available than it used to be.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.840
The wikis and the blogs are very active.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.880
They're active in the JSR process,
moving the J2EE standard forward.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.090
In particular, I don't know if you've
seen the EJB 3.0 stuff,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.700
but I wish EJB looked like that
two or three or four years ago.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.880
It's finally seeming to become
a little bit more simpler.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.150
And companies, as I said,
are increasingly setting

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.080
policies that they would prefer
to use open source tools,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.590
tools that don't lock them into licenses,
that don't lock them onto platforms.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.940
Tools that they can deploy on different
servers without asking some big company.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.040
So why Mac OS X Server and JBoss?

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.620
We think we've done good
things to make JBoss a lot

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.540
easier to use out of the gate.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.200
So I'm going to talk about those.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.860
So we've customized it.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.670
That's significant.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.770
The server admin application to start
and stop the container and to control

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.940
which configuration you're running.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.630
Server admin is used to administer a lot
of other services on Mac OS X Server.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.480
So the DHCP servers or the
FTP or the mail or whatever.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.860
We've made starting the
application just very easy.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.520
Essentially,
you can think about starting the

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.840
JBoss server and then 10 minutes
later you can have it up running

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.180
and then actually deploy an app
in it about three minutes later.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.000
So, you know,
that's not the end of your learning task.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.940
But it's at least a lot
easier to get started.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.270
You can download JBoss and
try to set up a distribution.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.960
It's going to take you a while
just to figure out the first

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.060
couple error messages you see.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.560
So we've saved you from a lot of that.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.570
Once you start to do something strange,
you'll see those error messages.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.120
You'll have to figure
them out eventually.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.380
But we've customized this for a couple
different scenarios that you can use that

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.040
will handle a lot of people's use cases.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.450
And we have graphical tools for
the monitoring deployment and

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.820
configuration of the container.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.550
So if you've tried to
do this stuff by hand,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.310
swinging without a net,
you end up VI and the XML and you

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.000
end up writing scripts to unbundle.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.350
It's a pain.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.140
It's a bother.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.560
So just getting an initial configuration
up that's reasonable for your machine

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.460
can be quite a learning experience.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.450
And we've essentially
made that automatic.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.650
There are three configurations
that come out of the box,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.760
and we'll talk more about them later,
but two of the configurations

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.850
are deployment.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.640
One is a deployment standalone,
just a single machine.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.380
One of them is deployment
for a clustered environment.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.100
We've set that up for you so
it works just automatically.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.750
And then another one is a
development environment.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.690
You're developing the application.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.470
You want to get a lot of
information out of what's going on,

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.370
and you don't need it to be performant.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.630
You don't need to emphasize the
performance of the application itself.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.380
The development configuration
is set up that way.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.700
JBoss itself, when you download it,
if you were to download it,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.370
it would be conservative about
what JVM you're looking at.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.850
So it would assume you have one
of the 1.3 versions of the JVM,

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.730
and options would be turned off.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.730
These options can be turned
on if you have the 1.4 JVM.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.110
You wouldn't necessarily
know which options those are.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.020
And actually, we've gone in.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.580
We know you're on a system with 1.4,
and actually now probably 1.4 too.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.720
And so we've gone in and
turned on those options.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.000
But we've also tuned
the parameters for that.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.080
And also we've, frankly,
looked at what the

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.860
parameters mean for the JVM,
whether they make sense,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.350
whether they do what they
say they're going to do.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.900
And if they didn't make sense,
we don't turn them on.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.480
So you don't have to go through
that discovery process yourself.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.880
You have n number of
configuration options and how

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.680
many combinations of that.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.000
And we've also done some test
configurations to sort of scope out

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.040
and run tests on to see what you want.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.450
It's pretty complicated.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.440
So we've optimized it for
the version of Java that's on

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.430
Mac OS X server that you've got.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.760
And we've optimized the deployment
environments for performance.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.390
Reliability and performance
tests were run quite a while,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.500
and the spec compliance as well.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.600
You know, you get it from JBoss.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.180
Their interpretation of the spec
is sometimes a little bit flexible.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:57.950
And we think we've interpreted the
spec to see what it means and made the

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.300
change that was appropriate to that.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:08.680
So this will help your learning process.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.910
So on Mac OS X Server,
it's not just a standard Unix distro.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.600
The file system has
laid out certain things.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.840
The tools, server admin,
it expects things to be in

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.060
certain places that make sense.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.320
And indeed,
we've put JBoss into library JBoss.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.270
The logging is redirected to
the library logs directory,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.620
which is where most of the
system expects logs to be.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.020
And you could go in and manually
defeat that to put logs somewhere else,

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.890
but there's really no reason to do that.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.070
The nice thing about this is that
when you switch configurations,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.940
you don't have to re-figure
out where your logs are.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.910
The standard distribution, you know,
all the logs go to different places

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.460
when you switch configurations,
so it can be a bit confusing.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:08.040
We've essentially made JBoss fit in with
the other tools on Mac OS X Server by

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.920
putting it in the expected places.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.190
And then, frankly, you know,
dealing with the changes

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.370
that fell out of that,
dealing with the things

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.900
which should be settable,
and yet you set them and

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.730
they do something odd.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.410
So we fixed all that.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.940
Server admin, as I said,
is the tool that Mac OS X Server uses

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.240
to administer all of the different
server services on the machine.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.390
And so it's as easy as clicking
on a button in a list and

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.830
picking the configuration.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.740
And from a pull-down and
then clicking one button,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.780
your JBoss container is running.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.950
So I'm going to say again,
that's really nice.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.680
You know, a lot of times,
I don't know about you, but, you know,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.750
if I can make the first step,
it's a lot easier to figure

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.840
out the second or third steps.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.310
But sometimes the first step itself,
you know, I remember trying to write in a

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.040
language I hadn't worked with,
and until I saw somebody give me a

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.730
20-line program that did something,
you know, I was like, oh,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.020
that's a good idea.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.100
You know, it didn't make sense.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.890
But once I saw that very first, you know,
yes, this works,

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.580
then I could step off from there.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.390
This gives you a place to step off from.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.680
This gives you a working server,
a working container, you know.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.070
And then when you go to the JBoss
list for help or information,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.680
you can say, you know, before I did X,
you know, this worked.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.320
You know, and I know it worked.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.340
You know, Apple shipped it.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.140
They had tested it.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.020
You know, it's more than just, you know,
your Joe Bob calling in.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.510
You know,
I'm doing something weird over here,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.360
and tell me why it's not working.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.920
You know, that's a little bit
hard for them to answer.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.630
But we have a known scenario.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.710
We have a known system,
and it gets you started,

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.150
puts you in a really solid position.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:03.730
So Watchdog is not JBoss specific,
but it launches processes for you,

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.960
watches them, makes sure if you register
your container process with

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.480
it and make sure it stays up,
the reliability, if things shut down,

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.900
they'll come back up.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.310
So it's very simple to use.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.770
There's a man page.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.940
and not really too much
else to say about that.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.370
The more of these things, you know,
the better these things work,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.820
the less there is to say about them.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:40.840
Security is, of course,
a huge ball of string.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.040
It's just one little
slice of the pie here.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.220
But actually, that makes sense.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.000
As I said,
we could take just one aspect of

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.460
security and talk all day about it.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:57.040
But really,
Mac OS X Server comes with some

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.260
things that make security and
authentication fairly easy.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.800
And JBoss just takes advantage
of them without any extra effort.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.820
Mac OS X Server comes with a
JAAS implementation based on the

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:16.600
CDSA standard stuff that Apple's done
and really strong authentication.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.910
The NetInfo configuration,
just having regular user accounts

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.330
in NetInfo and setting up your
communication with the container

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.710
to require authentication via
those accounts is very easy.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.410
So then you've got the server admin.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.460
That can set up your
user accounts as well.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:39.680
And you can just use the
Mac OS X Server tools to set up

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.620
your users in a very natural way.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.600
And then JBoss just knows about them.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.870
Apache is another one there's not too
much to say about because it works well.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.080
I'm not going to tell you anything
about Apache that you don't know.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.400
We use the 1329 version of
the server on there right now.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.480
The mod JK is included on the
system if you want to include it,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.790
if you want to have it be used by
the Apache server to more tightly

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.020
bind the server and your container.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.820
You may want to have them in
different -- with a farther

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.010
connection from each other,
different process spaces and everything.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:23.040
Or you may want to use the mod
JK to have Apache do things a

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.970
little bit more quickly with JBoss.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.700
And that's your choice.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:29.700
So that's there.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:37.810
So MySQL, of course,
everybody knows MySQL, fairly robust.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:44.220
Another open source project like JBoss,
a bit older, probably.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.320
JBoss comes with hypersonic, of course,
and hypersonic has some nice things.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.530
But frankly, how many O'Reilly books are
there about hypersonic versus

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.040
how many are there about MySQL?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.600
MySQL is quite a bit more known,
scales up to larger

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.340
deployments much more easily.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:05.140
And we've included the database
descriptor XML information that

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.260
lets you just use the MySQL server
that's included on the machine and

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.820
just lets you drop that in and go,
not worry about it.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.010
You don't have to set up
the database to start with.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.850
You don't have to populate
everything to start with.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.680
You can just start using it.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.220
That's certainly a lot of the task,
a lot of the job is

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.210
getting your container to
communicate with the database,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.150
and we've made that easy.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.060
So, again,
there's a whole lot of error messages

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.400
you might have to figure out if
we didn't already do this for you.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.370
You don't have to learn those.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.750
You can just start using it.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.130
So, and LDAP is popular for enterprises.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.640
The directories, the authentication,
user authentication,

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.710
JBoss can take advantage of that as well.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:01.480
So if you use LDAP for that purpose,
it's trivial to use the LDAP information

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.800
for identifying users in the container.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.030
So Apple uses LDAP internally as well.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:12.440
And so the open source tools
for LDAP are very nice.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.770
We've included those on Mac OS X Server.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.790
server as well.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:33.590
So, a bit repetitive, I know,
but we like to think that we've

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.820
done the hard work of setting
up the configurations for you.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.010
You don't have to edit the XML yourself.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.250
You don't have to worry about, you know,
you've got a key-value pair

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.500
in the XML that takes an
enumerated set of values.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.330
You don't need to figure
out what those are.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.280
It's not going to be
obvious what those are.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.960
Very often,
it's two or three indirections away.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.640
Where it's explained what
the enumerated values can be.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.410
We've set those up.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.600
So, for instance, you know,
pull-downs show you the

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.500
values that are possible.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.710
You won't have to worry
about mistyping something.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.570
Typing data source and putting a DETA,
you know, that will mess you up

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.070
for a day and a half.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.500
It really will.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.340
And we make it so that you don't
make those kind of mistakes

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.640
because it's provided for you.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.510
It's a whole level of things that
you don't have to worry about.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.120
And again, the logging is centralized,
so you can switch between

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.240
configurations and not worry about
where things are supposed to be going,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.360
where the information about what's
happening is supposed to be going.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.710
It's right there in the same place,
and the server admin application

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.560
can allow you to look at
the logs also remotely.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.170
So you can be on another machine
and then deploying the server

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.340
over there and looking at the
logs over there and everything.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:55.790
So it makes it quite
easy to administer these.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.970
These are the two deployment
configurations that I was talking about.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.120
And they are optimized for
performance quite a bit.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.110
Out of the box,
we were seeing performance and we

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:16.630
got multiples better by doing things,
doing some fairly non-obvious things

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.160
to make it work on the system that
we have with the JVM that we have,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.270
with the database we have.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.260
So we've done all that for you.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.500
The two deployment
configurations are standalone.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:59.600
[Transcript missing]

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.260
not so happy, but clustering is -- I'm
not sure if you can hear me.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.140
is going to talk about the
configuration of the cluster.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.720
You can try to set up the clustering
yourself with the configuration.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.520
Again,
a whole new slew of error messages to

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.780
learn and things to find that are not
optimal in the default configurations.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:29.020
There is a lot of information
about JBoss on their site.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.820
www.JBoss.org.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.500
They have a wiki.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.800
It is fairly interactive.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.770
You can get on and ask questions
or provide your documentation

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.290
of how you think it is
working and see what they say.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:43.290
All of that.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.510
But we do provide these
configurations to be working,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:55.010
to come out of the box, to launch,
to run, and to get you started.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.680
Tomcat, of course,
a server that by default is

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.580
run within the JBoss container.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.950
and plays well with the
standard Apache configuration.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.940
Basically, if you know Tomcat,
somebody's started up JBoss,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.960
you can use the Tomcat services without
worrying about what JBoss is doing.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.100
It subsumes them, wraps them up.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.860
So Tomcat is in its
own directory as well,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.390
library/tomcat.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.190
And the HTTPS services,
the connection services,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.020
are easy to set up and use.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.440
And when you start it up
in the JBoss container,

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.840
it's on a port 8080,
which is sometimes a little confusing.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:55.800
Because--next slide-- the standalone
Tomcat is on a different port.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.440
So if you want Tomcat,
but you don't want the

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.870
JBoss container running,
you can--one of the configurations of

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.560
the JBoss container is Tomcat only.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.640
So you can go into the
server admin application,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.330
select JBoss from the list, go to, say,
Tomcat only, and start.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.540
And it doesn't start JBoss,
it just starts Tomcat.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:25.400
And Tomcat will behave in the
way that it's expected to behave.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.990
So if you're doing something that
you don't want to involve the

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.850
container in your JBoss stuff,
this is there for you.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.720
So we're going to do a real quick
demo of the server admin application.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.260
OK.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:42.760
Great.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.460
So the server admin
tool is really simple.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.850
Let me just launch it really quickly.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.630
And what we did with JBoss and
Tomcat was made it a first-class

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.400
system within the server admin.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.900
And there's an application
server plug-in here.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.390
As you can see, most of your other
major services like FTP,

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.900
mail are accessible here.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.890
So we put it at the top level.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:26.500
So if you select it, as you can see,
the service isn't started.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:26.500
This first pane is just
giving you a little bit of

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:26.500
the configuration information.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:26.500
And boom, we've just started our server
without having to do much.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.360
Other things of note within our server
admin is that you can have access to

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.680
various log files and stuff like that.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.880
So this is the bootstrapping files.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:51.500
[Transcript missing]

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.320
Ray was talking about the
three configurations that we

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.800
give to you out of the box.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:01.850
There's deploy cluster,
deploy standalone, and develop.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:06.410
Primarily on a deployment platform,
you'd be interested in either

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.480
the cluster or standalone.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.860
I've also got a custom
configuration for the XPET store.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.830
So if you do create a
custom configuration,

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.450
it is accessible through the admin.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.900
It's not like hardwired to anything.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.730
So it dynamically picks that up.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:36.200
[Transcript missing]

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.360
So these other configurations
are both on 8080.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.240
So that's our quick demo,
just getting us up and running.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.960
So we have a server going.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.560
Back to slides.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.090
And just for the tech people,
try not to do that deep sigh

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.780
into the microphone again.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.660
It's been a long week, hasn't it?

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.360
You guys made it to Friday.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.450
You know,
the conference is a lot of work for us.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.580
You know,
the bad thing about the conference

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.710
is it's incredibly disruptive
on all of the processes,

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:06.690
the development work at Apple.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.660
The good thing about the conference,
though,

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.400
is it's very disruptive on processes.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.100
You know, because really, you know,
I want to say we really,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.150
really appreciate hearing from you all.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.350
And frankly,
sometimes the management needs to hear

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.900
you all and reset what they're thinking.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.300
You know, they've got their five-year
plan of the Soviet Union.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.580
They've got their five-year
plan of the Soviet Union all

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.300
mapped out in their head.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.700
You know, but the best laid plans,
you know,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.820
sometimes we need to redirect these.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:38.430
So it's been a challenging week,
but we're almost through.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.620
I appreciate you all being up here
early in the morning on Friday after

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.000
the -- I was told the attendance
might be really down because of the

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.690
alcohol consumption at the party.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.670
But that seems not to
be too much of a factor.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.380
Either that or it might make more
sense if you're a little bit hungover.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.540
You know, that's always good, too.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.550
Certainly nobody's looked at
J2EE implementations and said,

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.780
wow, what an elegant solution.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.720
It's not.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.090
But deploying in production
environments is really hard.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.230
You're looking at it and it's like, well,
see,

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:19.610
what I'm doing now is being paged at 4
in the morning every day for two weeks.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.460
Essentially, it's like chewing glass.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.120
These containers, with their management
protocols and everything,

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.490
they start to look better.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.450
We want to help you grow
your applications into

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.160
industrial environments.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:43.070
That's why we're doing all this.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:50.500
So configuring a monitor in JBoss,
as I said, it can be pretty complicated.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.170
But we try to make it as
easy as possible for you.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:48.000
[Transcript missing]

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.460
The different approaches,
we've provided the configurations

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.380
based on what you want to do.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.890
You can switch between the
different configurations and try

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.790
to get to where you're going.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.690
It doesn't destroy this configuration
to switch to it and configure,

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.320
switch back to this one and configure.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.040
You can experiment with what
you're doing and we make that easy.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:15.140
Again, the login is all centralized
and everything is easy to find.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.530
We think it works well.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.390
So JMX console is available.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.090
It's different using it.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.180
It's not very friendly.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.070
It is a web-based system.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.160
But it's all textual key value coding.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:39.480
It looks as much like
XML as any web page could,

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.900
actually.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.810
It's simply a translation of that XML.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.280
Also, of course,
when you're using the JMX console,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.780
you're changing things in memory.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.380
for the current container.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.390
And then of course if you stop
the container and restart it,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.340
it's all gone.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.900
You're off the scratch pad.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:04.300
It's for dynamic configuration
of some of the parameters.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:09.020
But it doesn't allow you
to persist those changes.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.050
Probably because of the
bullet too farther down,

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.360
which is that it's not secure.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:19.240
If you expose the JMX console,
you would have to figure out how

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.880
to make that access point secure.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.570
yourself.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.100
And there is no validation
in the JMX console.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:33.650
You know, you -- it asks you for
a data source name.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:41.400
And so instead of saying, you know,
MySQL DS, you say MySQL FUBAR.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.240
It's going to say, okay, fine.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:44.240
And then 20 minutes later,
you'll start to get some odd errors.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:50.640
So the errors do come up more than
one step after what you've done,

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.720
which always makes it harder.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.880
Because you think you've
just done something,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.000
but no,
it was actually the two or three things

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.120
ago that caused what you're seeing now,
and it's not obvious.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:06.970
So what we provide is more than just
the JSR77 dictionaries of information.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.170
We provide a level of ease
of configuration beyond that.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.830
The XML is still there, of course,
if you want to get dirty

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.160
and dive down into it.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.160
But then you're swinging without a net.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:31.670
Eventually we all do that because we like
to have -- eventually we want to have

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:36.270
that much confidence in our systems that
if the rest of the world has fallen down,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.810
we can bring things up.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.700
But it's going to take you
a little while to get there.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.690
And we're giving you a solution
that works until you get there.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.170
I think we're going to do another demo.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.200
Yes.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.230
Okay.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:31:48.500
[Transcript missing]

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:55.510
Okay, so what I'd like to do
is just manage my host,

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.950
and I'll select this button right here.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.580
I'll just give you a quick
tour of what we can do within

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.570
the JBoss management app.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:46.200
[Transcript missing]

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.850
Let me just show you how it
appears in our management app.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:57.400
So contrast this to
actually how the XML looks.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.390
And I'm going to open up
the file here really quick.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.870
So this is what it
looks like within JBoss.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.850
And you'd have to do a lot of digging
around here and hand-configuring

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:12.380
and figuring out what exactly
valid parameters are for this.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.120
And it's just kind of ugly.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.920
And there isn't a lot of
comments in here to help you

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.980
figure out exactly what this is.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:26.890
But within our management tool,
we've allowed you to -- we've exposed

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:33.160
some of the dependencies and some of
the values that are available to you.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.230
So I'm going to just show you something
like our cluster being really quick.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:58.900
[Transcript missing]

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:05.580
We've exposed a lot of the min and
max values so that you have an idea

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:10.300
of what you can configure here,
whereas defaults.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.570
We saved you more time
grepping through files.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.900
So let's go back to our top-level page.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.360
Other things that we've exposed are
creating data sources really quickly.

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:30.250
So if I want to create a data
source for a new JMS data source or

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:37.040
MySQL or a post-grade data source,
all I'd have to do is give it a name,

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:43.780
and it'll create my data source
for me with all this configuration.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.930
Other things you can do if you're
interested in JMS is we allow

00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:54.640
you to create topics or queues.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.100
So that is exposed to you and
you can save it off to a file

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.190
as you can see right here.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.190
And then, of course,
we allow you to deploy your applications

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.190
either in clustered or standard mode.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.190
So I'll just deploy our
XPET store really quickly.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.360
And there we go.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.800
So we're deployed.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.800
So let's try just accessing
it really quickly.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.800
And I think I put a link here.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.800
Oh, I'll show you one other thing.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.800
So if you just want to
check if your host is up,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.800
you can hit the 8080
port and just local host.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.190
And, okay, now I'm -- it's another way to
verify that your JBoss server

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.100
or your Tomcat server is up.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:47.640
So before I show you the Tomcat demo,
one thing you have to do is

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.140
actually populate the database.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.340
And there we go.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.970
So let me make sure
that that's populated.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:04.280
Let's hit my link here.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.320
So it's got to recompile some of
the servlets and stuff like that,

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.140
but basically,
here's your standard Java pet store demo.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:18.010
This is like validates your container,
or Sun at least uses it to validate

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:24.480
that a container is like J2EE compliant,
and it's like a good example app.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.550
So there's a working app,
and let me just show you really quickly,

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:34.460
contrasted with the JMX console.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.310
So what you're seeing here
is we're persisting our data,

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:45.370
we're configuring the XML files,
and if I stopped my server and stuff,

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:45.750
it...

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:52.540
: I think my configurations will persist,
but if we go to the JMX console, oops,

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:52.540
I hit

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:10.200
[Transcript missing]

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:35.900
Usually it allows you to add some kind
of values here and then invoke it.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:35.900
And so it's not always a pretty thing.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:35.900
You don't know what are valid values,
what aren't valid values.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:35.900
It allows you to kill your container.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:35.900
And this is only that instance
of the container and at runtime.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:35.900
If you invoke something like this,
then it will show you a

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:35.920
thread dump in particular.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.640
So we think that we've added a little
bit more value on top of the JMX console,

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.640
and like Ray said,
we validate on your values.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.640
We also are more secure because you
actually had to log in to get to

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.640
our tool versus the JMX console.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.180
hopefully that gives you
an idea of the interaction.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.550
And they are complementary.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.860
If you are just in development mode,
the JMX console is a

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.390
great way to tweak values.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.700
[Transcript missing]

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.880
We showed you one way of
deploying applications.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.780
But of course, we didn't do anything
with that application.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.140
That application was already
set up and waiting for us.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.720
Once you have it set
up and waiting for you,

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.340
you can use that interface.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.000
And it's very easy to get it deployed.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.900
But of course, before you deploy it,
you start out,

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.600
you build it for the first time,
you've got a bunch of things in

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.300
the archive for the container
that you've got to change somehow.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.880
So if you're doing it manually,
you un-jar all these things,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.160
move them around, edit the XML,
get them re-jared up in the right place.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:03.040
And it can be a bit of a mess.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.620
So, you know,
the web and EJB module descriptors

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.660
all have to be changed,
and usually, of course,

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.000
they need to be changed in
two or three different places.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.420
If you just change them in one place,
again, new kinds of error messages

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.840
until you find the next place
you were supposed to set it,

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.490
and then maybe the next place after that.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.830
So, you know,
our tool links these things together.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.710
You change it in one place,
and every place that is supposed

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.180
to have that same value,
it gets pushed to it.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.620
So, you don't have to worry about,
you know, did you type it different here?

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.180
Did you type it different there?

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.670
Did you remember to go
to this other descriptor,

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.230
this other level in the
system to set it again?

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.850
And, you know, just set the same values
over and over again.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.680
So, it makes the cycle of, you know,
the archiving, deployment, unarchiving,

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.020
it makes it very easy with our tools.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:01.350
So, you know,
our tool links these things together.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:07.460
You change them in one place, again,
new kinds of error messages

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:12.760
until you find the next place
you were supposed to set it,

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.580
and maybe the next place
that is supposed to be.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:23.490
So we think that makes a good
experience on Mac OS X Server.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:45.240
We validate the XML.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.240
You're not going to get some Jaxby
parser error or something that doesn't

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.240
-- it's not going to make much sense.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.240
The XML parsing, again,
new classes of errors.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.240
You can override the settings
in the containers and

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.150
The possible values are shown to you,
so you don't have to guess.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.350
It's very nice.

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:20.620
So what I'm going to show
off is a deployment tool.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:20.620
And so this is if you need to configure
application for your particular

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:20.620
container or you need to reconfigure
your war bundle or your bundle.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:20.620
So let me just start it really quick.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:20.620
And it will pop up in our
Safari browser in a minute.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:33.800
So I need to give the
location of my pet store here.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.880
I also have this checkbox
for validating XML files.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.590
So what that does is it also
checks for various values and

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.100
[Transcript missing]

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.500
So I think some of these things
are self-explanatory except for

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.230
the connect link right here.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.610
I'll explain that in a second.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:02.420
But what I'd like to show you is
just some of the validation features

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.780
that go on here within the tool.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.970
So say I strip this data source mapping.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.530
Let me just show you some
of the enterprise beans.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.810
So with the blue colors, this says, okay,
everything is validated

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.580
and it checks out.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.150
But if I remove, like,
some values here that are

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.680
necessary or dependent on other
-- by other beans or servlets,

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.020
they'll highlight in red and say, hey,
there's a cross-dependency here.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.880
You've just changed your global
data source and none of these

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.200
beans -- these beans depend on it.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.470
: This is an easy way of -- or
we've exposed this and made it

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.990
easy for you to tell if you've
configured your app correctly.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.140
So what I was doing here
was just editing by,

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.280
you know, if I had some specific
knowledge of my data source.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.310
But what if I didn't
know what my container,

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.100
what kind of data sources or
configurations I had available

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.700
in the specific container
I was going to deploy to?

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:11.760
We've added this connect feature where
I can connect to my actual JBoss server.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.500
And then the deployment
tool will figure out,

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.370
okay,
what settings or configurations does my

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.880
server support that I'm deploying to?

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.860
And as you notice,
those text fields went away in the same,

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.190
our global CMP settings.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:34.050
And actually,
it figured out from our server

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:39.290
that these various HSQL data
sources are available to me.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:44.700
And so we hand-hold you a little
bit so that you don't have to go and

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.120
figure out some of those settings.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.880
And that makes it pretty easy
to figure out what's going on.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.270
on.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.830
Other things of note,
here's where you check your

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.930
global settings on servlets.

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:02.660
You know, if you had various filters that
you were adding or needed to edit,

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.090
this is the place you would do it.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:10.930
And I think we only have one
servlet here for the expat store.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:16.210
And then once you're done
editing all your configuration,

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:16.210
then you can save it off somewhere.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.440
So that's kind of the quick tour.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.270
I encourage you to play
with the tool more.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.880
It really does help having
something which shows you the proper

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:33.500
JNDI names for all these resources,
you know, because you can look at the

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.190
file and you won't necessarily
be able to see immediately.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.060
It's not referenced by file.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.000
It's referenced by, you know, home,
other protocol, JNDI.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.590
And so you don't need
to worry about that.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.690
You just,
you have it tell you what's available.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.510
You know,
it can see the descriptors and it can

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:55.180
read them and understand that machine,
the XMAP.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.270
more easily than you can.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.400
So I'm realizing I'm standing
up here sounding very calm.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.740
You know,
I'm not really known around the company.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.310
You know, people have heard me talk.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.090
I'm not known for my calmness.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.130
But perhaps that's because really what
I've been talking about is deployment,

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:27.980
which we're not...

00:45:28.100 --> 00:46:27.500
[Transcript missing]

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:34.620
development on Mac OS X Server,
or actually Mac OS X, because

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.470
You can take a server system,
put the development tools on it,

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.820
get the development parts of JBoss,
or you can use the client and put the

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.280
JBoss development system on that as well.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.420
It doesn't matter.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.750
Of course,
we keep saying Mac OS X Server,

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.660
but of course,
really the difference between server

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.840
and client are some extra things,
some extra goodies.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.200
It's not a fundamentally
different operating system.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.830
We have integration with Xcode
with the developer UI to make it

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:04.440
much easier to build applications.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.810
There are other IDs as well,
and they do a lot for you as well.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.750
You can try them out,
but we think Xcode is

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.560
a very good solution.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:48:51.000
[Transcript missing]

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.370
in a web module project within two or
three minutes and just put some text

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.790
onto that page and then hit build.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.480
And about two minutes later,
you can go to your browser

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.680
and see the app running.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:10.090
You don't have to jump through a
lot of extra hoops to develop and

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:13.690
test it as you're going along.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:23.690
So if you have the server system,
you have JBoss,

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.730
you can put the development tools,
of course, on server.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.340
But that's not actually going
to get you the ability to,

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.510
for instance,
get the WebModule project and

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.680
some of these J2EE-specific tools.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.110
And obviously,
if you have a client system,

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.030
you don't have JBoss by default.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.850
So you can, again,
go to JBoss.org and try to get it.

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:44.910
But then again,
you've got your configuration problem.

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:50.260
What you can do instead, actually,
is go to this site and download.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.220
This is with an ADC membership, which is,
of course, free, as they've been saying.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.330
And you download this package.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.980
And one thing to keep in mind...

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.160
will bite you, maybe,
is that this includes JBoss.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.220
So if you've got a server system
with JBoss and you've configured

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:13.810
some things and then later on decide
you want to develop on that machine,

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.700
this bit me.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.710
So that's why I'm saying this.

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.460
It will gladly overwrite what you've got.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.480
So just pay attention to that.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.590
Because you're not only
getting the web modules,

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.560
the Xcode integration tools,
but you're also getting JBoss,

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:31.770
the same version, configured the same.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.390
as is shipping on the server.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.500
So if you've got just a client
development machine and you

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.900
don't want all those other
tools that the server provides,

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.480
you don't need to get them to do this.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.320
You just download this one package.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.160
And it is big.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:51.660
It's a big package.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:52.880
It includes JBoss.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.920
It has to be big.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.040
But it is just one package.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.470
And it's as non-intrusive as it can be.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.380
What else is there to say about this,
really?

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.290
You know, Ant is becoming the
standard for these things,

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:15.840
and we provide the Ant projects,
the projects that you create.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.540
By default, they use Ant.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.880
So, you know, it's cross-platform.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:24.250
It works with other platforms,
and people know it, so why not use it?

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:24.980
It works.

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:25.840
So we did.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.190
Not much else to say about that.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.540
Like, you know, it works,
so there's less to talk about.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.540
That's okay.

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:38.060
and xDocklet.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.060
These are the tags that we use.

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:44.060
So if you're looking at the
xDocklet implementation,

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.260
then this is what you want to look at.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.280
So if you haven't looked
at writing custom docklets,

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.780
this is going to make a
little bit more sense.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:58.460
But if you go to the Java doc
page on Sun and see some of

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.080
the really whacked out things
people have done with docklets,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:07.870
at least that will sort of point you to
the fact that this is -- Java doc has

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.180
gone way beyond what it was intended for.

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.970
But in interesting ways.

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.010
And then this is one of them.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:27.310
The develop configuration,
actually in the UI, it's a lowercase d.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:32.850
Again, we have preconfigured
this so that it works.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.050
You can run it,
hot deploy the applications,

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:39.420
check out what's going on,
get all the information.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.430
As I said before,
it's not optimized for performance,

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.660
but that's not necessary.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.410
You're changing things anyway.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.110
This isn't the stage you should
be looking at performance

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:53.700
in a J2EE application,
frankly.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.610
There's many other layers to look at it.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:03.240
And we're going to do a demo
of using Xcode for this.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.630
RAY KUDWAR: OK, thanks, Ray.

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:10.510
So after you've installed the
application server developer preview,

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.910
you'll get some templates
that will show up.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:33.300
[Transcript missing]

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.470
So what I'd just like to show you
quickly is the web module because

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:42.990
EJB modules aren't so sexy for demoing.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.600
We will call this test and
build this really quickly.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:54:01.900
[Transcript missing]

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:09.500
So some of the version information
and what are some other-- the servlet

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.500
home directories and stuff like that.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:16.250
So if you really have to remap
your jars or other resources,

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:19.020
this would be the place to do it.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:23.210
Here's our build XML,
just in case you need to

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:26.080
customize it for any reason.

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.900
And this is specifically the web
build XML for building servlets.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:34.710
Here's our source file,
and this is just like your generic

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:39.070
hello world kind of starter project.

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.870
And you can notice up here
there's a bunch of X doclet

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.870
tags that you can configure,
and these parameters are pushed

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:50.890
into your various config files.

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:57.450
One pattern I'll just configure here
really quickly is the URL pattern.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:02.930
Basically, when you contact the host,
as you'll see later, the URL,

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.460
I can remap it to different paths.

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.010
I'm just going to call this Hello WDC.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.360
And let's just do a couple
other configurations,

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:20.790
like we'll change the title.

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:30.220
is going to be posting here.

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:30.220
This is not particularly that difficult.

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:30.220
This is just a basic HTML page that
we're going to be posting here.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:36.190
Okay, so let's just build and run that.

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.910
I'm going to just double check
that my JBoss server is still up.

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.910
It should

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:56.670
Okay, so if I want to contact my host,
one other thing I should point out.

00:55:56.710 --> 00:56:01.480
In our targets directory, I think...

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.880
Okay, so this is just the build
script that is invoked.

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.980
So we've wrapped that in a target.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:24.620
Okay, so here should be the URL to my
servlet and we've gotten that.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:24.620
It's really easy to configure this.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:24.620
So, let's

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.040
Hopefully,
that's just a quick demo of what the

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:33.330
serverlet templates are about and
just how we've exposed them in Xcode.

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:40.740
So obviously, as you know,
there's a lot more.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:42.360
We're just showing you
very simple applications.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:47.410
But really, this does get you onto
the road past step zero.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.480
A lot of times,
you're coming to a completely

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.640
new technology like this,
and you try something for the first time,

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.820
and it doesn't work.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:57.200
And you have that period
of time in which you say,

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.010
am I just an idiot that I don't get this?

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.250
But actually, what we give you is that
you can very quickly deploy,

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:06.290
get this container running.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.990
You can deploy a first application,
and you can say, okay,

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:13.500
at least this ground that I'm
standing on is firm so that I can

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.660
decide to step forward whichever
direction I want to step forward.

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:23.120
Now, once you step forward, of course,
the JBoss documentation becomes

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:26.530
important if you're doing unusual things.

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:28.640
JBoss is the main site.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.640
They actually have, as I said,
they have the blogs, they have the wikis.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.810
So for instance, you could look,
there might be information, for instance,

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:35.800
specific to Mac OS X Server.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.710
On the JBoss wiki.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:44.800
And we as community members can
put our questions or answers there.

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.340
And so I hope that might be useful.

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:57.530
Of course, I'm a WebObjects engineer.

00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:59.600
WebObjects is near and dear to my heart.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.340
WebObjects is just a Java application.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:07.740
Getting it to run in
JBoss was fairly simple.

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:11.760
We just translated some of the
application configuration information

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.230
to make it look like a servlet.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.260
It's a very thin layer to wrap it.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:22.590
I'm just going to do a
quick talk about WebObjects.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.390
Of course,
you can use JBoss for many months

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:29.160
and not do WebObjects development.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:32.580
Mac OS X Server is a very good
platform for Java development,

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:36.940
traditional Java or
plain Java development,

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.120
whatever you want to call it.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:46.780
You can do all sorts of different
kinds of applications and deploy

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.110
them in a JBoss container.

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:48.110
I'm merely showing you
WebObjects because we think it's

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:49.680
Amazing.

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:50.150
Cool.

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.990
Wonderful.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.460
So, we're going to show it to you,
since we have you captive

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.260
for a few more minutes.

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:17.110
I actually thought that
this might go too quickly,

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.110
but it turns out actually that
speaking legibly has slowed me down.

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.110
So, interesting phenomenon.

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.110
I wasn't expecting that.

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.110
I think my manager probably
was expecting that,

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.110
but I was not.

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.110
So,

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:39.090
I never go in order.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:39.090
From the bottom,
JBoss has a lot of name recognition.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:39.090
Obviously, you look at the magazines.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:39.090
It's very cool in the buzzword
compliance stage of things.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:39.090
Tool development is
not the point of JBoss.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:39.090
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:42.680
We like to think that WebObjects
will let you more easily

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:46.190
build database applications.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.500
And then if you need to deploy
them in a JBoss environment,

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.390
it's trivial to do so.

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:54.440
So, you know, if you're, you know,
frankly,

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.860
WebObjects is a very cool technology,
but, you know,

00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.040
sometimes you're talking to a
somewhat hostile environment,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:04.250
you know, guys in the red ties, you know,
that don't get how cool this technology

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.670
-- cool doesn't work for them,
you know,

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:10.310
that they want to hear standards-based,
they want to hear industrial strength,

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.750
you know,
they don't want to hear elegant, frankly.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:15.820
Elegance is for after work for them.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.790
You know, it's -- you know,
they want to be able to bolt it on and

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:21.240
know it's going to stick to the floor.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.890
So, you know,
this lets you get WebObjects

01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:28.150
applications into those sort of
environments because you can say

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:31.990
I'm doing an application for you,
J2EE compliant, you know,

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:34.580
and you want me to do this EJB thing,
that's fine.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.430
We'll do it.

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:40.820
You know, and you just traipse
in the door that way.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:45.280
So it gives you sellability
into industrial data centers,

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.720
places where they might not be
showing the Apple logo prominently.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:54.250
So -- and WebObjects is a
world-class development environment.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.210
It's, you know, it predates, frankly,
all the application

01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.710
servers that are out there.

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:02.510
It's not as often acknowledged in
that role as we think it should be.

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:06.200
But, you know, we were doing this stuff
quite a bit before,

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.420
and Sun got started on some of it.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:12.840
And some of the industry leaders
were working on EOF and before

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.500
that DBKit and WebObjects.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.060
And, you know,
we've been doing model view

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:21.570
controller pattern use,
you know, since before any of this

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:23.450
was ever talked about.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.110
I'll stop now.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:26.840
This is my baby.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.220
I have to, you know, I can't help it.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:32.210
So if you're not
familiar with WebObjects,

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.420
you didn't go to the sessions,
that's okay.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:35.390
We forgive you.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.120
I forgive you.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.980
For now.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.780
WebObjects turns databases
into object graphs.

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:46.160
And as I explained to you,
when you're talking to

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:48.760
your parents or something,
you have to explain it.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.480
It takes databases and turns
it into some cool stuff.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.860
And then WebObjects also will
take that kind of cool data

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.900
stuff and put it out to the web.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:03.110
And so then R tool allows you to write
cooler stuff in the middle which can

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:08.490
be very thin or you can have a huge
thick wedge of coolness stuck there in

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:11.590
the middle in between those two layers.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.200
You don't have to handle
the web HTTP request,

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.780
you don't have to
handle the SQL yourself.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:21.490
So that's my, you know,
trying to explain to my mother what I do.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:26.980
So of course, it has visual tools
for the web interface,

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:28.800
dynamic prototype, yada, yada, yada.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.240
There we go.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.410
just cool, right?

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:38.140
So with a -- when you take
a WebObjects application,

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:41.190
if you build WebObjects,
normally you end up getting

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.980
a WOA with a jar inside,
with resources inside.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.830
It doesn't look J2E-ish yet.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:52.750
But if you tell it to include
the J2E functionality,

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.380
then when you build it,
it will automatically generate a war.

01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:00.060
It will automatically
put it in JBoss for you.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.440
So it will automatically deploy it.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.730
Just by building it.

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:08.420
Frameworks you use in WebObjects
projects get bundled up as archives

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:12.490
inside the application and made
available to the application.

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:17.370
And you can choose whether to put
the resources into whichever form,

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.680
wars, jars or ear files.

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:25.160
And your WebObjects application
can use the JNDI protocol to look

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.400
around itself at the container,
figure out what's going on,

01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:31.700
some something in the outside.

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:36.740
With a regular WebObjects application,
you have environment variables.

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:41.380
The J2EE version of that is
probably JNDI properties.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:45.290
Quite a bit less obvious how to use them,
but they are there.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:51.120
So the serverlet features are available.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.220
You can do all these things
within WebObjects applications,

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.880
with WebObjects applications.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.630
Integrated in J2EE,
I don't need to say this again.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.550
This is the benefits of J2EE.

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:05.260
Less pain being the main benefit.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.200
Less deployment hassles.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.450
Hopefully less being paged in the
middle of the night kind of behavior

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:15.150
because you've given it to a deployer,
somebody who knows deployments,

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.060
somebody who's got a
bunch of racks of metal.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:21.340
Let them worry about it
because we're developers.

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.870
We want to do our job,
send it off and go hit

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:25.600
the beach or whatever.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.810
So this allows you to do that.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:38.100
[Transcript missing]

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.700
And we're going to do a quick demo of
deploying the WebObjects application.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:49.700
Okay, so hopefully -- yeah, okay.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.280
So what I'd like to show you -- I mean,
I might lose some of the audience if

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:56.630
you guys are just J2EE developers,
but if you aren't -- and if you're

01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.570
not familiar with WebObjects,
we might go a little too quickly.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:05.260
But what I'd like to do is create
a quick direct web application

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.640
and then deploy it to JBoss.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:14.960
And so let me start by
creating our application,

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.790
just calling it Test App.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.100
What we want to do is create
a standalone WAR bundle,

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.520
and that's important,
so that it encloses all of

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.100
our WebObjects frameworks and
resources within the WAR bundle.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.570
There are other options that you can
explore that some of you have used.

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.810
That last pane was actually the
only thing that you have to do

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.020
that's J2EE-ish to use WebObjects.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:41.870
So it's nice.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.260
Everything after this is WebObjects.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.770
Next thing you have to do is embed
a deployment license in there.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.750
So you'll need that.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.880
We'll just take the defaults.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.520
These are just web server support,
adapter support.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.200
Take the standard frameworks.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.600
And what I'll do is I'll just
work with the real estate model.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.800
That's part of our example databases,
or one of our example database sets.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.300
We'll just do a neutral look.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:13.920
And let's just finish
this really quickly.

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:22.400
So a couple things I'll
just point out within Xcode.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:27.560
And I think a lot of people have been
interested in finding out exactly

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:29.900
where you have to tweak or what

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:36.730
So, I think one of the parameters
you have to tweak to actually,

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:36.730
if you have a legacy
project to create a new one,

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:36.730
is to have a

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:46.170
Hi, everyone.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:46.170
I'm Ray Kiddy.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:46.170
I'm the founder of JBoss.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:07:06.400
[Transcript missing]

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.940
So as you can see,
I just have a full-featured

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.530
direct web app.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.900
This is not running in JBoss just yet.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.820
I'll just show you that
it's fully functional,

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.900
and we can search on some
of the parameters here.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.460
Okay,
so what it also did when I built that

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:29.830
app is it deployed into JBoss the
slash library 3.2 deploy directory.

01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:32.590
Let me make sure,
let me get JBoss running.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.970
So I'm on a client system
currently right here.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.700
So if you install the application
server developer preview,

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:43.900
you'll find it here in library JBoss 3.2.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.220
And, oops, dang.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:51.770
Can't type.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:03.100
So you'd invoke the
run.sh script to start it.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.480
And this is on the client system, not--

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.560
All right, so I think we're up right now.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.640
And so let's just try
connecting to our application.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.660
Actually, I wanted to point out,
he didn't start it with a configuration.

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:21.420
And what it does in that case is it uses,
if you looked in the list really closely,

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:26.300
when we said, here's the three,
there was also a fourth and a fifth.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.260
The fifth was the example,
but the fourth was default.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.010
So by default,
you've decided on this machine to

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.330
point to one of those configurations.

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:36.900
And when you just invoke run.sh,
it uses the default.

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:45.450
So as you can see,
I just deployed-- the URL has

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:49.000
the 8080 port on there,
so you know that you're in JBoss.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.050
And here's my same
direct web application.

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:56.660
And we built this within minutes,
and it's all fully functional.

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.140
I just searched on these addresses.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.240
We can go over and take
a look at something else

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.100
like a rating or something,
or users.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.500
And it's fully functional.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.090
So JBoss deployment with
WebObjects is very simple.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:11.900
It's pretty easy.

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:16.300
And as you can see, out of the box,
it can get up and running in two minutes.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:21.000
One nice thing about this is--
Darrell's used to me interrupting him,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:21.900
so I'm going to go ahead.

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:27.500
One nice thing about this is
that when you deploy this,

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.900
of course, you put in the WebObjects
license information.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:35.060
So you can deploy this on a machine that
has JBoss and does not have WebObjects.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.200
You know, it doesn't-- it doesn't matter.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.260
I mean, if the machine does
have WebObjects on it,

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.600
if you know the deployment
machine is going to have both

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.700
JBoss and WebObjects installed,
then you can pick-- one of

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.440
those options is the legacy war,
which just includes the

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.600
application-specific stuff.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:55.200
But if you do the standalone,
the standalone, it stands alone.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.490
It sort of includes all of
the WebObjects-ish stuff it

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.080
needs inside of itself to run,
so that you can give it to somebody

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:06.290
who's running a J2EE shop and say,
run this thing.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:06.800
It's in it.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.700
And you say, good things.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.300
Run it.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.190
Go ahead.

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:14.280
You know,
you don't need to go into details,

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:15.600
because they're the deployer.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.800
You know, they really-- they don't
have a right to ask.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.570
You've made a working program.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.650
They need to deploy it.

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.100
And that should be the end of it, right?

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.100
So yeah.

01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:32.980
See, enterprise people aren't boring.

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.830
This is good.

01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:35.960
This is good.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.010
I think we need our screens back.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Okay, there we go.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.040
I confused the tech people
by talking in the demo.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.040
They didn't know.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Give me a stage.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.040
What am I going to do?

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.040
I'm going to talk.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.520
Summary.

01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:03.790
So summarizing.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.690
We've made it so that configuration,
you can configure JBoss easily.

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:12.130
We've made the tools so that you
don't have to edit the XML yourself.

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:17.890
I keep saying that,
but it is amazingly painful

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:19.960
to do if you haven't done it.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.150
If you've done it,
you're not minding that I'm

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.910
repeating myself because you know.

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:47.980
We provide the development
environment X-Cool,

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:47.980
X-Code is a very nice IDE.

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:47.980
Yeah, X-Cool, that's the new name, sure.

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:47.980
Yeah, yeah,
you build and then . You do boom,

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:47.980
I noticed, but I think that Steve Jobs,
we saw the keynote, right?

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:47.980
I think the official sound is now .

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:56.080
I haven't heard that in an app yet,
but it's coming, I'm sure.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.280
We have to watch our leader.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.810
We have to follow our leader.

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.820
It makes it very easy.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.040
Build an application.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:04.750
It's gone.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.570
It's done.

01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:08.960
Xcode templates for just
regular Java development.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:15.800
Java, Xcode, we've heard the complaints
about Java with Xcode.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.000
And they've done the
code completion things.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.280
That's working.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.310
The indexing,
finally it's out of the way.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.170
It doesn't get in your
face as it used to.

01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:31.340
And when you need to -- some of the
method names in J2EE or in WebObjects

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.880
is -- they get a little long,
and you don't need to type them all.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.900
Add relationship to both sides.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:40.280
You don't have to -- you
have code completion now,

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.120
so it's nice.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.870
And, of course, as we said,
WebObjects is just amazing.

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:47.890
So you can deploy -- build and
deploy a web build and deploy a

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.800
WebObjects application in JVOS.

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:55.560
We're running over.

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:56.600
We're running over?

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.500
Oh, no.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.810
OK.

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:05.670
So for more information-- actually,
the second to last is my favorite URL,

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:06.750
because--

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.440
That's one point of
information about JBoss.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.160
If you go to Apple and
search for JBoss information,

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.360
it can be a bit scattered.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.450
But I've put a very small
amount of content in this place,

01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:21.480
but this place will be there in future.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.240
So hopefully as a pointer to the
other places to find information.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.580
It can be hard to find whether it's the
download for the development tools or

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:34.300
whether it's the server documentation or
is it the JBoss version of the document.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.600
It can be hard to find.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.740
So we've centralized it there.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.220
And of course,
the server documentation is there.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.390
All these locations are there.
