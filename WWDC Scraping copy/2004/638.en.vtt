00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.050
Please welcome our first
presenter of the morning,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.880
Director Hardware Storage, Alex Grossman.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.640
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.510
Thank you very much for getting
up early on a Friday morning after

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.680
a really great night last night.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.790
I appreciate everybody
being able to do that.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.400
We're going to start this morning.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.630
We've got a lot to cover,
and hopefully it's going to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.040
be very useful to everyone.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.170
I've got a pretty full agenda,
and I've got some great guest speakers

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.190
to talk to us about some real-world
stuff that we're going to talk about.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.780
But before we do that,
I want to go through some

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.000
calisthenics in the morning.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.150
So we're going to use our right
hand and our left hand a little bit.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.320
So to get an idea, just to help us,
give me an idea of how many people

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.480
are familiar with the terms that
I'm just going to relate here.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.720
First one is DAS,
direct attached storage.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.560
How many people are deploying
direct attached storage today?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.460
Okay, not that many.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.360
How many people are
familiar with the term NAS,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.710
or network attached storage?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.360
And how many people are deploying
network attached storage?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.580
Oh, a lot of people.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.900
And how about the last one is SAN,
storage area networks?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.940
And how many people are deploying those?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.160
Okay.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.910
Okay, that's great.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.100
So for the other hand,
we've got to use the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.550
other hand for this one.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.040
How many people are familiar
with fiber channel networking?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.820
Okay, great.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.880
And how about iSCSI?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.560
Not too many?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.300
OK, great.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.030
Fantastic.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120
So let's get started.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.800
Let's talk a little bit about the
agenda and what we're going to cover.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.400
First thing I want to do is-- oh,
last question is,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.550
how many people today have Xserve RAIDs?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.200
Cool.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.380
Okay.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.450
So first thing I'm going to
do is give you a little quick

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.820
refresher on the Xserve RAID,
talk about what's unique about it.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.030
And, you know,
we're seeing a year or so ago, you know,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.880
Apple was probably the only one out
there in a Tier 1 storage vendor

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.040
with an ATA-based RAID system.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.240
We're seeing a lot more ATA out there,
but not all of them are created equal,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.770
and we think we have something
unique in the Xserve RAID.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.440
Then we're going to talk just a
little bit about RAID basics and

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.300
where we see that whole market
going and what's going on there,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.710
and then a lot about storage
planning and what it's really like

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.760
to plan a deployment in storage.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.170
And then we have one of the biggest
areas that we get questions in,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.690
and this is constant from people,
is they really don't understand,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.360
what do I do in fiber
channel infrastructure?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400
What does it really look like?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.490
What should it look like?

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.710
What's the future look like?

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.700
You know,
the costs have been really high,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.620
and we want to take a stab at what
it's really going to look like.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.300
So we're really happy to have...
Qlogic's SAN architect with us,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.160
Ryan Klein, so we're going to have him
come up and talk about that.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.320
And then we have a customer deployment,
a real life example of where

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.970
we actually had Apple and some
partners get together and do a great

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.990
deployment for one of our customers.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.100
Then we're going to wrap it up a
little bit and talk a little bit

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.890
about best practices and some Q&A.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.930
Sound like fun?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.820
Good, so let's get started.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.520
First thing is let's talk about
Xserve RAID and what it really is.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.540
So Xserve RAID is really a storage base.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.530
It's a storage building block.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.450
So it's a high
availability design system.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.540
It's a 3U enclosure, basically.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.040
It can scale up to 3.5 terabytes,
and it can scale up to

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.530
nearly 400 megabytes per
second sustained throughput.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.540
So that is really in read and
write performance very high

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.540
and very competitive with
systems that cost a lot more.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.490
The other thing about Xserve RAID is
that it's extremely versatile.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.780
So it can be used in a DAS deployment,
and we'll call that our

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.540
SCSI replacement strategy.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.540
It can be used with combining it
with an Xserve G5 or an Xserve

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.540
or even a Power Mac and use it
in a NAS type of configuration.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.540
And it has capabilities in it that
allow it to be used as standalone

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.460
or combined with other systems to
build great SAN infrastructure.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.590
Probably the most important
thing about Xserve RAID is

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.300
the high availability design.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.540
And what I mean by that is that
everything in the box is swappable.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.540
So the design really lends
itself from systems that have

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.540
cost a lot more money to run.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.540
So it's a very versatile system.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.890
It's a system that costs a lot
more money traditionally where the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.540
components are either completely
redundant or they're swappable easily.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.540
And so the downtime,
usually there's none,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.500
but if there's ever downtime,
it's usually extremely minimal.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.810
And that comes from just looking
at the front of the system where

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.540
you see 14 hard drives that can
easily be unplugged from the system.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.720
And in the back of the system,
what you see is you see a clean design,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.530
an Apple design from the ground up.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.540
We didn't start with existing designs or
use pieces or parts that were out there.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.620
We actually started clean
to design a system that had

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.480
high availability built in.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.540
And we have redundant power,
redundant cooling.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.390
We have hot swappable
components throughout,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.410
warm swappable RAID controllers.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.540
We have a passive midplane for the data.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.710
And so what you end up with if
you pull all the components out is

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.860
you end up with a metal box with a
midplane or a board in the middle that

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.540
does passive signaling through it.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.540
So very easy to change and
update the system as you need to.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.620
So this is one of the great
points of the XSERV RAID.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.900
Now, beyond the high availability design,
one of the things that really sets

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.420
Xserve RAID apart from a lot of the other
systems out there is the management.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.110
We chose to go with a Java-based
management tool for Xserve RAID,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.910
and it's something that we've
updated constantly since we

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.520
introduced the Xserve RAID.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.450
In fact, what you're going to see,
and one of the things

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.790
I can tell you about now,
is you're going to see an update

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.220
to the RAID admin utility that's
actually happening next week.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.340
And I was very fortunate last year to be
able to show you a significant update.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.860
This one's a little smaller,
but it's a performance update.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.300
So we're constantly
updating the performance and

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.060
scalability of the Xserve RAID.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.160
The beauty of the RAID admin
utility is it allows you to do

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.040
monitoring of one or even hundreds
of systems from a single screen.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.790
And it also allows you to manage
these systems very easily and do

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.040
all the management tasks remotely.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.890
And that was mainly driven by people
like me who just are lazy and,

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.900
you know, don't want to get up
early in the morning.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.460
They find out what's
going on in your system.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.650
They just want to do it from home.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.720
And the other thing is we've added
more and more SAN capabilities and high

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.040
availability features like LUN masking
and mapping to the system and things like

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.080
being able to rebuild parity on the fly.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.720
And we're doing a lot more of that.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.370
And when the new release comes out,
you're going to see a lot more of

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.990
those capabilities just built in.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.060
So this is really a tool that
is built for every platform,

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.260
yet it looks stunning
on the Mac platform.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.700
It's really a phenomenal tool.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.720
The other thing about Xserve RAID,
and this was a request that we

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.040
had here last year from just
about everybody who attended,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.530
was that we had people deploying
Xserve RAID on a number of

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.110
platforms beyond the Mac,
but we hadn't gone through the actual

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.980
certification and compatibility.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.660
Yet it was kind of funny that our
customers really drove us there.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.720
In fact, there was a website
that went up last year,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.220
and it's still extremely active.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.660
It's called alienraid.org,
and it's really exciting.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.360
And alienraid.org,
they were really the first people,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.070
it was a group of people
who actually said,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.320
did you know that the Xserve
RAID works on Windows,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.910
and that it works on Solaris,
and it works on AIX?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.100
And they really went through the
step-by-step features of actually

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.760
showing you how you would install it.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.400
And most of those were,
plug the cables in, turn it on.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.540
So it was really pretty simple overall.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.880
But what we did over the last
year is we asked our customers,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.990
who were the infrastructure partners
that they really wanted on Xserve RAID?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.830
And we're open.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.600
If you have suggestions as to
who else you'd like to see,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.910
we're very open to do that.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.050
And we chose what we felt
were the best of the best.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.570
And those are people like
Qlogic and Veritas and Emulex

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.590
and Brocade and Candera,
and people that you really,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.610
really care about.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.710
And then also the
traditional Apple vendors,

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.700
like Addo Technology,
where we really felt they would

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.980
add a lot to the platform.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.510
But of course, we had to look at popular
operating systems as well.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.360
Now, I think everybody in here realizes
that we work very well on Mac OS X,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.950
but we're also certified on Red Hat.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.910
And that's their advanced 2.1 and 3,
also on Yellow Dog Linux,

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.200
which actually runs on our platforms,
and Novell, and Novell 5, Novell 6,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.920
Novell 6.5, Windows 2000, surprisingly,
Windows 2003,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.490
and Windows XP Professional.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.560
So all those certifications
have been done,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.900
and we're continuing to
certify Xserve RAID on more.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.600
So this way you have guaranteed
compatibility for the system,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.140
and not only in Mac and
all Mac installations,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.880
but also in heterogeneous
installations where it's simple.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.530
And I'd just like to get a show.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.580
How many people have a heterogeneous
installation of the Xserve RAID?

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.980
Wow, that's a lot more than
I've seen in a long time,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.820
so that's great.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.660
So let's just go over
a quick RAID basics.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.950
So everybody in here should be
familiar with multiple levels of RAID.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.200
And I'll tell you,
these were the levels that

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.120
were initially defined by
Randy Katz at Berkeley in 1987,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.120
and these are still what
I call the pure RAID levels.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.380
These can be combined with
other RAID levels in here,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.380
and there are some fancy RAID levels
that people are looking at today.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.060
But for the most part,
these are the RAID levels

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.790
that everybody does.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.860
And what is a RAID level?

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.920
Well, obviously when you start
lowest to highest in number,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.240
you actually increase in redundancy
or availability and performance.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.300
If you start with RAID 0, it's striping.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.200
Not really a true RAID level,
but a lot of people have,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.740
or still are deploying
striping today for speed,

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.020
because it's one of the
easiest ways to take a number,

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.520
a number of disks, combine them together,
and get performance out of them.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.520
And then probably the most
popular RAID level that's

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.760
used out there is mirroring.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.800
This is basically just taking
either one hard drive or a group

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.530
of hard drives and mirroring them,
keeping the same data set between them.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.100
So if one were to fail,
you'd have another copy of the data.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.690
This is the photocopy
way of doing things.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.870
It's not very efficient.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.270
It's kind of wasteful, right?

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.620
If I have a copy of something,
I make a photocopy,

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.180
I wasted two pieces of paper.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.870
It's the same with mirroring.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.500
If I have one hard drive, I mirror it,
I used 100% of the second hard

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.430
drive's space for mirroring.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.300
And then as you move up,
really you get to what I would

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.100
consider more efficient RAID levels.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.240
And the one that we focus on a lot,
and the one we've optimized for,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.630
is RAID level five.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.280
And the beauty of RAID level five is
that it's a distributed parity scheme.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.780
And what we mean by that is we
actually create an algorithm or a

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.320
piece of data on every one of the
hard drives that is a part of the data

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.520
that's on the rest of the hard drives.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.050
And essentially what that means is
that if you have a hard drive fail,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.250
we can instantly, virtually on the fly,
recreate that data from

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.800
the remaining hard drives.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.750
So you'd have to lose a large
number of hard drives before you'd

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.410
actually have a failure or lose data.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.450
And the problem with RAID five
in the past has been that the

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.110
performance has not been consistent.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.900
So the read performance is very
similar to that of RAID zero.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.520
It's like striping a bunch of drives.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.700
The performance is better
than a single hard drive.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.660
But the write performance,
especially in random writes,

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.840
has been similar.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.640
It's slower.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.740
So people who are doing
things like database or

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.590
online transaction processing,
anybody do that type of

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.720
work on their systems?

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.250
So if you're doing that,
you knew that RAID five was

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.950
a bad way to go in the past.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.580
And also,
if you're doing things like video,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.760
anybody doing video here,
streaming video?

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.070
If you were streaming video,
RAID five was also terrible.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.060
People went to things like RAID three.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.560
Or in most cases,
they were just doing RAID zero striping.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.900
And with XServe RAID,
we really looked at that.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.300
And we put our team together and built
some really sophisticated algorithms

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.150
and some cache and caching schemes that
really make RAID five faster in most

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.250
cases than any of the other RAID levels,
including RAID zero.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.460
So our performance is really
quite good in RAID five.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.970
And the protection is really good.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.970
So let's talk about storage
planning a little bit.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.400
This is really the most important
part of deployment and really talking

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.340
about a best practices strategy.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.760
And it's really all common sense,
but it's things that we don't

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.130
think about on a daily basis.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.650
When we start there,
we have to talk about the three

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.590
different approaches to storage.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.930
And some of you may not realize
you're actually deploying a number

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.020
of these within your organization.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.150
The first one is direct attach.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.050
So when we talk about
direct attach storage,

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.120
what is that?

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.930
And there's a lot of different
ways that we look at this.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.800
The first way to look at it is,
a great example is the Xserve G5.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.020
It's locally attached hard drives.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.740
It's the hard drives that are in the
Xserve G5 that become direct attached.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.980
And for the most part,
this is the way traditional

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.370
storage was done.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.860
You bought a server,
you put hard drives in the server,

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.440
and it was a done deal.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.420
And when you needed more performance,
the servers didn't have

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.460
a lot of performance,
you added servers,

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.290
and therefore you added storage.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.860
And that's the way things scaled.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.010
And it kind of looked like this.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.590
You had a network down at the bottom,
all your clients, and obviously I could

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.670
draw hundreds of clients,
but I'm not that good with drawing.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.380
And you have Ethernet switches,
those are the gray lines,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.260
and then you have the two Xserve G5s.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.660
And in this case,
you could have a terabyte

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.020
and a half of storage online,
assuming you left it all in either JBOD,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.920
just a bunch of disks,
or a RAID 0 stripe.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.460
So it's quite a bit of storage.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.610
But the problem is
that it's never enough.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.210
And so you might take
one of your servers,

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.080
which is a,
let's call it a high-use server.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.830
This could be your email server,
for instance.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.040
And this could be an Xserve G5,
a Mac OS 10-based server.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.540
This could be a Windows server
or a Linux server.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.440
And you're going to add
some external storage.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.970
Well, that works.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.290
And you might even find
that with the Xserver RAID,

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.650
because it's a dual ported,
dual controller design,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.240
that you want to share half of
the storage on one of the boxes

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.000
and half the storage on the other.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.040
A little more efficient.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.810
You get the ability to centralize your
storage so that you take advantage of

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.980
the high availability of Xserver RAID.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.990
Yet you get to share it over two servers.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.660
Or you might find that that's not
enough and you just want to attach more

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.000
storage to your individual servers.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.980
And this is still direct attach.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And this is the way
things have been done.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
It's truly a traditional approach.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.810
And it works really easily because
today most people have LAN-based backup.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.950
So you're backing up across the LAN.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.880
Now this was a really good idea
when the data sets were small.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.900
How many people can remember a couple
years ago when your entire organization

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:08.900
ran on a couple hundred servers?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.890
100 gigabytes, right?

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:16.900
I had an experience a few months
ago when GarageBand first came out.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.900
And I was actually on a plane and I went
to install GarageBand on my notebook.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.900
And I put the CD in and
I went to install it.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.900
Actually the DVD.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.900
And it said that I didn't
have enough room.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.900
And this is my notebook.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.900
And I thought, don't I have an 80 gig
hard drive in here?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.890
Well, I had a few keynote presentations
so it was a little hard to do.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.300
But for the most part,
backing this amount of

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:38.800
storage is really easy.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.790
It's a lot of data.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.760
In this case, we would have almost seven
terabytes of data here.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.770
Imagine backing that up across LAN.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.790
Anybody go to the backup
session earlier this week?

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800
So you get an idea.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.800
For those of you who didn't go and
those of you who backup terabytes,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.750
it can really take about,
in an uncompressed environment,

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.800
over 24 hours to backup
a terabyte of storage.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.800
So, you know,
the backup windows are shrinking.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.330
So this LAN-based backup doesn't seem
to work very well in this occasion

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.700
where you have a lot of storage.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.250
So when you start looking at this,
you go, well, one of the problems is

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.690
I need to share the storage,
but I have something like this

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.690
where I'm pretty dedicated.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.880
That one XSERV RAID,
let's call it 3.5 terabytes,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.540
is dedicated to that server.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.680
And the other XSERV RAID is
dedicated to the other server.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.430
So my resource sharing is limited.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.680
So I better guess right as to how much
storage I really need on each server.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.140
Let's say one of those servers
needed 6 terabytes and the

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.670
other one needed 1 terabyte.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.600
In the direct-attached world,
it's really hard to do, right?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.570
You just can't,
what we'll call provisioning that

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.380
storage over between the two systems.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.330
So when you look at this and you
look at that traditional approach,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.390
is it still viable in today's world?

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.390
And a lot of people
look at it and they say,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.460
sure, it's viable because it's a
lower initial investment.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.500
I don't have to do much planning.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.500
I know that I can just
buy one and attach it.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.500
But there are problems with scalability
and there's problems with longevity.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.560
Because a lot of times that storage
is internal to your servers and when

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.400
it's time to replace the server,
when the call kicks in,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.280
it's time to replace that server,
you end up not having

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.400
storage that's compatible.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.820
And that's the beauty of an SSRV RAID if
you deploy it because it's external,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.380
it's fiber channel,
it's just going to plug in.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.750
But you also find out that
you're pretty limited on that

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.400
backup and that restoration.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.400
So it's not really the ideal approach.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400
So what else do you do?

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.400
Well, this is what most people do.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.380
Most people have moved to a
network-attached storage model.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.210
They start out with some type of
direct-attach and usually it's many more

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.400
than two servers that are out there.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.340
And they take some
type of direct-attached

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.280
NAS right onto the network.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.300
So it's attaching to that gray wire
that's there indicating our network.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.090
And in my case,
I chose to take an XSRV G5

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.300
and an XSRV RAID and use
that as a NAS replacement.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.160
And that works.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.970
It works and it gives you the
ability to share that storage

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.300
across the network to both servers.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.300
So you get some provisioning because
what you can do is you can dedicate,

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.280
you don't have to
dedicate those resources,

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.300
you can leave them open.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.200
And it has expandability.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.810
But the expandability becomes
limited because what happens

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.200
at this point is now the wire
that's coming out of the XSRV G5,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.200
that single Ethernet
becomes the bottleneck.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.330
And because your backbone,
unless you're building a 10

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.200
gigabit fiber backbone or just
10 gigabit Ethernet backbone,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.090
you're really pretty limited in the
overall performance it's going to do.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.010
How many people have a 4 gigabit
Ethernet backbone out there?

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.200
How about a 10?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.200
So I saw one hand.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.100
How many, you're pretty much limited.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.100
How many people have gigabit backbone?

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.930
That's just about everybody out here.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.220
So imagine that if each XSRV G5
can saturate that gigabit backbone,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.070
how is your storage being
attached going to do that?

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.100
And this is really what most people do.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.100
Most people have deployed a network
attached specialty appliance.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.090
And they're just an embedded NAS.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.100
So this is a very lightweight NAS server.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.090
And the reason they've done this is
there's no client access licenses,

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.100
just like an XSRV G5.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.100
But they're usually inexpensive.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.000
And usually what happens
is you end up with this.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.000
And you end up with a lot of
different little appliances out there.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And the problem with that is that while
it gives you a heterogeneous approach,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.880
and while it has a lower investment,
it is a management nightmare.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And it's very difficult to manage that.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.840
And it's very difficult
to know what's failed.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.000
And you find that you start
plugging them in all over.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And when you have an Ethernet problem,
it's really a problem.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.880
It is a big problem because you
lose accessibility to the storage.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.000
And whether we like it or not,
anybody here ever crimp

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.000
an Ethernet cable?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.880
Okay,
if you've crimped an Ethernet cable,

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.900
you know that usually one out of
three you're going to screw up.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.900
And usually it fails like six months
later when it's hanging there.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.900
And this is part of the problem with
hanging everything on the network.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.900
That network was made to
deliver small packets.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.890
And it wasn't really made to deliver
the performance and the reliability

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.900
to a lot of different servers.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.900
It is truly a collision-based network.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.900
But for most people, that works.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.890
And in fact, most people who start
there tend to move to this,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.900
the NAS appliances.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.900
And we know who they are.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.880
They're generally extremely
expensive in a per-gigabyte cost.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.900
But they have a lot of features.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.650
They do things like snapshotting,
which means that you can

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:19.820
replicate the data really quickly.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.860
And they're appliance-like.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.900
They're generally easy deployment.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.840
They have a built-in file system.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.040
And for the most part,
these very high-end appliances have

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.900
an operating system and a file system.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:37.790
And they also have the downside
of being a single-vendor lock-in.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.730
You're, for the most part,
using their management tools

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.800
and you're having to buy them
again and again and again.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.750
And it gets pretty expensive.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.800
And we all know those people.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.800
And they're good things.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.800
They're companies like
Network Appliance and EMC.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.800
They build really nice products.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.080
And they still have the issue
of having that single point

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.640
of connectivity to Ethernet.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.920
Now,
they may have multiple Ethernet ports,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.780
but generally, you're not going to have
hundreds of Ethernet switches.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.720
You're going to have one or
two very high-end switches.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.700
And what if you don't have a hundred?

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.600
You're going to have a
high-end infrastructure.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.600
You're really funneling
everything through Gigabit.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.590
Has anybody here ever seen Gigabit
Ethernet perform at Gigabit?

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.600
So, that's one of the other issues
that we run into all the time.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.570
So, what is the choice?

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.590
The choice is to build a SAN.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.090
And it sounds like a lot of people
out here have already taken that step,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.480
at least.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.570
So, what does a basic SAN look
like and where do they scale?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.550
Well,
most people who build a SAN start out

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.550
again with that direct-attached model.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.600
They start out there
and they add storage.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.980
And I'm going to go in a fiber
channel switch in here because

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.500
I knew I was building a SAN.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.500
So, from a best practices standpoint,
I want to start out with expandability

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.500
and scalability already in there.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.500
And you can take an XSERV RAID today and
you can use a tool called LUN masking.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.500
And you can map each address,
almost like a MAC address,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.490
but we call it a fiber
channel worldwide port name.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.150
And we would map those worldwide
port names very easily in the

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.500
RAID admin utility to each server.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.390
So, we can have a provisioned
storage to each server.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.200
So, the servers can't see
each other's storage,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.400
but they see the storage they have.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.400
Really simple implementation.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.400
And I can add more.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.410
And as I add more,
I don't degrade my performance

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.040
because my back channel network
is a specialized network called

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.390
fiber channel in this case.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.110
And fiber channel is a non-blocking
network infrastructure and my

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.400
performance scales as my capacity scales.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.320
And we call that a SAN island.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.250
And then people will scale it out.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.370
So, as you scale it out,
the server becomes more heterogeneous.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.400
The servers become MACs, PCs, Linux.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.400
Hopefully they're all MACs.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.400
But as you scale it out,
now you can start to deploy more storage

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.400
on more servers and you're not limited.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.400
And you can reprovision
that storage as you need to.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.400
And in some cases, the manual process.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.380
In other cases,
there are partners that can help us

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.490
provision that storage instantaneously
and without any interruption of service.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:28:03.800
[Transcript missing]

00:28:03.900 --> 00:30:27.800
[Transcript missing]

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.000
If we look at that mission-critical
storage environment,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.060
I picked one, an interesting one here,
because I said I'm not

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.120
going to pick one on Macs.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.080
I'm going to pick one on Windows.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.810
So this is a Windows 2003 advanced server
with Microsoft clustering environment.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.870
In this case,
it cost about $6 a gigabyte to deliver

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.920
fully redundant mission-critical storage.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.700
And this is something that today you'd
have to spend an incredible amount of

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.950
money to deliver this with other systems.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.670
And this is really made
possible by Xserve RAID.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.380
So in this case, you've got a lot of
storage to two servers,

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.740
and it's really simple
and easy to deploy.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.190
Now here's your typical three-tier
storage infrastructure the

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.900
way it usually really looks.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.600
It's more than one storage device,
it's more than one server,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.900
and it's heterogeneous.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:16.200
And so you do have a storage
pool that's mission critical,

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.660
a business critical pool,
and a near-line pool.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.820
That's really the way it looks.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:24.540
And today, with XSAN, you can build this.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.230
Or at least when XSAN is released,
I should say.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.180
So it all comes down to which
storage approach is best,

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.490
and it really depends.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.890
And what it depends on

00:31:36.140 --> 00:32:03.000
The other thing that's interesting
is that 50% of the managers

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.890
consider heterogeneous storage
to be a strategic goal for them.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.060
So when we talk about interoperability,
this is important.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.820
So if you don't have an
all Apple infrastructure,

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.630
you don't have an all Windows or an all
Linux or an all Solaris infrastructure,

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.170
you really need to be heterogeneous.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:22.670
And I think the most important thing
is that 52% of the people surveyed,

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:26.110
and I think they surveyed
about 1,000 IT managers,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.140
they view the reduced maintenance costs
as proof of a return on investment.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.160
So when you look at
deploying tiered storage,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.620
probably in that high tier of
storage that's 40 to $100 a gigabyte,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.890
you pay that same amount
in maintenance every year.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.480
And that's really where the cost is.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.220
So when you look at, well,
I can tier this,

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.240
and I can reduce my cost both in
the initial cost of the system

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.190
and in the maintenance cost,
that's really what it's all about.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.900
And can I deliver those same services?

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.230
We think so.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.910
So if you're doing storage planning,
there's a few things to look at.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.510
It's really, well,
what do I already have?

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.850
What do I really need?

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.620
How much is it going to cost?

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.140
And so let's take a
look at some of those.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.350
The first one is existing infrastructure.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.920
There's two things that
people don't look at here.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:12.060
The first one is,
how old is the existing infrastructure?

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.990
I hear this term all the time,
and I guarantee everyone in this audience

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.080
has used it in storage at least once.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.620
It's called legacy.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.100
They all say,
I have legacy storage that I need

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.480
to connect to my new storage.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.820
Anybody ever say that?

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.300
Yeah, we say it a lot, right?

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.030
Legacy storage.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.300
Well, what does that mean?

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.080
Does anybody here realize
storage wears out?

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.000
I mean, that's another thing that
people don't realize.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.720
In the year 2000, I paid $2 million for
this three-letter acronym,

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.380
storage.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.300
And I have to amortize it
over the next 10 years because

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.410
I paid a lot of money for it.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.830
Well, storage wears out.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.990
It's rotating media.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.060
It's not as bad as tires on a car,
but it does wear out.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.170
So you have to plan on depreciating
that storage over three to five

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.590
years and getting it out of there.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.570
And when you do,
are you going to buy that same

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.700
monolithic storage you bought before,
or are you going to look differently?

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.030
The other thing to really look at is,
have you considered a tiered approach,

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:06.080
lowering the overall cost of storage,
putting that expensive storage in

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.130
your mission-critical areas and
putting lower-cost storage in the

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.840
business-critical and the near line?

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.580
It's something to really consider.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.460
And then the other one is
true capacity requirements.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.280
And since most of us don't really know
what our requirements are going to be,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.180
we can take a guess.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.140
But, you know,
who would have thought that

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:27.070
from 1998 to 2003 that storage
would have been growing,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.400
from a needs standpoint,
110 percent per year?

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.180
Not a lot of people
would have guessed that,

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.790
and they would have guessed low.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.700
So in deploying something
like a storage area network,

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.700
it allows you to actually
grow with that storage.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.950
So you get scalability up, down, in, out,
every way you can look at.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.510
So you can redeploy the
storage and reprovision it.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.040
So you need to look at
today and look at tomorrow.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.580
I think the other important
thing is throughput.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.630
So we talk about network
attach versus storage area

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.220
networks versus direct attach.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.300
In the storage area network world,
in the direct attach world,

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.620
the performance is going to be
bottlenecked by the limitation of

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.430
either the server or the storage.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.440
They're the limitations.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:09.010
In the network attach model,
the throughput or the storage performance

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.930
is going to be limited by the network.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.330
So you have to determine
what is my application.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.810
Is it megabytes per second?

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:15.810
Is it IOs per second?

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.950
And how many clients do
I actually have out there?

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.840
So you really have to look at that.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.900
The other one is really
availability requirements.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.420
Do I need it to really
be up 24 hours a day,

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.030
seven days a week with no downtime?

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.680
Or can I have a reasonable
two to four hour downtime?

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.440
It could be five minutes,
but let's just assume it's four o'clock

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.400
in the morning and something happens and
it's going to be two hours of downtime.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.560
Is that reasonable?

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.240
Is it business critical?

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.540
Does it need to be archived?

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.240
How often does it need to be archived?

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.720
Can I use near line?

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.400
These are all questions you have to ask
and you have to answer these yourself

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.800
because there's really no one who
can tell you what your business model

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.720
looks like because they vary so much.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.480
In fact,
you'll find that most of the people

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.180
selling very high end storage will
dictate your business model to you.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.180
And that's not necessarily
the right way to do it.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:06.500
And the other one is
really disaster recovery.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.180
So there's been a couple things
that have really driven that.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.950
One, of course,
was 9/11 and none of us really wanted

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.870
that to happen and none of us wanted to
have to bear what happened afterward and

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.270
that was rethink our storage strategy.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.780
Let's get this off site.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.240
And there's really two ways to do it.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.360
One is to deploy remote replication.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.290
Very expensive.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.350
Generally, it doubles your cost because
not only do you usually have

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.140
to replicate the storage,
you have to replicate servers and

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.640
infrastructure and everything.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.590
And the other one is an
off site backup service.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.460
And you can even carry it off site.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.570
Small companies, you know,
the CFO carries the tapes home.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.040
And in large companies,
there are companies like

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.240
Iron Mountain that will come pick
up your tapes and they'll even load

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.730
them and unload them if you need to.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.670
So it's really a cost driven thing.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.780
And when you talk about that,
you really need to talk about compliance.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.250
Because one of the other things,
anybody here that falls under

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.030
Sarbanes-Oxley or know that they do?

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:01.030
So a lot of larger
companies are doing this.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.680
And they're actually using
the same technology that's

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.850
used in the last five years.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.930
So they're using the same technology.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.160
So you can see that the government
is taking this very seriously

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.990
and it's starting to move to
Europe and it's starting to move

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.730
farther throughout the world.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.360
So this type of compliance that say
that you have to find every email for

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:20.320
the last seven years in 24 hours and
deliver it to the Justice Department,

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.150
that's a pretty huge requirement.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.840
Especially how many of you can go
through the tapes you have today

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.790
and find something from yesterday.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.600
It's usually a pretty hard thing to do.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.660
So it is good practice to have a budget.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.500
But it's also important to have a budget.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.620
And I think that's the most important
thing about a budget is that you

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.200
have to have someone that you can
trust that can give you the right

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.120
advice and that's looking out for you.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.040
And if they're just telling you today
that this is the right thing to do,

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.220
then you're going to have to have
someone that you can trust that

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.180
can give you the right advice
and that's looking out for you.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.470
And if they're just telling you today
that this is the right thing to do,

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.720
then you're going to have to have
someone that you can trust that

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.150
can give you the right advice
and that's looking out for you.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.250
And if they're just telling you today
that this is the right thing to do,

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.220
then you're going to have to have
someone that you can trust that

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.680
can give you the right advice
and that's looking out for you.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:01.890
And if they're just telling you
today that this is absolutely what

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:02.480
it's going to cost and there's
no other way of doing this,

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:02.680
I think you need to think different.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.390
So what I want to do
with that is really talk,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.880
bring up Ryan Klein,
who's a SAN architect at Qlogic,

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.950
to talk to you about basically the
one area that we hear all the time,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.880
and that is fiber channel best practices.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.830
If I'm going to deploy a
network and basically a SAN,

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.490
how do I do it and how do
I lower the cost in it?

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.210
And Ryan's going to tell us about
some great exciting stuff here.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.480
So what I want to do
with that is really talk,

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.060
bring up Ryan Klein,
who's a SAN architect at Qlogic,

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.050
to talk to you about basically the
one area that we hear all the time,

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.980
and that is fiber channel best practices.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.930
If I'm going to deploy a
network and basically a SAN,

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:47.800
how do I do it and how do
I lower the cost in it?

00:38:48.100 --> 00:39:50.200
[Transcript missing]

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.380
from One End to the Other.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.100
When building small networks,
starting as small as

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.650
eight fiber channel ports,
growing up to very large networks

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.810
such as 64 and 128 port SANs,
and deploying a very scalable,

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.330
cost-effective architecture.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.900
And then we're going to talk a little
bit about SAN interoperability.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.720
Alex touched on this as being
a very important part of

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:43.880
deploying a storage area network,
and it's really key to making sure

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.140
that all the componentry that you
have works together and is supported

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.280
and there are solutions that
you're not going to have to deploy.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.010
not going to run into any issues with.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.780
So we talked a little bit about all
of these components that Qlogic makes.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:59.500
So how does this come to you?

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.230
What are the strategies that allow
you to make use of these products?

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.250
Well, what we're going to start to see
is that we integrate our products

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.780
into the SANs that you go deploy.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.060
So you'll see Fiber Channel HBAs
inside of the servers,

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.860
taking our Fiber Channel ASICs,
iSCSI ASICs,

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.100
putting them on the motherboard.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.820
Most people today who
have deployed servers have

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.020
IP integrated on the motherboard.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.400
You're probably familiar
with SCSI on the motherboard.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.440
Same thing is happening
here with Fiber Channel.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.370
We also integrate switches into
the componentry that we have.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:37.120
So if you look at a lot of the bladed
environments that are out there today,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.520
they've taken the technology,
such as the Sandbox 5200,

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.290
which today is deployed in a box product,
and they've integrated it right

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.220
into the back end of those products.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.460
So moving forward,
storage boxes like Xserve RAID and

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.830
various other storage boxes have
the ability to integrate switching

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.000
architectures into those boxes.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.040
And there's a lot of things like
that that will be coming out.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.180
We're simplifying and lowering costs.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.560
And what does that really mean to you?

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.680
So when Alex asked how many people here
are storage administrators and have

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.640
dedicated people deploying storage,
I only think I saw one

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:13.180
person raise their hand.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.160
So what does that really mean?

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.180
Well, essentially,
everybody here has a lot of different

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.360
responsibilities and functions
within their IT organizations,

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.130
as in their developing products.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.160
So you're not necessarily a SAN expert.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.160
You know you have storage out there.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.230
You know that a storage area network
makes sense for your deployment,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.380
but you don't necessarily want to have
to know every single parameter and

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:40.160
all of the detailed implementations
to configure these types of things.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.010
So what we're doing is we're
building intelligent software

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.160
that allows us to configure
automatically these environments,

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.360
as well as provide ease of use to you
so that you don't have to worry about

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.910
all those detailed implementations.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:55.750
The final thing that we're really
doing here is we're delivering

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.250
turnkey SAN infrastructures.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.970
So what this means is it
gives you the ability to,

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:04.520
from a single perspective,
buy all the componentry that you need

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.340
to deploy a storage area network.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.170
So today, you know, we need servers,
we need the interconnects,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.760
and we need your storage.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.000
Well, what are all the pieces and parts
that you need to go deploy a SAN?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.320
If you're not very familiar
with all the componentry,

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.020
it could be somewhat overwhelming.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.870
So the idea is to provide a turnkey
solution that allows you to purchase

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.660
the storage networking switch,
all of the optics and things

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.300
like that that are required,
all of the cabling,

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.500
as well as the host bus adapters
that go inside the servers,

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.280
and to be able to do that in
a heterogeneous environment.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:41.390
So these types of kits
allow you to cross Windows,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:47.160
Linux, NetWare, Solaris, as well as OS X,
to deploy heterogeneous environments

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.250
and manage them from a single location.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.770
Talk a little about expanded management,
and this is what I just mentioned.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.900
We have something called our
SAN Surfer Management Suite,

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.020
and this is a device management tool.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.310
It's Java-based and really
complements the Xserve RAID GUI.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.560
So Alex talked about LUN mapping,
LUN masking,

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:11.530
the ability to point specific
LUNs at specific servers.

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:15.630
This software really complements this,
and what you're looking at here

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.780
is a picture of our brand-new,
just-released OS X GUI for

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.980
the Sandbox 5200 switch.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.580
What this allows you to do is
configure the specific SAN ports,

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.150
switches, and all the functionality in
a heterogeneous environment,

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.550
crossing all the applications
that we show at the top there.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:38.030
It works out really well and
complements all of the Apple tools,

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.810
and is Java-based, as I mentioned.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.690
Let's talk a little bit about
the switch market and what you've

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.730
probably seen in the past and
where we believe switching to go.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.940
So here's a basic SAN.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.500
This is a four-switch mesh.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.730
You see a bunch of Xserve
servers at the top,

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.610
Xserve RAID at the bottom,
some tape backup, as well as some

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.600
heterogeneous environments.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.650
And if you wanted to go deploy
this environment or something

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.210
similar to this a few years ago,

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:13.580
Those are some rough numbers of what
you'd see and what it would cost.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.080
The switching environment
really stands out here.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:21.300
Four switches there cost
roughly $20,000 apiece,

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.360
roughly going to about
$80,000 for the total,

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.040
so that's a large part
of the overall SAN.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.390
It was cost prohibitive for a
lot of people to put together

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.970
storage area networks.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.240
So what did we see?

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.520
We saw most SANs being deployed
at the large enterprise.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.400
And from a show of hands
earlier this morning,

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.770
most people here aren't
deployed large enterprises.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.000
They're more on the small
to medium business side.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.640
So SANs are really cost prohibitive.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.190
As we move forward,
one of the strategies that we're

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:56.070
working with Apple on is to be able
to bring storage area networks,

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.720
the functionality that
Xserve RAID brings you,

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.000
down to the small to medium
business and be able to develop

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:06.910
the platforms at the sub-$15,000
level for the entire solution,

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:10.630
as well as still scaling all
the way up to the enterprise.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.450
So the Sandbox 264 switch is a
chassis-based switch that allows

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:18.630
you to be at the very high end here,
as well as the Sandbox 5500.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.490
The Sandbox 5200,
which we're going to talk

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.660
about in a few minutes,
really allows us to scale all

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.750
the way from eight ports through
the small to medium business

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.750
there all the way up to 64 ports.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:48:16.600
[Transcript missing]

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.130
At the same time,
the embedded switches start

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:20.500
to come into play here.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:24.360
Taking that switching technology
and putting it directly into

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.770
the storage arrays or directly
into bladed environments for

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:32.500
servers and things like that,
really reducing cost and complexity.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.940
So using the last two
slides and comparing them to

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.990
this one and the next one,
in the past we had the chassis-based

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.640
high availability directors,
large port count, as well as we had the 8

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.840
and 16 port fixed switches.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.040
So of the folks in the audience
that raised their hand regarding

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.470
having switch infrastructure,
how many people here deploy

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.480
chassis-based or director class switches?

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.320
I see one or two hands, so almost nobody.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.630
So everybody else here,
by a show of hands,

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.660
eight 16-port switches, fixed port?

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.930
Okay, so right there,
you're really locked into a

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.230
strategy where if you want
to scale that environment,

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.000
you have to take another switch
and connect it in via an inner

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.020
switch link and start using up those
valuable end-user ports to do that.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.470
So where do we see this going?

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.310
Stackable switch market.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:30.670
Stackable switch market allows
you to scale an environment.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.700
You can still continue to
leverage the existing eight and

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:37.300
16-port switches that you have,
but you connect them directly into the

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.460
stackable switch and scale that way.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.000
And then if you need
the high availability,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.640
high port count switches,
you start using the

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.880
chassis-based switches,
and you see how they

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.080
complement each other,
giving you a choice to scale from

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.420
fixed port environment through
stackable all the way up to the

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.960
high port count chassis switches.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.810
to really be able to pick the right
switch for the right application.

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:06.840
So here's a little bit of a view
of the industry and the major

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.740
players that are out there and some
of the products that they have.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.440
So most of you are probably
familiar with Cisco,

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.380
small little company, McData, Brocade,
as well as Qlogic.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.950
And you see that everybody out there
really is offering fixed port switches,

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:23.820
not giving you too much
choice or scalability.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.450
Qlogic has come along and really
been disruptive and is offering

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:33.680
the Sandbox 5200 as well as the
Blade switch in the bottom right.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.880
But one thing that you'll notice
about stackable switches is they offer

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.940
all of the functionality that you
would get from a fixed port switch,

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.330
as well as they're offering
you functionality that you'd

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.490
see at the director class.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.210
So things like non-disruptive code load.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:50.660
Everybody here uses patches all the time.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:53.480
Well, as we move forward,
we provide updated software

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.620
and functionality to switch.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.490
Infrastructure part,
you want to make sure that you're

00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:59.330
up on the latest and greatest code.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.790
Well, you probably don't want to bring
down your environment to do that.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.620
Sandbox 5200 allows you to upgrade
firmware dynamically without

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.700
affecting your storage area network.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.850
Other big things here
are management software.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.120
This is really important because it
allows you to manage the environment and

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:20.850
doesn't cost additional money to you,
as well as all of the features

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.800
such as monitoring and
performance and things like that.

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.610
These are all things that are included
in these environments where you may not

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.100
get those in a fixed port environment.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.340
So we're going to introduce
here the Sandbox 5200 to you.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.900
By a show of hands,
how many people here are

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.740
familiar with the 5200 switch?

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:39.430
That's great.

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:42.170
That's a great number of people here.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:50.230
So the 5200 has 16 2G
ports and 4 10G ports.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.520
So the 16 2G ports really kind of be
viewed as a fixed port architecture.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:58.610
What the 4 10G ports,
and you got cut off here

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:02.450
on the right-hand side,
but I'll show it to you in a later slide,

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.900
are used to interconnect
those switches together.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.680
It's a 1U box.

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:12.780
It's managed just like an
IP switch would be managed.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.000
It has an Ethernet port
as well as an RS-232 port.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.590
It has something that we
call configuration wizards.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.160
I mentioned this a little bit earlier.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.040
Configuration wizards allow you
to step-by-step configure and

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.730
deploy a storage area network
without having to know all of

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.930
the details required to do so.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.650
5200 can be deployed in about five
minutes from a configuration standpoint.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:40.650
And you're ready to start plugging
in XR RAID boxes automatically

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:42.640
discovered and configured.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.280
And you don't have to worry
about what's happening and why.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.530
It does it all for you.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.070
IO StreamGuard.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:54.080
For the folks in here that do full
stream video as well as backups,

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.080
this is a really cool feature
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.400
But it's the type of feature and
functionality that Qlogic works

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:03.590
with Apple on to ensure that
we're serving all of the needs

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.490
of the folks like yourselves.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.200
IO StreamGuard.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.170
For the folks in here that do full
stream video as well as backups,

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:16.170
this is a really cool feature
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:19.520
But it's the type of feature and
functionality that Qlogic works

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.680
with Apple on to ensure that
we're serving all of the needs

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.600
of the folks like yourselves.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.340
IO StreamGuard.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:33.380
For the folks in here that do full
stream video as well as backups,

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.380
this is a really cool feature
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.710
But it's the type of feature and
functionality that Qlogic works

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.850
with Apple on to ensure that
we're serving all of the needs

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:44.790
of the folks like yourselves.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.050
IO StreamGuard.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.050
For the folks in here that do full
stream video as well as backups,

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.050
this is a really cool feature
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.050
But it's the type of feature and
functionality that Qlogic works

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.050
with Apple on to ensure that
we're serving all of the needs

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.050
of the folks like yourselves.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.020
10GIG ISLs, this is really a disruptive
technology to the industry.

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.100
We're the first switch to
have 10GIG functionality,

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.440
and we use it on the
right-hand side there.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.100
You see those copper interconnect cables.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:31.380
Left-hand side here is a picture
of a large 64-port mesh that

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.580
you would have to create if you
wanted fixed-port environments.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:39.530
So if you wanted to scale that large,
that's what the environment looks like.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:44.600
It requires 30 cables just to
connect the infrastructure together.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.400
And by the way,
those ports that you had to use,

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.350
you can't use for your devices,
your tape drives and your disk

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.800
drives and your servers anymore.

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.880
In a 64-port stack using
Qlogic on the right-hand side,

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.130
you get to use all 64 ports.

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:04.490
You don't lose those valuable user
ports when deploying a 5200 solution.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:10.260
Not to mention the amount of cables
and infrastructure mess that you would

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:14.740
have to manage with 30 cables and the
redundancy problems that you might have.

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.740
The other thing to mention
here is the 10GIG speed.

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.070
You'll be able to connect those switches
together with a 10GIG bandwidth.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.630
And in a fixed-port environment,
even if you started out with two switches

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.500
and you scaled the third and the fourth,
you're only having a 2GIG

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:33.340
bandwidth between those switches.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:38.370
So that's one major aspect of the 5200
that really brings a lot of advantage.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:40.640
Breakthrough ease of use.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.670
So, you know,
QLogic really looked at what

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:48.220
Apple had done with Xserve RAID and
the GUIs and the tools and the

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.640
ease of use that's available today.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.540
You know,
that's one of the biggest things

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:55.350
that you hear about Apple software
is how easy it is to use.

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.960
We took the lead there from them,
and we were able to integrate that

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.230
type of technology into the software
that we have for the Sandbox 5200,

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:06.810
as well as the SandServer
management suite that we've built.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:11.150
Really being able to provide a
stackable architecture with all the

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:13.240
value-added software that's easy to use.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.800
We really think that's important,
and it's really looked at as a best

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:20.410
practice in the industry because
it provides you with ease of use.

00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.500
So here's IO StreamGuard.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.440
I mentioned this before.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.160
This is a really cool
feature with QLogic switches.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.140
It's exclusive to QLogic switches.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.940
And for those of you that aren't
familiar with the process,

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:37.790
when you bring a server up and down
on a SAN or reboot a server on a SAN,

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.850
something called an RSCN,
a Registered State Change Notification,

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:42.500
goes out.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:45.360
And what that is,
is that server telling every

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:49.280
other server on the SAN,
hey, I'm here or I'm gone.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:52.060
Well, when that happens,
it's only a split second.

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:59.070
But if you have server A talking to disk
A and server B reboots and comes back up,

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:04.410
and this RSCN goes around the SAN fabric,
server A momentarily pauses.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.160
If you're in an OLTP environment running
a database or something like that,

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.840
not really a big deal.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.150
If you're streaming video or
you're streaming a backup and

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:18.490
all of a sudden there's a pause,
what do you think happens to the screen?

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:24.200
This is not a good thing if you're
doing high-definition broadcast.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.250
So this feature that we have
called I/O Stream Guard allows

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:33.000
that switch port to not acknowledge
something called an RSCN.

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:37.660
That way you can have continuous
streaming video or streaming backup

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.060
without having that port go down.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:44.250
This is exclusive to the 5200
and really plays well with Xserve

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:48.020
RAID as well as the customers
that use this type of technology.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:52.160
So best practices in
SAN interoperability.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.860
SAN interoperability is
something very important,

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:59.450
and it's something you need to look at
when you're deploying SAN solutions.

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:03.030
Historically,
interoperability really meant

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.980
connecting product A with product B.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:06.770
Does it work?

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.370
And it seemed like a game.

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:11.760
You didn't really understand
how it worked and what to do.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.740
And most of that has gone away,
and a lot of it has to do with

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.790
things like the SAN interoperability
guide that QLogic put together.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.400
This is something that's
available on our website,

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.020
and you can go to
QLogic.com and download it.

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:29.610
Really what it is, is a guide that allows
you to build a SAN.

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.900
It covers close to 60 different
partners in the industry,

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.800
from QLogic to Apple to
backup companies like Veritas.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:43.220
All the ISVs and IHVs out there,
multiple storage vendors,

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.660
multiple software vendors.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:48.920
And what it really is,
is a guide that allows you to know.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.840
What works with what,
and how to put it together.

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:56.480
Really key that you use a document
like this when you're building a SAN.

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:59.510
Everything from the infrastructure
components all the way up

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.870
to the application layer,
to know what's out there

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.940
and what works with what.

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.530
Great document.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:09.990
Switch interoperability is also
something very important to Qlogic

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:12.500
and something we work on continuously.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:15.100
Of the folks in the room,
there was a number of people

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.000
that had deployed 5200s.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.390
How many of you have
deployed brocade switches?

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.190
Great, there's only a few of you.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.700
I like that.

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:27.350
So the idea here, though,
is that there are going to

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.060
be a lot of people that have
used other vendor switches.

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.970
And sometimes you're going to
hear somebody say you have to

00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:34.910
stay in a homogeneous environment.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:38.010
If you want to add another
switch or grow to more ports,

00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:41.520
you have to buy another Brocade
or another McData switch.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.740
That's really not the case anymore.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.080
You know,
there's a lot of advantages to using

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.500
something like the Sandbox 5200 as you
continue to scale your environment.

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:53.490
But at the same time,
you don't want to forklift out

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.540
the switches that you have.

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.580
So this type of a document is a best
practices switch interoperability

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.470
document that gives you step-by-step
procedures on how to configure

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:07.720
new technologies like the Sandbox
5200 with legacy technologies

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.040
from companies like Brocade,
the fixed port architectures

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:12.730
and things like that.

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:16.380
So keep your existing technology,
continue to scale your environment,

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.390
and we give you step-by-step
procedures on how to do that.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.130
And something that really gives
an advantage to you when you're

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.260
growing those environments.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.910
So the other thing we like to
do is really educate our users,

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.840
our developers,
and provide documentation.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.710
All the documents that I've
been talking about fall under

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.500
an umbrella called QLogic Press.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.570
And it's really an educational arm of
QLogic that is designed to provide really

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.080
great white papers and documentation
about common SAN deployments.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.630
So as Alex described the various
areas of NAS and DAS and SAN,

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.460
of course QLogic is focused on SAN.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.530
And what we like to do is provide
procedures and step-by-step

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:03.100
and deployment scenarios
for SAN infrastructures.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.920
And this is a series of
guides that we built.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.830
This one is an Xserve
RAID-focused document.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.320
And it really gives you an
idea of common topologies,

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.780
how to configure, how to deploy.

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:18.270
There was a lot of topology
screens that Alex showed you.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.620
And those are in these types of guides.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.850
Plus, it tells you how to configure it.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.240
So that can be very complex, very quick.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.730
You know, lines everywhere and devices
connected and multi-pathing

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.590
and heterogeneous environments.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.140
I've got a network server.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.010
I have a Linux server.

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:35.320
How do I connect that in?

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.910
How do I do LUN mapping?

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:38.120
How do I do LUN masking?

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.230
We try to take all of that complexity
out of it by putting together

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.740
guides like this with step-by-step
screenshots that give you the

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:47.160
ability to go deploy effectively.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:54.500
So in summary,
Qlogic is an I/O technology leader.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.380
We want to provide you with
the infrastructure to move

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:03.060
your data from your server to
your storage via a SAN network.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.080
We make fiber channel switches as
well as fiber channel HBAs that

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.110
cross heterogeneous environments.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.090
You can deploy in numerous solution
environments as well as manage

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:15.570
them from a central location.

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:18.380
In addition,
we have new technologies like the

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:23.690
Sandbox 5200 that you're going to see
just continuously become easier to use,

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:26.990
more functionality,
as well as price being reduced

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:31.140
to enable more people to deploy
SANs and take advantage of all

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.030
the aspects of shared storage.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:37.660
The ability to pool your storage to
more effectively back up your storage,

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.760
as well as to use SAN to
better your businesses.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.300
We touched on interoperability
and how important interoperability

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.010
is to your environment,
making sure that when you

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:51.120
build SAN environments,
you take advantage of things like

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.740
the SAN Interoperability Guide.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.510
That guide gives you all
the visibility to what works

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:58.960
with what and how to deploy,
as well as taking advantage of things

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.560
like the Xserve RAID Configuration
Guide that we put together.

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.220
And finally,
you're going to see Apple and

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.880
QLogic working closer together to
continue to bring you solutions

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.820
documents and things like that,
and to continue to build environments

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.040
that take complexity out,
as well as allow you to

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:21.170
scale SAN environments,
and really take a competitive

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:26.170
advantage over your competitors,
as well as building solutions

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:31.260
that allow you to scale from small
environments all the way up to large 64,

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.250
128 port count environments.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.060
Thank you.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.180
That was great, Ryan.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.410
I brought one of those SAN configuration
guides just to give you an idea

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:48.170
how thick and complete this is.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.890
And I can tell you that with this guide,
just about anybody is able to

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:55.320
build a SAN with an Xserve RAID.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.610
Now, obviously, if you're doing something
like deploying an Xserve RAID,

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:03.160
an Xserve, you're deploying XSAN,
you know, the physical part is

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.410
really going to be hard.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.430
I mean, it really is.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:06.520
How do I set that switch?

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.220
What do I do?

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.320
If I've got video,
do I need to turn something on,

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:10.400
turn something off?

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.610
And it's all in here,
and these are available

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:15.550
online from QLogic,
so thank you, Ryan, for doing that.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:20.790
What I'm going to do now is I'm
actually going to turn it over

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:25.770
to Steve Terlizzi from Candera,
who's going to really talk to us

01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:29.820
about an interesting case study
that we put together with Candera,

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:33.280
and where the customer
is actually Shai Day,

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.260
who is a large ad agency.

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:39.390
It just happens to be Apple's ad agency,
just had nothing to do with that,

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:40.240
actually.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.360
But they were really facing
something that is something

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.350
that everyone faces out there,
and it's really a mission-critical

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:50.510
storage environment and an issue they
had for a long time in heterogeneosity.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.970
And Candera, Apple,
and QLogic all got involved,

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:55.920
and we're able to really do
something that's incredible.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.790
So, Steven,
do you want to take the stage here,

01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:58.260
please?

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.510
Sure.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.260
Thank you.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:10.040
So, one of the interesting things when
you start to look at what Apple,

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:14.060
Qlogic, and Candera are talking about
is addressing the needs of

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:17.580
mission-critical storage,
but not at the prices that the

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:21.770
big players and the big vendors
are pushing on the Fortune 200,

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:23.820
Fortune 500 companies.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:28.860
What they tend to miss is the fact that
there's a large number of companies

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:34.190
that need mission-critical storage,
need the availability, the performance,

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.900
the performance scalability
that you could find in a

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:41.020
monolithic storage device,
but certainly not at the $40 per

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:46.170
gigabyte plus that you typically see
when you look at a monolithic device.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.050
So, today I'm going to talk about
Chiat Day and how they built their

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:53.670
mission-critical infrastructure on
a combination of Qlogic and Candera.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:56.460
So, let's start with the
first part of the session,

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.180
which is the Qlogic, Candera,
and Apple products.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.870
Then talk a little bit
about this new architecture,

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:04.100
the ability to build
this intelligent ATA,

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.500
and then close it up
with what that means.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.490
How much can you apply this
to your infrastructure,

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:13.190
whether you're an enterprise
or a small to medium business?

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.200
And, of course, the Qlogic.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:59.000

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.220
About 50?

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.520
Over 100?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.350
It's actually over 100.

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:11.390
Now, we scaled it down to about
40 by rationalizing it,

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.650
but when we were developing it,
it was over 100 megabytes.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:19.280
Now, imagine 500 professionals working
daily with multiple copies of

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:23.340
presentations of this level of quality,
trying to do digital content,

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.420
and you can see how quickly it can grow.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.380
And this is their business.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.080
They're responding to very tight
deadlines of clients that are paying

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.280
a lot of money for advertising that
don't want to see things missed.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.240
And they need the access all
the time because creative people

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:42.880
like that work very long hours,
very vigorous hours.

01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:48.850
And so, Chiat Day, this facility in LA,
needed 7 terabytes of storage

01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:51.560
to handle 500 clients.

01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:55.500
Their New York office
needed 21 terabytes.

01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:59.160
So what did they have originally?

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.460
What was the before?

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.150
The before was a heterogeneous
server environment made up of Novell,

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:07.830
Apple, HP servers,
all with direct attached storage.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:13.080
So every server had its own storage,
different departments had different

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.890
projects on different servers,
and sure enough,

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:20.050
the server that had available storage,
that department didn't need the storage,

01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:24.080
while the department that really
needed the storage had a server

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.730
that had no storage on it.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:31.260
So they ended up having an environment
that was very difficult to manage,

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.800
very poor utilization.

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.420
The other aspect to Chiat Day is
this is not a Goldman Sachs that

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.900
has a liberal IT department.

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:43.770
It was a very limited
IT staff and a limited budget.

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.200
So they needed to focus on how can
I build this infrastructure that

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.900
I can manage most cost effectively.

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.900
The other thing is storage planning.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.900
How do I plan for the growth?

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.900
How do I plan for the scaling?

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:59.500
As they brought more and more
services and more clients on,

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.900
it's an unpredictable demand flow.

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.390
They land a big client,
they need more storage very quickly.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.770
How do they respond to that environment?

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.480
And the other thing is
with a DAS environment,

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.850
backup is difficult.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.040
And in an environment where
you have high availability,

01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:18.900
they need to be able to consistently
backup and restore that data.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:23.900
In this DAS environment,
you have different backup regimes.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.250
So what we did is we recommended a SAN.

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:35.520
We took a pair of 5200, Qlogic 5200s,
and what we call a Candera

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:40.440
Apple ATA appliance,
which is a number of Apple Xserve

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.220
RAIDs aggregated with Candera's
network storage controller.

01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:50.760
And what that allowed them to do
is deploy a very easy SAN storage.

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.690
The Qlogic SAN provided the connectivity.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:10:01.460
The Candera Apple ATA appliance provided
this storage that could be deployed in

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.060
seconds and provisioned very quickly.

01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:08.640
The other aspect to this is the
fiber channel level of reliability.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.340
When Chayote went out to look and say,
"What can I buy?" They looked

01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:16.720
at fiber channel storage,
modular and monolithic storage,

01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:19.180
because they believed
that's what they needed.

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.810
When Candera and Apple came in and said,
"No, you can do this using

01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:26.020
serial ATA technology,"
they looked at us and said,

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:29.400
"You've got to be kidding." But we
were able to provide the kind of

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.490
active-active high availability,
the kind of tracing and diagnostics

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.200
that you typically find in a
monolithic storage device with

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:39.820
the Candera Apple solution.

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.590
Also, it allowed you to
centralize the data assets.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.240
So I could have the physical storage
here of the Apple Xserve RAIDs,

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.270
and then with the virtualization
and the centralized management

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:56.180
provided by Candera,
I could create virtual LUNs

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.260
that I could very flexibly
provision to the various hosts.

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:07.060
And those hosts were heterogeneous hosts,
including HP, Apple, Novell environments.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:11.800
The other key aspect to that is
the error detection and correction.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.340
So when you look at a SAN environment,
when there's a problem

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:20.090
in the environment,
maybe a flaky HPA or something

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:25.330
that goes awry on the storage,
it's difficult to diagnose.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.340
The more complex the SAN gets,
the more difficult.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:32.020
But with an aggregating element in there,
you can then do very quick

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.350
error detection and diagnosis.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.360
And the other aspect and the
other benefit to this is,

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.360
by moving from a DAS environment
to a SAN environment,

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.360
you de-link the storage from the hosts.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.020
Consequently,
it's very easy to replace hosts,

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.110
to add new hosts,
and to buy smaller servers.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.860
So were they happy?

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:59.160
So this is the quote from
Chiat Day where they said,

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:01.430
basically,
we didn't think we could do our

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:06.220
storage infrastructure on ATA,
but Candera and Apple were able to

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:11.850
deliver that at a fraction of the
cost of monolithic or modular storage.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:18.000
They were so happy that after the
evaluation with the LA system,

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:22.300
they bought the 21 terabyte
New York system at the same time.

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:24.970
And they had planned a phased
implementation and they

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:26.770
bought everything up front.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.240
So what is this partnership
with Candera and Apple?

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.620
Why are we together?

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:36.540
What are we doing?

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:41.060
The Candera Apple ATA appliance
takes the components,

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.650
takes the guts of what you'd find
in a monolithic storage device by

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:48.780
way of fine-grained virtualization
and centralized management,

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:54.950
and uses that to aggregate
Apple's superior ATA technology.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.920
So when you look at a monolithic device,
what you typically find,

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.910
and pull back all the sheet metal,
you find components that

01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:08.140
handle connectivity and
virtualization and management,

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:11.710
components that provide RAID processing
and those types of things.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:16.100
And they're able to scale because as
you need performance and capacity,

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.920
you add more controllers.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.830
As you need connectivity,
you add more disk adapters,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.460
channel adapters.

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.400
So you can scale the performance.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.360
As you need modular
devices can't do that,

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:32.500
but the combination of Candera
plus Apple allow you to do that.

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:35.910
They allow you to scale both the
performance and capacity together.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.280
Also, enterprise class,
the high availability,

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:43.370
the ability to do active-active failover,
the fault tolerance,

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:45.270
those types of things are very important.

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.540
When you look at environments,
we talked about legacy storage

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.150
and how messy it can be in there.

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:57.820
What we allow you to do is start by
building this ATA appliance and then

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:01.780
start to bring in your legacy storage
and provide one centralized approach.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.060
So interoperability becomes very easy.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.040
And so when you look,
it's now a new approach

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:15.280
to a storage architecture.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.810
Monolithic approach
was the first approach.

01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:22.300
Big, manageable scales,
but very expensive.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.300
Modular starts small, but doesn't scale.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.100
Now you have this intelligent
ATA approach that allows

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.730
you to start small,
but aggregate all those devices

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:36.830
into one big virtual disk.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:42.590
In fact, the combination of Candara
and Apple allow you to build

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:48.110
an architecture that matches
that monolithic architecture.

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.890
What does that mean?

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.580
What that means is you can manage
everything from one centralized

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:59.140
approach and have a management GUI that
will work and allow you to scale

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:02.980
and work like a monolithic device.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:16:36.500
[Transcript missing]

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.310
Fantastic.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.240
Thanks, Steve.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.380
I appreciate it.

01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:48.580
You can see that today there's
a lot of choices in storage.

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.950
And the Candera and Apple solution
is an interesting one.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.970
It's one where you can actually
take high-performance storage,

01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:59.510
combine it with the feature
sets that you get in very,

01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:02.390
very expensive monolithic storage,
those three-letter

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:05.410
acronym name companies,
and you can really build a system

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:08.170
that is very cost-effective
and scales a lot better.

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:11.760
And so what I want to do
really quickly is wrap up,

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.680
and we're probably not going
to have time for Q&A today,

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.920
so what we're going to end up
doing is talking to you afterward.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.980
But just to wrap it up real quickly,
I think when you look at the

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.780
summary of what we've talked about,
the first thing is to remember is budget.

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:27.660
Budget's going to dictate
your infrastructure,

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.820
and we think we have a
building block storage product

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.040
that allows you to do that.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.450
The second thing is that complexity
is always going to equal cost.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.450
So the more complex it gets,
the more it's going to cost.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.190
And of course,
scalability is something you

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:42.710
need to address up front.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.760
And you have to really look,
when you're talking about scaling it,

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.100
is what is your real-world
usage of the systems?

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:53.460
And you don't want to overlook
the backup needs that you have,

01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:56.500
because a lot of people say, well,
I'm putting in RAID storage,

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.860
I no longer need to backup.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.490
And nothing could be farther
from the truth than that.

01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:03.540
When you put in RAID storage,
what you need to do is be more

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.180
concerned about backup because
you get a false sense of security.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.720
And then the last thing
is consider tier storage.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:11.890
Because if you look at tiered storage
and you look at these approaches and

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.460
not spend that money on that monolithic
storage for everything you need,

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:19.080
you can build an infrastructure that
matches your needs going forward.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.130
And I can guarantee you one thing,
and that's that we're going to

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:25.140
continue to drive the ease of use
and the price of storage down.

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:27.060
I appreciate everyone's time today.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:27.960
Thank you very much.
