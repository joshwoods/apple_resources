WEBVTT

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.800
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for attending the session today.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.750
My name is Benjamin Feinman.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.070
I'm a senior product manager
in the QuickTime group,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.500
and I focus on mobile
media delivery solutions.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.740
Today, we're going to split our
time into two presentations.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.220
One from Erickson, Eugene Sarmiento.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.270
He's going to take you through
in a little bit more detail the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.040
components of their mobile delivery
solution and talk a little bit about

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.980
how Apple integrates into that.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.480
And then we have Dr.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.490
David Guyard from Buick Telecom,
which is a major European operator

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.180
that we've been working
with on video services,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.950
and he's going to take you through
what it takes to create and deliver

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.760
content from the operator's perspective.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.700
And at the end,
we'll do just a little bit of Q&A.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.820
So I'd like to invite up Eugene.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.130
The clicker is now yours.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.760
Good afternoon everybody.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.300
My name is Eugene Sarmiento
as Ben mentioned earlier.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.430
I'm a product marketing manager as well,
but mainly focusing on Ericsson's

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.400
content download and streaming solution.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.520
How many of you here were
in yesterday's presentation?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:04:48.700
[Transcript missing]

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.100
And in terms of opportunities
that we see in this space,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.500
okay, according to Business Wire, right,
this is on the fixed side,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.420
there was 7.87 billion streams in 2003.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.220
That's 100% increase from
2002 or the year earlier.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.460
And we see that same
expansion or growth going,

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.220
this is also going to happen
in the wireless space.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.980
And just also from another analyst,
it's strategy analyst,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.290
they see that in 2008,
over 150 mobile users will be

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.680
viewing video content and video
services generating $4.6 billion.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.400
So this is one of the analysts.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.550
Some are saying 6 billion,
some are saying a bit higher,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.080
some are saying a bit lower,
but there's basically a lot of revenue

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.000
to be made in the wireless space.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:53.360
Okay, now to give you an example of
what or which operators are

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.420
actually mature in wireless media,
I have two examples,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.480
one from Japan where they have
launched a lot of 3G handsets.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.720
They're going to increase their
subscriber base by six-fold.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:16.040
And one of the operators there,
which is NTT DoCoMo,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.350
they launched a service
called M Stage Visual,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.120
which subscribers pay
for on a monthly fee,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.760
and they also charge for
a transmission charge.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.100
So the monthly fee is $1.8 to access
all the content in their portals,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:40.670
and the transmission charge is
roughly 14 cents per minute of data.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.680
Also in the same region,
we have South Korea Telecom,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.160
who's also earning a lot
of money on mobile media.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.140
They're earning an average of 7.5
US dollars on top of their existing

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.280
revenue because of the streaming and
download capabilities in their network.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:06.050
Also in the same region,
we have South Korea Telecom,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:16.230
who's also earning an average of 7.5
US dollars on top of their existing

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:27.590
revenue because of the streaming and
download capabilities in their network.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.010
And it was surprising for the
CTO to see that people want

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.980
to view TV on a mobile phone.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.440
And this is just an example of
what all the other operators

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.480
around the world could be.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.040
This could be their
situation in the future.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:53.590
Now apart from the opportunities,
Ericsson has also done its own

00:07:53.690 --> 00:08:00.360
studies on what services subscribers
would like in the mobile media space.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.600
So we surveyed 40,000 people around
the world in 11 countries actually,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.430
and this was done by an internal
group called Consumer Lab,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.700
which just looks into user
behavior and user statistics.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.890
And specifically for streaming
and download of video content,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.620
what they found out was there's three
main categories that people look for.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.900
It's the music category.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.760
the news and the sports categories.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:11:42.800
[Transcript missing]

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.670
So, in the end-to-end chain from
creation of the content to the

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.820
actual delivery to the handset,
what are we doing in these

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:57.700
different processes or different
stages of the delivery of content?

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.770
From the content creation side,
as I said, we have mobility world,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.790
we have partners,
we create packages of applications

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.670
that we match towards operators.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:17.020
So, if we approach, for example,
a company called Amena in Spain,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.570
the way we approach them
is we have a mobility world

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:24.430
representative and he says,
these are the things that we have,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.590
a thousand different things,
pick and choose from them.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.330
Or we give them also information
about how these services are,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.390
if they're successful in other markets,
why they're successful,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.350
what sort of revenues,
potential and business case.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.660
What these applications have and
how it would impact their network.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.810
So, from that side,
we have mobility world as well

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.830
as the tools that we sell with
our solution to enable operators

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:57.820
to create content on their own or
resell that content or actually

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.700
buy content from content providers.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.270
On the other side, from the terminals,
the activities that we

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.440
mainly do is testing.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.660
IoT testing.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.520
We do IoT testing with our
own handsets as well as all

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.220
the other handsets from Nokia,
from Motorola,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:22.400
from NEC and the rest of the
terminal suppliers across the globe.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.530
So, we do support for that.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.930
Now, our main offering and our main,
well, actually, our core competence in

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.030
Ericsson is delivery,
is integration and is

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.850
the wireless network.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.880
Okay.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.750
And that's why we focus on that.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.210
In terms of transport,
we make sure that our platforms have the

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.620
features and functionality that interwork
with the core network and radio network,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.630
that the quality of service is maintained
end-to-end between the handset,

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.420
the radio base stations,
the radio base stations

00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.010
connected to our switches,
and then the switches connected

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.600
to our streaming solutions.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.520
Okay.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.790
So, we not only address the
features on the product itself.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.320
But we also.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.070
Develop features on the
radio and core side.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:17.790
Apart from that, we do integrate or we
focus on business logic.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.470
The product that we sell focuses
on the business logic that

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:26.020
will allow operators to charge,
to provision, and manage the different

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.240
nodes that we're introducing.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.710
Because this is where we're coming from.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.710
This is where Ericsson's competence is.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.320
We've been building mobile network
technology and integrating this.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.560
For more than 100 years.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.580
So,
this is why we're focusing on this area.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:51.540
Okay, so knowing our role and our
function in the end-to-end chain,

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.100
what's the challenges we see and
what challenges do operators see?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:02.760
And I think my colleague from Buig
will be discussing their views as well.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.260
But in our point of view,
there's four main areas that

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.950
are challenges in delivering
mobile media content.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:17.200
First and foremost,
it's having the right content and the

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.250
right applications in operator networks.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.730
It's still not that easy to
find that killer content.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:29.070
Then there's the handsets,
the problem of making sure that

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.620
every single content is delivered.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.760
And then there's the operator networks.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.310
So we have to be able to integrate
the operator networks into handsets,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.670
and those handsets can decode and
play the different formats that

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.250
are available in operator networks.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.630
But apart from that,
we also look at end-to-end integration.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.350
All right, let's say I have the content
out and my partners are set.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.240
I have the handsets ready.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:56.300
Next thing that the operator asks for,
or the next thing that is asked for,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.850
is how do I integrate the solution?

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.730
How do I make sure that the
billing interfaces are set,

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.940
that the prepaid interfaces are set?

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.820
How about my integration
to customer care?

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.760
How about my integration
to network management?

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.100
And finally, of course,
there's how should I charge for this?

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:20.220
And this is still an unknown
area for a lot of operators.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.260
There's so many ways
you can charge for this.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.470
It could be subscription-based,
event-based, it could be volume-based,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.760
it could be category-based,
it could be one-time fee,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.760
or it could be combined with MMS,
it could be combined with voice.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:42.760
There's so many things that could be
possible on a way to charge for this.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.760
And that is a challenge because this
will actually make or break the service.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.680
All right, so what's our solution?

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.760
What's Ericsson's solution for this?

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.710
Well, basically,
we have come up with a solution,

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:01.160
an end-to-end solution that addresses
or aims to address all the content,

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.650
all the relevant formats,
all the relevant protocols,

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.520
connecting that content to the
handsets or the devices that

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.760
will receive that content.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.610
And what we've done in Ericsson,
or what we focused on Ericsson,

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.760
is the development of a
network integration node.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.440
And what that does, of course,
is do the integration aspects,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.680
basically develop features that
bring about our core competencies.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:35.750
And what it does is it allows
us to have streaming services.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.610
Now,
it could be a Sun streaming server or it

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.760
could be a QuickTime streaming server.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.450
What we want to be,
what we want the system to be is

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.350
agnostic to its streaming server
or streaming platform because we

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.760
want to address the content space.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.770
So if an operator says,
"I want this type of codec and

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.720
this other streaming server
provides it," then we put that in.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.730
And I think QuickTime is really
helping us there in terms of

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.680
the new protocols that they're
supporting and 264 is coming up.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:11.190
So it could happen that operators
will start asking for that,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.760
and we will deliver it with that.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.540
We do also provide content
upload for the content providers,

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.870
content storage rating for that content,
and a subscriber database to

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.730
hold the information about which
services that subscribers want.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:35.520
Apart from that, I'd like to explain to
you how our solution,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.330
which is ECDS,
fits into the radio network

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.760
and the core network.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.720
The way it works today is we
have support for both circuit

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.310
switch and packet switch,
which is quite a key strength because

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.700
a lot of the existing solutions today
only address the packet switch space.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.760
So we have a lot of different solutions.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.760
We have a lot of different solutions.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.750
This is more wireless
technology infrastructure.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.440
So you have your radio base
stations connected to controllers,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.010
controllers connected to gateways,
and then finally it's on the Internet or

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:13.740
within the operator's walled garden.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.040
And then we have integration
to content creation,

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.740
content management, HLR,
and charging systems.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760
Okay?

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760
So that's the first part.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:30.650
So, I told you that one of the
challenges is integration and

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.130
that's why we focus on that.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.100
We make sure that we have integration
points to the billing gateways,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.620
we have integration points to
network management systems.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.540
So, when we talk about network
management systems,

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.260
it could be HP OpenView,
it could be Compact TAMIP,

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.760
anything with SNMP support.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:56.030
We have integration points towards
a AAA server where basically we

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.810
get the IP to MSISDN mapping.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.300
Now, this is important because
on the wireless network,

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.650
you need to find out what MSISDN is
so that you can charge for it.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.640
So, it's like if you look at it
from the web perspective,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.010
it's your key to access
streaming services.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.120
Okay, apart from that,
we're looking into integration

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.100
with or creating functions for MMS.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.850
Okay, integration to that and VIG is a
video interactive gateway which allows

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.630
us to have circuit switch services.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:34.310
Okay, on the encoder side,
we do sell products based on

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.760
QuickTime and we do promote
QuickTime based encoders like the

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.220
Final Cut Pro and the QuickTime Pro,
is it?

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.260
Yeah, QuickTime Pro.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.940
But we do have also other
partners that we have.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.850
we package along with our solution.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.150
Okay.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:59.140
Now, let's say we address
the integration part.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.770
How did we address the application part?

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.340
How do we make sure that there's enough
applications out to the handsets?

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:12.290
Well, we have a Mobility World program
where we focus on making sure that

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.100
developers have the ability to create.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.100
Then, after the creation process,
we take those applications,

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.880
verify it in our test labs,
make sure that it's tested properly,

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:27.730
it integrates with operator networks,
and then we go to market with that.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.580
Okay.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:33.540
From the developer's site,
we have www.ericsson.com

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.760
slash Mobility World.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.670
Okay.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.940
And there you'll have all the SDKs,
not just for streaming

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.900
and download services,
but you have APIs and SDKs for

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.920
location-based information,
for parlay services,

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.870
which is voice-related,
and there's also SDKs

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.580
on how you can push SMS.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.240
So, basically,
anything with regard to mobile

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.540
network technologies and
providing applications on that,

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.980
you can find the development tools there.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.390
We have support services, forums, and we,
of course,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.300
have success stories of search.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.780
We have certain application providers
who have made it big with us.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.000
Okay.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:22.040
On the verified side, we try to as much,
since we package

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.000
Applications and services
towards operators,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.480
we need to make sure that
it's tested very well because

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.800
basically we do first-line
support for those applications.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.760
And the first thing the operator says is,
Erickson,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.910
why doesn't your application work?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.880
So we need to do very stringent
tests on these applications,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:49.930
and we do that through a process,
and we have a lot of things that we

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.800
look into in the testing process.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.340
After the testing and verification,
then we go to the market.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.780
And there's roughly 30 centers
worldwide where we have

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.300
mobility world representatives.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.060
And these mobility world representatives,
the only thing they do

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.510
is sell applications.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.770
They go to each operator and ask them,
"What do you want?

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.220
Where are your services headed?

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.410
How can we help you?"
And that allows you,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.880
as an application developer,
to push your content without

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.810
actually having the manpower
to fly across all the globe.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.590
So we do the front end for you.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.030
On the terminal side,
we're heavily relying on the standard,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.600
as is Apple.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.060
And we've been drivers for
the packet switch streaming

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.370
standard for a while now.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.340
During the times when it was
three or four years ago when I was

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.370
trying to sell streaming solutions,
but a lot of the streaming

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.570
solutions were proprietary.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.820
There was a proprietary
codec from guys from Seattle,

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.700
proprietary codec from this guy,
and there's like four solutions,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.780
all proprietary.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.800
And we couldn't live with that.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.960
As Ericsson, being a driver for standards
and being a driver for GSM,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.520
we needed to make sure that there
is a standard way to transfer

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.870
these files and encode these files.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.150
And we did that through the
packet switch streaming standard.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.770
So what came out of that
is UA prof information,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.770
which basically allows you to
find out the terminal capabilities

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.160
of the phones that you send.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.700
And we also have a standard for
the data that you send content to

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.720
or is retrieving content from you.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.840
There is a specific standard on DRM,
but it's very limited.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.920
It took them a day and a half to hack it,
and now it's not that

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.830
difficult to hack that.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:53.640
And then for the codecs, we have AMR,
narrowband, wideband, AAC,

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.900
which is the next generation MP3,
H263 and MPEG-4.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.890
H264 is coming in R6.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.900
We have scalable polyphony, media.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.900
And as you can see, all the things that
Apple has been working with,

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.900
RTSP, RTPSDP, these are things that is
in the standard as well.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.530
Apart from that,
we have for scene descriptions,

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:25.400
SMILE 2.0, and for text and images,
we have the following.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:32.420
You can get this off of the 3GPP site,
www.3gpp.org.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.310
You can get the latest information
of what's happening in the standards.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.560
Okay,
so that's addressing the terminal space.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:47.640
I think now I'll focus mainly on
what we've done with other customers,

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.280
or some of our customers.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.620
I'll focus on three because the rest,
we actually have roughly 15 customers,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.480
but I can't really disclose them to you.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.720
But I have three samples
that I will be discussing.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.260
All right,
so we have Mobitel in Slovenia.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.150
They were our first customer, actually,
and they started launching

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.440
their services in 2003.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.630
And in terms of services,
they listened to us and put news,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.580
put sports, and put music content there.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.480
Apart from that,
they had their own thinking of

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.940
putting a lot of adult content,
which is really taking up there.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.580
Don't know why.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:29.650
Okay.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.580
But yeah.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.080
They also have live TV.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.640
And in their launch,
during less than two weeks

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.290
since the introduction,
they had 100,000 clicks

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.410
to various erotic content.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.100
Well, we'll see maybe that's
the way forward for this,

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.770
but there was a lot of interest
in special weather programs

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.880
where people were stripping,
and there was a lot of

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.840
services around that.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.540
Now, basically what happened
is after they launched,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.630
after a year of launch,
they were able to penetrate

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.770
40% of their subscribers.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.710
So that's quite a quick penetration rate.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:17.890
I mean, that's one of the best they have,
actually,

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.800
in their span of launching services.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.700
And right now they have
roughly 445,000 users.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.510
They are growing at 8,000 per month.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.100
So big.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.160
So they could reach 100 pretty soon.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.440
In terms of content providers,
we have given them

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.700
some content providers,
and we've given them support in

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.230
providing them with the content
that they're looking for.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.950
Okay, so we have discussions now
ongoing with Sony Music and MTV.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.750
Another operator that we
work with is Amena Spain.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.220
They have been very good
supporters of Ericsson.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.280
And they launched services such
as TV programs from Canal+.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.570
And they have also music,
sports, cinema, and fashion content.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.370
In terms of content providers,
there is Grupo Prista,

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.550
which is a media company in Spain.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:20.270
And the way they charge for
this is basically... Ah,

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.920
one thing that I missed on
the other slide was charging.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.870
All right.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.420
The way they charge for these
services is they charge on the time

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.930
the person is browsing content.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.650
So it's time-based.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.580
For Amena Spain,
they charge on time-based

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.390
charging as well.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.080
And there's no specific charge.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.540
But they're now looking
into prepaid support.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.610
And once that happens,
I think then they'll

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:44.660
go into the broad base.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.860
Because if you look at Europe,
it's mainly prepaid subscribers there.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.530
Okay, then there's Telefonica.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.600
They launched in December 2003.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:59.280
They launched almost the same
time as Amana because they're

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.560
competing with one another.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.140
And they have the same set of services.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.540
They have Spanish TV channels.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.560
And in terms of charging,
they do have prepaid support today,

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.560
and we did that for them.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.620
Apart from the success that
they have with the service,

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.620
what I haven't really said here is
the integration that we've done.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.760
Integration into fault
management systems,

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.390
integration into their
content management systems.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.890
And we've been very successful
in quickly deploying that.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:38.310
Actually, we had one customer where they
wanted to launch within a month

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.300
and we were able to deliver.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.900
Actually, it took us one week to install,
two weeks to integrate.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.500
That was one of our best times
in integrating a platform

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.840
for one of our operators.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.240
And the price levels for
Telefonica is one euro per video.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.940
Another important customer
that we have is Sunrise.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.880
And the difference between Sunrise
and Telefonica is that we have

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:02.880
a lot of different customers.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.880
And the difference with this one is we
provide them with a hosting service.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.600
So they don't have anything.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.500
We provide everything from the platform,
the streaming servers,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.030
and the applications,
and we aggregate that content for them.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.260
They only pay us for usage, basically.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.810
And this has been very successful.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.500
They launched in July 2003.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.230
We've used a lot of the
Mobility World Partners,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.860
EMW.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.740
That's Ericsson Mobility World Partners.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.690
They price per clip.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.660
That's the difference with the
rest of my previous examples.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:41.770
So they price per clip.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.220
And they also have subscriptions
for groups of content.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.680
So you pay a subscription fee,
let's say HBO content,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.160
and then premium prices
for each of the clips.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:59.520
We recently launched with them Emuse,
which is a music service.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.500
And this music service,
allows subscribers to look into,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.470
let's say, Britney Spears' website,
and find out the latest

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.220
information about her,
her ringtones, her music,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.830
and also the music.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.860
Ask for MMS content that
they can show their friends.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:26.280
And we had in Asia last year a slogan,
which is make money by

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.180
making people famous.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.160
Because how operators will make
money is if they can make the

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.060
subscribers famous with their friends.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.130
Oh, look, I have the latest football
goal in Euro 2004 by,

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.680
let's say, Portugal.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.530
Or maybe here,
if it's the San Francisco Giants.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.400
Oh, here's the latest tackle.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.560
All right.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.270
Summary.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.900
There is a lot of opportunities,
and it's happening now.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.970
It didn't happen as much last year,
but this year we see a

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.990
lot of positive results,
both with our operators and with

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.340
operators that have launched
streaming and download services.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.260
Ericsson wants to be
your business partner,

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.060
and we want to take you to our operators.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.790
We'd like you to join us in
Ericsson's Mobility World program.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.420
The link is there.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:25.420
If you need to get contacts,
just please approach me and be part

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.170
of the mobile and media convergence.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.130
Thank you.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.700
Thank you, Eugene,
for an excellent presentation.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.460
So coming up next, we've got Dr.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.310
David Guyard, who's going to now talk
about a similar topic,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.600
but from the perspective of an operator.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.560
So with that, I'll hand over the clicker.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.590
My name is there.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.080
It doesn't move.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.200
It doesn't change.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.400
I work in the Department of
New Technologies at Bouygues Telecom.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.160
It's a French operator.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.700
I will make a brief
presentation in a moment.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:08.140
The topic of this presentation is
video services of a mobile network.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.260
And here are the different
aspects I will deal with.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.660
First, I will speak about my company,
because we are a small operator.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.660
And it's interesting to know why
we are making video right now.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.330
I will talk a little bit about iMODE.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:28.080
But my colleague in next time slot
will have a deeper presentation of it,

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.880
I think.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.810
So I will be rapid.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.440
I will also talk about the
network constraints and the type

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.030
of networks we are operating,
and also the handsets,

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:47.610
because it is one of the most
limiting devices to deploy video.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.380
And then I will go
deeper into the subject,

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.130
that is I will present two simple
services that are launched,

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.880
that is video mail and video downloads.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.290
And as a conclusion, I will make some

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.420
Talk about future trends,
both in the content aspects,

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.380
how to encode the content,
and the transport problems,

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:11.180
how will the transport
evolve in the future.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.710
And that will be all.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.750
So Buick Telecom.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.900
In the previous slide,
there was a way to pronounce it.

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:27.240
It's very difficult to
pronounce it for American.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.620
So the network started in 1996.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.620
We have 6 million subscribers.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.710
It's approximately 18%
market share in France.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:45.050
And we are operating GSM/GPRS network.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.760
We have a nationwide coverage
for both technologies.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:54.760
And since we are only French operator,
we have a lot of roaming agreement

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.350
around the world that makes us possible
to have access to iMODE services

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.900
while we are being here in the States.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.510
So it's quite important for us.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.640
We intend to evolve our network.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:14.120
In 2005, we are making some sort of test
in France with Edge technology,

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.690
which is a very important
evolution for us because we will,

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:22.420
from one day to the other,
gain a nationwide coverage as a

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:28.820
position to 3G networks that most
of the time operate on spots.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.950
And with Edge,
we will gain a four-fold throughput.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.600
So very interesting to have
bigger files to download,

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.100
for instance.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.520
In 2002, we launched iMODE.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:49.600
Internet for the mobile phones,
but in a simpler way than, for instance,

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:56.300
WAP, because it reuses protocols
existing for the web.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.670
So mainly it's HTTP based,
and it uses email instead of MMS.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:08.830
One particularity of it is that the
operators specify completely the services

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.230
and also the phone functionalities.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.300
That is, with other operators,
we exactly define the

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.490
layout of the phones,
the functionality that's inside,

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.630
the keyboard, everything,
so that the users exactly know

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:25.040
from an ergonomic point of
view how to operate this phone,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.800
which is not always the case
with very sophisticated phones.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.090
The idea behind that is to make it very
simple for everyone to use the services.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.940
So far we have mostly 10% of
our clients that have shifted

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.240
to iMODE since we launched it.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.390
And finally, well that is the topic
of the presentation,

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.610
we launched with this one,
we launched the video services

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.450
end of May of this year.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.490
So back on iMOD in a few words.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.720
It is a technology that
is licensed from NTT.com.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.280
We deployed it in 2000 in Japan.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.820
It is licensed to, I think,
approximately 10 operators worldwide,

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.820
mostly in Europe and one in Australia.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.580
It has 42 million users,
so it's quite important.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:24.790
Well, maybe 40 million in Japan,
but it's increasing overseas.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.700
I think there is a
problem with the slides,

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.610
something that comes again.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.610
Concerning the network,

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.960
For packet data, we use GPRS.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.640
That is,
we have throughputs in the range of 40

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.680
kilobits per second in the downlink and
20 kilobits per second in the uplink.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.850
It is the best effort network.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.080
That is, well,
if you don't have any radio resource,

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.820
then you have to wait a little bit.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:00.470
And most of that,
you also have the fact that

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.280
voice may be primitive over data.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.470
That is, that if a lot of people
want to place phone calls,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.600
then you have to wait for your content.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.760
Handsets is a big limitation today.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:23.500
Most of the JPRS handsets are 3+1,
that is they can support 30 kilobits

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.900
in the downlink and 10 in the uplink.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.650
It's a little less than the
theoretical throughput available.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:36.070
For the IMOD onsets,
we specified that they should

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.820
support 3GP file format.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.930
That is for the video,
they use H.263 on MPEG-4 video

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:52.530
codecs in resolution SQCIF,
that is 176 by 144 pixels.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.560
Joseph Kucif.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:58.040
And for the audio, we use two codecs,
one dedicated to voice,

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:01.200
which is IMR that comes
from the GSM world,

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.250
and the other one which is AAC.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:14.340
We have a very simple data
protection for Wordlock.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:18.500
It's very simple but still very
efficient because we specify

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.500
the phone in a manner that the
content can't go outside the phone.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.710
So even that very weak protection is
enough to convince the content provider

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.500
to be confident in the technology.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:40.100
And from the recording point of view,
we have found we're equipped

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.490
with camera so that we can send a
video as an attachment to email.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:56.340
So if we look at-- there are
two constraints when you design

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.330
video clips for mobile phones.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.840
One constraint is the time
that people have to wait

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.000
before they can see the clip.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:09.240
That is, if I go onto a website,
I click on the URL for the clip.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:13.810
If I wait more than 30 seconds,
then I don't wait more than 30 seconds.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.890
I quit.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.740
We made some tests two years ago,
and that was a conclusion

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.390
for 90% of the users.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.520
When we combine this constraint
with the fact that we have a very

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.600
limited throughput on the network,
we end up with a constraint on the file

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.300
size that is approximately 100 kilobytes.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.760
And if you look at the table,
then you can see that the

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.680
download duration time on
Edge is approximately between 20,

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.220
30 seconds.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.500
And the upload duration
is more important.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.710
It's 80 seconds.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.560
One thing interesting to see is that
the phones today are not operated

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.040
by a multitask operating system.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.440
So when I download a
clip from the website,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.320
well, I wait,
but I can't do anything else.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.890
If I sent an email with
a video attachment,

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:06.830
it's the same problem.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.400
So from a user perspective,
it's very problematic,

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.600
and we have to find some solution.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.660
And one solution is you
increase the bandwidth,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.810
so you go to Edge,
and then you have shorter

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.990
upload/download time.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.380
And that is the way we're going to.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:33.350
We also have a problem with video quality
because if we have very small files,

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:38.270
if we want to have a duration
acceptable that is in the range of 15,

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:41.470
20 seconds to give the users
a piece of information,

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.800
not only a still image,
then we can't have

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.180
video bitrate very high.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.700
We are in the range between
32 to 64 kilobits per second.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.780
I will show you later on what is the
type of quality that we can have on very

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.300
hard content that is on football games,
for instance.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:07.440
If we look at video mail services,
it's a service very intuitive

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.260
because it's like an email.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:16.510
You just shoot video with your phone,
and then you open the email.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.420
Email client on the phone,
you put the video as an

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.940
attachment and you sent it.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.100
Very clever, very simple.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:27.120
Or if you have the
authorization to do so,

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.620
if the video that you downloaded
from the web is not a lot,

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.830
then you can forward it to someone else.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.530
I said iMod is reusing some
technologies existing on the web,

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:45.540
so what is good with that is that
you can address any email on the web,

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.640
so almost everybody.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.090
And also you can address
some MMS recipient if you

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.100
have their phone number.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.860
There is in fact a getaway into the
network that makes some translation

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.850
between the email format and the MMS.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:08.240
On the recipient side, well,
you could have different case.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.520
If it is inside an iMod network,
then it's very easy.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.960
There is no problem.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:16.680
If we talk to an OMS client,
that's what I talked about.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:21.100
And if you talk to someone
on a PC on a fixed network,

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.920
then you can look at the video using,
for instance, QuickTime,

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.480
which is very easy to get.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.090
Video download is the other service.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.700
So it's HTTP download.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.260
It has a little overhead
during the transportation,

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:44.200
so we had to think about that when
we look at how to charge the content.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:51.540
And it's very important because
the users pays for transport.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:58.400
Here I put different captures
in order to show you the steps.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:02.980
The idea is when I go
onto the iMODE portal,

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:08.260
there is-- maybe I'll show you in a
moment-- there is a touch on the keypad.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.780
And the keypad, if you press it,
you just go onto the website.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.210
And this is the portal
you see on the left.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:23.040
And then it's very
similar to web navigation.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.820
So I'm going to show you a video clip.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.750
If we can switch to the camera.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.060
We can put the light a little down.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:57.360
I will play it again before
making some comments.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.490
So as I mentioned, there is a fixed--

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.730
You can see the length of the video here.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.040
Well, it's a little better on
the screen of the phone,

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.590
because there is
degradation in the process.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.210
But there you can see the size.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.630
Well,
you have duration of about 12 seconds.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.820
It's a video clip encoded
at 64 kilobits per second.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.890
And there is no audio on it.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:25.290
So that gives you an idea of the
kind of quality you can have.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.560
That type of content is
very hard to encode because,

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.150
well, there is the grass with
a lot of tiny details.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.580
There is a lot of moving objects
that are the players and also

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.590
some small objects like the ball.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:50.790
So you end up in having
that type of quality.

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:53.680
Could we switch back to the other,
please?

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.930
So if we look at how all that is charged,
we have on iMOD something very simple.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.390
Well, at least in the beginning
it was very simple,

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:12.960
but it's very hard to live
with it while it evolves.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.090
It is simple in the fact that
we charge one cent by kilobyte.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:22.080
So if you just make email, that's right,
because an email is something

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.940
in the kilobyte range,
two or three kilobytes.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:33.100
And when you start to download files
that are in the range of 100 kilobytes,

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.960
then it makes you something
like a euro or a dollar,

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.000
which is approximately
the same for a video,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.290
and starts to be really expensive.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.740
And on top of that,
the economic model that the content

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:52.780
provider want to use is the same
as the Ringtone economic model that

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.160
is they want to charge for a video.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.420
So if you subscribe for a month,
and during that month you

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.730
could get a number of videos,
and at the moment it's in the

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.590
range of two to five videos.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:14.800
So I will talk a little
bit about content creation.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.900
Some consequences of the
file size that we have.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:24.190
Since it is very limited,
then we need to work on the video.

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:29.000
And while it's not our job,
but we have to help the content

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:31.100
providers to work on that.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:36.220
The story about this is, in iMOD,
we have content providers

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.150
coming from a reasons that
are very different from video.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:45.570
We have people making newspapers,
we have people selling ringtones,

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.820
and all of a sudden they want to
put some video on their websites.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.180
And we have to tell them, well,
if you want to do so,

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.700
you have to use such tools,
you have to follow such rules, and, well,

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:59.050
we have to define those rules.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:05.930
So video sequence must be very simple,
that is, not too many sinkers.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.510
There might be a contradiction with
the kind of trailers that we can

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:13.980
see where everything is going very
fast and in the end you don't see

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:17.300
anything if you encode it right away.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.010
We have to also optimize the sound.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:24.500
The sound is something very -- to
which the user is very sensitive,

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.260
in fact.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.400
If you put two videos with soundtracks
encoded at different qualities,

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.340
then although they are the same,
the users will prefer the

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.220
one with the best soundtrack.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.050
So we have to live with that.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.100
And there are some contents.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.570
For instance, if you have a news,
then someone is speaking,

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.260
you can use without any
problem a voice codec.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:52.860
But if you have someone singing,
if I start to sing right now,

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.440
if I want to encode that,
then if I want to encode that,

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.040
if I use an iMarketDec,
it's the end of the world because

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.220
there will be some glitches in the
soundtrack and it's unacceptable.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:04.910
So we also have to define
how to encode that.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:11.580
And to do so, we have the AAC codec,
which also requires a higher bit wedge.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:15.110
So there is a compromise between
the amount of data that you put

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.500
into the audio and the amount
of data you have in the video.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:27.880
For the digital right management,
there are several ways to do it.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.160
At the moment,
the only tool that we have to create

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:40.610
content and to have the protection is
QuickTime Pro that completely supports

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.640
the file format defined by Entity.como.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:50.310
And while it can be seen as a limitation
for certain content providers.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.400
But it enables the protection.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:00.770
If we have a look at different
parameters we can use,

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:07.400
here there is the different profiles
optimized for duration or video quality.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:13.260
And you can see the
video quality and audio.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:19.710
I'm looking for the-- OK,
duration is there.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:24.720
So if you want a high quality
video that was the parameter

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.650
set for the football sequence,
then you encode at 64 kilobits per

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.120
second with 10 to 15 frames per second.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:35.330
That number of frames per second
is largely sufficient due to

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.080
the definition of the image.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:45.260
And you can use an IMR codec
or you can not use an ECODEC.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:50.250
if you just want to emphasize the action.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:54.610
And then if you don't mind that
much about the video or if you

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:58.010
have something very static like
head and shoulder sequence,

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.390
you can encode the video at 32
kilobits per second and you end up

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:07.160
with a duration that is twice the
duration of the high quality video.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:14.060
If you look how it works in QuickTime,
well, when you export a file,

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.000
you have a source file,
a clean source file in QuickTime.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.670
When you export it to 3GPP file format,
you have different tabs in which you

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.500
can select the format of the file.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.240
So there it's the mobile MPEG-4.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:29.200
It's the format defined by entity.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.240
It's exactly the same thing as 3GP,
except that there is

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.670
the DRM on top of it.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:43.700
You can define the definition,
also if there is a nodule tracker or not.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:43.700
And then,

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.720
You specify all your
encoded audio on the video,

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:50.100
and it's very intuitive to do it.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:53.360
So it's a really nice tool.

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.640
Well,
so all that is what can be done today.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.530
The service has just been launched,
so we don't have any

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.090
figures to provide to say,
well, it works very well,

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:08.040
or the users are really
satisfied with the quality.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:12.690
Still,
we are working to define the service

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.080
we will have in the coming years,
taking into account the

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.520
evolution of the network.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:23.740
And that's why I'm talking
about the future trends.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:29.090
Concerning the contents,
one big need is the

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.660
improved encoding tools.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:37.090
Someone yesterday mentioned the fact
that MPEG-2 is now all standard,

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.840
that improves every day
in coding efficiency.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:49.010
MPEG-4 has hit the market very recently,
so we evaluated a few tools

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:53.780
and we have similar results,
but we think it could be really improved

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.940
by the use of two-pass encoding,
for instance,

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.680
better analysis of the sequences.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:04.610
And also we think that the encoder,
the core of the encoder will also evolve.

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.430
We hope so.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:10.140
We hope there will be
a lot of progress done.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:16.420
Then we can increase the file
size in order to have longer

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.710
clips or to increase the quality.

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:23.120
So here there is a trade-off,
what the users in the end want.

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:30.160
And it's not a very easy question because
depending on how we charge the content,

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:36.790
what if I charge one euro for ten
seconds of video and if I charge

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:42.410
two euros for ten seconds of video,
but with a file that is twice the size,

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:46.550
then maybe the users,
although the video quality is better,

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:47.680
they won't understand.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.510
So we really have a problem
of how to charge the content.

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:03.420
Then what you saw on the phone is
a phone with a QVGR resolution.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.840
So you put a QC content on QVGR.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.040
You can zoom it.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.250
You can make it full screen.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:14.970
But then you have some artifacts
due to the extrapolation.

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:18.890
One interesting thing would
be to increase the image

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:22.710
definition in the 3GP file.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.830
If you do that,
then if you go from QC to QVisio,

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:31.910
then the surface of the image is doubled,
mostly doubled.

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:34.440
It means that if you want
to keep the same quality,

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.460
you have to double the file size.

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.570
So it's a never-ending problem.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.180
Whatever you change,
you have to improve something.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:45.600
So we can look at the encoding tools.

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:48.240
We can also look at the codecs.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:53.980
There is the H.264 MPEG-4
AVC that is being introduced.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:58.410
There has been some
press release and so on.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:04.300
We should gain from that
50%. For the same quality,

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:09.480
we should gain 50%. But we are waiting
for something working for mobile phones,

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.410
because we have the encoder
problem and also the availability

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.850
of colleagues for the phones.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:22.800
And then another improvement
could be the use of AAC+, where

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:27.650
we could achieve higher audio
quality for half the bandwidth.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.590
So also an improvement we're waiting.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.180
For the content,
there are two evolutions.

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:45.990
One is progressive download,
because as mentioned earlier,

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.990
If my file size is too long,
and if I have to wait until the

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:54.080
end of the file size is downloaded,
then maybe that waiting time

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.120
is too long for me and I quit.

00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:00.160
So the idea with progressive download
is to start downloading the file,

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.110
and as soon as there is
enough data into the buffer,

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.080
start playing it.

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:10.020
So this improves the user
experience with a click and play.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.630
I click, it plays.

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:15.350
And it allows encoding of some
contents with higher bitrate than the

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:17.950
available throughput on the network.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.520
So that's very interesting if we want
to increase the quality of the image.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.900
Then the other way is to look
at streaming for video on

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.490
demand or for live channels.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:39.080
It's possible today,
but one limitation is that if

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:42.350
we have one user streaming at 40
kilobits per second in a cell,

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:45.170
then it might be the only
GPRS user in the cell.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.770
So it's a strong

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:52.620
And it will be possible more
easily when Edge is deployed and,

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.340
of course, UMTS.

00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:02.340
A problem with that is we need to
introduce new elements in the network.

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.150
We need to introduce streaming server.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.290
We need to define an architecture that is

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:12.910
That is good, both for us and for
the content providers,

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:16.930
because there are big content
providers like TV channels.

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:19.580
They can host streaming at home.

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.490
But there are small content providers.

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.890
We doubt that they will be
able to put the money and the

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:29.430
knowledge to make the investment
of the money and the knowledge.

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:30.730
So we have a big problem.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.820
So that is the where.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.540
The Omni is also in the range of this.

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.260
It's also the same kind of problem.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:46.940
A big argument that is often given,
the argument is, well,

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:50.060
if you put some streaming,
if you have live streaming,

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:53.560
it is for specific events
like a football match.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.630
That is, when there is a football match,
you will send SMS to

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:01.360
the users and you say,
well, there has been a goal.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.140
And what you expect is that everybody
is going to go to the streaming

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.170
server and make some requests.

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.960
And if the dimensioning of
the network is not good,

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.700
then you have a big problem.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.480
It doesn't work.

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:20.100
So, how many is something very,
very difficult to resolve.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.480
One last point is,
one of the last point is the

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.390
interoperability problem,
as was mentioned in the

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:26.920
previous presentation.

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.290
You can have,
you can find a lot of brands of

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:33.820
streaming server that may not
be interoperable between them.

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:37.820
And we have to be sure that
the day we launch the service,

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:41.690
we don't have any problem with that
because the user won't understand.

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:51.640
And last evolution about the
content is how we charge it.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.070
Well, I talked a little about that.

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.690
So if we increase the file size,
then automatically the price

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:04.600
tend to increase with the
business model we have today.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:07.690
Another problem might come
from the standard bodies,

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:12.190
because if you read
into the 3GPP standards,

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:16.550
then the MPEG-4 profile that
is used is limited in bitrate.

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.920
And theoretically,
we could not go beyond that bitrate today

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:22.280
with what we have in the specification.

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.190
So we have a problem.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.980
It might not be a problem because
with the phone I show you,

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.770
you could put video with higher bitrate.

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:34.980
So we just could say, well,
we don't mind.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:38.560
Except if one day we have a
manufacturer that says that,

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:44.930
well, it was not in the specification and
I can't support 128 kilobit per second.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:52.610
For content providers,
we have a problem of compatibility.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:56.280
That is,
if I launch a terminal today that

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.310
supports a certain amount of codecs,

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:06.040
And one year after I start
to ship H.264 terminals,

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:11.160
then a content provider,
what it will do is it will say, well,

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.200
I have one encoding chain.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.520
I will shift my encoding chain to H.264.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.760
And for the guys who bought
a phone one year ago,

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.060
then it doesn't work anymore.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.850
And we have to deal with that.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:28.030
And every time we think about the
specification of future phones,

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:29.500
we keep that in mind.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:41.320
So also the content creation
tools are important.

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:45.210
I talked about increasing
the performance of them.

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:52.020
There is also the fact how to manage
different profiles for different phones.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:01:01.020
The last point we foresee as a
big problem is the DRM aspects.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:06.220
There are already a lot of phones on
the market shipping with memory cards.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.340
And on those phones,
DRM is not always handled properly.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:16.530
And we have to be very careful about that
because without any protection solution,

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:22.990
there is no content
provider that follows.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:28.200
The future trends and difficulties
that we will have to face as operators

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:34.690
and also as providers of solutions
for encoding and terminal solutions,

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:35.560
for instance.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.640
Okay.

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:38.430
Thank you.
