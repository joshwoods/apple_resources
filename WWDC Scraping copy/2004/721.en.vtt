WEBVTT

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.880
Okay, let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.560
Welcome to session 721,
Mobile Success Stories.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.010
We have three great presenters for
you here today with great stories

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.160
to tell in the mobile space.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.080
We have Jean-Philippe Fournier
from Bouygues Telecom.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.340
We have Alec Hendry from MTV Europe.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.700
And we have Pierre Barbau from Sprint.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.800
So with that,
I would like to first introduce

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.690
Jean-Philippe Fournier.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.690
And I will try and work the clicker.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.750
So with that, I'll give this to you.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.900
Okay.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.990
Thank you.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.640
Good afternoon.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.830
I'm Jean-Philippe Fournier
working for the Department for

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.540
New Technologies at Bouygues Telecom.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.750
For those who attended
the previous session,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.160
I'll try not to be too repetitive on
some slides that my colleague presented.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.540
A few words about Bouygues Telecom
for those who might not know.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.740
We are a GSM French mobile carrier.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.820
We have six million customers.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.030
GSM GPRS network is available
nationwide in France.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.340
So we achieved 99% population coverage.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.140
And for those of you who travel
to Europe and have a GSM phone,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.280
you might know what's
nationwide coverage.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.100
The feeling of a nationwide coverage
is pretty different than here.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.190
We launched iMode in 2002 and
we happen to be the largest

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.540
iMode carrier outside Japan.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.210
With 700,000 iMode users,
that's a mark that we reached this week.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.090
We are preparing an Edge network rollout.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.110
I'll say a few words later on
in the presentation about it.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.400
And we are not a public company,
we are a subsidiary of a group,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.100
the Bouygues Group,
which is a unique combination of a telco,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.400
a mobile carrier, and a media company.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.530
In the Bouygues Group, you have TF1,
which is the largest TV channel

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.670
in France and Europe.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.400
You have subsidiaries
of TF1 or Eurosport.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.270
If you want to look at the Super Bowl,
if you're in Europe,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.400
then you'll definitely
switch to Eurosport.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.400
It's a Europe-wide sports channel.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.390
We also operate satellite TV channels.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:19.390
We have a satellite TV bouquet with
about 16 channels belonging to TF1

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.400
and many other media activities.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.230
A few words about the
mobile market in France.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.040
Two major players, Orange and SF4,
are competing with us.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.960
SF4 is about to become
Vodafone later this year.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.460
On the left side you'll see the
market share for voice users.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.370
So you see that Orange is
the largest mobile courier in

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.510
France with about 50% market share.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.690
SFR has 30% and both couriers
SFR and Orange began operations

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.320
in 1991 whereas we began in 1996.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.980
That's why the difference mainly.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.170
We have then about a 20%
market share for voice users.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.980
On the right side of the slides
I presented the data only subscriptions.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.960
What's interesting is that despite
the fact that we are the smallest

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.620
courier regarding data services
we have a pretty good market

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.690
share and very good penetration.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.170
It's a fair competition between Orange,
SFR and us on these services.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.150
One of the main reasons we could
achieve as a small courier to

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.360
play an equal game with R-Range
and SFR is that we rely on iMode,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.800
which gives us possibilities we
could not expect to have on our own.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.520
So a few words about iMode
is that it's been launched,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.920
of course, in Japan by Docomo in 2000,
I guess, maybe not accurate,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.800
but 2000 or 2001.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.800
That was the first data services
offering that has been popular.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.440
And during the time that
European couriers were

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.550
struggling with the web services,
Docomo was doing very,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.800
very well in Japan.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.270
And they have now tens of millions
of subscribers in Japan only.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.400
So iMode services have expanded overseas.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.540
They've been rolled out by nine couriers
around the world and outside Japan.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.180
And more couriers are joining every year.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.040
And all these couriers formed
a group called the Alliance.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.040
Which aim is to specify and to
maybe adjust the iMode systems to

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.070
adapt it to their local markets.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.150
iMode is based mainly on the clear
separation of the roles between

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.690
content providers and carriers.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.030
The point we want to be clear on is
that we are not a content provider.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.790
We don't want to provide our
customers our own content.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.440
We can't do it.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.510
It's not our job.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.450
And iMOD relies on standard
technologies that we like:

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.380
HTML, email.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:57.110
So no MMS,
no telecom originated standards.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.510
A few words about the iMode ecosystem,
why iMode is pretty

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.160
well working in Europe.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.500
The customer is of course
center of the place,

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.400
the central role.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.890
And we as a courier, we

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.050
Allow the content providers to
distribute their contents to the

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.490
end users through our network.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.890
That's just what we do.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.790
We don't do any content creation.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:35.370
We don't host any content
providers or we don't host any of

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.190
our own content on our servers.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:45.870
It's really,
we are offering a pipe for people to web,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.090
to browse iMode sites.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.090
That's all.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.510
But we are trying to do it our best.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.320
One thing where we are pretty good at
and where we are trying to help our

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.850
content providers is that we have a
unique relationship to our customers.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.960
Our customers get a bill from us, by us,
each month,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:21.470
so they know who their carrier is
and at this point we have also a huge

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.690
Customer Care and
Customer Relationship Department.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.700
So that's one of our strengths.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.160
And we want to allow
the content providers,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.050
big ones or small ones,
to benefit from this.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:54.900
[Transcript missing]

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.820
The iMOD model is pretty clear.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:02.080
We share the content providers
get 86% of the subscription fees.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.420
So a typical subscription fee is about
between one and three euro a month.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.190
So if you want to get weather
for your location in France,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.920
then you would pay one euro a month
to a weather content provider.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.230
So that's pretty fair.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.180
And we pay back 86% of this one
euro to the content providers.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:32.190
And we keep the money
for the packet traffic.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:44.160
So the key for success of our
iMode services is that through

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.620
iMode we have the ability to
specify and to adjust handset

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.500
specifications to our local market.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:58.930
That's something that our
competitors are beginning to do.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:05.970
For example,
you see Vodafone is working more and more

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.940
closely with their handset providers,
which give them the

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.760
ability to do so as well,
to control the handsets,

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.150
control the features, and to specify,
for example,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.080
the file formats they want to use.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.240
It guarantees for the end users,
it guarantees a consistent

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.230
experience throughout,
across all the handsets

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.800
that they could buy from us.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.320
So you get for example on each iMode
handset you have a hard key which is

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.800
always the same place on the handset
and you'll find it on any iMode handset.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:53.700
So if I change my handset, if I upgrade,
I'll still find the same navigation menu,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.800
always the same ergonomics.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.800
So we want to keep it
simple for end users.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:06.800
And most of them don't have PCs at home
so that's maybe their unique data device.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.960
So we really want to make it a very
simple experience so that they can enter

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.770
the data world as easily as possible.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800
Thank you.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:25.310
Something very important for
our content providers is that we

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:30.300
guarantee the content providers
that their content will look exactly

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.300
the same across all our handsets.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.300
I was discussing this with Alec
from MTV right before the session.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.960
If MTV gives us a picture,
then we guarantee them that the

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:47.600
same picture will look exactly the
same on our latest handsets and on

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.290
the handset that we launched two
years ago when we launched iMode.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:57.300
So that's a burden that the content
providers don't have to take care of.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:03.300
And they pretty much appreciate
the homogeneity of iMode handsets.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.300
That, of course, reduces drastically the
content productivity.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.490
It reduces the production costs for them
so they can concentrate on their job,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.300
which is mainly produce content.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:21.260
And that's building the
success for our data services.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.940
One word about the content providers.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.260
Copyright Control Management:
iMode has a very simple but very

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.700
efficient feature which allows a
content provider to protect its content.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.680
And we ensure the content provider that
the content won't go out of the phone.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.690
It's stuck.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.690
As soon as you download a picture,
for example,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.390
and the content provider protects it,
then you won't be able to take it

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.680
out through infrared or Bluetooth.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.630
A list,
a non-exhaustive list of iMODE services.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.640
What you'll find are pretty
interesting and practical information.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.800
You'll find weather, you'll find news,
you'll find finance,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.800
stock quotes for those interested in it.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.800
You'll find real-time traffic
information for Paris.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.350
For those who know Paris,
that might be very interesting

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.150
to have this information
next time you come to France.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:33.320
There are more than 250 services
and there are more than 200 content

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.490
providers working with us on iMODE.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:45.400
We offer also Java-based services.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:50.460
We're using the slightly different
version of Java from Docomo,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.530
which name is Doja,
but has almost the same

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.850
capabilities than Java.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:15.600
[Transcript missing]

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:24.560
We've just launched video
services beginning of June.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.840
Of course, it's MPEG-4 based.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:36.720
That's why we are here working with
QuickTime and Apple because all the

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.230
iMode handsets that are supporting
videos are using the standard,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.190
supporting the standard.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.560
You can download,
it's a download service,

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.710
so you can download 100
kilobytes of video on our portal.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.840
Clips are approximately 15 seconds long.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:04.830
And you can then, oh that's video mail,
sorry.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.110
Maybe I'll go through.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.360
Yeah, video clip download.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:15.210
So you can download clips that
are 100 kilobytes long and the

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:21.190
duration is approximately 15 seconds.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:31.140
And the users pay for a subscription,
pays a subscription fee to be able to

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:37.180
download three or four or five clips each
month from the same content provider.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.600

In addition to the subscription,
the users pay traffic,

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.810
1 euro cent per kilobyte.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:58.090
So, we've been trying to help our content
providers to make the best videos

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.400
for our video download service.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:10.810
And we've been giving them guidelines,
tools to help them encode

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:16.400
efficiently their content
into our MPEG-4 file format.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.700
And that's why we recommended
QuickTime Pro for all

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.400
our content providers.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:33.950
Because we found it's a very simple
and easy to use tool that also

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:42.530
allows directly to set the content
protection feature supported by iMode.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.130
Video mail.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:52.960
Besides video download,
you can capture a movie on your phone and

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:59.080
send it through email as an attachment
to any compatible phone or to any

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.130
email address you want on the web.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:07.150
On the other side,
the Mac user or the PC user just

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:16.030
needs to have QuickTime installed on
his desktop and can see your movies.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:31.300
[Transcript missing]

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.950
The first network is GSM with
very limited data support.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.780
It evolves to GPRS.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.350
That's what we've deployed and now we
are There are two after GPRS deployment.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:50.020
There are two alternatives You can
go either for a network upgrade and

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:56.090
go for edge or you can go for whole
completely new network that is UMTS

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:05.740
So you have two options,
Edge versus UMTS or 3G.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:18.100
So to have a better throughput
than with the current GPRS network,

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.700
you have to deploy one
of these two networks.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:31.280
UMTS networks offer very high capacity,
pretty high speeds, but there's a but.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:38.010
They assume a huge upfront deployment
cost because it's a brand new network.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.890
You have to deploy
your network from zero.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.880
You can't just upgrade your radio sites.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:50.050
You have to make new radio sites and you
have to build new hardware on top of it.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.940
To give you an idea,
if we are to deploy a 3G

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:04.580
UMTS network in France,
we have to pay 6 billion euros,

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:04.580
6 billion.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.160
A bit more than six
billion dollars for it.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:17.160
That's exactly what our GSM,
the whole GSM network cost to us about

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.200
six years ago when we deployed it.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:29.200
So that's something that's
still very money demanding.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:35.230
The problem is with,
if you go today for a 3G deployment,

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.300
you have very few,

00:19:37.300 --> 00:21:13.000
[Transcript missing]

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.210
That's something that might
make a huge difference in the

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.830
first years of UMTS deployment
between us and our competitors.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.760
That's our strength.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:35.390
So, of course, UMTS is an option for us,
but in a few years from now,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:41.310
we expect to increase our revenues
first using the edge network,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:50.370
and then we'll think again what
we'll be doing for a UMTS deployment.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.370
A table where a few of
the main features of,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.980
compared features of 3G, UMTS and Edge.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.590
So the bandwidth is

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:12.700
For the first deployments of 3G is 128
kbps what you'll get in a radio cell.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:22.590
It will evolve of course up to
384 kbps that might evolve in

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.700
the next month or next years.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:31.690
But on the edge side you will
get 200 kbps from the first

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.560
day the edge is deployed.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.790
The coverage, as I said,
for 3G is more focused on

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:44.200
metropolitan areas because of the
huge investment to deploy the network,

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.000
whereas Edge will be
available nationwide.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.790
And the handsets,
that might still be an issue

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:56.830
for 3G carriers because
they're still pretty expensive.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.990
They're new.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.000
It's a brand new network,
brand new technologies.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.760
So, as you know,
brand new technologies are

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.000
sometimes difficult to start with.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.330
So, they're pretty expensive
this time as well.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:20.100
Whereas for Edge,
only asks for a radio upgrade of

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:27.610
the handsets and you can use your
today's very stable GPRS handsets

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.920
and upgrade them to Edge.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.840
If you're a handset
manufacturer of course.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:44.860
Multimedia Services Evolutions:
What we will use Edge for is to

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.160
allow for longer video clips,
better quality.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.430
You will be able to have larger pictures,
larger videos.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:24:00.570
You will be able to go from QCIF to QVGA.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.870
Video streaming is also an alternative
on which we are currently working.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.300
And of course,
you might as well increase the quality

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.700
together with picture size and duration.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.500
You'll be able to allow higher bit
rates for your video and codes.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:31.630
An alternative we are also
looking at is MPEG-4 H264 support,

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:36.830
also called AVC,
something we are currently looking at to

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.070
reduce the bandwidth for a given quality.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:48.730
And something that we see
coming also is stereo handsets.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.720
You'll get a better audio but
also you'll have a two-channel

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.490
sound on the coming handsets.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.160
So for us it requires more
network bandwidth to download

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.500
two channels instead of one.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:13.640
So for example currently we play,
if you're using an AAC device, mono,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:19.490
you are able to download 32
kbps encoded audio files.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.500
But with stereo you have
the simplicity to double it.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.720
The future?

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.210
Today we speak about download services.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.220
We're speaking for tomorrow
about streaming services that

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.500
might allow you to see real-time
video coming to your phone.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.050
But there's also another path to
follow which is broadcast networks

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.000
are coming to mobile handsets.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:57.310
That's something that we will see
happening in the next two years.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:03.670
There's a standard that's been
specified currently which name is DVBH,

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.500
Digital Video Broadcast for Handhelds.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.400
And that's a possible candidate for
these mobile broadcast networks.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:18.500
The point for us is we make
money using video download.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.000
We make money using video streaming.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
We make money using video streaming
on our networks because the packets

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.990
simply goes through our pipes,
our network.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:34.450
The day that the broadcast network
will be on and you'll be able

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:40.000
to watch TV on your handsets,
it might change two things.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:49.000
The first one is that our users might
not download the videos from our website.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
But our iMode site does.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.880
But rather watch it
directly on the TV channels.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:01.130
And the other one is also since
customers will spend more time

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:07.500
watching TV on their phones,
revenues will, they will spend less time

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.000
using our iMode services.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
So that's something today that
we see as a possible threat.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
But we also see this as a
very exciting alternative.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.970
And a very exciting way of
expanding business for us.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
We just need to find new business models.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
But we're sure we'll find some
interesting ways to use it.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.150
A few words about what
we're doing with QuickTime.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.260
So as I said,
QuickTime Pro has been recommended

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.700
for MPEG-4 content creation
because of its ease of use,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:47.900
first of all.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.900
It has a very large audience
as an MPEG-4 player.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:28:00.010
If you receive a video mail sent from
an iMode handset on your PC or Mac,

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.900
it's always better if you have
QuickTime to be able to read it.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.890
That's why it's a
player of choice for us.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:15.000
It's an inexpensive encoder that
does a very good job compared to

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.150
some very more expensive encoders.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.900
And of course, it's a free player.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.980
Thank you, Apple.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:29.380
And it has this nice feature
that our content providers love,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:36.550
that is they can protect their
content using this MPEG-4 encoder.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:43.220
We are also evaluating with time
streaming architecture because

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.420
streaming might be a service that we
could roll out on an edge network.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:54.170
We found out it's a highly
interoperable solution.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.900
For example,
we can stream videos in PIC4 format

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.900
on these small Nokia handsets.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.580
It's not an Apple handset
and it's not a Nokia server,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.900
so that's things that we just love.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.350
Before this,
you had to buy a packet video

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.900
streaming server and a packet
video client on your handsets.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.570
something that's not
always very easy to do.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.940
It's a very reliable hardware platform.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:31.460
I won't tell you too much about this,
but I'm pretty sure you agree.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.600
And it's a telco-grade architecture.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.040
What's next with QuickTime?

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.890
Of course,
we'd love to evaluate the first MPEG-4,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.890
MPEG-264 and CADRs from QuickTime as
soon as they're on the market.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:56.110
And something we could work
together on also is DVB-H digital

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.640
video broadcast is coming.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.900
DVB-H is an IP-based broadcast network.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:11.750
So the hardware you would use to
operate a DVB-H network is pretty

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:19.880
close to what you're using today to
stream video on a cellular network.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.510
So QuickTime could be the
architecture we might use to

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.900
operate these kind of networks.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.900
And also, I think,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.540
Since TF1 is one of our sister
companies in the Bouygues Group,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:42.450
they are very much focused
on TV and they are promoting

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.300
very heavily HDTV in France.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:54.300
And their point is to go for MPEG-4
AVC or MPEG-264 for HDTV very soon.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:31:00.250
And for them it's also very interesting
to have the same end-cutters,

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:08.300
the same tools ranging from
HD broadcasts down to mobile broadcasts.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:13.810
So these are directions
we would love to go into,

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:18.300
to look into with our Apple fellows.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.300
Okay, that's it.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.150
Thank you.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.110
Thank you, Jean-Philippe.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.440
Next, we're going to invite Alec
Hendry to come up and speak.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.440
Excuse me.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:45.010
He will speak about his experience as
a content provider in the mobile space.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.680
Thanks, it's great to be here today to
show you some of the services we're

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.100
offering in the UK for MTV Mobile.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.560
We're doing quite a lot of
different stuff which I'm hoping

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.100
you'll find quite interesting.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.280
I'm going to show you some of
the different services we've got,

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.100
give a quick overview of some
of the mobile technology,

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.730
but I think we've covered some of that
already so I'll try and skip through

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.100
that to get through the session.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.100
Mobile usage, what people are doing
with mobile in the UK,

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.930
and then try and move on to some of
the more new technologies we're doing

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.100
with video production for 3G services.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.900
So I'm the operations manager for
MTV UK in Ireland and I look after

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:27.270
the services we run on websites,
interactive TV and mobile phones.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.350
In MTV Europe,
we've got a wide set of distribution

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.440
across the regions and we've got
multiple genre channels so we can

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.400
quite target specific audiences
with different tastes of music.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.180
It's actually grown since last week
when we bought some new music stations.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.430
But there's around 27 different
music feeds across Europe,

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.700
all originating from London,
and with different regions around

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.370
Europe contributing local feeds.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.290
It's actually nine specific to the UK,
so we've got quite a big task

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:02.840
dealing with our music channels:
MTV Hits, MTV Two, MTV Bass, Dance, TMF,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.870
VH1, VH1 Classic and the
newest of which is VH2.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.950
And we're in just under 120
million households across Europe,

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.500
so we've got a really wide distribution.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.610
So anything we do on
air with our promotions,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.050
we can really target mobile users
by discussing our services on air.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.550
I'm having to look at the screen
by the way because I've left

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.100
my glasses back in England and
I can't see that one down there.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.250
We offer quite a wide range
of multi-platform services.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:37.100
Currently the latest statistics are that
53% of UK homes have digital services

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.100
to receive their TV transmissions.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.100
Whether that's on digital satellite,
which is the predominant platform,

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.550
digital cable,
and the most recent platform

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.970
which is digital terrestrial,
which is on a free view service and

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:53.300
has about 4 million viewers on digital
terrestrial and that was a real drive

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.100
over Christmas on set-top boxes.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.140
It's a crowded music market.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.100
There's 25 different music
channels in the UK alone,

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.100
9 of which are MTV.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.100
So we have a real tough time
competing in the market.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.470
So the interactive services
we offer are kind of a big

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.100
differentiator to our competitors.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:17.070
I think it's only the Skype platform
who have their own things.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.100
We also have three music channels
which also have interactive services.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.440
We also use it to extend the viewing
experience so we're not just targeting

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.640
people who are sat in front of the TV,
but they can go away with their

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.080
phone or go online afterwards
after they're watching the channel

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.100
and interact with MTV that way.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.100
So we've got various websites
for the different channels.

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:41.810
We've got a very advanced
interactive TV service that

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.880
lets people enter competitions,
read the latest news,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.400
all while they're sitting
there watching the TV.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.390
And we've got games.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.490
There's one in the middle there,
Seymour's Turbo Couch,

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.400
which you actually play over the videos
while you're watching the channel.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.550
And on the end there is our
Ringtones app that lets people,

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.800
while they're watching the TV,
find out about what ringtones we've

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.710
got available and they can text
straight off the screen and receive

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.400
their ringtone to their phone.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.390
And a whole range of mobile services
which I'll go in depth with in a moment.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.710
I think we've covered
the main technologies.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:19.250
In the UK we've mainly got GSM, GPRS,
WAP, and 3G services are just

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:23.400
sort of starting and some
interesting stuff happening there.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.230
Data speeds, which is a bit ridiculous,
but it shows the fact that the 3G

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.910
services are way ahead and we can
do some really fun stuff with video.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.510
There's over 50 million
mobile subscribers in the UK,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.840
so it's got quite high
penetration across the UK region.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.280
There's six major network operators,
so it's quite a competitive market.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:50.240
There's Orange, O2, T-Mobile,
Virgin Mobile, Vodafone,

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:57.110
and the newest of which is Three,
which is a dedicated 3G service provider.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.990
Vodafone launched a 3G data card
for business users earlier on this

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.580
year and 3 launched over a year ago.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.890
And they've now got,
the figures are probably

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.240
about a month or two old,
but around 400,000

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.110
subscribers on the 3 network.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.000
Data usage is definitely
increasing in the UK.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.750
Text messaging in the UK and across
Europe is really quite a mad phenomenon.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:25.200
In the UK alone we've got 21
billion messages sent per month

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.500
and that just keeps increasing.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:30.620
Data usage has certainly increased
after GPRS with MMS technologies

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.620
from camera phones where people
are sending their pictures around

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.500
to each other or other mobile
content such as little video clips.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.480
We've seen a kind of little resurgence
in the use of WAP because of the

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.670
increased speed you get over GPRS.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:49.500
So there's now little WAP portals that
a lot of the operators are operating.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.350
MTV have our own sort of slimmed
down version and it's currently

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.490
estimated that only around 12%
of UK mobile users are data users

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.780
so there's room for growth there.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.470
So we've kind of got a two-pronged
approach to mobile for MTV.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.830
We've got everything we
do for our on-air channel.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.560
We could do a wide range of things here.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.840
We've got voting, chat, on-screen games,
competitions and feedback.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.860
And I'll show you a quick video in a sec
which shows some of those services that

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.300
we use where people can actually interact
with what's happening on the screen.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.650
I think the first one in this
video clash where people can

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.580
actually vote which video is
going to play next on the channel.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.290
There's Matchmaker which is a
kind of interactive game where you

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.190
text your name and the person you
like and it gives you a percentage

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.040
score based on how matched you are.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.600
It's all based on numerology
but not quite sure about that.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.220
And it comes back with a little
statement about how much you're in

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.600
love with them or something like that.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.560
And you also get it sent back to your
phone at the same time so you get the

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.600
instant response and something on screen.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.600
As an example of our presenters
promoting use of a computer.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:01.600
We've got a competition and there's text
drugs and rock and roll which is on MTV2

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.600
where you can text in messages and they
appear on the screen over the program.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.600
And I'll run that now.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.030
We've had some volume?

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.950
The M-TV has shaped music
television 20 years ago,

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:34.550
and now M-TV is shaping music
television of the future.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.800
Okay, so that's just an example of a
few of the different services.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.000
I mean, they've been really successful.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.880
We've now rolled those out
all the way across Europe.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.760
Matchmaker, for instance,
there's getting around three or four

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.750
thousand SMSs an hour just in the UK,
so we've been really pleased with that.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.330
And we're just sort of extending
the Text Drugs Rock and

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.820
Roll format there into photo chat,
so you can go online to our websites,

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.380
upload your photo,
you put in your mobile number and it

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.980
stores all that information about you.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.940
And then when you text your
message into the screen,

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.670
it'll bring a little
picture up in the corner,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.380
and people seem to be really liking that.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.370
We also do subscription services via SMS,
so advertisers who we

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.140
have partnered with,
if you've opted in to receive messages,

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.830
we can send out messages
on behalf of them.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.920
We also send out mail alerts,
so when an artist that you've signed up

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.430
with comes onto TRL or one of our shows,
we'll text our audience to let

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.520
them know what's happening.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.960
We've also got sort of mentioned a
sort of products area where we're

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:33.200
doing stuff that isn't directly
affecting what happens on air.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.340
So we've got business to business deals
with most of the operators in the UK.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.960
And if we haven't,
we're in talks with them.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:44.540
So that's where we're doing video
content for various mobile portals and

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.860
providing sort of chart information.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.050
I think we provide charts to O2,
who have a digital media

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.930
player which downloads MP3s.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.260
We've also been doing deals with
handset manufacturers such as Motorola,

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.440
where we deliver content that
comes on the phone when you buy

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.430
it out of the shop directly.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.210
And then we've got our
business to consumer services.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.340
So we're selling ringtones
off our own websites,

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:09.170
through interactive TV and
through on-air promotions.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:44:12.400
[Transcript missing]

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:40.620
So they've done really well for us.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.570
So some of the other products here,
wallpapers.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.940
So actually I've got an example
there of how we actually have to

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.460
format some of these sometimes for
the different layouts on the phones.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.840
So there's a typical jackass
wallpaper and there's some

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.870
of our MTV UK presenters.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.210
People just love to personalize
their phone with this kind of stuff

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.660
and show it off to their friends.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.840
Now I'm going to move on to sort
of more of the video content which

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.060
is the stuff that I'm having quite
a lot of fun with at the moment.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.030
And just a little montage of some of
the kind of content we're putting out on

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.350
two and a half networks and 3G phones.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:47:09.600
[Transcript missing]

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.310
So, one of the main things we've been
trying to do is create a really

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.490
good user experience by putting
little packages together of content.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.130
Reversioning some of the MTV shows,
producing specific

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.990
content for the mobile,
and it's doing really well for us.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.440
I'll just run you through some of
the packages so you can kind of

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.980
see what kind of content we offer.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.470
This is the MTV What's Hot package.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.000
This is all on 3G, these ones.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.990
It's two minutes, we do two a week.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.990
It's kind of reviews and recommendations
of new artists that are coming out,

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:20.870
new singles, what's going on tour,
fashion, hot topics.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.350
We've got the best of MTV,
which is about a minute

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.700
and a half to two minutes.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.500
We do three of these a week and
we use a lot of stuff that's

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.630
been out from the channel,
say from the previous week.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.200
So if there's a guest
that's been on a show,

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.240
we'll edit together a
little package with them,

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.710
either from the show itself
or after the show's gone out,

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:40.020
we'll do a little backstage
interview with them.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.580
So it's kind of unique content
you can only get on the phone.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:49.110
Live Lounge, which is a longer piece,
it's up to four minutes,

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.410
and we deliver around
12 of these a month.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.900
These are all exclusive
MTV Live performances,

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.320
either from our archives,
and we've got stuff going

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.770
back years and years,
or the latest performances,

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.840
either from America,
which we've licensed over to the UK,

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.650
or from our own TRL UK shows.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.610
We also do specials such as
the MTV Europe Music Awards,

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.820
the MTV Video Music Awards,
basically any awards that are going.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.510
There's always something fun happening.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.460
And probably the most updated
one is the MTV News package,

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.800
which is a two-minute package.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.760
It goes out every day, Monday to Friday.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.680
And that normally consists
of around three news items.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.300
And I thought it would be interesting
to sort of just walk you through

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.790
how we produce some of this content.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.360
So for MTV News,
the normal MTV News team goes and

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.800
produces that on behalf of us.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.800
So they'll use the same news
format that they use on air.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.740
So to the viewer,
it's the same kind of look and feel.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800
It's the same presenter.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800
They understand what's going on.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.800
But we reshoot it in the studio just
after they've done the normal news.

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:55.800
Tighter headshot to kind
of maintain the action.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.800
And they remove a lot of the smaller
crawls and the moving backgrounds.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.630
It's recorded live,
and we get it delivered on a

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.800
DigiBeater to us to manipulate.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.290
And I've got a short clip here
that just shows that process.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.150
Now with money comes fast
cars and of course women.

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:19.610
Well, not if you're 14 years old
and known as Harry Potter.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.810
Now, what do you think was Jamilia's
favourite thing about shooting her

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:28.900
latest video of a sea in her boy's eyes?

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.080
Being in Cuba?

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.700
Nope.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.510
Loads of blokes she paid
to be in their schools.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.500
We went on set to clean up the mess.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.480
Well, just before I go,
a big happy birthday to

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.500
the delicious Kylie Blogue.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.300
I've got your present right here.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.250
That's it, I'll back you up with more
news directly to your mobile.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.770
And that generally goes out
to the viewers about 6 o'clock

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.100
each day as a single package.

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:58.100
And the actual news item,
generally the same news package

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.200
on air goes out an hour later,
so they kind of get exclusive

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.030
to their phone first.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.910
But with our other
packages that I showed you,

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:07.100
we edit all that in-house,
we do our own shooting,

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:10.100
we go out with DV and
shoot all our interviews.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.550
We use a desktop Final Cut system,
which has really impressed the

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:16.510
business because they've suddenly gone,
"Wow, you can do all of this on that

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.070
machine and we don't have to go
into Soho and spend a fortune with

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.960
an editing house." So it's a G5,
Blackmagic 10-bit uncompressed,

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.620
we come in at the highest quality we can,
because if we want to archive this

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.920
kind of content for later use,
we want to make sure we've got it

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.010
in the highest quality possible.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:36.410
And we can come in direct off DV cameras,
which means we don't have to

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:38.100
dub from one format to another.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:44.430
We use DigiBeater and SP as the main
tape source and laying off for archiving.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:46.960
I probably won't go into
this too much detail,

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.340
but you need to say we've got
to do some work to make sure the

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:53.060
content looks right on the phone,
so we've got to make sure that we

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.820
reframe the shots so that there's
not so much going on in the frame.

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.110
We try and avoid fast
cutting where possible,

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:02.790
but we have actually found with the 3G
services that the picture quality is

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:06.720
so good that we can do a lot of that
kind of MTV style zooming in action.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:11.490
One of the biggest things we do do though
is redo any titling because normally

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:15.080
if it's too small it won't show up,
so instead of it being a lower

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.290
third it's the lower half
of the screen on the phones.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.800
One of the biggest issues we've
found is the devices don't have that

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.220
much storage capacity at the moment,
so that's why we're only doing

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:25.680
two or three minute packages.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.660
The sound is not great
on the phones themselves.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.850
The speakers aren't really
designed for that kind of playback,

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.600
but if you plug in the headphones
you get pretty good audio quality.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.530
Most people don't do that when
they're showing it to their

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.950
friends and correcting video
levels to make sure it looks good.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.100
Okay, so this is a brief bit about
how we get it onto the phone.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:52.900
All our 2.5G content we encode directly
out of Final Cut using QuickTime 3G.

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.980
As I mentioned previously,
for some of the download

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:59.640
options on the 2.5 phones,
we have to make sure the file

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.600
size is quite small otherwise the
viewer has to wait quite a long

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.900
time for the file to come down.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.430
So I think we've seen a
few of these already today,

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.900
of the video rates, equivalent frames per
second and the lengths.

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.470
But T-Mobile are sort of trying
to open up that format at the

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:16.860
moment and they've sort of said,
"Let's try and see if we can

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.540
make a bigger file format to give
longer content." So we're playing

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:20.900
around with that at the moment.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:25.050
I'll try and give you a quick demo,
if we can go over to that.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:48.400
[Transcript missing]

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:12.530
So it's just weird little clips
that people seem to like to

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.690
download and show to their friends.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.520
The actual show itself is a
little bit ruder than that,

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.460
but thankfully on the phone
we've only got a little short

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.700
space of time to show stuff,
so we cut a lot of that out.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.590
If we can switch back to the slides.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.420
For three in the UK,
what they've actually done is

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.200
they've appointed BBC Technologies as
a sort of gatekeeper towards

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.690
all the content providers.

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.830
So we actually currently,
we go out as an MPEG-2 format at a

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:46.010
really high data rate and we send
that over to them and they check

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:49.700
it over for us and do the encoding
and pass it off to the phones.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.840
It's an MPEG-4 format on the
3G phones and there's a little

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.700
bit here about the differences
between the 3G and 2G content,

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.560
which I think is just basically obvious
if I show you the actual footage.

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:03.700
So I will now move on to a 3G example.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.700
There's a few different phones
in the UK for 3G at the moment.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.700
This is the sort of original one,
which is the sort of clamshell design,

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.700
quite bulky.

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.970
But this one's even bulkier.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:15.700
This is the sort of more business
phone with a little touchscreen.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.700
But the video quality on
the screen is pretty good.

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.700
So I'll try and show
you an example of this.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.710
So that's a little clip
from the news there.

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:54.920
You can see the motion is quite good.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.220
It moves along quite well.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.340
Frame rate keeps up.

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.090
Obviously these aren't streaming
from here because I can't do that,

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:09.160
but back in the UK,
you've got the choice of either

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.600
downloading it to the phone
and storing it to watch later

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.400
or streaming it in real time.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.400
And the quality comes down
at just about the same rate.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.590
Can we switch back to the slides?

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:26.380
So, what have been our main findings?

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.730
Well, we found that mobile is
integral to our viewers' lives.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.020
It's their main source of what
they get out and what they do.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.070
Most of our viewers are quite young,
they're demanding,

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:39.100
and now the scary thought is some
don't even remember a time before SMS.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:43.130
And the latest stats show that
25% of UK 7-10 year olds now

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:44.930
actually own a mobile phone.

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:50.070
We don't actively target under 16,
we can't under X-DIS rules, under Ofcom,

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:54.370
but we can't help it sometimes, you know,
they're going to text in and it's

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.570
down to their parents to make sure
they're using it in the right way.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.890
The demographic research
has been very strange.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.320
Three subscribers are generally
25 to 35 year old males.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.600
They're all downloading pop music.

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.840
So they're the kind of
people who tell everyone,

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.460
"Yeah, I really like cool music."
And then they're secretly going

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:16.600
off and downloading a bit of
Britney Spears to chill out on.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:20.240
Device constraints, we found that,
as I've mentioned before,

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.510
the sound isn't so good on the devices.

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.670
For instance, on this one,
the speaker is at the back,

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.500
so if you're looking at it,
you're not getting the

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:27.600
sound in your face.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.590
So people are using their headphones,
but they generally don't.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:33.750
So we're trying to make sure that
just the video quality is there

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:35.490
so that people can show it off.

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:39.300
They've got short attention spans,
so they don't like to sit there

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.760
and wait for it to download,
but even more so, the content itself has

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:44.900
to be quite snappy,
very visually appealing.

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.900
And thankfully that's
something we can deliver.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.900
The other very important thing we
found is the navigation to the content.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.970
It's all very well having this
great content on your system,

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.900
but if people can't get to it,
then they're never going to find it.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:00.980
So we've got our editorial team in
place who've done a lot of work to

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:05.130
work out how people in one line of
text are going to understand what

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:08.900
this content is and therefore how
they're going to go and download it.

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:11.760
The status symbols of the moment,
the phones,

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.680
they're not sort of widespread as yet.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.260
These are the two sort of
very strange looking phones,

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.700
the Nokia,
very strange fashion looking phone.

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:23.500
But they want content they
can show their friends,

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.010
they want up-to-date content,
and the kind of content you've

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.880
downloaded on the phone does make
a statement about who you are.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.960
If you've got loads of Jackass
and Daddy Sanchez clips,

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.300
then you're probably going to be
kind of a bit funky and a bit crazy,

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.320
whereas if you've got a whole
load of live lounges by Queens of

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:40.380
the Stone Age and a whole
load of other old content,

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.400
then that kind of says
something about you as well.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.100
We've done very well.

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.660
We're second only to football in the UK.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.300
There was a slide earlier
that sort of showed football

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.410
and then adult entertainment,
but thankfully we're actually beating

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.100
adult entertainment in the UK,
which is quite pleasing.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.570
The download estimates have been up.

00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:02.100
I can't give you exact figures,
can't release those,

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:06.250
but the percentage each month is just
going up and up as new subscribers

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:11.100
come on board and the awareness
of the 3G phones is happening.

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.820
It's just been announced today,
I believe,

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.100
that Orange are launching a 3G service
towards the end of this month in the UK.

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.100
Vodafone is going to be September.

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.990
So as the main operators come on board,
it's going to become

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:23.100
more and more common.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:27.100
And subscribers do seem willing
to pay for the extra content.

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.880
And we've seen a lot of requests
from other regions around the world

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:35.080
who've seen our content within
MTV and now would like to use that.

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:39.090
So we're trying to help them
build their 3G businesses.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:40.500
The future?

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.650
Well, it's standards-based and
thankfully QuickTime is

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:45.200
definitely looking towards that.

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.750
And there's a good workflow
at the moment we get out with

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.800
using Final Cut and QuickTime.

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.200
The handsets are going to get better.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.300
I mean, the biggest stumbling block seems
to be battery life at the moment.

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:57.800
I've had to change my phone
battery twice today when I've

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.000
been showing people video clips.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.500
And the storage is going to
hopefully improve as well.

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.520
As I said,
the main networks seem to be deploying

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.200
towards the end of this year in the UK.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.570
and it's going to be a big market.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.560
That's it.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:09.900
Thank you.

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:20.550
So we've talked a little bit
about professional mobile success,

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.520
mobile content,
and now I'd like to invite Pierre Barbau

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:28.130
to talk a little bit about the
success that Sprint has had with

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.100
their consumer messaging service.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.090
So with that, Pierre.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.580
Thank you, Aliza.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.220
And I'm not sure if I've
ever been in a tighter spot.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:42.440
I sit between MTV and I'm told there's
a party at the Apple campus tonight.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:48.100
So we'll try to be brief and walk through
a few of these slides here with you.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.270
Essentially,
we're here to share with you a little

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:55.100
of our learnings from picture mail and,
more importantly,

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.870
video mail as it applies to
our experiences with QuickTime.

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:02.080
And to, I hope at the end of the day,
look at the future of mobile marketing.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.320
And I hope that I leave you
with the impression that

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.710
our relationship with Apple,
and particularly around

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:12.120
the QuickTime product,
has been very helpful to

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.990
us and to our customers.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.970
Give you a sense of where the camera
phone has been and where it's going.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.020
And of course here we assume
camera and in part of these,

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:25.100
of course, our video enabled handsets.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:30.240
We got excited about what
happened last year into this year.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:34.160
Going forward,
there's a lot more growth ahead and

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.190
the side of the company I come from,
we're really focused on

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:40.110
the personal communication,
visual communication

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:41.140
aspect of our business.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:47.440
So this is really the path that we're
following in the coming few years.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.130
If you look at video
messaging as a segment,

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.910
it too has a great deal of growth ahead.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.680
We're really just
getting started in 2004,

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.460
as you can see.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:03.660
We launched our service in
November of last year and

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.370
By the end of 2009,
it's estimated there will be

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:11.200
over 30 million users in the
United States of video messaging,

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.470
handset-based video messaging.

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:17.990
In that same period,
it's expected the potential market

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.370
associated with video messaging
will reach over $2 billion.

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:29.010
So it's really something of importance
to us and we're quite committed to it.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:03:22.200
[Transcript missing]

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:26.730
This is actually a much better
improvement to my original slides,

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.200
so thanks for doing that.

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:31.200
Basically a timeline of
kind of where we've been.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.320
Launched our services in August of '02,
first camera attachment

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.200
in the United States.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.160
Arguably there were more camera
attachments launched in the

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.200
United States than perhaps
any market in the world.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.000
I'm not quite sure what caused that,
but there seemed to have

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.200
been a lot of those.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.070
We quickly followed with
our first integrated camera

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:54.200
phone in November of '02.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.190
And most of you, again,
have seen the progression from there.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.190
So now we are very much
into an integrated device.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.190
Still images,
video now are becoming one and the same.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:11.200
Become pretty much a standard
across our image capturing devices.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.430
Any questions on this?

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.430
No?

01:04:15.300 --> 01:07:16.400
[Transcript missing]

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:37.920
We have three models in the
market today that support video.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:38.180
Some of you may have some of
these just out of curiosity.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:38.180
How many of you might
have one of these models?

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:38.180
We have one customer, two.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:38.180
Okay.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:38.180
You work for the company.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:38.180
That doesn't count.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.370
I think the gee whiz here
and what really is exciting,

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:45.440
as Aliza and I talked
about some months ago,

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:52.000
is there's going to be an unprecedented
amount of personal videos taken

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.800
as a result of these devices.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.630
I think in history,
never before will there have

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:04.800
been so many personal videos
captured on an electronic device,

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.440
far beyond the camcorders
or anything like that.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:13.380
So it really presents quite an
opportunity and opens up new markets and

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.590
new ways that you can use these videos.

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:19.880
The overall experience
again has to be very tight,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.260
very integrated.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.180
Those of you who have the
Sprint camera phones will know,

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:30.240
we like to think there are some parallels
in our approach to how I think Apple does

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.170
certain things with your devices.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.410
We really spend a lot of time
and energy to make them better as

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:37.420
far as the user experience goes.

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:40.520
Everything we do we design with
the customer in mind first.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:45.090
The technology in many
instances comes second.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.510
And of course in the United States,
unlike Europe,

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.030
the presence of the personal
computer continues to play a

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:56.660
dominant role in what's going on.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:03.190
So if I look at the picture mail service,
primarily the still picture sharing,

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.200
the PC continues to be a, you know,
it's holding its own.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.580
Some people thought that by now its
share of the picture messaging would

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.700
have diminished much more than it has.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.100
I never thought that.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.700
I really believe that
it will hold its own.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.730
This comes with video, of course,
there are not a lot of video

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:26.200
phones out there to share to.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.010
So you can just imagine the
lion's share of what's being

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:32.200
shared now is done to email.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.920
So, and PC email for that matter.

01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:40.920
So, Lisa got a phone call from us,
I don't know Lisa was

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:45.380
it sometime last summer,
in that time frame, as we were preparing

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:46.870
to launch Video Mail.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:54.080
Video Mail and Picture Mail are also
off the platform by a company called

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.140
LightSurf that we work hand in hand.

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.980
They're our partner in our
design and our implementation.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.340
And as we were designing
and building the product,

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:06.900
our engineering teams were
faced with a challenge.

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:12.400
The challenge was, you know,
here we had MPEG-4 files, you know,

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.440
what clients,
what PC-based client or software

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:22.830
should we use and recommend to
customers to support the ability

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:25.000
to receive and view the videos.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:29.000
And the decision was made
really based on the product.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.810
And the decision was made really
based on the quality and the,

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:35.360
I would also say,
the willingness of Apple to

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:39.110
work with us to really,
again, go the extra step to make the user

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:43.620
experience of making it possible
to download the software better,

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.000
easier.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.950
And in turn, today when you receive a
video from Sprint Video Mail,

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:54.000
what we do is we'll sniff
out and find out if,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.850
we'll determine if you do or
don't have QuickTime on your PC.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.540
And that's the next thing
you see automatically,

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.280
the recommendation of you,
we recommend you download

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.980
this particular software.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.650
Lisa tells me that it's
a successful engagement,

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:14.000
not knowing exactly how successful it is.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
It's something that's been good
for Apple as it has been for us.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.990
Again, going forward,
what we're trying to really

01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:25.000
achieve is create a mass market.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And that's what we're trying to do.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.990
And that's what we're trying to do.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.630
We're trying to create a mass
market for these devices,

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:30.980
for these applications.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.340
You're going to start seeing
us do more with the technology,

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.890
again,
providing customers what they want,

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:38.990
better quality, longer videos.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.400
You're going to see us also drive
down the prices of the handsets,

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.950
which will in turn make it possible
for more folks to get involved.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.850
And as you know,
there are some improvements

01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:54.260
coming to the wide area networks,
which will increase

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.870
the bandwidth as well.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.400
We're also corner of our eye,
we're looking at the PC and

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.870
how it is directly going to
play with the device as well.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:03.990
You talked about memory.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.990
I think a lot of those things are going
to get addressed in the near future.

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:11.790
So we're really very much in
tune with trying to bring,

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:15.520
again, at the end of the day,
a better user experience

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.000
and a better product.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.830
That is it.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And that was yours, actually.
