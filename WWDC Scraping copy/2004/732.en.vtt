WEBVTT

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.060
Well, welcome everybody.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.800
Thanks for coming.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.300
I am pleased to welcome
you to session 732,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.290
New Directions in Branded Entertainment:
An American Express Case Study.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.300
I am very pleased to announce that,
well let me explain who I am.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.500
Aimee Nugent,
Product Line Manager at Apple for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.300
Core Media Technologies.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.260
And I am very pleased to
introduce Evan Schechtman.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.300
About 1998, he started Outpost Digital in
his apartment and consequently

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.300
was acquired by Radical Media,
which he currently is the CTO.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.590
And he has been very involved with the
American Express Superman webisodes,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.290
which you might have seen.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.630
This is a very interesting project,
blended entertainment

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.280
and advertising together.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.270
And Evan is going to talk us through
some of the challenges of that project,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.300
how we implemented it.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.000
And I hope that it's on the Mac platform
and hopefully inspire you guys and help

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
walk through some of the issues you might
find and end up with a great project.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.380
So again, please welcome Evan Schechtman.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.030
Thanks.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.880
Okay.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.950
Well, one of the first challenges
that we had on this project

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.200
was actually nothing technical.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.580
It's kind of,
in our business in post-production

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.850
over the past few years,
it's been somewhat of a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.020
changing of the guard.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.430
You know, the business that I got into,
I got into right about when

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.330
After Effects was coming out and
Adobe Premiere and those kinds of things,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.310
and everyone labeled it
desktop post-production,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.490
which at the time it was against a
lot of the big million-dollar rooms

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.200
that we were competing against.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.070
Um...

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.460
We don't call it desktop
post-production anymore.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.370
It's post-production,
because everyone in every part of our

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.960
industry is using a desktop computer.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.850
So most people thought that
these things were toys,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.790
and as we say now,
that if you don't see ahead of the curve,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.060
you get hit by the car,
which is what's been happening.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.240
The kind of professionals
that are in my business now,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.670
it was a very rigid
business for a long time.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.150
We had our offline editors,
we had our online editors,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.650
we had colorists,
we had graphics people and compositors.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.530
There really was very little spillover
between the different disciplines.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.000
The kind of people that
we're able to hire now have

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.360
had access to all the tools,
all the time, for one price.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.740
People who get Final Cut Pro or
get a copy of Flash,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.900
and these are the tools
they have access to.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.980
And so we're able to turn
drastically different results

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.900
in a fraction of the time.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.800
And these are, I call them consolidated
media professionals,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.180
because what happens is we have the
same person who does the offline edit,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.750
do their own conform,
do their own online and color

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.380
correction in most cases,
because unlike the traditional business,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.340
when people only had access
to one portion of the tools,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.120
we get access to everything all the time.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.300
So we have really, in our business now,
there's a mix of seasoned

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.140
professionals and young,
talented stars,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.490
and there's an information
exchange that goes back and forth.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.920
People are still telling us
that we can't do it this way,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.560
as we opened our fourth office,
which is kind of funny.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.810
I would think at this point it's
more of a... The revolution is over,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.360
now it's an evolution in our business,
but that's totally fine.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.200
We're going to do it this way.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.980
So a couple of challenges that we had.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.000
The first one is that we were the first
company outside of Warner Brothers to

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.600
ever be able to animate Superman.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.050
And we weren't going to do it in
traditional style animation because it

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.070
takes forever and it's really costly.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.080
You do the drawings here,
you edit them in,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.320
you send it overseas for inking,
and then they change a cut

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.600
and you have to send it back.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.930
So we had a couple things.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.540
Budget.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.250
It's always shrinking on commercial work.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.960
That's why we did
webisodes to begin with.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.390
I'll explain that.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.780
The other thing is that time.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.320
They want it done very,
very quickly because everyone

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.760
boasts how fast we can do things,
and that comes back to bite us.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.960
So we said we'll animate
Superman in Flash,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.740
which I don't think had
ever been done before.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.760
Now everyone... How many
people use Flash?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.870
I don't know if I'm talking to
content people or most people.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.000
How many people edit in Final Cut?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.190
that.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.840
And how many people do
compositing or other?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
Okay, so it's a mix of everybody, thanks.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.490
So we wanted to animate in Flash.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.320
So there we were sitting,
there was a bunch of,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.240
really kind of felt like we
were in detention or something,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.440
'cause there was a bunch of young
people on one side of the table,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.220
then a bunch of industry
leaders kind of in the,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.940
from Warner Brothers and from DC and
from the agency sitting on the other.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.070
Then we said, okay,
we'll offline a Final Cut Pro,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.960
we'll online a Final Cut Pro,
we'll do our color correction there,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.070
we're gonna shoot it in DV.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.220
We shot it on an XL1 with a lens
package called an Enzo lens package.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.160
This is a 35 millimeter lens
adapter that goes on this DV camera.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.360
Take the birthday party look off of DV.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.700
Everyone loves to shoot
DV for a few reasons.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.560
Generally inexpensive, high quality,
inconspicuous acquisition,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.440
but it looks like you
shot a birthday party.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.900
So the other part of what we do is trying
to make video look less like video.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.800
So this Enzo lens package helped that.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.980
So we said, we're gonna shoot it on DV.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.340
We're going to do animation in Flash and
we're gonna do compositing in Shake.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.240
Now the advertising people only
knew terms like flame and inferno.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.780
And Shake is equally as a
weird name for a product,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.820
but they didn't understand
what any of this stuff was.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.280
And of course, Final Cut Pro is a toy,
according to a lot of people

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.980
in our business still.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.500
Although they're coming around.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.480
So we had a couple of
different arguments with them.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.430
They just didn't understand
how we were going to do it.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.670
Thankfully, the company that I work for,
Radical Media,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.850
is able to hold people's hands
and help them take the leap.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.470
So what I'll do first is show
it instead of talking about it.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.310
I'll show one of the webisodes,
and I'll do a little talking and show

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.520
you how we did some of this stuff.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:52.640
Oh, I've got to make sure there's volume.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.940
Is there volume from this computer?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.940
The middle

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.330
"I can't touch anything.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.530
I swear.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.360
No sound?

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.000
Oh, it's real funny.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Should I just go?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.580
Oh, okay.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.700
It's running off a Windows box."

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.200
Let me switch to built-in audio.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.200
There it is.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.330
I memorized it so I can
just speak over it,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.640
although it's much funnier to hear it.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.310
Want to try again?

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.110
Okay.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.580
I'll wait.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.230
Well, I can talk in the meantime
while he does that.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.900
So, why webisodes?

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.700
Advertising budgets are shrinking.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.970
The company I work for, Radical Media,
about four years ago started to

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.480
say to some of their clients,
"The average budget for a

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.100
30-second commercial is insulting.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.620
It's $300,000.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.980
Depends on what side you're on.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.790
You'll be insulted." It's a lot
of money for a 30-second spot.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.690
So what we started to do,
because of the onslaught

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.210
of DV and Final Cut Pro,
truncated workflow,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.240
we said to our clients,
"For the price of a 30-second spot,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.290
we'll sell you a 30-minute TV show."
So we were the first company to shoot

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.550
the show for ESPN called "A Life"
on DV and do it in Final Cut Pro and

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.020
get it out to air that way.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.100
And just to buy some time,
one of the arguments we had,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.580
which we're fighting
less and less these days,

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.180
was an executive from
ESPN came in and said,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.860
"Listen, son,
DV will never do what Beta SP can

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.000
do." And like a hot-headed person,
I said, "Of course it won't.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.490
It won't cost twice as much to work with,
degrade over time,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.680
be harder to enter the system, you know,
all these different things that

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.150
analog systems do." And we did a
demonstration of DV versus Beta SP.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:16.900
[Transcript missing]

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.980
So we kind of stopped
fighting that fight.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.040
The interesting thing about
this was that when they came

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.060
to us to keep the cost down,
they were already ready to shoot DV.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.740
So over three years,
the argument of DV is inferior,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.930
it's not broadcast quality,
it has no time code was

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.140
kind of out the window.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.400
It had proved itself over time
as a more than lucrative medium.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.230
So webisodes.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.800
Seinfeld has a deal
with American Express,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.060
and everyone knows who Seinfeld is,
right?

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.160
We don't live in a bubble.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.970
And he's not funny in five minutes.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.740
He's not funny in 30 seconds on TV,
although I think he is.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.660
He needs five minutes of 30 minutes.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.540
So we said, we'll do these short
episodes of these webisodes.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.060
And so we did two five-minute pieces
for American Express's website.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.900
I want to be as famous,
so I have jerry.americanexpress.com.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.730
And we did three lifts
from those two webisodes,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.390
these three 15-second teasers that were
on TV to drive you towards the web.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.240
And then we did a Today Show appearance
where we composited in Superman and

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.810
Jerry Seinfeld sitting with Matt Lauer.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.500
Well, we learned a lesson a few years ago
when doing some work for advertising.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.960
We did a bunch of absolute
vodka spots that were supposed

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.250
to be emailed to people.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.320
So the entire time we worked quick and
dirty because of compression and we

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.100
were going to email them to people.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.460
And as soon as we were done,
the agency liked them enough to say,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:44.300
"Okay, blow them up to film." And that's
when I learned my first lesson

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.100
with the fact that we should
always work for a broadcast.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.210
We should always work at top quality
because you never know how someone's

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.300
going to want to repurpose this.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.530
So I learned that lesson
and on the Seinfeld stuff,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.130
even though it was going
to end up as a webisode,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.300
and compressions come a long way too,
so we really couldn't hide too much.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.550
We did it for broadcast quality.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.000
I'll show you one of the pieces
now and show you how we did some

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.300
of the more difficult stuff.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.570
How many people have seen these,
by the way?

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600
Cool.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.840
Two.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840
Do you have a reservation?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840
Superman.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.840
I don't see anything.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840
Might be under Man of Steel.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.830
Man of Steel.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.830
Man of Steel.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.840
Oh yeah, Man of Steel.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840
Right here.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:30.840
This way.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.310
Man of Steel.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400
Why do you do that?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400
Want to sit by the kitchen?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400
No.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400
No, we don't.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.000
I mean,
how can they put this much mayonnaise on

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.400
tuna fish and expect people to eat it?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
Why do you care?

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400
You're invulnerable to harm.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.400
It's not harm.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400
It's too rich.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.390
Makes me queasy.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400
Send it back.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.390
Eh.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.400
I got a little... Hm?

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400
Mm-mm.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400
Napkin?

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.900
Why?

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.240
It's impervious disdain.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.340
Excuse me.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.230
Superman?

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.760
Yes.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.940
I don't know if you remember me.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.690
Barry Katz?

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.740
You saved my life once.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.500
I was hanging from a train trestle.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.640
Yeah, sure, sure.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.420
How are you?

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.270
Terrific.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:03.920
Great.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.080
I don't want to interrupt your meal.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.540
I just wanted to say thanks again.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.650
No, not a problem.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.580
It's good to see you again, Barry.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.420
He's the best.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.250
You're good, too.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.380
Thank you.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.100
No idea.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.100
So you want to help me hook up this DVD?

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.600
I thought we were going cycling.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.000
Eh, cycling with you is no fun.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.580
Why not?

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.200
It's just not... Anyway,
I want to hear this thing.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.340
It's got surround sound.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.940
I've always wanted that.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.900
That's what we're hearing.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.500
Yeah, but it's not surround sound.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.450
I mean surround sound.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:36.450
It's like...

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.690
What are you talking about?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.840
So did you go bowling with
those people last night?

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.700
No, I stayed home.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.090
I watched that rebound at wedding.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.080
Oh, stop.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.940
With the reality television, I can't.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.740
I know, me too.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.700
But this one's pretty good.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.780
They found 30 guys who just got divorced.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.580
I don't know how.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.780
Please, stop.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.040
If I wanted reality,
I'd take the screen out of my

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.660
TV and look through the wooden box.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.010
Oh, boy.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.680
Look at these reviews.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.920
Unbelievable.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.260
Oh, yes, Wyoming.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.760
See, now,
this is what we should have seen.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.560
What's wrong with you?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.390
Of course they only put up the good ones.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.690
Every play does that.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.650
No, that's Joel Segal.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.790
I usually trust him.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.250
Oh, yes, Wyoming.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.490
One song after another.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.240
You stole my DVD player!

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240
What, am I not here?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.240
Unbelievable!

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.980
How do you miss this?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.940
Would you get over yourself?

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.280
He's getting away.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.880
He's not getting away.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.060
So what happened here?

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.540
Guy threw it at me and
bounced off at the ground.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.890
Why didn't you just catch it?

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.180
I don't do that.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.900
I do this.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.650
What if... Well, now what?

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.020
If you what?

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.850
I could go around the world
at super speed or reverse the

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.340
rotation of the Earth or go back
in time before it hit the ground.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.300
Take about 20 minutes.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:47.850
I don't know.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.540
It's quite a production, don't you think?

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.740
You got a better idea?

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.530
Actually, I do.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.580
We just duck into this phone booth.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.540
Phone booth?

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.420
That's a ritual.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.700
That's right, short shorts.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.380
You may be invulnerable to physical harm.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.830
Cutting off a superhero's chest
within 90 days of purchase.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.960
"What's the point of that whole going
back in time thing?" "Why not?" "What's

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.090
the point of anything if you can just go
back in time and fix any problem?" "Wait,

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:21.700
get a job.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.680
You do what you do, I'll do what I do."

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.250
"What's going on back there?" "This
one's different than mine." "Go back

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.900
in time and read the instructions."

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.340
This was torture.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.980
This was really torture to shoot.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:16:55.600
[Transcript missing]

00:16:55.800 --> 00:18:14.100
[Transcript missing]

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.390
So we used Pinnacle CineWave
for color correction and for our

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.300
onlining and for some transcoding.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.300
And then sound, of course,
was done in Pro Tools.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.300
Okay.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.010
Let's go through some of
the challenges that we had.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, on this last shot,
just as a funny thing,

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.390
we were using two cameras,
two Enzo cameras.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.980
And they're pretty
expensive lens packages.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.460
One of the cameras broke.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.660
And so the reason why
this was so painful,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.100
besides for the song that
got stuck in your head,

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.720
was that it was seven hours of this,
because we had to shoot

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.720
everything twice from one camera.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.000
The cool thing about shooting this on
DV was that because the camera broke,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.100
the next morning,
we went to a local reseller, B&H Photo,

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.140
and bought another Exon 1,
and bought a 35mm lens

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.160
adapter they had on the shelf,
and finished the job that way.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.290
So it's kind of cool that you can go
to the corner store and buy some of

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.800
the stuff to do this kind of work.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:09.360
I'm a Final Cut guy.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.490
I don't really know Flash or
Shake all that much,

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.800
but I have some screen captures of some
of the hardest stuff that we did here.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.290
We're going to take a look at...

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.130
Where is the DVD player?

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.140
We're going to take a look
at this shot specifically.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.320
This was a big challenge.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:36.140
These were traditionally
cell-animated hands,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.330
and we had real cables that we had
to somehow animate into there and

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.880
have it look pretty convincing.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.880
So the first thing I'll
show you-- let's see here.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.990
And I have screenshots that the
flash and shake people did for us.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.380
Let's take a peek at what we did here.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.830
Flash.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.800
You know,
when I first started in post-production

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.420
during the dot-com boom,
all I knew of Flash is that you use it

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.290
to make fart cartoons for the internet.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.530
And pardon my French,
but I soon realized that it's

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.420
actually more powerful than that.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.470
We did a few shows for it.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.150
That was a joke, everybody, by the way.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.280
Just checking with you.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:17.760
Okay.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.710
You've been staring at
cinema displays all day,

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.240
I know.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.460
We started to do a lot of broadcast
Flash animation for MTV and realized

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.580
that it's a fully viable means
of doing all kinds of things.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.030
So here we brought in basically
your background plate with

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.630
the back of the DVD player.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.080
A little bit difficult because we
were working with Barry Levinson,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.710
and I'm somewhat timid to work
with these kind of people before.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.070
And so I was the visual
effects supervisor on the set,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.500
and if there was a shot where
there was a shadow or he wanted

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.200
to shoot everything handheld,
if you've ever done compositing,

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.360
is a nightmare on any format.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.800
And he didn't really want to
listen because he's Barry Levinson.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.840
So when we were doing stuff like this,
I'd go, "Oh, Mr.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.160
Levinson, there's a shadow being cast.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:00.200
Do you think maybe we can, you know,

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.900
please maybe take it again.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.640
And he'd think about it for a second,
and every once in a while he'd be like,

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.640
okay, we're taking it again,
and all these people would start to move,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.400
and it felt kind of
powerful for a little while.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.590
Then there were a couple times, Mr.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.200
Levinson, can we maybe try it again?

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.960
He's like, don't push it, go sit down.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.200
On a shot like this,
we got our background plate

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.210
because it was imperative,
and so we did a very simple key,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.880
and I'll show you the
plate that we built,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.260
to key out most of the hand.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.660
Now, there was a stand-in,
and this is how crazy

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.150
some of the mentality was.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.220
We got a guy who was big,
like a football player,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:34.340
and we put him in huge shoes and he had
to wear this blue outfit for two weeks.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.230
The people from DC said, "Well,
he's got kind of a gut." I'm like,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.490
"Ma'am, he's going to be composited over
with Superman." "I don't know.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.530
He's just not like Superman."
This woman was put on the set

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.120
to be the keeper of Superman,
which I respect, but he was supposed to

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.840
whistle and bounce his knee,
and Superman does not whistle.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.380
Okay, Superman doesn't whistle.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.090
That's fine.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.970
So here we have the guy with the
blue hands actually doing it,

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.940
mostly for eyeline.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.900
The good news is that on a lot of
the takes that Barry Levinson picked,

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.030
we had it very often.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.500
We did it without the blue guy,
like the third time,

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.130
and thankfully those were a lot of
the takes that we picked because

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.640
we had to roto out everything.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.060
So here we keyed out the
majority of the hands,

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.970
and there are the cables
that it was using.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.700
This is just as a rough guide.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.780
Okay, so then we put in some of the,
we mapped the start and the end point

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.440
of where the cables actually need to be.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.590
Now this is in Flash.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.990
As much as we could have
animated the cables in Flash,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.160
the animators, from what they tell me,
Flash is excellent for creating

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.600
mats because we're just working
in simple black and white.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.200
And after we build this map file of where
the cables are going to have to live,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.040
we're able to export as a
PNG sequence into Shake for animating.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.830
We basically fill in the
matted area with black.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.290
So here we're just doing a really
kind of a rough mapping of where

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.550
the cables are supposed to live,
regardless of what else is in the frame.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.890
Is everyone enjoying this?

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.900
Because I could just do a Quake demo.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.700
Okay.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.700
Just making sure.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.300
I want to keep you engaged.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.490
So we're just mapping start and end
point for where the cable should be.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.810
Let's see what else he did here.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.650
And then brought in the rough,
this is a lit animation,

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.050
but I'll show you actually
doing the lighting.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.190
Brought in the animation.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:33.100
The animation was really
done on top of DV plates.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.870
We just took the DV files,
captioned them, sent them over.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.790
There's a company that's part of
our little network of companies

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.630
called Unplugged in Canada,
where they did all the animation.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.200
And the thing that I couldn't
grasp is how the people from

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.000
DC who have been doing animation
for years didn't understand.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
They said, "Well, we don't understand.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.780
We usually take our drawings and
we lay them over a picture and

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.080
that's how we animate." I'm like,
"We're going to do the same thing

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.140
except it's video." "We don't
understand how you're going to do

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:02.060
that." Which I couldn't understand how
they couldn't grasp when it's so simple.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.200
It is very simple.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.320
You just take a piece of video
and you ray trace over it.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.940
But that's traditional thinking.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.940
They had to get their heads
around this method of working.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.980
We taught them a thing
or two on this one,

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.590
I think.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.940
So they were just doing some
rough tracking of where those

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.500
points are going to start and end.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.580
I think we all got that.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600
Let me scrub through and see
if there's any magic here.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:21.660
There we go.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.800
Pretty good job, too,
even just coming up with the way

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.150
the cables are supposed to move.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.960
So that's one of them.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.870
Let's make sure this is the right one.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.400
I will not pretend to know, Schecht.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.540
That's why I have screen captures today.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.900
So there already you can see that the
white mat that we were building in

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.660
Shake is just filled in with black.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.170
They did a little bit of an edge blur.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.330
The hands are already colored
here for the most part.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.210
Okay, so there we take away the
animation for a second,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.420
and there's the big blue hands.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.760
And they just did a very,
very rough key to get out.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.130
Maximum amount of blue so that we
can just place the animation over it.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.570
There was still a bunch of blue
area that needed to be masked out.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.990
And we actually see that happening here.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.530
There we go.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.900
So there's a basic key,
and then we took a portion of the

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.340
plate and keyed it over just like that.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.410
Everyone with me so far?

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:27.410
Yeah?

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:27.410
Good.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.080
Just to show you a quick
matte area that we built,

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.290
and then we put the two together.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.310
We picked one track point.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.280
The track point we picked was on
the top left of the DVD player.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.520
Because we have to track the matted
out area with the rest of the plate

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.060
so it actually acts as a single plate.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.780
There's a little bit of blue left
over that's going to get covered

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.200
by the animation in this case.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.360
There are wires in black,
you can barely see them.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.310
Show you the matte file and
how it's all going to move.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.590
That is what the flash file
looked like when we got it.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:10.380
And all the lighting was done in Shake by
building additional mats and lights.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.640
There's our track point
for the animation.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.380
Cut a little hole where
the RCA cable was gonna go.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:24.640
And there, that's the mask that was built
to cast the shadow on the hand.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.830
Just put a little bit of blur
on the edge to kind of match,

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.950
and we also had to add a green,
a defocus layer and a green layer to

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.190
kind of match the ground glass that was
in the 35 millimeter adapter for the DV.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.400
It looks too antiseptic,
the animation versus it.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.740
And when we did a lot of tests up front,
we kind of overdid it.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.430
It was like film noir Superman.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:10.500
So we kind of backed off the lighting
a whole bit and backed off the grain.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.670
The one bad thing I think we
did was actually work too fast.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.040
The people really kind of took-- they
ended up taking for granted how fast

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.300
we were able to work because then they
wanted to try a thousand and one things.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.580
So, you know,
it's not often you have to walk into

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.410
a room full of artists and be like,
"Can you go slower?" Because it's

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.690
really starting to cause a problem.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.300
They wanted to try this, that,
and the other all the time.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.680
But that's typical of nonlinear
editing in this whole world.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.700
You know, when-- I cut on film once.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.450
Once.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.740
And when I got my sound tied in a knot,
which is when I decided to

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.330
actually use a computer,

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:49.090
As my main cutting tool,
you used to sit and think about

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.890
the cut you were going to make,
because if you cut it

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.200
and you didn't like it,
you were then on your hands and knees

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.590
on the floor looking for the short end
to scotch tape back into your reel.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.170
With nonlinear editing, you do one cut,
you save it, and then you come and

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.130
do 10 more versions.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.660
Usually you end up back
at your original cut,

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.060
but everyone wants to try it
so many different ways because

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.030
of how fast this stuff is.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.170
I don't know why I did a
screen capture of rendering it.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.610
I have one other that
I'll show you in a minute,

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.990
but I'll come back to the project
file and show you the finished.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.660
That's pretty convincing.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.240
Pretty difficult shot, but done with some
pretty simple technology.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.400
So that's -- in this job,
there are two nontraditional

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.660
uses of Flash.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.380
Most people who use Flash will say that
animating Superman's not nontraditional,

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.040
but using it as a tool for creating
mats in all of our composites --

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.150
we do all the time these days,
because it's quick and dirty.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.760
We even -- some of the people in
the office want to do titles in it,

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:50.380
whereas we like to go to
After Effects or different packages.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.000
They're very comfortable
with these tools,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.650
so I want them to be comfortable.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.790
They're faster that way.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.740
Okay, let's go back,
and I have some other

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.340
stuff to show you here.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:05.390
Some of the color correction,
which we did, which was pretty intense.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.750
I'm just going to give you an idea.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.200
That's what we were dealing with.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.390
Was he hanging from a train trestle?

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.080
Yeah, sure, sure.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.760
So there's our standing blue guy.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.600
The good news is that in most cases,
and you can see some of the, and this,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.790
the next webisode that I'll
show you has a lot more

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.090
Drastic color correction.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.840
The color correction was done using the
three-way color corrector in Cinewave.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.040
One of the major issues
for a shot like this,

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.750
the over-the-shoulder shot,
is that in this case we had

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.470
the blue guy in as a stand-in
because we had a composite out.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.360
The guy in the bottom who ended
up getting eaten by the letterbox,

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.550
we had to mat his head out.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.070
And so a lot of times we have the blue
guy there just to find a mat line.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.100
But when you're actually
going to pull a key,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.730
DV is five-to-one compressed
inherently in its 4-1-1 color space.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.180
Looks great when you're playing it,
but when you're actually going

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.920
to look at it to pull a key,
there's not enough information there in

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.090
color data to really pull a clean key.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.400
So what we do is not add any
information to these DV files,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.330
but we put them in a
different color space.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.310
So out of Final Cut Pro,
this is a feature if you

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.550
have third-party hardware,
especially the CineWave, well,

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.760
primarily the CineWave card,
we're able to take DV footage,

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.340
drop it into a CineWave timeline,
and it plays out as

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.480
10-bit uncompressed 4:2:2.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.590
The transcode happens in
real time as you play it.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.310
In a case like this,
we would take the file before it gets

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.100
sent over a point-to-point T1 network
to the LA office for compositing.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.670
Thank you.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.760
is we basically take it
out of Final Cut Pro,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.240
file export,
and we export as Cinewave 10-bit files.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.240
That way when the
composite artists get it,

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.780
there's not any more information there,
but they can then work in 422 space.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.470
It's a little bit easier to pull a key.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.030
Any color information we then add to
the file at that point is added in 422,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.840
in Cinewave's case,
16-bit YUV color space.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.450
We're always working for broadcast,
even though this would

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.400
predominantly end up on the web.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.040
But we knew that if they liked it,
which they did,

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.780
it ended up on NBC and then again on TBS.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.500
So I'm pretty glad in this case that we
worked for broadcast the entire time.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.370
The sad part is we work digital and we
stay as clean as possible and it was

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.300
broadcast off of Beta SP because that's
the way that NBC and TBS wanted it.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.500
Which is a drag because it then looks
kind of muddy when you broadcast.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.370
We spent all this time and money on this.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.670
Which is typical of most broadcasters,
most MTV work that we do ends up on D2.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.480
Does anyone remember what D2 is?

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.300
It's a deck that has wheels,
I swear to God.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.600
We literally wrote it around the
office when we brought it in.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.400
It's composite digital.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.580
So we spend,
a company can spend a million dollars

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.700
doing something and at the end we
jam all the signals together and

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.200
throw it on a tape that was sold.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.900
I fell off my dinosaur
and broke my newspaper.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Okay, so in this case it was really
important when we were doing color

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.880
correction that we oversample it.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.550
We take DV out of 411,
we put it into 422 and that's

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.680
the way that we do all of
our work that's acquired on

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.300
DV that goes out to broadcast.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.400
DV excels at offline,
DV excels at acquisition,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.100
but it does not excel in its native
state at onlining and color correction.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.830
So in Final Cut Pro with the
SineWave hardware you can

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.490
work in 422 to circumvent all
deficiencies of the DV codec.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.900
Some people unfortunately think
that's a deficiency of Final Cut Pro.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.090
That's the DV codec inside.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.920
So I'll bring up the other webisode.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.340
Let me see if there's
anything very interesting.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:40.400
Does anyone have any questions
while we-- Didn't do it.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.040
OK, cool.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.860
OK, I'll bring up the other webisode.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.460
Do you mind if I play this, Aimee?

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.700
Okay.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.600
I could just bore you
talking tech numbers.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.520
I'd rather show the stuff.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.420
It speaks for itself, I hope.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.560
This is the second one that we did,
and they're meant to be shown in order,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.430
because it's like a
true Seinfeld episode.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.270
You know, it kind of pulls on
jokes that they create.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.800
That's an animated
suitcase on top of the car.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.500
Yeah,
it's amazing how much you've missed.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.400
Super speed.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.220
I don't even know how you
figure out where you're going.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.700
- That's me.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.700
Did I hit your face?

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.700
- Sorry.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.700
- Well, I am Superman.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.540
- Right.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.440
You know,
some of these are so hard to get open.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.580
Do me a favor.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.890
Don't make a mess of the car.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.100
Look at this one.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.700
It's completely sealed up.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.930
There's no seam at all.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.440
Glad you got your nail in there.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.640
Oh!

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.000
That one was ridiculous.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.250
"Look at it." "That is
really something in terms of

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.410
everything." "I don't believe it."

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.700
You know,
my uncle was saved by Green Lantern once.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.700
He was hanging from a, um... A trestle?

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.690
A trestle, yeah.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.300
"The way that green ray
comes out of his run.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.380
Did you ever see that?" "Yeah,
I've seen it.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.510
Could you just take the picture?"

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:43.200
[Transcript missing]

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.900
Open the door.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:50.690
What's the matter?

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:50.940
Nothing.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.790
Keys.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.300
How could the keys be locked in the car?

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.200
Who had the keys?

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.500
Let's start with that.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.100
I guess I rushed back to get the camera.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.200
You take a second.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.290
One second!

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.700
Insight's 20/20.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.900
Thanks for the tip.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.080
What are we gonna do now?

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:04.680
Relax.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.300
I can rip the door off, melt the lock,
peel the roof back.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.900
I just finished restoring this car.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.000
I could go back in time.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.100
No going back in time.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.300
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.700
Do you know how many people you
annoyed with the back in time thing?

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.400
I can just fly the whole
thing back to the locksmith.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.690
No flying!

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.000
There's no flying!

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.500
That was our agreement.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.790
Road trip, on the ground, no flying.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.560
Wait a second.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.650
Wait a second.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.590
Hold on to your bathing suit.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.390
I know how to get help.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:37.400
No superpowers.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400
No super strength.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.400
American Express,
we're outside of system.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400
Hello?

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400
Yes.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.390
Well, thank you very much.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:57.940
So I can explain to them that it was
Superman who locked the keys in the car.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.300
Don't do that.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.840
We'll see.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.910
But if they should inquire,
perhaps I will drop a subtle

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:11.080
hint and say of the two of us,
it was the fellow who wears his underwear

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.040
outside his clothes who is responsible.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:28.200
[Transcript missing]

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.800
You're in a completely
different category.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.460
It just kind of takes away a
little from what I'm trying to do.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.130
Where did you come up with that name,
Superman, anyway?

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.340
Why are you asking?

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.870
I'm just curious.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.590
Ma and Pa Kent didn't name you that.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.200
Did you name yourself Superman?

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.200
Long time ago, I don't remember.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.190
Well, where did it come from?

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.740
Did somebody see you with a car
like over your head and call you

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:55.200
Superman and you cut out an S and
sewed it up on your thing there?

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.590
"What if there were any other
names you were kicking around,

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.480
like, uh, Unbelievable Person?" "Look,
it's just a name.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.010
I got a job to do, it works well,
end of story." "Or Surprising

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:11.060
Guy." "What's wrong with you?"
"How about Remarkable Chat?"

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.000
Petty, petty man.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.180
Well, what do you know?

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.010
Here's the truck.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.800
We were stranded and
we didn't need to be.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.710
You need any more help, just let me know.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.540
- How many do you have?

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.300
- I have another bag.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.680
- Do you want your own bag?

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.300
- No, I don't want my own bag.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.290
I think I have enough to get to L.A.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.300
if I ration it properly.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.300
Well, I'll bet you've worked that out.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:00.200
Would you mind, uh,
cracking the window just a little?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.840
You, Superman.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.180
Where are we, anyway?

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:33.240
and We actually caught a lot of
flack content-wise on this one

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:38.360
because the DC Comics people said
we made Superman seem effeminate

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.130
and we undermined his superness
or something because he locked the

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.290
keys in the car and there was a big,
you know, it was a political debate.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.380
He was supposed to be bouncing his
knee and whistling in the car and they

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.440
wouldn't allow any of that kind of stuff.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.760
This one I want to show you
because of color correction.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.100
Is there internet on this computer,
do you think?

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:56.500
Worth a shot, right?

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.420
Give it a shot.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.340
There's internet spilling in
every corner of this facility.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.330
I hope there is.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.090
Let's see if my-- this
is something interesting.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.040
Still up.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.800
It is.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.930
Whenever we have -- I'll jump back
to the color correction in a second.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.440
But whenever we have a job
this big with brands this big,

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.630
Seiynfeld and Superman,
the parent company -- and this is

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:24.420
definitely a lesson I learned from them
-- is you kiss the butt of the brand.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.340
It makes total sense.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.600
This is what it's all about.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.820
It's subtle product
placement in this case.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.760
So when anyone from the
agency or Jerry or from D.C.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.710
wanted to log in -- let's see if this is
-- I'm surprised this is still active.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.300
Even down to branding the approval
site with the American Express logo,

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.170
making it look like an
American Express card.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:53.030
So you can see on the bottom here,
view as agency, view as Jerry,

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.380
view as DC Comics, view as clients.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.890
Clients see the least, of course.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.720
The agency has pretty
much access to everything,

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.600
and then for internal purposes,
we have all of it.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.040
We post the making of,
this is all driven off of an excerpt

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.100
running from our New York office.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.620
I'll hide that for the time being,
see if there's any good nuggets on there.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.200
Some of the color correction
was absolutely outstanding.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.590
Let's see if we can find some of it.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.700
And that was all done in Final Cut Pro by
a guy named Pete McCoubry.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.900
And Pete McCoubry was two
years out of film school,

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.860
got really good at this,
and he ended up color

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.000
correcting Soderbergh's
Full Frontal on Final Cut Pro.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.700
I don't know if anyone
ever read about that.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.110
And did all of our mastering
kind of work on Final Cut Pro.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.190
He's just good.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.200
He's just really good at what he does.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.000
And so after much screaming and
yelling that he might be wearing

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.100
sneakers with the shoes on tied,
he's really good at doing your work,

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:43.800
they gave him a shot
at doing this coloring,

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.300
which would normally have been
done in a film transfer bay

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.590
like a DaVinci or a Poggle.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.260
The other interesting,
I don't mean to talk too

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.020
politically about this,
but that's also part of the challenge,

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.260
is that people didn't really want to take
a lot of the gear that we had seriously

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.900
until we put in a film transfer bay,
which we used for film mastering work.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.580
But as soon as we put in a
Poggle bay with a DataCine,

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.570
these two big machines,
and we tore people around, "Oh,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.810
you have one of these and one of those.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.040
Yeah,
but I'm selling you this." It all of a

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.220
sudden added all kinds of validity to
what we were doing on the other side.

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.110
You know,
you have to have a good cinema display,

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.400
a Herman Miller chair,
and a nice place for your clients to sit.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.200
And you're all set.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.400
You're in business.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.260
It's all about the chair.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.780
It really is, though, in many cases.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.640
All right,
so there's the original DV file.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.860
It's not even bad looking
to begin with for DV.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.860
It was shot by professionals.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.300
And then we did a nice color package.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.870
I'll play some of it so you can see.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.100
There, another stand-in.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.150
Poor PA.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.520
The guy in blue I think
was on a coffee break.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.110
This was Death Valley and I know
why they call it Death Valley now,

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.120
being from New York.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.980
So a really nice before and after
color correct that was done.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.600
Anyone here in Final Cut know
how to use the limit effect in

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.900
the three-way color corrector?

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.410
All right, a few of you,
then I would like to show

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:10.600
you one thing that we did.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.640
Pretty ominous coming from back there.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:24.290
The truck going by is a perfect example
of not leaving well enough alone.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.670
The truck was purple, I think.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.570
And they said, "Oh, well,
because you can,

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.750
could you make it green?"
And I'll show you how we did it.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:35.870
No, I'm really not joking around.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.800
I'm really not joking around.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.690
You just had to touch every slit.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.060
The original truck was purple.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.180
I think it was absolutely
a beautiful shot.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.660
They wanted a green truck.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.160
And we did it kind of quick and dirty,
but I'll show you how we did this.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.900
Does anyone care to see how we did this?

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.000
Alright, cool, thank you.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:51.450
Alright.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.400
So I'll shut this off.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.540
Go down to our base layer here.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:02.490
I'm just gonna make it a little easier
on myself by adding an edit point.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.250
on a G5.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.980
The more processors you have, obviously,
and the faster they are,

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.690
the more realtime you're going to get.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.320
The cool thing is that in that
Sinewave system I was talking about,

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.170
this is completely realtime,
not at DV resolution,

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.890
at uncompressed resolution.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.740
10-bit, uncompressed.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.060
No rendering whatsoever.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.430
In DV we can do this,
but we need to do a final render

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.010
to get it to full quality,
and DV of course is not best

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.710
suited for doing this kind of work.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.350
You'll see why in one second.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:38.520
Actually in black and white
it'll be painfully obvious.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.440
We're using the color correction,
of course, anything in bold is realtime.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.450
The color corrected three-way.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.950
I'm going to just tear this
off so we can look at it.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.800
and hidden now in the latest version,
of course,

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.300
is the limit effect all down here.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.670
We're going to grab the eyedropper.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.950
We're going to grab some purple.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.860
I'll just put this back where it belongs.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.770
And now I can show you what
I mean by being a deficient codec

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.580
when it comes to compositing.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:05.800
There in black and white,
it's trying to show us what our selected

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.830
area is for affecting it with color.

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:12.580
It's pretty blocky if you look at it,
because 411 is basically,

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.150
in layman's terms,
it's saying that for every

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:20.350
sample of contrast data you have,
because the eye is not so good at, well,

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:23.560
the eye is good at seeing
major differences in contrast,

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.000
there's one-fourth as
much color information.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.540
Whereas in 422,
obviously it's a lot better.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.360
It's a two-to-one relationship.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:33.640
And in film, it's 444.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.340
All attributes of color and
contrast are basically equal,

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.230
which is why it's such
a great way to work.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.460
In this case, I'm going to open up the
selected range for purple.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.950
It seems it gets a little smoother.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.840
Open up the bottom a little bit.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.190
I'm just shooting in the dark here,
no pun intended, to, uh...

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.320
to get as much of that truck
in in one shot as possible.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.320
Obviously, if I open up the
selected area really big,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.980
it's gonna start to,
not so much in the case of purple,

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.320
but it starts to pick up sky and other
parts that we don't wanna pick up.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:12.040
If this was shot in DigiBeta and
brought in in its full range,

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.240
I'd probably be getting a lot more
of this information on the first try.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.800
We're just looking at it
on a sample basis here,

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.320
and it's not that much I can pull out.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.470
We're gonna come out of this key mode,
show you a couple things we can do now.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:25.630
Just the truck is selected.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.510
There I just, it's kind of small,
but I pulled it down so you

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.880
can see it in black and white,
and of course you can go in

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.200
and reverse the selected area.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.280
So in the case of this shot,
now everything is black and

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.600
white except for the truck.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.590
These are things you,
and this is no rendering involved,

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.980
which is pretty, it's pretty bad.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.620
No matter what system you're on.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.110
But in this case,
they just went and they pulled

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.000
the mids towards the green area.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.580
And if I wanted to,
I can sit and finesse this all day long

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.830
until I catch the rest of the truck.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:57.860
There we go.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.900
Yeah, I actually did.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.380
Come back out of that key mode,
and there's your green truck.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:05.400
Not bad.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.100
No tracking involved.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.820
Most people would run immediately
to a flame to do this.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.260
We're trying to tell people to
write hardware in Final Cut Pro,

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.460
and a little bit, a tiny bit of patience.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.630
The proper operator.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.580
When we first started doing
Final Cut work at this level,

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.020
you can see actually I picked
up a little green in my sky.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.740
I would just do a quick matte
to get that out of there,

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.740
but the matte's also
real-time on a CineWave card.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.940
Still no rendering at full quality.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.060
We first started doing this,
there were a lot of people who

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.300
picked up a copy of Final Cut Pro.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:33.960
I was like, "Oh,
I can do Final Cut work." We'd

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.280
put them in front of the client,
and they very often would turn

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.310
around and say to the client,
"Oh,

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:41.960
I can't do what you want me to do because
of Final Cut." Never operator error.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.260
Always the software's fault,
because it was new,

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.460
and that was kind of the error about it,
that it couldn't do with these things.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.290
We're lucky enough to be able to
cultivate talent that's never going

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.710
to turn around and say to the client,
"Oh,

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.970
I can't do what you're asking me to do
because of the software." It becomes

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.660
a talent issue and a training issue.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:56.990
issue.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:58.880
So there's a purple truck turned green.

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:03.960
Not bad.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.800
Okay.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.160
Let's see.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:10.350
What else can I show you from
here without all my media on hand?

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.790
Yes.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:17.720
The other thing I thought was
completely neat was the camera,

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.990
which was built Photoshop and Shake.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.260
Pretty effective, I think.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.150
Very, very simple.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.490
Even the blur area in the
part of the focal area.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.910
And the coloring is even a
little bit of a halo here.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.700
And we did shoot with a Grad filter.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.030
One thing we did learn about
color correction is that it's not

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.490
completely a computer side thing.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:44.580
A lot of times you actually have to
shoot for your own color correction,

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.980
which is something that
these new consolidated media

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.420
professionals are very good at.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.750
A lot of our colorists now actually
go out and shoot because they're the

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:55.440
people receiving all the footage and
grading it to look like something else.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.830
Where in a case like this,
they know how they need it to look

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.710
when they get it into the bay,
so they might as well be on set

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.200
helping the DP or even shooting
for themselves in certain cases.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.200
This was supposed to be
a low-budget project.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.000
Then Seinfeld got involved, of course,
then DC Comics got involved,

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.860
then the agency got involved,
and then trucks started pulling up,

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.760
no joke, and then big crews and
people with walkie-talkies,

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.080
and it turned into a full-blown,
almost like feature-type

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.540
set closing off the streets.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.670
And the funny thing to me was,
having started the company in 98

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.810
and fighting an uphill battle of
doing DV and all these things,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.160
there I am sitting on the set,
and everyone's running around.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.050
There are two XL1s on
these little dollies.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.560
It was a couple years ago,
not even a year ago.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.440
You can't do it.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.190
It's garbage.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.420
It's amateur time.

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:42.450
And there was everyone hustling
and bustling and checking the gate,

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.820
which blew my mind.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.910
I'm like, there is no gate.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:45.430
It's video.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.370
Just a little dust-off and
check it on your monitor,

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:48.230
and you're ready to go.

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:50.430
But they were treating it
like this regular production,

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:52.160
which I thought was pretty phenomenal.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.620
And let's see if there's anything
else here I can pull up for you.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:23.200
Let's see if the video still lives.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.490
This is pretty far into it.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:26.880
I want to show you

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.190
with shading tests.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:31.700
Here we go.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.140
Here is the raw.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.750
This is how we delivered the files.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.140
Not bad.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.500
Basic motions in,
it keyed in pretty easily.

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.770
And then we did the mid shading,
which is what we ended up going with,

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:51.210
and I'll show you the film noir version.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.950
Alright, so that's mid,
and here's the full lighting

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.740
package that was rejected.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.250
It was a little too harsh, they said.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:57.600
[Transcript missing]

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.180
It's really, it is really subtle and
it's all over this piece.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.510
But this was shot in a diner
at night while it was raining.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.810
And it looks like day, no joke,
and it looks like daytime.

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.410
And that's the one I was looking for.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:14.560
And it plays like daytime.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.870
You can see the light crawl
across his face and then wait

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.610
the proper breath and then hit,
hit Seinfeld in the face.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.690
I just think it was absolutely awesome.

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.030
I was just buying time with
this thing loaded here.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.170
They say that opposites attract,
while our next two guests may

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:32.740
just be the next successful odd.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.860
I'll just take this.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.710
They say that opposites attract,
while our next two guests may

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.940
just be the next successful odd
couple to get people talking.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:55.440
Although Superman usually works alone,
he's teaming up with Jerry Seinfeld

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.700
for a project with American Express.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.740
First of all, we want to thank them
both for coming back.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.340
We were scheduled to do this last week,
but we had a little scare.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.440
Someone claimed to have some
kryptonite on the plaza.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.980
Luckily, it just turned out to have been
a piece of moldy Jarlsberg.

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.500
Anyway,
it's a great... They made a cheese joke.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.670
I just couldn't believe it.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.060
Subtle things, though,
to make it convincing:

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:29.200
the shadow or the reflection in the table
when he got actually caught by the cops.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:33.300
Beach ball, talk amongst yourselves,
I'll give you a topic.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:34.140
Okay.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.460
I don't know if anyone
caught it the first time.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.650
That's right in front of our office.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.440
There we go.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.580
Right in the reflection of the window.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:48.880
I don't know if anyone caught that.

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.260
Getting the right curvature,
getting the right reflection,

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.480
the right density.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:59.750
All those little things they insisted on,
which we did too for realism,

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.790
even though he's animated.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.890
"I'm on a project with Mr.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.680
S and myself that's going
to appear on the internet on

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.610
jerry.americanexpress.com.

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:32.360
There's one running on there
now and then there's another

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.500
one coming up like the internet.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:36.740
I mean that's a little different
for you." "Jerry told me about it.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.050
He's got good instincts.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.500
Plus,
I like the idea of being on the internet.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.850
You're really up on this." "I like it."

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.360
And it's a fairly lengthy
interview that got cut down.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:53.170
There are a couple other people
that I wish I had on my review

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.700
site that did voiceovers.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.800
It was fun to say no to Alec Baldwin.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.580
No, thank you.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.860
We ended up going with,
and then there was a couple

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.080
other people who tried VOs.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.360
The person we went with was someone
who Jerry had chemistry with.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.340
And if you didn't tell already, Superman,
the voice,

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.820
is played by the guy Putty from Seinfeld.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.750
And the funny thing is,
as much as they have chemistry,

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.330
they actually do not get along.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.670
It was fun to sit there with
him and watch Jerry make fun

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.060
of this guy Putty to his face,
and he didn't get it,

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:19.420
which was really kind of funny.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:24.550
The whole mechanics of the political
side of the business was really

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.090
interesting to see on this job.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.640
The good thing was,
after all was said and done,

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.160
because we did turn results,
it raised a lot of eyebrows

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.980
at this place called Ogilvy,
which was the agency.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.210
They were brave enough
to let us try this.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.480
And of course, now that it's a success,
everyone loves Final Cut Pro and

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.830
Shake in the office because of
what it was able to do for them.

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.120
But it was just about
having them take a chance.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.520
It's kind of a thing.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.440
It's one of the dangerous waters to be
in because we've almost shot ourselves

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.910
in the foot several times doing this.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:53.320
But as long as you have the right talent
and you're trained properly on this,

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.010
I really don't think there's
anything you can't do.

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.840
Am I good on time?

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.100
That's it?

00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:58.400
No?

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.200
I have 50 more minutes.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.200
Can we take your questions?

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:03.200
Oh, let's do that.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:07.340
Usually I'm like showing off
functions of Final Cut Pro and not

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.020
really anything that we did per se,
so I can talk for ages and ages,

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.200
but this is project-specific,
so I'm out of steam.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.200
Well, first, thank you, Evan.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:17.200
Thank you very much.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.200
Thank you for coming.
