WEBVTT

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.530
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Nader Nafissi, Server and

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.890
Storage Software Product Manager.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.790
Good afternoon.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.180
Looks like we had a
packed house here today,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.400
which is very cool.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.800
So today we're going to be talking
about Apple Remote Desktop 2.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.790
This is brand new.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.210
We just introduced it last Monday and
we've been working hard on it and

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.520
it's going to be a great release.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.200
And before I start,
everybody in their packs,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.200
they've got the little ARD software.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.660
Yeah, so try it out.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.940
Let us know what you think.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.930
Again, we think this is one of the best
releases we've done and it's got a lot

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.980
of great features in it and we'll try
to cover some of these features today.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.510
So, Apple Remote Desktop,
what's it all about?

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.650
So basically I think this
image captures the essence of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.540
what the product helps you do.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.790
This is one of the
many labs that we have.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.280
This happens to be the
University of Tokyo iMac lab,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.390
but again, there's probably every
educational institution has

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.930
something similar to this.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.940
If you own a business,
you might not have all

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.740
your computers in one room,
but they're probably scattered

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.600
across a floor or buildings
or across different cities.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.980
And again, as system administrators
or IT professionals,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.660
you're trying to manage these systems.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.440
You need to configure them,
you need to provide remote

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.670
assistance to users,
you need to collect information

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.730
about what exactly the configuration
of these computers are.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.920
And again, if you only had one iMac,
we've made Macintoshes

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.970
really easy to use,
and that's great,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.280
but if you've got one or more,
especially if they're scattered

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.300
across various geographical locations,
that quickly becomes a very hard job.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.660
So that's why we make
Apple Remote Desktop,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.520
is to really help you
get the job done faster,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.590
more efficiently, with less resources,
etc.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.580
So Apple Remote Desktop 2 is our
second generation of this product.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.880
We have over 50 new features
in Apple Remote Desktop 2 and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.700
countless other enhancements.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.660
Again, if you use the old product and
you start using this new version,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.020
everything you do you'll notice, oh,
this is new and this is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.510
new and this is better.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.850
So it's a really great product.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.880
I've been using it now for a couple of
months now just with the beta testing and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.060
I can't even go back to the old version.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.490
This is really a great product and we've
taken it out to some customer sites to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.950
kind of do some field testing on it.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.270
And again, the way this software behaves,
especially in larger environments,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.370
if you've got hundreds, 500,000 Macs,
just the whole interface, the workflow,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.200
this product is much
better suited to managing.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.810
So at a high level,
what this product lets you do

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.740
is it helps you with software
distribution and software could

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.400
either be operating system updates
or just regular application updates.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.000
We also have a lot of features that
help you with asset management.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.860
By asset management,
I mean what the configuration of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.730
your computers are as well as what
software you've installed on there.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.700
It also helps you with
remote administration.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
So again, remotely, in mass,
you can target a bunch of computers

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.740
and perform various tasks on them.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.640
And you can also provide remote
assistance to your end users as well.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.840
There's a lot of screen sharing features.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.250
You might have gotten a clue,
we've got the big binoculars,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.480
that's what that's for.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.680
So you can do some screen
sharing with your users and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.830
help them through their tasks.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.410
And last but not least,
we also have a lot of features

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.020
that really help make the
product very easy to set up.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.440
And if you're trying to add
computers for your management tasks,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.640
it's a very easy task.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.120
So that's Apple Remote Desktop 2.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.320
Our tagline is
Desktop Management Made Easy.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.400
And hopefully,
it's not just us saying that.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.430
We actually have a lot of
customers that value the product

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.360
and they're strong supporters.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.200
This is a sample quote from
one of our education customers.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.540
So what I'm going to do next is
just kind of walk through each one

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.460
of these categories of the product.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.330
I'll try to keep the slides to a
minimum because I've got Michael Lopp,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.100
who's the Center Engine Manager for
Apple Remote Desktop,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.660
to actually give you some demos
because the product really,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.440
you know, you could read about it,
you could look at the spec sheets,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.140
but until you see it in action, you know,
that's when it starts clicking for you.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.290
So we'll try to do a lot of demos to
actually show you how the features work.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.480
So for easy setup,
what's new in ARD 2 is we've again

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.300
reexamined how the workflow works and
we have what we call network scanners.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.960
And these network scanners assist
you in the task of finding out what

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.880
computers are in your network and
adding them to your computer list.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.500
The four scanners that we have in ARD 2,
one is just a local area network scanner.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.580
So whatever computers are in your
local area network will detect,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.020
will tell you what version
of ARD they're running,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.830
if they need to be updated or not.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.400
We also have a network
address range scanner.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.690
So if you want to see what
computers are across the street or,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.020
you know, in another town,
you can also specify a range

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.620
of IP addresses that will go
scanning and will discover

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.200
computers in that remote location.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.320
If you just want to
individually add computers,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.360
we can also do host lookups
either by IP address or DNS names.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.470
And new to this version,
we also have the ability to

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.380
import a list of computers.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.620
Whether it's just host names or IP names,
you just have a little

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.100
text file or a spreadsheet,
whatever,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.830
and you can just drag it into ARD.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.400
We'll go resolve it and again,
you can add it to your computer list.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.280
The basic way you manage your computers
is you would organize them into computer

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.280
lists and new in this version is you
can have any number of computer lists.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.870
We don't have any limitations anymore.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.860
As well as within each computer list,
you can have any number of computers.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.350
And again, Michael is going to be
showing that to you shortly.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.360
We also have a brand new setup assistant.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.330
So again,
if you want to configure all these

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.750
computers as far as the ARD settings go,
you can answer a couple of

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.940
questions and we'll apply all these
settings to your computers in mass.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.680
And what's very cool about this
too is you can actually save that

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.590
settings in a little package and
you can put in your keychain drive,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.370
whatever.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.650
So as you go along and you
get additional computers,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.420
you can just apply that package
to that new computer and it'll

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.280
get all the settings that you
want for your organization.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.610
Amen.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.590
And also new to in ARD2 is
with the old version and again

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.880
in this new version as well,
the authentication,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.580
the way it worked was you had to have
a local account on the client computers

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.340
and you would assign privileges to it
and that's how you would authenticate

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.620
and add it to your computer list.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.270
But based on a lot of feedback we had
from our larger customers that were

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.590
heavily involved directory services,
they used it, they really liked it,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.680
they were asking us,
can you make ARD be a better player

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.620
if we have directory services?

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.110
So what we've done now is for the
authentication of the clients,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.240
again you can still rely on the
local accounts because some accounts

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.600
or some customers really like that,
but now you can also specify directory

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.970
services group so the authentication
and the privileges happen through that.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.190
And last but not least in the
easy setup category is we have

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.930
a new feature called user mode.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.790
And this is probably more relevant to
folks in the education side of the house.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.230
And again, the product is really great
for managing computers and

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.020
in a classroom type setting,
teachers like a lot of the

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.880
features we have in the product.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.510
But the IT folks are typically kind of
hesitant to allow a teacher full admin

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.190
access and the full power of the product.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.720
So what we've done with user
mode is an administrator now can

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.970
go off and essentially enable or
disable features that they don't

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.250
want regular users to be using.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.360
And when you log into the computer
with a standard user account,

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.820
which is what most teachers
or non-IT folks have,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.200
they can still launch the application.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.830
But when they try to do the tasks that
the administrator didn't want them to do,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.210
they'll be grayed out or not highlighted.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.090
So with that, thank you.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.800
I'm going to invite Michael Lopp,
who's again Senior Engine Manager for

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.120
Desktop Managed Solutions.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.020
And he's going to give you a quick
demo of the basic user interface

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.000
of the application and some of
the things I just talked about.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.040
Michael Lopp: Good afternoon.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.080
So my boss asked me -- he
came by before this and said,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.340
"What are you going to demo?" I told him,
"I'm demoing everything.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.280
I want to show you everything in this
product right now." And we've got

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.980
a set of hardware here that we're
actually going to be using to actually

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.700
show you the features of the product.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.160
So I call this an aggressive demo
because we've got a lot to do.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.020
So, App and Remote Desktop.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.880
How many out there have used one, two?

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.650
Ah, okay.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.940
What do you think of the new interface?

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.700
You like it?

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.840
A round of applause.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.700
It's a very familiar interface probably
because it's very similar to iTunes.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.670
We've got on the left,
we have a list of computer lists.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.700
We've created a couple sample
ones here to start it off.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.700
Then we have scanners,
the ability to actually find

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.700
machines on the network.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.700
And then we have saved tasks.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.640
Saved tasks is a whole new metaphor
that we've put into this product.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.700
It's sort of the concept of a task
that we had in the prior product,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.700
but it was something that you can
actually save information with.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.270
So a task is all the tasks that
I want to do and then all the

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.650
computers I want associated with,
and then scheduling as well.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.050
So tasks are something that are
reusable things that you're going

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:44.700
to want to have a lot of time.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.700
So we give the ability to save those
whether they're scheduled or not.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.700
So I've created a WWDC lock task here.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.700
I'm going to show you
all this in a second.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.700
Over here what you're seeing on the
right is just a standard computer list.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.580
These are the machines that we're
currently seeing in the system.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.590
These are the labs machines over here,
what the application is

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.670
that they're currently in,
who the current user is,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.700
whether it's available.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.700
What VNC is.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.700
We'll explain that in a second.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.700
And then the bottom is the task history.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.700
These are all the tasks
that I've currently executed

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.660
against these machines.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.850
You can see I've been very successful
in running all these tasks.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.460
So this is again any task
that you've executed,

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.430
whether you've executed
explicitly or scheduled,

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.220
it shows up down here.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.560
So this is your console.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.730
This is where you're going to be spending
your time managing your machines.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.810
So let's talk about a task really
quickly and show you that this is

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.410
not actually just a fake setup.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.160
It's real.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.420
So we'll go ahead and create a scanner.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.540
These are the machines that
are currently on the network,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.660
on a private network here.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.980
Go ahead and we're going to
select these machines that

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.340
I want to create a list from.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.040
Latecomers.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.540
Maybe not.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.510
And we're going to create a new list.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.980
As Nader said,
computer lists are all over the system.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.900
You can create them from
just about anywhere.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.020
We'll go ahead and create
this list with these machines.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.570
I'm going to call it WWDC Live.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.140
Okay.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.750
I've already authenticated to them,
but if I hadn't authenticated,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.140
you'd see an access
authentication dialog.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.660
We provide the admin
name and the password.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.580
So let's go ahead and select these
machines and do our first task.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.500
I'm going to lock the
screens because it's fun.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.270
Go ahead and type locked.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.900
Now, this is a task window that you're
going to see in all of the other tasks.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.780
They're very similar.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.930
It captures the information
that's relevant to the task,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.600
like lock screen, copy items,
all the other tasks.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.220
But also, you're just going to
see the schedule dialog.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.120
So if I want to schedule this one
repeating or at a certain time,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.890
I can do that.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.620
Also, if I want to target it against
a certain set of machines,

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.120
I can do that from this window.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.460
These buttons are in every
single task that you have.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.350
I'm just going to go ahead and lock this,
show you what it looks like.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.260
It locked.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.180
The power.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.250
That's great.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.660
Anyway, so let's let our users back in.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.240
We'll go ahead and unlock those screens.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.710
And we'll talk about
this other window here.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.250
So what happened is when
the task was running,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.280
what you saw was the status was updating.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.550
What you're seeing here is,
this is sort of a detailed

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.730
task progress view.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.080
These are all the machines
that I executed the task on.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.220
And you can see the status.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.760
The status varies depending
on which task you're using.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.650
But the idea here is you can get
a little more detailed status.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.950
If you don't want this window popping
up every task that you're running,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.790
you can just turn it off in preferences.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.660
So that's kind of a high level
overview of the interface.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.590
We've created a scanner.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.650
Let me show you one other
type of scanner that we have.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.720
Maybe you've got an Excel document
or some other document that you

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.660
have a list of IP addresses in.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.220
The other scanner that we have that we're
really fond of is the file import one.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.340
What this is,
actually I've already put it in there.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.570
What this is, what we do is we allow
you just to randomly,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.120
any document, you can just drop in here.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.280
As long as it has IP addresses,
Excel document, whatever you wanna use,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.520
you can just pull it in here.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.620
We'll just drag it in.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.030
And rescan it.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.750
And there you go.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.880
You can use this list live to actually,
if you have something,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.180
if you have an Excel document
or something like that,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.230
if you want to edit it,
you just rescan it and it'll show

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.630
back up with your edited documents,
your edited computer

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.700
list in there as well.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.300
So.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.080
So client settings,
since we're talking about easy setup,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.190
now that we've got our admins,
now that we've authenticated them,

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.920
now that we've got a list,
let's go ahead and actually do

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.020
something to these machines.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.710
What I'm going to do is I'm going to
actually set some client settings.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.000
This is basically setting
preferences against these clients.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.530
So I'll actually want to do something.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.640
So you're going to see this
sort of assistant here.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.390
What I'm going to do here is I'm
going to specify what properties,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.720
what preferences that I want to be
associated with all of these clients.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.210
I'm going to kind of blaze through this.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.470
So I'm going to leave
the startup preference.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.320
I'm going to leave it enabled.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.000
I'm going to leave the menu extra
up on the top of the screen.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.310
I'm not going to create any
users right now because that

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.550
would take a little time.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.460
But I could create new
users at this point.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.990
I could,
if I want to do directory authorization,

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.020
I have the ability to set that in here.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.540
If I want to specify
privileges for the local users,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.720
I can do that as well.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.660
I can do a feature that we're
actually not going to demo.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.020
We can set the request permission.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.340
This is a guest access feature.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.120
So again,
this is for the educational setup.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.140
If you want to say, listen,
I occasionally want help.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.700
But I don't want this
admin to have access.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.410
You can have it so you can check it.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.840
And then when someone, your admin, says,
well, you're in trouble.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.540
I need to help you.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.920
You actually get prompted and say, yes,
no, you can observe my screen.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.740
No, you can't.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.740
So guest access is a
really popular feature.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.460
As you probably heard already,
we've rewritten our

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.790
screen sharing in VNC.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.190
VNC is the
Virtual Network Computer Protocol.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.260
We've done a clean room implementation
so that you can use any VNC viewer

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.560
with Apple Remote Desktop as well.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.320
We'll show that in a second
when we actually observe and

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.830
control a PC as well as a Mac.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.880
And just first,
we're actually doing something

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.800
in this client setup task demo.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.990
We'll go ahead and set that right there.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.890
Okay, task window again.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.580
Do you want to save it?

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.970
Do you want to run it?

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.790
Do you want to schedule it?

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.790
We're just going to run it.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.500
Takes a second to get going.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.740
You'll see this one is a little bit more,
got a little more data.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.290
You can,
if you've got a really long task,

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.900
a big report or something, this is great.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:17.440
It gives you a little progress,
tells you what each computer is

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:17.440
doing as it's installing the package,
applying the settings,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:17.440
restarting everything.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.660
And then it's done.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.030
More success.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.830
Knock on wood.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.750
All right.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.720
So, again,
this is just a little bit of the stuff

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.450
that you can do with setting up a client.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.000
I encourage you to take a
look at the product and,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.750
Nader, that's it for Easy Setup.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.240
Thank you.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:18:20.700
[Transcript missing]

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.230
And again, this whole software
distribution is a task that,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.650
just like any other task,
you can schedule it, you can save it,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.960
so it inherits all the
functionality that is the whole

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.890
task in Apple Remote Desktop 2.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.140
So with that,
I'm going to ask Michael to come up

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.650
and do a couple of demos for you.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.700
Michael Kahn: Me again.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.640
All right.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.320
So we talked about easy setup.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.030
We're going to do
software distribution now.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.650
As Nader said,
there's a lot of ways to get

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.060
bits down in a machine via ARD.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.030
Maybe you have a package
that you want to copy.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.970
Maybe you have some other way.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.260
There's a lot of different ways.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.140
I'm going to show you guys a
couple of ways we can do stuff.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.140
A feature that we put into 1.2
was the install package feature.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.020
And it's still there.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.430
It's got all the new task work
that we put into the product.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.330
I'm just going to go
ahead and grab a package.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.260
It's a small package.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.680
It's going to go ahead and
it's going to close that.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.150
We'll go ahead and install
it to these eight machines.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.800
Again, what you're going to see,
there's task progress chugging away.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.600
Go ahead, copies it down,
and it goes and just invokes the

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.720
installer on the client machines.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.210
Gives me some information
about what's going on.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.070
All done.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.040
Success.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.840
So that's installing a package.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.580
That was pretty quick.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.460
But what other packages do you have?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.340
Lots of them.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.760
They're always going to need -- this
is a really easy way to push these

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.460
packages out to lots of clients.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.110
Again, we have eight machines here.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.560
This is going to work for 50.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.490
This is going to work for 100.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.460
So it's a real big time saver.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.300
Okay.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.030
So let's do -- let's say we
don't want to do a package.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.340
Another way that people like to
copy stuff around is to copy items.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.600
This is similar in install
package in that it's copying a

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.050
set of bits over to the machine.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.620
But what we're doing here is
we're just copying files or files.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.940
And what we're going to do -- what
we do is give the ability to copy

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.460
to the same relative location or a
bunch of other locations as well.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.740
Application folders,
current user of the logit.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.060
And then we're going to do a little
bit of the -- of the login machines,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.690
desktop folder, home directory,
whatever you want to do here.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.110
The other thing we'll do -- and I'm
going to show this to you a little bit

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.310
later -- is you can actually invoke
whatever the document or thing that

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.360
you're copying is after it's done.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.070
So you can actually say
-- copy a Word document,

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.890
have Word come up as well.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.980
So I'm just going to pull for -- let's
pull a new lock screen picture down here.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.090
We're going to put this
into the preferences folder

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.870
and we're going to copy it.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.480
Okay, copied.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.700
Success again.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.690
When is something going to go wrong?

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.720
All right.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.670
So just to show you what happened,
let's go ahead and actually use

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.260
task progress here for a second.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.560
Task history, sorry.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.800
So lock screen,
this is a task we ran a while ago.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.320
Just to show you what you can do
with this task history window,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.480
let's go ahead and
click on this guy here.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.510
Yep, that's right.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.110
Everything worked pretty well.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.300
I'm going to go ahead
and duplicate this task.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.120
What I just did here, I said, listen,
this task is done,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.040
but I want to duplicate it.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.460
I want to do the same thing to it.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.270
So lock again.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.970
Go ahead and close this
and lock the screen.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.480
Copy down a different image,
lock screen now to use that and

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.200
we also showed off reusing a task.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.200
Down here is a lot of
information in task history.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.200
It's a lot of stuff that you're
going to want to use again and again.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.200
Those are a couple quick ways to
get bits down to the computer.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.710
Copy items, we have the general concept
of soft distribution,

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.020
but you can also use it to push
out a lot of configuration files.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.100
With Mac OS X,
a lot of the applications are just

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.920
driven by configuration files.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.060
So by just the mere fact of copying
out a plist to the right directory,

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.260
you can pretty much reconfigure a bunch
of applications on the remote computers.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.740
Or what we also do is a lot of the
actual services that are out there,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.930
like the printing services,
you can just push out, for instance,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.930
the CUPSD config files out to the client
computers and you can enable computers

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.040
or disable computers for computers.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.720
So again,
a really powerful feature of the product.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.040
So the next category is asset management.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.100
And again, imagine, if you will,
you've got a sea of computers

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.250
out there and your boss told you,
you know, Tiger's coming out and

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.130
I need to understand,
you know, are we ready for it?

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.500
Or how much budget should I allocate?

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.020
For memory or, you know,
which computers do I need to

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.190
retire and get new computers?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.160
And again, imagine, if you will,
you had to go to each computer and,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.670
you know, go up,
bring up system profiler and, you know,

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.440
jot down what the various configuration
things are and put it into a spreadsheet.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.320
So we can kind of cut through all
that stuff with App Remote Desktop and

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.450
just those same computer lists that
you use for distributing software,

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.830
you can select those computer lists and
you can perform any number of software

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.500
or hardware reports on these computers.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.330
And we can give you, you know,
direct from the source information

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.180
on what the configuration
of those computers are,

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.590
again, both from a hardware and
software perspective.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.730
So the reporting functionality
on Apple Remote Desktop again

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.080
has been totally overhauled.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.680
It's a lot more comprehensive now.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.880
We've added seven new different
hardware report types.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.230
The amount of information we're
collecting now is orders of magnitudes

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.300
larger than the old version.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.720
Just to give you an example, ARD 1.2,
its system information report

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.780
collected maybe at most 30 attributes.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.980
Our new system overview report,
which is the replacement

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.200
of that old report,
now gives you over 100.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.840
And collectively,
there's over 200 different attributes.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.130
And if you want the full list,
you can go to the website because

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.000
I don't have it all memorized.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.120
So again, a lot more flexibility in
the way you report as well.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.160
What we're doing now is we're
actually caching this information.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.220
We have a built-in
SQL database in the product.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.880
So as we collect this information,
we'll store it in our SQL database.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.320
And if you know that the
configuration hasn't changed,

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.540
you can save yourself the
time of actually going out

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.710
and touching the client.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.740
You can just talk to the local database.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.950
Or you can force a refresh
of that data as well.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.180
So a lot more flexibility.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.760
And again, reporting is a task just
like all the other things.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.490
The other tasks we had,
so you can schedule these reports

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.590
to happen on a given frequency
or at a future date as well.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.710
So this is a list of all
the reports that we have.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.990
And again, brand new in this new version
are like PCI card reports.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.840
Or one of my favorites is the memory
report now because in the past we could

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.470
report to you how much memory you had.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.820
But again, if you're trying to plan
out your memory purchases,

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.430
you need to know if a
computer has 256 megs,

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.480
is that two 128 meg sticks or
is that just one 256 meg stick?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.130
So we can give you that information now.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.370
So again,
very detailed level of information.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.840
The storage reports, again,
lots of information

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:53.780
about your hard drives.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.160
So again,
encourage you guys to check it out.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:04.510
So we've also added a more kind of what
I call an advanced reporting system.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.930
So because what we're seeing out
there is notebook computers are

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.590
increasingly becoming more popular.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.610
And I think in education, for instance,
all these one-to-one

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.440
initiatives that we have,
it's changed the mix now.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.510
So I think roughly 50% of
the computers that we sell

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.880
into education are notebooks.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.100
And one of the challenges we had with
the old version of the product was that,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.520
again, notebook by definition
means somebody could be,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.080
you know, have the lid down.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.580
It could be asleep or they
could have taken it home.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.430
And so it's not on your network.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.900
So how do you figure out
what the configuration of

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.600
that notebook computer is?

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.390
So to address this need,
we have a new model for doing reporting.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.140
And the way it works basically is you
dedicate a machine on your network

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.610
that you always know is going to
be up and running because the admin

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.760
computers could follow the admin.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.200
You know, he or she might take it home.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.160
It's not always going
to be on the network,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.860
but you can designate a computer.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.060
An XServe would be an
excellent way to do that.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:03.880
So you would have a separate license
for that XServe or your server that

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.850
you've dedicated for this task.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.480
And then what you can do is you
can set the client settings.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.200
So there's a menu option,
Apple Remote Desktop 2,

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.890
where you can specify the client
reporting policies as to how often

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.020
it should report its information.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.010
So you can configure
that again centrally.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.150
You don't have to go
touching every computer.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.980
You can do that from the ARD console.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.980
And then what you do
is on the admin side,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.360
you specify there's a preference setting
that you can have the admin talk to

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.620
the XServe's database as opposed to
looking at its own local database.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.700
So essentially now you get a complete
loop here where the clients are sending

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.440
their information up to the XServe.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.560
And the admin,
when they're looking at information

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.130
about all the client computers,
they're looking at the

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.950
XServe as well now.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.380
So if the admin is offline,
the clients have a source to

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.020
report their information to.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.420
And if the clients are offline,
the admin can still look

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.080
at the last known state.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.580
So again,
we think this is a great solution

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:05.030
for all those notebooks out there
that you want to still keep track of.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.080
Reporting.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.260
So what we've done so far is
we've pushed a lot of bits out.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.390
Now we want to get those bits back.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.430
We want to know what kind
of deployment that we have.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.800
So we're going to run through
a couple of reports right now.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.720
What I'm first going to do is
just quickly talk about this kind

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.440
of designated offline reporting
collector that Nader just mentioned.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.520
What you look at when you
go into preferences here,

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.480
what you can do is,
this is my admin machine.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.010
You can actually specify a
different machine that you could

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.530
actually pull the data from.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.880
So the other part you'd have to
do after that if you set this is

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.900
actually go to your client settings,
manage those,

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.140
and you set the reporting policy.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.520
Again, a task, schedulable, configurable,
whatever you want to do.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.900
You can tell them how often,
all you clients out there,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.820
how often should I be blasting
my data up to this other machine.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.250
So this is again, as Nader said,
this is a great thing for mobile

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.140
computing when you don't know
whether the network is there or not.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:02.900
So reports, current application,
still locked.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.030
Let's unlock that.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.770
Unlock.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:09.680
Success again.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.330
All right.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:15.800
So first, let's just go do one of
the more popular reports,

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.160
system overview.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.390
What you're seeing here is
all the different data that

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.190
I can collect for this.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:22.760
I'm not going to go into all the details.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.960
Go ahead and get this report.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.760
All right.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.180
That was pretty fast.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.890
So let's talk about what's
going on there really quick.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.200
If you're familiar with 1.2,
the reports kind of were real time.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.700
What you saw there was almost
instantaneous response.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.200
The reason is it was cached.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.170
I was pulling it from cached information.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.080
So it's nice and speedy.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.930
If I was doing it the first time,
it would take a little bit longer because

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.110
all the clients would be basically
building up their caches the first time.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.660
So the first time you do this, you go,
"Wow, it's not as fast as Michael's

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.260
demo." That's what's going on.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.520
Okay.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.480
So the memory report,
which people really like.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.740
So it's very similar.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.620
You can specify slide identifiers,
module size, all the detailed

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.540
information that you want.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.620
Go ahead.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.660
Pretty gosh darn fast again.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.800
So let's go ahead and
take a quick look at this.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.370
There's all the detail that you need.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.100
It's a very,
very comprehensive memory port.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.260
While we're here,
I just want to point out we also have

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.640
the ability to print this information.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.560
If you want to export it,
all the reports have the ability to

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.260
export all this information as well.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.810
All right.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.610
Okay, so let's get a little,
just a little bit more here.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.500
Let's try another report.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.650
Let's do a software version.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.950
Hypothetical situation.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.470
New version of Safari is out and I want
to know who's got it and who doesn't.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.710
So I'm going to go ahead.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.170
These are all the actual applications
that I have on my admin machine.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.040
I'm saying, okay, where's Safari?

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.140
Go find Safari here.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.640
I'm going to go ahead and say, okay,
compare this,

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.000
the version that I have here to
all those machines out there.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.140
Speedy and fast.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.750
All right.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.100
So, as it turns out,
since these are all cloned

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.480
from a net install server,
they all have the same version.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.570
But hypothetically,
work with me for a second here.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.930
Remember what we said
earlier about computer lists.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.570
They're everywhere in the system.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.390
So let's say these first five
machines that I have here

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.070
have an odd version of Safari.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.740
It's a version I don't know.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.450
What we did at the very beginning of
this demo is we created a computer list.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.980
A computer list is really a simple thing.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.280
It's just a list of computers.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.320
But what I've done here in
the software version report

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.620
is I've got some information.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.080
And the information is this
is what version Safari is on.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.080
And these five machines have
something I want to follow up on.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.990
But I'm not going to do it right
now because I've got a lot of people

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.260
here and I've got other things to do.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.110
So I'm going to go ahead and
create a list here again.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.320
What it did was it took the main
window and it created a list.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.890
It said, okay, great,
from those machines.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.520
And these are old Safari.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.120
Huh?

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.060
I made a little note to myself
and I can go back later and I can

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.720
actually take a look at that.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.260
I've got my machines, right?

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.600
These lists are very powerful.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.540
You'll find yourself as
you start to use ARD a lot,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.720
you'll just be dumping
things in there all the time.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:57.900
It's kind of like a
post-it note for yourself.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:57.900
All right.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:57.900
So,

00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.700
That's about it.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.860
Those are all the ones I wanted to show.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.990
Nader?

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.220
Nadir Nafi: Okay.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.000
Thank you.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:08.140
And so we actually have another
session at this year's WWC.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.480
It's Friday at 3:00, I believe,
and it's in North Beach.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.340
And we've got three superstars,
Tony Graham, Steve Heyman and Mike Bombic

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.000
that are going to be talking
about how you can extend some

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.380
of the features we have in ARD.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.740
As I mentioned,
all our reporting now is in SQL database.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.090
So Mike and Tony are going to be showing
you some applications they built right

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.110
on top interacting with the SQL database.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.830
And just as an example of what
you guys can do too with your data

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.460
as you start using this product.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.780
So I just want to plug
that session there as well.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:44.100
All right, so the next category is
remote administration.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.600
And again,
ARD has a ton of products or excuse me,

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.120
features that help you
remotely administer.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.900
And we're trying to figure out how
the best way we can capture this.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.960
And so we had our graphic arts
person take a little remote control

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.930
and put those little commands on
instead of the numerical buttons.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.490
But that's essentially how ARD works
is essentially you have this

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.540
all-powerful remote control that just
by clicking on a couple of buttons,

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.940
you can influence a lot of computers.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.600
And you've already seen some of the
things that Michael's done by locking

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.540
screens by just a couple of clicks.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.480
These are very powerful.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.730
And again,
as you're doing your day-to-day duties,

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.290
you might have a need to remotely restart
all the computers or put computers

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.680
to sleep or empty the trash files.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.320
So this is a great
capability the product has.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:42.150
And so this is a complete list of
all the different admin commands that

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.770
you can perform on the computers.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.790
And again, you can select one or more.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:50.270
These are all tasks in the ARD2
nomenclature that we have now.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.990
So these can all be scheduled.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.040
They could be all saved.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.560
And so it just adds an
additional dimension of power

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.110
to these management verbs.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:05.880
And one new feature that we've
added here is the send Unix command.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.900
And this is my favorite command.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.070
And I think as more and
more people start using it,

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.340
it's going to grow even more popular.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:16.140
And again, to plug the Friday session,
Steve Heyman, who's like the wizard of

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.680
Unix scripting and stuff,
he's actually going to use

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.970
this to help you build your own
little software update server.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.380
So I know we have one
coming on Tiger Server,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.000
but you could use ARD today to
kind of whip up something yourself.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.550
So be sure to catch that.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.950
But what the send Unix command does is it
lets you type in either just a one-line

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.400
command or a whole sequence of commands.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.120
And it will go off and dispatch it
and have all your client computers

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.020
simultaneously execute that command.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.120
And the results are displayed
back on the console.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.340
And again, if they're successful,
they're successful.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.580
If there's any failures or errors,
you would see that.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.900
What we've also done, again,
Mac OS X has a ton of

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:58.400
command line utilities,
but what we've done to even

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.990
further that is there are two
command line utilities that we're

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.260
including with the ARD software.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.070
One is called Network Setup and the
other one is called System Setup.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.750
And you might recognize those names
because those are actually command

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.840
line utilities that Mac OS X server
started including with Panther.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.560
And these two command line
utilities essentially can set

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:22.610
the system preferences from a
command line for your network,

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.720
for energy saver,
as well as date and time.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.490
So, again,
being able to remotely set essentially

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:32.010
the time zone for all your computers,
I think that's just really,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.180
really powerful.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.380
And again,
all these Unix commands can be set up.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.020
scheduled.

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.420
So just to give you a sense of
how powerful these commands are,

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.300
just these two commands,
never mind all the other command

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.140
line tools we have in the Unix space.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.810
So these are all the different
options you can give to network setup,

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:49.140
right?

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:53.280
So there's this, and then there's that,
and this, and that,

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.580
and a little bit of that.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.360
So that was network setup.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.960
Should I go back?

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.370
Did everybody catch that?

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.290
And this is system setup.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.610
A little bit less powerful,
but still pretty good.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.680
So I'm going to ask Michael again
to come up and show us some of

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.050
these remote admin commands.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.080
Send Unix is cool.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.060
It's really cool.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.950
I'm going to show it to you in a second,
but maybe a good way to explain

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:21.340
it is to take a look at all the
things that ARD currently does.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.520
There's a lot of tasks there.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.880
I'm not going to go over all of these,
but the point is with Send Unix

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.700
is when you're stuck with these,
if there's something that ARD doesn't do,

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:32.300
Send Unix probably does.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.780
It's got a lot of
flexibility available to it.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.180
What we are talking about
is remote administration.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.390
The first thing I want to do
is I'm actually going to show,

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.650
I'm going to start using these
machines a little bit more,

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.780
a little more visual,
and we're getting into probably

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.060
what everyone wants to see,
which is the multi-observe,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.120
which is always a very demo-able feature.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.960
We'll go ahead and we're going
to do an open application here.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.940
Open application, again,
we're getting into more things that

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.740
are interactive with the machine.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.920
It gives you the ability to just open
an application on all the machines.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.840
You could do this with
Send Unix if you wanted to.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.110
So we'll go ahead and
just open up Address Book.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.750
There you go.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.540
More success.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.670
So, address book's open.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.420
Now what we want to do is we
want to close the application.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.290
Let's go ahead and select the
close application command.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.600
There is no.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.050
So what were they thinking, guys?

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.360
So what there is, is there's send unix.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:27.740
Okay?

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.490
So what we have here is we're going to go
ahead and use a command called kill all.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.600
Kill all goes and says any
process with this name,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.770
we're going to kill it.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.900
So kill all address book.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.490
Go ahead and send it.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.060
It's gone.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.680
I have no idea what you guys are
going to do with this command,

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.230
but I'm excited because it's really cool.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.800
So let's do another one.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.260
We'll go ahead and use one of
the network setup commands.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.200
Let's say we want to get the
Mac address from these machines.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.800
We'll go ahead and do a network setup.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.910
Get Mac address.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:14.630
Oh, right, on collaborative demo.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.400
Get Mac address, EN0.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.780
Is that right?

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.740
Okay, let's try this.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.650
Okay, we'll go ahead.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.200
Oh, command not recognized.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.180
He typed it wrong.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.530
We've got to do it again.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.240
Network setup.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:49.900
[Transcript missing]

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.530
I can type, I can type.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:51.980
All right.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:57.110
So you can also just do
get info on the machine.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.600
I thought I'd make it hard
because I'm an engineer.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.040
All right.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.950
So in preparation for the next set,
I'm actually going to do one other thing,

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.850
which is another powerful--
another powerful feature

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.120
kind of akin to SendUnix.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.580
What we're going to do is
we're going to do a copy item.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.380
What I'm going to copy down is I'm
going to copy down an Apple script.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.240
And what the Apple script is
going to do is it's going to start

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.320
doing things to this machine.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.660
It's going to be opening Safari.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.300
It's basically going to be
simulating user activity.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.990
But it doesn't matter what
Apple script you're going to write.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.740
You can actually do it-- you
can use the copy items to go

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.440
ahead and copy it and execute it.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.030
So we'll go ahead and we're going to
go and copy-- why am I doing this?

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.450
We can just do this.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.920
We're going to open up
our ARD assets folder.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.200
And then we're going to copy the script.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.240
We're going to put it
in the home directory.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.970
And we're going to go ahead and open it.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.730
And what you're going to see here is
it's telling me it's already there.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.030
So it's saying, wait, wait, wait.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.160
You want to blow it away?

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.420
Of course I do.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:51.980
All right.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.090
So there it goes.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.940
Machine started going.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.930
Again,
it's-- this is for-- I'll show you for

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.320
our multi-observed demo in a second.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.880
But the point is that any
Apple script you want to copy down,

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.660
you can do it the same
way just like send Unix.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.740
So that's it for remote administration.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.080
Nathan?

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.620
NATHAN CURTIS: Thank you.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.570
See, I knew Michael was
going to jinx this by--

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.300
Keep saying success, success.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.490
I knew it was going to
fail sooner or later,

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.220
but that's actually cool.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.750
You can actually see the tasks
do fail every now and then.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.070
All right, so we,
last but not least is remote assistance.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.570
And again, this is probably the feature
set that most people might

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.650
identify the product with,
but we just wanted to show you

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:31.280
that there's so much more to this
product than just the screen sharing.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.620
But the screen sharing, nevertheless,
is very cool because that's

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.520
probably the most visual part of it.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.560
As Michael said,
we've adopted the VNC protocol

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.340
for this new version.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:48.680
Mac OS X, it's all about open standards,
so whenever there's a standard

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:52.000
or open source project that
we can use which adds value,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.940
we will do that.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.460
So we've adopted VNC and we
use VNC for our screen sharing.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.580
Sample scenario is, again,
maybe in a training classroom,

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.880
whether it's corporate or in education,
you want to keep an eye on

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.300
what students are doing.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.180
Again, the computer list will show you
what Apple Remote Desktop is doing.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:17.060
So we've adopted the VNC protocol
for this new version.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:26.690
And again, this is probably the
most visual part of it.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:31.140
So for remote assistance, as we said,
we've adopted the VNC protocol.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.310
We've actually enhanced it because,
I mean,

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.600
the VNC is a great protocol and solution,
but I think there's two things that

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.120
people typically associate with it.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.560
One is that it's slow,
and I think Michael will just demo that,

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.620
so we'll put that to rest based on
some of the optimizations we've done.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.100
And the other thing is security.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:54.040
VNC, as it natively operates,
is somewhat insecure in the sense

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.950
that it transmits passwords in
clear text when you're trying to

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.700
authenticate against a client,
and that's a no-no, right?

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.120
So what we've done there is
we actually are using the

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:09.150
ARD communications channel to provide
you with a secure way to authenticate

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.680
against those remote computers.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.850
As well, any control events,
your typing or any mouse points,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.600
all that is encrypted.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.860
And we've also implemented using
AES 120-bit encryption as well,

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.860
which, again, is something VNC out
of the box doesn't do.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.140
You have to set up SSH tunnels
and all that kind of stuff,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.600
so we've made that easy for you as well.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:37.790
So that's the VNC and you can
individually take control of systems,

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.960
you can observe them.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.810
Because we're using the VNC protocol now,
if you happen to have VNC service

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.830
software running on a PC,
running Windows or Linux or you have

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.990
a Solaris box that's got VNC on it,
now you can control or observe

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:55.300
that computer straight from
the ARD console as well.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:58.240
And similarly now because we
have the VNC server software

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.870
built into the clients of ARD,
if you have it enabled

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:05.190
for outside access,
if you have a VNC viewer

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.760
installed in the PC,
you can now control a Mac.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.160
So this is one of the little byproducts
we got from adopting an open standard.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.300
So far the reception
has been really good.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.170
One of the unique things that
ARD does is it lets you view

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.000
multiple screens simultaneously.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.230
With the old version,
it was fixed at only four screens at a

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.760
time and the size was also fixed as well.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.700
So if you wanted to see bigger versions
of it or smaller versions of it,

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.180
you really couldn't.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.120
So again,
Michael will show this to you shortly,

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.510
but our new multi-observe window is
ultimately more dynamic and flexible,

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.360
allowing you to see up
to 50 screens at a time.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.220
We only have eight computers here,
but if you actually go back to

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.570
your company's organizations,
you'll be able to try

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.230
it out for yourself.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.850
And really what this is very
useful for is just again

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.720
providing end user assistance.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.350
So in a help desk type setting,
instead of waving your

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.570
hands over the phone saying,
"No, move your mouse this way,

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.270
move your mouse that way," you can
remotely control that screen and

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.530
show the user how it's being done.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.920
Or better yet,
you can actually send your screen,

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.180
so you can share your screen to
one or more Mac computers out

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.580
there so they can follow along
and see exactly what you're doing.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.700
So again,
this is very popular in education

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.600
or even in a corporate training lab.

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:33.740
And we also have some text messaging
features as part of the product as well.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.040
So you can send out broadcast
text messages to all your users.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.070
And we also have a one-to-one
computer-to-computer text chat.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.070
So I get this question a lot, you know,
why do you still have this?

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:45.960
There's iChat.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:51.950
Well, our computer-to-computer text chat
doesn't require any accounts and

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.000
it's strictly computer-to-computer.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.160
So it's still pretty handy.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.120
You don't have to worry about whether
iChat's installed or is working.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.820
And actually, a lot of places,
they turn off iChat because they don't

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.340
want people going outside of their,
you know,

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.840
their corporate firewalls and whatnot.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.860
So again,
this is a nice way that you can still be

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.600
able to do the chatting with end users.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.380
So I'm going to ask Michael to come
back and show you all the cool stuff.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.920
All the cool stuff.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.750
If you want to see 50
machines being observed,

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.900
come to my demo, 9:00 AM on Thursday.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.670
We're going to do it there.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.370
Right now,
we're going to do it with nine machines.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.020
OK, so multi-observe.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.140
As Nader said, this is what you're all
probably used to with ARD.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.290
Four machines.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:36.640
That's it.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:37.300
Ta-da!

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.860
That's all.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:40.770
Let's go a little bit bigger.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.290
All right.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.800
Here we are.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.530
Eight machines sitting here going ahead.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:47.480
What do you want to do to these?

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.340
You want to make them bigger?

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.090
You want to make them smaller?

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.530
You don't want eight machines,
you want less.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:56.790
Okay, that's great.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.600
You want to see the next ones?

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.080
Go ahead.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:07.700
- Yeah, we had to do it.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.380
What you're seeing here is
the timer is actually going,

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.400
right now I'd actually click there.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.200
What we have here is this timer,
and I'll talk about

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.100
each of these controls.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.400
It's going rather fast.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.330
What we're going to see is the timer,
if you just wanna look

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:20.990
at a lot of machines,
and you want to go ahead

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.770
and cycle through them,
you can set the adjusted time there.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.340
You can adjust the
amount of machines there.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.940
So as Nader said, we can go up to 50,
and that's a pretty cool demo.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.520
You can adjust the time,
you can actually just

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.580
turn it off completely.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.320
And what you're seeing here in
the last one is a quality codec.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.010
What we're doing here is we're
looking at it in thousands.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.370
We can also go up to millions,
which is a bandwidth hog.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.880
You can go down to a gray scale,
or you can even go down to something

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.060
that looks like an old version of the OS.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:51.420
So the idea here is that if you're
in a bandwidth constrained situation,

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.270
you wanna use a little less bandwidth,
you wanna go down to gray scale.

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.300
Uses a lot less bandwidth
for this sort of things.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.860
We'll go back up to thousands.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:04.280
Okay, so the other thing that's much more
improved than 1.2 is the ability to,

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.130
it's non-modal.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.860
If you wanna, just go,
I wanna get this guy over here,

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:12.400
make him small, and then I wanna go ahead
and observe this guy here.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.340
He's pretty big,
he's having some problems there.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.000
Oh, I want this guy too.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.480
Okay, oops, missed it.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.360
All right, it's already open.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.550
It's doing the right thing.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:22.920
Go ahead and open up another one.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.150
How many of these do you wanna open?

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.120
Just go ahead, it's very flexible.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.990
You can have as many of
these open as you want.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:31.830
And what we're looking at right
now is we're looking at observe.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.480
The other thing you can do, ooh,
the other thing before this is remember,

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.260
this is also a computer list.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.960
Computer list everywhere.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.810
Let's go ahead and lock
the screen from here.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.500
Again, let's do it.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.240
All the, there you go.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.200
Oh, someone's asleep.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.980
Someone's not happy.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:47.130
Something had to break.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.300
So there you go ahead,
and we can go ahead and unlock it,

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.800
and then we'll go ahead
and unlock those again.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.780
I'm going to come back.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:58.000
So the other thing is you can
actually control these machines.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.460
You can't multi-control because
that would be very hard so far,

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.200
maybe.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.390
And then so we'll go ahead and
bring in an observe window.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.340
I can't really do anything
to this window right now.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:11.380
But if you go ahead and
you click on control,

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.140
you've got control.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.760
Let's go ahead and move it around,
drag it about.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.910
The other things we have up here,
I've also got the script running

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.350
so I'm kind of fighting with it.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.320
The other thing we have in here
is the ability to share the

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.830
mouse control with the cursor.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.440
I mean the cursor with the user.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.750
So right now I'm sharing
it but if I click it off,

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.140
if someone's at the machine,
they can no longer access it.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:34.850
The other thing that we can do in here
is this is kind of big so let's do this

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.460
and make it a little smaller for us.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:41.180
But now I want to move around a little
bit so we got panning mode as well.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.230
Go ahead and move it all around
and do what you need to do there.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.170
So different screen resolutions,
however you want to do it.

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:50.300
It's a very,
very flexible part of the system.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.420
Part of the application.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.340
And again, you have the codec change
if you need it here as well.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.000
The last one is if you
want to take a screenshot,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.740
just go ahead and click it,
throw it on the desktop, give it a name.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:02.370
So if you want to grab something as well,
you can do it from

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.580
So that's multi-observe.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.670
The other part-- thank you.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.320
going on here?

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.510
Okay anyway.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:16.780
Unlock that.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.390
Yeah, yeah yeah.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:19.520
Okay got it.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.170
Okay.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:22.650
So let's go ahead and get rid of this.

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:26.060
So the other side of multi-observe
is actually send screen.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.470
Now the send screen is for more
of the institutional environment.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:31.730
When I--I've got something on this screen
that I want you guys to see when I don't

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.640
have this big huge projector behind me.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.570
So what send screen is it actually sends
the screens down to all the machines.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.880
So what we're going to go
ahead and do is we're going

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.230
to go ahead and select a task,
send screen, quickly on this screen.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.910
Right now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to send the screen on this machine.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.930
What you'll see is I can
share another screen as well.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.460
What I can do with ARD is I can
actually broker an agreement and say,

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.190
"You, this screen,
share to all these other screens."

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.180
So you can actually set that
up if you've got some sort of

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.180
complex setup that you want to do.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.440
But we're just going to use
the admin one right now.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:01.440
You go ahead

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:03.440
There you go.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.700
Send screen.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.870
You're up.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.160
Obviously, if you have multiple going on,
you can sit here and stop them.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.040
You'll probably notice that task
progress right now is still going.

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:17.040
Why is it going?

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.900
It's going because the send
screen task is still going,

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.390
right?

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.840
This is confusing some people.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:27.030
So go ahead and stop it,
and there you're done.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.720
What everyone else was probably
wondering about is it's VNC,

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.200
right?

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.700
So there's other
computers you can look at.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.690
Let's go ahead and take
a look at this one here.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Thank you.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
I'm going to tell me land.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Anyway.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
No.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.960
It's... So...

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.860
So we have an XP machine here as well.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.170
We're running the VNC server on it.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:55.640
And we have control over everything else.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.450
So if you have PCs, if you have Licks,
desktops, go ahead and use it.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.540
You'll see it's the same control.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.200
You don't have all the
other tasks against it.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.520
It's just the control and multi-observe.

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.060
And just to show you,
if you can go ahead and click that

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.420
machine there a little bit slower,
you can go ahead and see it's just

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.190
like any other machine that you have,
right?

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.260
So the assets, you have PCs out there,
obviously.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.990
Your asset, you need to get to those,
you now have the ability to

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.100
do that via this console.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.080
We think that's a big
win for this application.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.880
And with that,
I think that's all we're going to demo.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.410
We're just going to go ahead and restart
all the machines with our last task.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.620
We'll go ahead and
manage and restart them.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.200
And that's it.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.620
So as we're restarting,
I wanted to plug another

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:37.920
session that we have.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.600
It's desktop management technologies.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.200
They are cranky about
something not being saved.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.600
It's on Thursday at 9 a.m.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.790
We're going to have a little
bit more ARD demo with a

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:47.110
little more cowbell in it.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.070
We're going to have
mobile home directories,

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:51.840
software update server.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.290
If you're interested
in managing desktops,

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:56.280
9 a.m.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.790
in Russian Hill,
we'll be going over that.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.790
And that's all I got.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.790
Nader?

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.790
Thanks.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.800
So that's our new screen sharing.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.780
And again, it was implicit.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.240
Michael didn't really highlight it,
but I think the performance

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:14.900
is very good too.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.480
I mean, as those screens were updated,
you could see that in the multi-observe.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.840
And again, that's something we didn't
have with the old product.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.380
At least it wasn't as fast.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.940
So there you go, Apple Remote Desktop,
desktop management easy.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.560
And I know everybody in
the room here got a copy,

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.360
but just when you go back home
and you want to tell your friends

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.430
and relatives and colleagues that
they should buy a copy as well,

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:37.180
that's our pricing model.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.460
We license it per admin.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:41.520
So every administrator needs
to have their own copy.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.420
And we have a small office,
home office version of this,

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.600
which is called a 10 client version.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.900
With that version, your computer list,
that master computer list

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.700
can only have 10 computers.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.820
You try to add 11 computers,
we're not going to let you do it.

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.400
So by and large,
most of our larger customers get

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.730
the unlimited client version.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.450
You can add as many
computers as you want,

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.580
create as many computer
lists as you want.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.840
And so for additional information,
you can contact me.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.580
Skip Levins is also maybe
someone in the room here.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.400
He's our technology manager.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.320
And if you're a developer,
you can also contact him.

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.330
This is a link to all our documentation.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.140
Again,
you have the documentation in your CDs,

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.000
but if you want to go,
you can go visit our website.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.400
I should also plug the
admin guide for ARD2.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.920
The old admin guide used
to be like 30 pages.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.120
It was a little handbook, essentially.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.220
The new version is over 100 pages.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.430
So again,
hats off to our docs person for doing a

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:40.340
great job on the new ARD2 admin guide.
