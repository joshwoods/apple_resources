00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.500
Hello everybody,
my name is Brian Schmidt.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.330
I'm the product manager
for DVD Studio Pro.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.900
Very excited to be showing you
the app today and talk about

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.100
DVD Authoring a little bit.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
And one of the big things for
our whole Pro Apps team is like

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.460
it's all about the customer.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.420
So we're really focused on
delivering what our customers need.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.200
And the way we really get
our satisfaction is seeing

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.680
what our customers do.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.500
At NAB this year we actually
did a little thank you reel,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.740
kind of a tribute to our customers.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.380
And if you're at the keynote you may
recognize a little bit of the style.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.260
But I wanted to play it
for you real quick and then

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.580
we'll get into DVD Authoring.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.560
Who was at the
Final Cut Pro things this morning?

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.070
So you guys have probably already
seen this so bear with me and

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.860
then we'll get on with it.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.960
I've said this a hundred
times and I still like it.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.810
So to get an idea of the kind of
people we have in the crowd today,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.000
how many people have
authored a DVD to begin with?

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.600
Like one DVD.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.240
Good number of you.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.790
How many have done it
with DVD Studio Pro?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.090
Okay, so you're all pretty
familiar with DVD Authoring.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.230
Anybody actually developing content
for people who are authoring DVDs,

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.530
like maybe menus or transitions or any
kind of third-party stuff like that?

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.500
A few of you?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.650
Okay, great.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.190
Let's go ahead and switch to the slides.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.680
Great.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.220
So as you can see with that demo reel,
especially when you look at, like,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.970
the DVD Studio Pro customers,
they're all over the board.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.800
There's a lot of people
using DVD Studio Pro for

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.380
a wide variety of tasks.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.070
And so...

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.920
DVD Studio Pro-- it's a
pretty unique application,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.110
really.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.570
Because we looked at it and we said,
"DVD authoring has this

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.950
reputation for being really hard,
and you have to be a rocket

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.910
scientist to do it." We wanted to
give people a scalable interface

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.360
that you could actually grow
with as you grow with a product.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.450
So when you're first starting with
DVD authoring with DVD Studio Pro,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.460
we made it so that it's
relatively simple to get going.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.000
As you want to start adding more
advanced features to the disk,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.800
you can do that through
our scalable interface.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.620
We added these powerful design tools.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.960
So you can now design menus
right inside the application.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.240
You can do transitions.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.000
You can design these things in
third party tools and easily

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.000
integrate them into the application
using the tools you already use,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.520
like After Effects, or Photoshop,
or Final Cut Pro, and soon, Motion.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.690
Has anybody seen Motion yet?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.960
A few of you, that's good.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.070
It's a really cool app.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.160
And then on top of that,
we really go deep.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.460
It's a very technically deep application.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.370
So that when you need the features
that you might not use 99% of the time,

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.080
that 1% of the time you need it,
they're there.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.580
And so you can deliver the kind of
DVDs that your clients really want.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.140
And going back to the point
I was making earlier about

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.000
people using DVD Studio Pro,
it's a pretty wide variety of people.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.250
We saw in the reel,
Criterion Collection has done a

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.580
couple of DVDs with DVD Studio Pro.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.480
Criterion,
for those of you who don't know,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.730
is really an excellent
DVD authoring house.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.280
They really pride themselves
on special features and doing a

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.220
great job of really portraying
a DVD and a movie in its light.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.430
We're also seeing people using
it as corporate projects,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.560
weddings, special events type usage,
and even ad agencies,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.030
post houses are doing things.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.240
We're seeing boutique shops,
like the American Splendor

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.540
example that was on the reel.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.500
We actually have-- there's a company
called Twinklin in New York that

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.650
designed the DVD menu system with
DVD Studio Pro and then handed it

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.350
off to a company and they finished
it in another really super high end,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.750
very expensive authoring tool.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.370
So there's a lot of variety in
the usage of DVD Studio Pro.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.970
Let's talk a little bit
about the interface.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.070
So here we have three different
modes you can start out with,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.020
basic, extended, and advanced.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.160
This is the basic mode,
and it's basically menu editor with some

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.340
other panels in the background there,
and the templates and other

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.290
content options you can use.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.720
And then it goes all the
way to the advanced mode.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.480
This is actually the extended.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.560
No, this is advanced, I'm sorry.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.380
But you have the assets here on the left.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.560
You've got the timeline,
you've got the graphical view,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.760
you've got the menu editor.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.110
And so on.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.990
So it really kind of blossoms out to
become this DVD authoring powerhouse.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.620
The transitions.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.580
These are new with DVD Studio Pro 3.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.490
You can see the example
just kind of flew by there.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.060
They give you real-time previews.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.690
You don't have to render
anything and wait for things

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.720
to actually happen to see them.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.430
When you actually build your menus,
they incorporate the menu content that

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.640
you build into the transitions and
build completely new chunks of video.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.530
Prior to this,
people had to go back to After Effects.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.570
Design the whole transition in there,
drop it in DVD Studio Pro,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.020
and do a couple other
things to set that up.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.850
And then if that menu changed that
they were actually transitioning from,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.010
they had to go back into After Effects,
redo everything, bring it back in,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:55.570
and update it.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.300
Now all that just happens
for you automatically.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.530
You can create your
own alpha transitions,

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.100
which we'll actually show you
how you can build those in

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.910
After Effects a little bit later.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.160
And moving on to the templates and menus.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.720
We added templates
primarily to After Effects.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.720
Primarily to help people
get started DVD authoring.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.880
Because when we came out with
DVD Studio Pro 1 so many years ago,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.450
one of the complaints we got is like,
it does a lot, it's a great app,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.860
but you look at it and you don't
know where to get started and

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.510
you have to do a lot of things to
actually get going with the DVD.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.530
So we added these great looking templates
that you can just drop into your project,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.820
start working,
start adding your video content,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.300
and get a DVD done really
quickly your first time around.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.030
Then you can create additional
templates that you then reuse and

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.270
modify as you need them for projects.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.260
And we also have an
advanced slideshow editor.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.080
So you can do things like drop in slides,
add transitions to the slideshows,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.920
add audio to them,
fit audio to the slides,

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.120
add audio per slide.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.630
There's a lot of different
options in there,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.960
a lot of possibilities.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.990
The workflow, um,
one thing we really knew we had to

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.440
do was work well with Final Cut Pro.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.380
Um, we do that with the chapter markers
and compression markers in Final Cut.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.780
When you actually export everything
out through a compressor,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.900
everything gets maintained right into
DVD Studio Pro from the chapter markers.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.930
Compression markers get
set in Final Cut Pro,

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.660
automatically forces iframe,
so you get better encodes.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.900
With Motion,
we've done some really cool integration

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.380
things I'll show you in my demo.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.720
And, uh, we've even improved
Photoshop integration.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.680
We've been able to import
layered Photoshop files.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.300
Now we can do launch
and edit with Photoshop,

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.490
so it makes it a much more
seamless working experience.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.490
And then we've also borrowed
a lot from the iLife,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.540
uh, world,
and I'll show you that in my demo.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.690
The graphical view is really cool
because it lets you lay out your project.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.100
So you can keep an eye on
what the disk is doing.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.290
So you can keep everything in
your head much better just by

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.660
glancing at the graphical view.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.670
So you can see how things
are connected to each other.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.700
You can print this so you
can show it to a client,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.100
maybe put it on your wall so you can
see the DVD while you're working on it.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.520
It's just a great communication tool.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.530
And then you can also use
it to help author your DVD.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.680
And I'll show you a little
bit of that in the demo.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.530
When you talk about
the advanced features,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.010
it kind of becomes this big grab bag
of all these really powerful things

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.040
that you need to do in DVD authoring
that prior to DBCO Pro being around,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.260
you were paying thousands and thousands
of dollars to get these features,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.300
to do things like subtitling,
to do things with end jumps on

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.440
chapter markers and stories,
buttons over video,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.830
multiple video angles, all this stuff.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.240
We give you all of this power
in an application that's $499.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.300
This is unheard of.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.670
And with DBCO Pro 3,
we've added some things like jacket

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.190
picture creation so that when
somebody hits stop on the DVD player,

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.780
you can put a picture of your product up,
or the couple if you're doing a wedding,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.340
or the film logos if
you're doing a movie,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.500
and so on.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.780
It comes to professional features.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.840
Again, we have the timeline so you can do
so many things with our timeline.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.160
You can string together video
clips so you don't have to have one

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.550
sequential piece of video in there.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.940
You're doing a lot of different
things with chapter markers.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.680
You can attach script to chapter points.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.640
You can do end jumps on chapter markers.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.200
You can do buttons over video,
all kinds of great stuff with that.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.130
The encoding,
we've done a couple of different things.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.030
One is if you want to just use QuickTime,
you can drop a QuickTime movie

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.390
into DVD Studio Pro and we'll
encode it for you in the background

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.400
or when you build your disc.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.420
We also run it straight out
from Final Cut Pro through a

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.380
compressor and you can drop
QuickTime movies into the compressor.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.160
The compressor lets you do
batch files with presets.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.080
It lets you do a lot
of really cool things.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.190
New with the Compressor 1.2 version
that's with DVD Studio Pro 3 is the

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.160
ability to scale your HD content.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.280
You have your DVC Pro HD content and
it scales it down to SD resolution so

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.540
you can take this great looking source,
punch it out to MPEG-2 that will work

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.380
on today's DVD players so you don't
have to wait for that next generation.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.380
We've also got a new generation of
HD DVD to come out in a few years to

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.120
actually take advantage of HD content.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.450
You can still reap the
benefits of that today.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.500
And we're one of the very few
applications to actually include a Dolby

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.170
Digital Professional quality encoder.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.700
Some other applications around our
price range do include Dolby encoders

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.800
but they're the consumer level.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.040
So that means you can't put the
DVD or the Dolby Digital logo on your

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.220
DVDs when you actually ship it out.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.670
Our encoder gives you that professional
quality encoder that Dolby signs off

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:21.440
on that lets you actually add their
logo to your AMERI cases for your DVDs.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.760
And we're very standards happy.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.540
We support QuickTime, MPEG-1, MPEG-2,
FullD1, CropD1, HalfD1,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.460
any kind of video format
you basically want.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.480
All kinds of audio formats
including DTS with DVD Studio Pro 3.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.370
So that means now you can offer your
clients all of the audio that they need.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.870
You can do uncompressed audio,
you can do Dolby Digital audio,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.920
you can do DTS, all kinds of stuff,
basically doing everything possible.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.510
Also with media we now write
out to drives that support -r,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:56.840
-rw, +r and +rw and we'll master out
to all the major formats as well,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.860
DLT, DDP and CMF.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.100
And it's available now.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.140
You can buy DVD Studio Pro for $499.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.370
It's a $199 upgrade.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.400
And let's go ahead and take
a look at it real quick here.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.390
So I'm going to show you...

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.640
Pretty good look at all the
features in DVD Studio Pro.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.270
And then I'm going to ask Doug DeVore
from our QA team to come up and show

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.390
how alpha transitions are actually made.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.900
So you can get a look at the settings
you need to make in After Effects,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.400
how you can use motion to create
these alpha channel transitions,

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:30.400
and so on.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.340
So you can start creating your own
because it's a really powerful feature.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.400
You can start creating
your own alpha transitions,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.200
integrate them into your content,
and just go from there

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.130
and just reuse them.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.810
So here we have the basic view and these
are some of the templates and I'm just

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.240
going to drag in one of the templates.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.210
And it just pops up on the screen
and if I want to go over here to say,

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.860
let's go to the stills tab.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.480
And if I had any photo
albums from iPhoto,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.860
those would actually show up
in my stills tab up there.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.210
So you can see that iLife integration.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.160
Same goes for the audio tab.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.920
If I had iTunes playlists,
they all show up in the audio tab.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.090
You can just drag in directly from those.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.800
So I can drag a photo down
here into a drop zone.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.180
It may not be the most
appropriate picture.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.300
Let's try this one.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.230
Okay, that looks a little bit more.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:20.790
Okay.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.900
And then if I want to make a connection,
let's say I want to drop this

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.610
second template that matches
this template onto this button.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.340
I just drag it to the button.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.190
Let's get that button.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.690
And it's going to add that.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.300
Make a connection for me,
make a new menu, and link all that up for

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.870
me just with a simple drag.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.860
It's kind of how DVD authoring should be.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.940
So now when I go to the simulator,
you can see it's a

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.940
motion menu background.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.740
I hit that button.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.480
It actually is going to
generate this for me on the fly,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.240
this transition,
using my content that I just created,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.180
creating that whole new
chunk of video automatically.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.730
So I can hit the main button.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.720
We'll go back to that menu.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.390
So you can kind of get an idea of how
powerful that feature actually is.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.620
Let's back out of this a little bit.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.770
Okay.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.200
And then I mentioned the extended mode.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.990
So I can hit F2.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.640
F2 launches.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.420
And we have the timeline
extended across the bottom.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.560
Got the assets up in the upper left.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.390
We have the menu here.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.710
The menu up there and inspector
shows up and all this stuff.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.530
And you'll notice that when
I go to the configurations,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.380
I can go to these menus.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.400
It's going to now add a fourth quadrant.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.450
And so what we did when we designed
DVCR Pro is we built this four

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.390
quadrant system so that when you're
actually working with the app,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.520
you can customize all this.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.180
So if I want, say, in this view,
if I want the track editor to be

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.680
all the way across the bottom,
I just drag it across.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.040
And I can drag that out.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.150
I can grab this and move that up,
make all these things slower.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.290
I can pull these tabs out,
do all kinds of things,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.680
save those configurations.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.620
And so I can reuse those
configurations just by hitting F keys.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.040
And so it's a really fast way to work.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.980
If you're doing subtitling,
you like a certain layout for subtitling,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.560
you create that,
save it as a configuration,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.440
go to it when you're subtitling,
and then go back to something

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.410
like the advanced view when
you're doing your normal working.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.300
Now, I mentioned you can
save your own templates.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.340
And that's what I've done here.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:17.000
So throughout the course of this seminar,
I'm going to create a demo reel that

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.830
actually BlackBox Digital created.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.480
They do some really high-end
effects processing and things like

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.900
that for Hollywood commercials,
things like that.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.280
And they made their demo reel disk with
DVCR Pro so they could theoretically

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.280
get more clients if they needed them,
and just by giving out this demo reel.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.980
this DVD and showing
off their great work.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.310
Okay, so I just dragged a template in.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.060
This template has a few elements in here.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:51.460
This is just a Photoshop document right
there with an alpha channel in it.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.620
These are buttons,
so I can click on these

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.550
and just drag them around,
move them wherever I want.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.360
So then I can grab video.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.660
I'll just grab this music video clip
up here and just drag it down here.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.370
So you notice when I get this
context-sensitive drop palette,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.980
it actually is looking at what I'm
dragging and where I'm dragging it to.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.420
And give me a relevant list,
a short list of options of what

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.920
I could actually do with that.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.070
So this does a couple
of different things.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.640
One, it saves you a lot of time when
you're first getting started.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.190
Because if you don't know exactly how
to set something up or what to do,

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.630
this will do it for you.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.180
So if I just drag it on
here and say create track,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.290
I drop it, and it actually creates
a new track for me.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.540
You can see it up in the graphical view.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.500
And it linked it to that button.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.570
So it took care of a few steps for me.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.340
I didn't have to know, okay,
so I need to go into the menu, the menu,

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.610
select the button,
go over here and change this

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.550
target and do this other,
you know.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.860
I didn't have to know all that stuff.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.880
That drop palette took care of it for me.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.590
So it's kind of a mini way of authoring,
of automating the program.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.000
Now, in the graphical view,
I can just drag these things

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.040
around to keep them organized.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.910
And I'll just kind of play with that a
little bit more and show you a little

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.540
bit more about the graphical view when
we get to have more content in there.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.700
So I'm going to take another template
and create a submenu on this one.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.100
So I'll drag this template.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.820
And you'll notice there's only one
thing that really makes sense when

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.740
I drag a template into a button,
so it just gives me the one option.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:24.780
And I'm going to drop it on there.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:24.780
And so you can see now it
created a menu 2 for me.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.340
"So you can select different
things in the graphical view,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.390
it will show you in the menu editor
what you are actually playing with.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.700
And then I can go in and create,
I want to put some slide shows on this,

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.410
so I'm going to go to
this design folder here,

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.080
and this folder right here,
for the people up in the front two rows,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.480
you can see that those
are actually PSD files.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.460
You can just drag this in,
and this time it knows

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.670
I have a folder of slides,
so it knows I probably want

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.460
to create a slide show,
so that's the first option,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.070
or else I could create
a bunch of buttons,

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.450
I could create a bunch of sub menus.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.300
So I'm just going to choose
create buttons and slide show,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.890
so it makes the slide show
button there use it for me.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.190
And I'm going to get this
arranged a little bit.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.860
And that is my corporate ID stuff,
so I'm just going to call

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.220
this button Corporate ID.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.700
So I can just name buttons
in there pretty easily.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.770
And let's go ahead and
add a couple more slides.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:26.010
Let's get the promos, drop that in there,
create another slide show.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.310
Get one more.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.120
I'll grab the tunes.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.810
And you'll notice that the, um,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.150
These buttons are all coming in with
their little thumbnail on them already,

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.990
the preview of it.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.300
That's just because with the template,
that's the default button I created.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.640
So every button that gets added
uses that template or that button.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.930
So to kind of show you what I mean,
this button is a different button,

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.340
so I can control click on it.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.510
And there's an option here that
says set as default button style.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:06.640
So now when I drag in
this movie to add a new,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.410
create a button and a track with this,
it actually uses that

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.520
button for that movie.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.730
Thanks, I'll just do that.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:20.410
All right,
now what I want to do is actually...

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.900
changed my slideshow around a little bit,
because we found that people

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.140
weren't actually using our slideshow
editor in DVD Studio Pro because,

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.100
well, it was a good slideshow editor.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.620
There wasn't really anything
wrong with how we built it.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.860
It was more that they were
doing them in Final Cut.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.100
And we weren't really sure why
they were doing it in Final Cut.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.710
And it turns out that they
didn't like those hard cuts.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.840
And we're actually going into Final Cut,
adding transitions in between these

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.420
hard cuts so that it would be like
a dissolve from side to side or

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.070
a fade through color or whatever.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.010
One of the things we wanted
to do was make that really

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.490
easy to do in DVD Studio Pro.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.830
So you didn't have to do
that in Final Cut because

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.880
if you do it in Final Cut,
you want to make a change,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.940
you've got to go back to Final Cut,
make the change,

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.250
export out of Zimpeg 2 again,
then bring it back in.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.680
So we made it so that you could -- I'll
just double-click on the slide button

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.890
and it actually shows me in the viewer
now the slide show and down below it,

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.280
it switched to the slide show editor,
so now I have all this.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.660
And if I want to add a
dissolve to all these slides,

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.770
it's just as simple as saying dissolve.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.300
Picking that from the pop-up.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.100
And then when I hit play,
now we just automatically build the

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.150
slide show with dissolves on it.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.080
So if you want to go back
now and reorder one of these,

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.300
let's say I want to drag this
moon crescent one up to the top,

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.280
then I hit play,
it just rebuilds it for you.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.620
So you don't have to
go back to Final Cut.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.820
You don't have to redo all that stuff.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.540
It just does it here in
the application for you.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:51.440
On top of that,
we added the ability to do different

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.130
transitions for each slide.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.480
So I have the dissolve on the first one.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.160
I can do a cube.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.390
And we have little parameters
in here you can set.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.720
So I set this to a one second cube,
which actually turns

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.800
out to be kind of cool.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.780
This one is a droplet.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:13.430
And I'll go in and add maybe a
fade-through color on this one.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:14.580
And let's go ahead and put some,

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.120
We're going to do some alpha transitions
on a couple of these so you can get an

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.000
idea of what more of those look like.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:33.910
A little fog, maybe a lens flare,
static is a good one.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:41.520
Then my personal favorite,
the remote control.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.890
All right, so now I can just
Control-Click on this menu,

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:45.100
hit Simulate.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.300
The simulator lets me
simulate the entire project,

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.970
or I can just pick a part of the project
and choose Simulate from that menu,

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.210
like I just did here,
to go directly to that piece.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.270
So then I can click on this button,
and it will play back as

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.830
if it was on a DVD player.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.870
So you can see now how these transitions
are actually working in the Slideshow.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.380
There's my cube.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.230
A little droplet.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.540
Fade through color.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.930
Static.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.660
The fog.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.800
So Doug,
I think you're going to show that one,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.200
right?

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.200
Excellent.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:35.150
You guys can learn how to make your
own remote control transitions.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.320
All right,
so now I've got a few things going

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.300
on on my graphical view still.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.850
Let's go ahead and hit shift spacebar,
and that expands it out,

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.640
because this is another thing we notice.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.320
It's like people have a lot of
tiles in their graphical view.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.010
You want to have a way to
quickly do it full screen,

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.460
so you just sit here
and do shift spacebar,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.050
and it'll actually expand
that view out for you.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.450
So you can work with all
these in a much bigger space.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.570
So I can drag these around.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.490
Say I want the slideshows
to look over here,

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.520
go like this.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.220
I can drag all of these out.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.830
I can hover over these,
and it puts a little flag

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.210
when I just hit the F key.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.920
So if you're not done working
on a menu or something,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.500
you can flag it so you don't
have to go back to it later.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.260
And this is really cool,
because now I can see that I have

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.390
three slideshows attached to this menu.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.340
I've got this menu one that
goes to this video here,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.610
and I have this commercials trailer.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.700
And I've got this soundtrack that
hasn't been attached to anything,

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.660
because there's no arrows
showing anything going on there.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.150
So immediately I know there's a problem.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.370
I need to fix that.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.380
Can you add comments?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.530
No, not right at this point.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.660
Question was can you
add comments to this?

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:52.440
And the only thing you can do
at this point is flag items.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.250
And so then I can hit Shift Spacebar.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.310
It goes back,
but I have a little problem because

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.860
it's all kind of hidden now.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.680
Shift Z actually fits
it all to that window.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.530
So there's a lot of little
accelerator keys in here,

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:04.480
so you can zoom around.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.360
You can hit the M key.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.300
Brings up this little macro view,
so you can actually zoom around inside

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.700
of it if you have a really big project.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.060
By the way,
if you have a really big project,

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:15.820
I have an answer.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.350
30-inch display.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.110
Phenomenal.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.200
It is absolutely wonderful.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.860
Okay, and then there's some other
things in here you can do,

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.580
like you can show relative
connections on this.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.070
So this is pretty cool because you
can step through a disk and see,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.330
okay, this menu goes to these two things,
this menu goes to these three things,

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.060
and so on.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.320
It really comes in pretty handy.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.250
Okay, now I want to hook up this
commercials tile here.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:50.090
And when I double click on that again,
it shows me the clip and the

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.830
viewer and then the timeline,
so everything I really need

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.100
to do to play with this clip.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.530
And you can see down the timeline here,
I've got those little purple

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.950
chapter markers above the clips.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.350
These are all actual individual clips.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.990
So a lot of times when you're
doing a demo reel like this,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.140
you have content that was created
at all kinds of different times.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.300
So you want to be able
to see what's going on.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.580
And you can see that you can actually
be able to string them all together,

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.030
even though one may have
been done in January,

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.480
one was done in February, and so on.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.540
So DVC-RO Pro gives you
the ability to do that.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.690
And I can even go in here and grab
a new commercial that just got

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.540
done and drag it to the timeline,
just pops it in.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.350
It automatically knows
to grab the audio there,

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.880
so it was right next to
it with the same name,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.520
so it pulled it in for me.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:36.070
And then I can use this,
the control menu.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.940
to add a chapter marker there
to the clip end and just name

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:46.070
it up here in the inspector.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.340
OK, and so then I just type in a name.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.060
I can do other things on that
chapter marker if I'd like.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.430
Then I can go back to the menu,
and I want to actually

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.440
add it to menu one.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.900
So I'm going to take this tile and
I can drag things directly in from the

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.480
graphical view to the menu editor now.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.580
And I'll just drag it into this button,
and this time it's saying, ah,

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.510
you maybe want to create a
chapter index with this because

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.150
I have chapter markers in here.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.630
So that's exactly what I want to do.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.810
So I'm going to hit chapter index,
go to a template that was

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.330
designed to be an index,
hit OK.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.100
So now, DvD Sphere Pro in the background
has created a new menu for me with a

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.010
bunch of buttons on it all linked to

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:37.110
"So, I've got the commercials track
right here and that menu.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.400
And so then you can see that
each of those buttons up there,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.530
so you can see the first
one is mini carbonation,

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.400
relates to this chapter marker and so on.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400
So each of those buttons
is hooked up for me.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.400
All in all, that was about 25 steps if
I had to do it manually.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.400
So, the only thing I really have to
do on my own is give this a name.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.060
Okay, and I'm done with that.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.280
So now when I go play this menu,
it's actually going to navigate

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.100
directly to the individual movies.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.140
Okay.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.160
Let's do one more thing.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.490
I want to show a quick
example of multiple angles.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.660
Let's go ahead and grab the...

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.000
So I'm going to import a whole folder.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.790
And now I have--

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.590
Budweiser before spot and an after spot.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.860
So this is some work that
BlackBox did for a Bud spot.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.660
I'm going to go ahead and drag
the-- let's put the after in V1.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.320
So I'll just drag it in here
and drop that clip on here.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.710
So it just made a track for me.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.520
It knew I had video.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.720
Made sense.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.380
If I pull this down now, it shows me V1,
V2.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.860
And we go all the way up to V9,
or video nine.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.210
So that's nine video angles.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.940
Video angles are very useful
for some very specific purposes.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.880
All the way from things
like usability testing,

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.370
where you may want to have
a camera on the person,

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.860
a camera on the computer screen,
a camera on the mouse and the keyboard,

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.930
and maybe a full edit.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.300
So you could have the
full edit in video one,

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.090
and then the keyboard on video two,
and the person on video three,

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.100
and the computer screen on video four.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.780
So that any given time, you can say, oh,
I want to see what was actually

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.270
happening on the keyboard at this time,
even though the editor

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.680
chose to show me the person.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.540
So it's got some pretty
cool uses like that.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:33.100
Then there's other commercial uses,
like there's a BMW disc out where they're

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.680
actually driving the car down the road.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.390
You can look at it from the front,
from the side, from the back,

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.550
from the driver's perspective, and so on.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.660
So it's a pretty cool way
to actually give people the

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.060
full experience of the car.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.260
So a lot of really clever uses for this.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.360
And another one is this one right here.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.230
If I drag in the before spot here.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:57.670
So this allows BlackBox to
show the compositing work that

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.590
they've actually done for a spot.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.540
The after spot here,
so you can see now the

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.160
clouds and all this stuff,
but if I go back to video two,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.310
you can see the clouds and
everything weren't there.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.900
So a client could actually watch this
and switch between angle one and angle

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.150
two and see the before and after of this.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.800
Actually a really kind of
a cool spot of this horse.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.810
So they have the horse's eye,
you can see the trainer and

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.480
another horse in the background.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.430
And then you go to
that and it's actually,

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.190
they put a lightning bolt in there.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.190
So then you can actually hook these up
to different buttons in DVD Studio Pro.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.290
So you could have a button
that just played angle 1,

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.700
a button that played angle 2.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.310
You could give people instructions
to hit the angle button to

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.690
switch between the angles.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.700
And this is pretty cool too.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.570
Blue screen.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.830
So you can really get a sense of the kind
of work they do through the DVD medium.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.830
This is not possible really so much
when people are doing this in VHS.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.700
Okay.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.160
Now the last thing I want to add
to my menu is a contact page.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.560
I'm going to drag this Photoshop document
in here and drop it on this button.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.440
Again, the drop palette,
I want to create a submenu.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.980
Now it's going to make a
new menu for me up here.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.240
It's showing me that that's linked up.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.480
A lot of people use
Photoshop for doing DVD menus.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.760
It makes a lot of sense.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.260
A great many of our
customers use Photoshop.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.360
It's very important to work with it.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.600
What we did in DVC-O Pro 3 is
add this Open in Editor command,

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.010
which is pretty powerful.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.110
Now I can say Open in Editor,
and it'll actually just launch

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.470
Photoshop for me because
it's a Photoshop document

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.490
and open that file up in it.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.340
Then I'm going to be
able to make changes.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.540
There we go.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.590
And I'm going to be able to make
changes to this document now.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.940
Let's say I want to maybe move
this text up here for some reason.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.760
I hit save, close that,
come back to DVD Studio Pro, it updates.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.160
So it's really handy
to do things like that.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:13.320
I actually don't want that text up there
because it kind of throws everything off.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:13.320
I'm just going to throw
it back down here.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.400
Come back to
DVD Studio Pro and it updates.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.260
Good.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.420
But, um, still menus are great.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.360
People use still menus
for a lot of things.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.310
Um, but Hollywood is doing a lot of
motion menus on all their DVDs now,

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.100
so it tends that clients are
starting to demand more motion

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.180
menus 'cause that's what they see,
and they want their discs to

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.540
look as Hollywood as possible.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.560
So we wanted to tie into Motion.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.340
Motion, Motion Menus,
makes a lot of sense.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:43.400
Thank you, pretty lame joke.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.560
And Motion is an excellent
program for making Motion Menus.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.390
When I first saw it, I just was like,
nah, this is going to be perfect.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.480
It's exactly what our
customers are needing.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.700
We have to work with it.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.380
So I'm going to grab the same
contact info PSC that I had in here.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.300
And these look familiar.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.460
So Motion is now using our
contact-sensitive drop palettes

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.940
and really handy in Motion,
just like the R&D V Studio Pro.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.610
I'll hit F5 to show me my layers.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.010
So these are the same layers
I would see in Photoshop,

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:15.790
for instance.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.600
And what I want to do with
this is I'm just going to add

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.580
some bubbles to the fishbowl.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.060
Because we don't want the
fishbowl to be in the way.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.200
It needs a little air.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.430
Motion has these really
cool things called emitters.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.100
And these emitters,
I can show you a few of them here.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.240
That's a good one.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.940
So you can take shapes that they
build in and do different things

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.410
with them and actually spit them out,
like the bubble machine here,

00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.020
like this one.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.090
So I'm just going to drag
the bubble machine in,

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.880
put it underneath the fishbowl,
and when I hit play in here,

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.000
you can see now it's added these bubbles.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.380
And they're just randomly generated
bubbles just going all over the place.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.540
If I had to keyframe those
and do those all by hand,

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.350
I'd go crazy.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:07.250
Um, and now what I want to do is actually
take these bubbles and drag them down

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.350
here and add them to the fishbowl.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.840
So I'm getting closer now because
they're behind the fishbowl now,

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:15.050
it's got the transparency in there, uh,
except they're escaping the

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.650
fishbowl and that doesn't look very,
very good.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:21.670
So I'm going to add an image mask to...

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.500
I'll just drag in the fishbowl here.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.070
And I'll just drag in the
fishbowl itself to the image mask.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.370
Turn it back on.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.660
And so now you can see the image
mask is actually masking the

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.200
bubbles inside of the fish tank,
so it looks a lot more realistic.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.760
And I could go in and
control these emitters.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.220
I could make them faster, slower.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.870
I could make more bubbles, fewer bubbles,
change the size of the bubbles over time,

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.720
do all kinds of crazy little things.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.420
Matter of fact,
if I go to the inspector here,

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.060
you can see these are all the
parameters I can set for the bubbles.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.000
So you can do a bunch of different things
with color effects and there's so much

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.000
control in motion it's unbelievable.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Okay, and the really cool thing
is now that I have my motion

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.000
menu background designed,
I can just hit save.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.000
I'm going to save it to the,
I'll call it contact page.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.290
I'm going to save it
to the Movies folder.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.730
And it just saves out.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.060
I didn't have to render it or anything.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.640
So I'm going to go now to my Video tab,
click on that same Movies folder,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.110
because DVD Studio Pro just
automatically references that.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:36.920
It shows up in here.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.310
And I just drag it in and
set the background with it.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:45.730
And it's going to say, OK,
I've got a motion project.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.100
Let's hit the Preview.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.410
And I hit the Preview and it
automatically displays back.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.320
Thank you.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:57.140
So the key point is here,
this is actually just a motion project.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.180
So then when I want to,
I can go back over here to where

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:07.180
it shows up now in my asset manager
and just say open an editor.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.680
And we'll go back into Motion.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.220
I can make more changes to it, save,
it'll automatically

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.300
update in DVD Studio Pro.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.430
Some really tight integration there.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.480
That's really super handy
for making Motion menus.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.050
So that is pretty much the end
of what I wanted to show you,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.440
and I'm going to ask Doug to come
up and show you actually how to

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.960
build your own alpha transitions.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.190
Did you have any more general
questions about DVD Studio Pro?

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.500
We can take a couple and
then have Doug go on.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.260
Got one over here.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.020
Philip Makero, can you put

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:49.580
Can you put buttons into a slideshow
so that the user can interactively

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.260
select which is the next slide?

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:55.300
So the question is can you
put buttons into slideshows

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.300
and in the slideshow editor,
no you can't.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.760
But what you can do is actually
hit convert to track on your

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.300
slideshow after you have it
built and turn it into a track.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.300
And you can actually add buttons over
video on top of the slides in that point.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.910
So, yes.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:16.540
Is there a specific reason why there's a
limit of 99 slides that I'm not aware of?

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:23.560
It is a limit of the spec where
there's a certain number of chapter

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.540
markers that we have to maintain.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.530
Okay, it's chapter markers?

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.540
Yeah.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:27.540
Would there ever be an option?

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.530
And actually,
I'm not even sure it's chapter markers.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.730
Do you know more about that?

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.500
A limit of the specters to have slides.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.200
Okay.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.850
Because our slides are
actually stills that are,

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.170
you know, if you set a slide to
be five seconds long,

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.820
it's actually one frame
that's held for five seconds.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.130
It's not five seconds of video.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:46.560
So they're really efficient.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.360
Okay.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.140
So you could turn those all into video.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.840
The efficiency's cool,
but 99 is really small,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.160
so I was wondering if there was ever
going to be maybe an option where it

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.530
would actually render it out to video
frames just so that you could have the,

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.420
you know, the ability to go higher.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.580
How many slides do you typically do?

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.060
Well, the thing is, it's kind of morbid,
but it was for a funeral and

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.220
there was way more than 99 slides.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.680
Okay.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.660
And so DVD Studio Pro wasn't an option.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.500
Okay.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.260
How many was it?

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.260
Like 300.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.020
Okay.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.920
So you could still do three of 99 each.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.240
Yeah.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.520
But not continuously.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.540
But not all the same.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:21.560
Yeah.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.940
They just wanted to be able
to set it and it ran in the

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.960
background and just forget about it.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.580
Okay.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:26.840
Yeah.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.150
You could have still done that.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.710
It would have just been
three drags instead of one.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.360
Oh, okay.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.490
Because you can actually set.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:32.660
Yeah.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.950
And then jump on a slideshow
to go to another one.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.000
Okay.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.650
So you can link them together like that.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.740
So.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.810
Any other quick questions?

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.720
Then I'll turn it over to Doug.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.450
All right.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.270
Doug DeVore.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.700
Great.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:51.440
Thanks, Brian.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.300
If you have more general DSP questions,
we'll bring Brian up in the end.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.040
And if you have any questions
while I'm giving this

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.480
presentation on alpha transitions,
feel free to interrupt or say

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.820
I'm going too fast or too slow.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:06.610
If I'm going too slow,
I probably can't do anything about that.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.530
So Brian said he mentioned
alpha transitions.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.470
Alpha transitions are basically
transitions that use a QuickTime asset

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.230
as part of their transition,
or they can use a QuickTime asset

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.840
to influence the transition.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.160
And we're going to look at a
couple different situations here.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.960
So what I'm going to
do is open up Motion.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.660
We'll create a really
simple alpha transition.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.180
It's the remote control
that we saw earlier.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.360
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to a preset that Motion lets me create.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.750
I'm going to call it alpha transitions.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.100
This is a preset that I created.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.560
Basically,
when you create alpha transitions,

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.040
you want to create them at 60
progressive frames per second.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.330
And the reason is because when
DSP makes these alpha transitions,

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.710
it's going to pull those 60
progressive frames and make its

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.130
own interlaced frames for you.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.710
That way, the user can speed them up,
they can slow them down,

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.160
and you're not going to have
to worry about the fields being

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.350
placed back into the right place.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.960
You're working with progressive frames.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.780
It'll make its own field.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.200
So you'll have these
nice field-based -- yeah,

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.300
go ahead.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:05.940
No, I'm sorry.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.410
If you're working with the--
not that I'm ignoring Pal.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.620
Pal will work with 50 frames a second.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:19.130
Any NTSC resolution that you use, 720x40,
720x486, or CropD1, HalfD1, SIF,

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.040
are going to work.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.900
They're going to be recognized in
DVD Studio Pro as alpha transitions.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.970
If you're using PAL, of course,
you'll use PAL sizes.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.850
So I'm going to hit F5 and F6.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.880
That'll show me my timeline
and my media layer.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.480
And let's see,
I'm going to go to my Documents folder.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.800
And here we go.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.630
We have some content.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.070
All right.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.280
I've got this blue screen footage.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.280
I'm just going to...

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:51.100
Let's make this the same length
and zoom in a little bit.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:55.120
So what this is is a remote
control shot against a blue screen,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.130
just like so.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:00.260
I've got 60 frames per
second in this timeline.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:04.210
And first thing I need
to do is go to this

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:10.060
This is a piece of media here in
Telmotion that this was originally

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.850
"Shot as lower field dominant." So that
will give us some nice clean frames.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.420
So what Motion is doing here is it's
taking every other field and building

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.180
a full progressive frame out of it.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:28.530
It's interpolating the information
to build that extra half of

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:28.530
information that we need.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:31.900
And we need to key this out,
so I'm going to take our remote

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.920
blue screen and add a filter.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.460
I'm going to choose keying,
prime at our T.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.600
There we go.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.560
We get kind of a basic key.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.740
It doesn't look very good yet.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.760
I'm going to call up my
heads-up display or dashboard.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.010
And we'll bring that matte
density up a little bit.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.650
Now if you want to see,
basically what we're doing is

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.900
we're creating an alpha channel.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.220
If you want to see that alpha channel,
you can go right up here to color.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.890
We can look at transparent and any
area where you see a checkerboard,

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:59.400
just like in Photoshop,
that's going to be transparent.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.070
I'm going to leave this on color
for now so we can see this blue

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.680
and get rid of a little bit of it.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.150
So I've got my matte density up.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.960
I don't want to take too much away.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.310
And I'm going to bring my
spill suppressor up to get

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.670
rid of the blue fringe,
but I don't want to bring it

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:14.560
up too high or we start to
discolor the original asset.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.050
Now this piece was originally shot in DV.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.150
And DV presents sort of a keying problem.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.770
You can see, like along these edges,
we have a little bit of stair-stepping,

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.200
a little bit of aliasing going on.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.500
So I'm going to do a little trick here.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.950
I'm going to add another filter.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.620
I'm going to go to blur,
and I'm going to go to channel blur.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:40.680
I'm going to bring the channel blur
down so it occurs before the key.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:40.680
Oops.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:40.680
Try that again.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.000
There we go.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:46.240
Now, I only want to blur the blue
channel in this situation.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.560
So I'm going to turn off the red,
I'm going to turn off the green,

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.040
I'm going to turn off the alpha,
and I'm going to bring

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.500
this down to about 2.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.990
What this does is it gives us
kind of a more of a smooth border.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.040
So here it is without the channel blur.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.770
You can see the A-list edges and
you can use this in any keyer

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.990
that's not meant to key DV.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:06.660
So there we go.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.860
We have a nice smooth border.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.850
We'd work on this a little more,
take away some of this blue,

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.010
bring up the matte,
bring up maybe a choker on there,

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.010
but this is good enough for now.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.760
So we play through here.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:18.980
We've got the remote control.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.480
We want one other thing to happen here.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.760
When the remote goes down,
we want kind of static

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.000
to obscure the screen.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.610
Otherwise,
the source image is just going to

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.080
change to the destination image,
and that's not too exciting.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.810
Let's add a little something in there.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.570
So I'm going to go back
to my file browser,

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.960
and we have this piece of
static that's very handy.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.670
And we'll shorten it
up just a little bit.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.370
Here we go.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.920
So about halfway through this transition,
we're going to have a piece of

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.200
static go on just like that.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:45.980
We'll play that.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.200
That's what it's going to look like.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.390
So I'm going to export this.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.660
I'm pretty much done at this point.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.140
And I've created some export presets.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.600
I'm going to show you what
those export presets are.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.740
I'm going to choose
Alpha Transitions with Alpha.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.080
I have a special transition folder
that I'm going to save these into.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.700
DSP recognizes transitions
saved into certain folders.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.730
So if you go into your application
support library and find DVD Studio Pro,

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.760
you can put a folder in
there called Transitions,

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.770
either your root level library
or your user level library.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.770
And DSP will automatically
import any of these transitions.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.780
So let's create a new folder here.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.780
I'm going to name it asterisk remote.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.770
That will help me find
it a little easier later.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:36.680
And you need to name the asset
the same name as the folder.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:37.800
So there we go.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.420
We've got Asterisk Remote.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.600
Let me show you what this preset is.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.620
It's QuickTime Movie.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.050
It's using the animation compressor.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.630
We're using the animation
compressor so that we can save the

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:49.900
alpha channel in the transition.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.580
Now,
later on I'm going to show you that you

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.740
don't actually need to do that because
using the animation compressor is going

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.560
to create a fairly large-sized file.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.620
If you're putting transitions up
on the web for people to download,

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.000
that can get out of hand.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.080
So you can actually have DSP make
its own alpha channel based on

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.570
information that you provide,
a matte layer.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.440
And that's going to create file
sizes that are about one-tenth the

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.200
size that we're about to create now.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.960
But in this case,
we're going to export the alpha channel.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.400
So our resolution is full.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.380
We don't need field rendering.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.580
We've got 60 frames a second.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.890
We're going to pre-multiply the alpha.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.200
The alpha channel transitions
work with pre-multiplied alphas,

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:23.800
so don't do straight alpha.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.990
And everything in there looks good.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:32.100
We just need video and we export.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.250
Oh, one extra thing I forgot to do there.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.710
Let's just do that export one more time.

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.730
We don't want to actually
export this entire project,

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.060
so I should have done use play range.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.100
So let me just back up a little bit.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.510
New folder.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:52.760
We'll call this one Remote 2.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:58.580
And we'll name the asset Remote 2.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.630
We've got Use Play Range selected.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.070
We've got Alpha Transition with Alpha.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.860
And we export.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.470
We're going to get a little preview.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.740
It goes pretty quickly.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.730
Now we can go into DSP.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.030
I'm actually going to relaunch
DSP to clear out Brian's project.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:17.800
I hope you don't mind if I don't save it.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.020
And we launch DSP.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.020
And that transition,
since it was saved into

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.580
the Transitions folder,
is going to be accessible

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:29.700
in DVD Studio Pro.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.040
I'm going to grab a couple stills.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.900
Now these transitions
can be used in menus.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.140
They can be used in slideshows.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.420
They can also be used in the timeline.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.100
That's easiest to demo,
so I'm just going to drag these down.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.980
We've got this very
important looking man.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:47.640
And we want to transition-- let's
put him first-- to the donkey.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.560
That might be something
you need to do someday.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.720
So we'll choose our transition.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.180
And what did I name it?

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:56.990
Remote 2.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.410
Here we go.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.570
It's automatically put in there.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.380
And we get a nice transition.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:10.260
You can vary the length of it,
speed it up so now it's much faster.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.300
You can slow it down.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.410
And when we finally compile the DVD,
it's going to build

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.610
nice interlaced frames.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.650
It's going to look really nice.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.600
All right, so that's one way you
can create transitions.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.220
Any of you use After Effects at all?

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.470
Any After Effects users?

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.020
Okay.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.520
So we're going to go into After Effects.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.560
I'm going to quit motion.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.070
I won't save.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:39.800
So you don't need to create
one-layer transitions.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.740
You can create up to two
and three-layer transitions.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.410
We're going to show you a
different type of transition.

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:50.070
Let's look at this
transition called Rings.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:55.740
Now this transition called Rings has
an interesting bit in that we see the

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.860
source picture and we see the destination
picture on the screen at the same time.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.180
It's not perfect, but there we go.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.140
And that way we don't
just get a sudden change.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.450
Now if we use just a sudden
transition switch point like we did

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.880
in the remote control transition,
it's not going to work very well.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.090
What we need to do is create something
called a background matte layer.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.960
So let's go into Adobe After Effects.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:25.020
And I'm going to import, still here,
we'll import this DVD.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Let me just want the DVD layer.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.180
All right.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:37.180
And I'm going to set my project
settings to 60 frames per second,

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.990
which it already is.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:42.340
and create a new composition.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.880
I'm going to make this
composition three seconds long.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.360
Frame rate's going to be 60.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.100
Okay.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.900
I'm going to bring this
DVD down into our comp.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:58.180
And basically what we want to do here
is fly through the center of the DVD.

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:03.440
So what we need to do is create a scale.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.900
I'm going to set a keyframe
there and set the scale to 1.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.790
Then I'm going to go
to the end of the comp.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:12.680
And I'm just going to scrub through here.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.560
We're not going to fly
exactly through the center.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:18.000
We'll fly a little off.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.880
Right to there.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.480
So now when we play this...

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.360
We're going to fly
through the center now.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.390
Unfortunately,
the way these keyframes are interpolated

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.640
is sort of a linear progression.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:35.260
So the difference between
1% and 100% is pretty large.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:41.380
But the difference between
760% and 860% is pretty small.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.030
You just don't see a lot of difference.

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.720
So it looks like the DVD is coming
at us real fast in the beginning,

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.630
but then it slows down in the end.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:52.180
So what we want to do here is
grab these keyframes Thanks.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:51:09.900
[Transcript missing]

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.000
So I'm just going to set a
keyframe at the beginning,

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:17.960
go to the end, rotate it almost

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.030
321 degrees.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:26.330
Play that back.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:26.330
We get a nice rotation
as we fly through it.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:26.330
That looks better.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.100
And if we want to look at the alpha,
we can.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.330
We can choose this little alpha button.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:36.560
Basically, what we do at this point
is export this movie.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.630
Now, I'm going to export it
without an alpha channel.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.240
So I'm going to go to Make Movie.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.120
And I'm going to choose my preset,
Alpha Transitions.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:49.360
I'm going to choose Alpha Trans-- oh,
this preset, by the way,

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.320
is just setting field render off.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.900
We're using 60 frames a second.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.980
If I go to this preset,
I'm going to choose Alpha Transition,

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.800
No Alpha.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.770
Basically, what that's using is the
Photo JPEG compressor.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.110
You can use any compressor you want.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.140
This works pretty well.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:10.360
I've got it set to about 75%.
We've got our 60 frames per second,

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.560
and we're not rendering
the alpha this time.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.780
We're just rendering the RGB channels,
no alpha at all.

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.040
You can't in this codec anyway.

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.590
And then I'm going to add
another output module.

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:22.590
Oops.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:26.290
I'm going to say Alpha Transmat.

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:29.990
And basically, that's the same thing
as the first output.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.820
But this time,
I'm outputting the alpha channel.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.860
Now, this actually isn't
exporting an alpha channel.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.140
What it is is it's
exporting the equivalent.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:39.970
Say OK.

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:44.070
And that equivalent is
just white on black.

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:45.840
Any areas of gray,
they're going to show up

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.610
as partially transparent,
just like so.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.980
So I'd export both of these things,
and then we do still have a problem.

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.480
There are points in the transition
where we want to see the source

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.960
image and the destination image.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.850
So we want to see the
source on this outside part,

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:05.130
and we want to see the
destination on the inside part.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.340
So how do we fix that?

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:10.470
Well, we create another layer called
the background matte layer.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.990
I'm going to create a new layer here.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.300
I'm just going to make it pure white.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.390
Just like so.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.940
Bring that down underneath our DVD.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.360
I'm going to create one more layer.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.600
It's going to be pure black.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.500
We've got two layers.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:35.060
I'm just going to bring them back
to the beginning of our comp.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:47.110
"So what we want is that black
layer to follow underneath the DVD.

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:52.410
I'm going to create a quick mask
here using our masking tool.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.060
Draw a mask, constrain it, just like so.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.760
So now if we look underneath the DVD,
we've got this black circle

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.240
that's going to follow the DVD.

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.970
It's not going to follow it yet,
of course,

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.770
because it's going to just stay there.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:09.980
So I'm going to use an expression
and bring up our scaling of mask,

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:12.740
bring up our scaling of the DVD.

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.510
"Go to our layer, let's see,
oh I'm sorry,

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:20.700
we're going to go to animation,
add expression to the scale,

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:25.340
and I'm going to attach using this
little pickwit tool the scaling of that

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:29.660
black solid to the scaling of the DVD,
just like so that now when

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:34.690
we go the black is going to
follow underneath the DVD.

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.930
We turn off the DVD layer and
we render this out and we call

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:39.800
it the background matte layer.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:44.800
So let's take a look at
what that looks like.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.790
I'm not going to render
those out right now.

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:49.900
Hold on.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.140
We'll open up our transitions.

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.400
We have one pre-rendered for you.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.250
Here's a background matte layer.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.440
It's just going to look like this.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:12.090
And in this example,
I created one movie with alpha built in.

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:14.370
There it is.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:22.260
When we see it in DVD Studio Pro,
we'll choose our DVD.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:43.930
So, let's look at the first slide.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:43.930
So, we've got the source asset,
and we've got the background asset

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:43.930
in the middle following along,
and we've got these

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:43.930
semi-transparent areas right here.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:43.930
Now, there's one other thing you
can do to create a transition.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:43.930
Let's look -- I keep doing that.

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:50.340
Let's look at a transition called Brush.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:54.610
Now the Brush transition only has
a background matte layer in it.

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.270
So basically,
it's not using a QuickTime asset to

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:00.840
overlay any part of the transition.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:03.780
It's just using a background matte layer.

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:07.440
to influence the change between
the source and destination assets.

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:13.470
So if we look at that transition, brush,
we get something that looks like this.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.800
There you go.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.830
That's how you create alpha transitions.

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.730
Any questions on that?

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.720
Brian, I don't know if we have time to
show the buttons and drop zones,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.520
do we?

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.060
Okay, let's show you one more thing here.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.660
I'm going to go into Photoshop.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:42.170
And what DVD Studio Pro allows
you to do is create your own

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.790
custom drop zones and buttons.

00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:48.250
We'll see what those look like.

00:56:51.210 --> 00:57:00.190
So let's open up a file and
we'll go to our documents.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.740
And I'll just find where I put them.

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.700
Let's go to the DVD Studio Pro.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:20.650
I'm going to open up this clip.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.640
We've got a TV here.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:27.620
We're going to create a button or a drop
zone out of this TV so we can drop movies

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:32.610
or stills into this drop zone or button
and it's going to respect the boundaries.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.700
Basically what DSP needs
is four different layers.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.700
We're going to create those layers now.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.690
First, let's separate this
TV from the background.

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:43.700
So I'm just going to
select the black here.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.710
And I'm going to say,
let's bring that tolerance down

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:50.700
just a little bit here to 16,
deselect, and select again.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.720
I'm going to say select similar.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.140
And I'm going to inverse that selection.

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.130
That's Command-Shift-I.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.980
I'm going to copy it, Command-C,
and paste it, Command-V.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.580
That brings us up with a layer.

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:13.260
The first layer that we need to
create is called the Image Mask.

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.220
The Image Mask defines when we drop
a QuickTime asset or a still asset

00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:21.070
onto this button or drop zone,
where do we get to see that image.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:24.280
So if we created just a
little button right here and

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.740
we dropped a movie onto it,
the movie would only show up

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.650
in the little circle there.

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.470
We're not going to do that.

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.210
We're going to create a much larger area.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:34.380
What I'm going to do is just

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:41.810
Define an area.

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:41.810
Now, it doesn't matter that I'm not
adhering to the contours of this TV.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.070
Because the image mask is
going to be behind the shape

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.100
layer that we see right now.

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:52.500
So my imperfections are going
to be sort of covered up.

00:58:52.670 --> 00:59:00.640
Go to Layer 2 here, and I'm just going to
grab my paint bucket tool,

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:01.830
fill it in with white.

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:04.650
Now, if you have this filled in
in semi-transparent areas,

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:08.200
that semi-transparency will also
show up in the drop zone or buttons.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.480
That's kind of nice.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:09.940
So there we go.

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.760
We've got our first layer.

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.870
I'm going to name it Image Mask.

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.040
It's not important that
you name these correctly.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.900
What's important is the
order that they're in.

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:20.820
So you can keep them named Layer 1,
Layer 2.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:20.820
This is our shape layer.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:38.400

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.980
I'm going to use my little lasso
tool and we'll create sort of

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.190
the universal symbol for play.

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:47.200
Oops, there we go.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.830
It's not a perfect triangle.

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.240
And I'm just going to
fill that in with black.

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:54.340
Now, notice we have anti-aliasing on.

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:58.150
Now,
if you've worked with overlays before,

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:03.550
then you know that anti-aliasing
can sort of mess up your overlay.

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.380
It can cause all sorts of jaggies,
things like that, because

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.550
Well,
DVD players can't handle transparencies.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:12.510
But what DVD Studio Pro is,
it interprets the semi-transparency

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:16.070
for you into grayscale,
and then you can map that

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:20.660
grayscale to the same color,
giving you full anti-aliasing,

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.470
which is great if you're doing text.

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:28.870
If you're doing any type of text buttons,
you can get nice round edges just

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:29.190
based on those transparent areas
that show up as anti-aliasing.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.190
So let's fill this in.

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:32.150
And then the last layer is
going to be our thumbnail.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.150
So I'm just going to
duplicate the shape layer.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.630
The thumbnail is just what shows
up in our palette for us when

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:40.760
we're looking for this layer,
what it's going to look like to us.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.040
So there we go.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.080
We don't need all this
extra area around the edges.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:47.080
I'm just going to crop this a bit.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:53.050
And it is awfully big because we're
viewing this at 50%. Let's just make this

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.820
whole thing a little easier to work with.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.570
It's not going to be much bigger
than that in a NTSC project.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.500
There we go.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.570
And we'll just save this.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.590
I'm going to save it
in my documents folder.

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:15.840
I'm going to call it tv.psd.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.070
Now just in case I already
have it imported,

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.620
I'll call it TV4PSD.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.680
All right,
so we go back to DVD Studio Pro,

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.070
go to our shapes,
and we can click import.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.400
I saved it there, tv psd.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.150
Now we can save it when we import this.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.110
It's going to create a copy of it and
put it into our application support

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:39.680
library so we can use it for later.

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:42.000
Or we can choose to just
import it for this project.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.550
If we import it into the project,
it actually makes a copy of it in the

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.820
project within the package contents.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.350
So if you give this
project to someone else,

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.830
they'll have the shape imported as well.

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:54.740
We click import.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:02:01.740
I'm going to go to my projects,
go to menus, here we go, create a button.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.280
It's a little bit big,
it's a lot bit big.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.870
We'll bring it down a little bit.
