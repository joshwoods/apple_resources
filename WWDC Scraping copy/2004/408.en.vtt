00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Manager of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.520
Software Technology Evangelism,
John Geleynse.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.300
Hey, good morning.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.850
Welcome to the second session
of the second day of WC 2004.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.220
I hope that this is turning out to
be a really great conference for you,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.180
and I hope that at the end of the week,
you look back and say this is an

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.100
incredibly valuable week for you,
and you've gained a lot of experience

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.440
developing software on the platform.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.560
Let's see, is this the right slide?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.820
There we are.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.900
This is the one I want to start on.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.840
This session is all about
how to distinguish your

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.890
application on the platform.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.400
We're going to talk about UI stuff,
designing for Aqua.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.900
We're going to talk about technology,
choices.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.890
We're going to talk about
planning your product.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.180
I just want to say up front that a
lot of this content is based on my

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.990
experience and the experience of my
team working with many of you and your

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.340
peers over the last year or two years,
helping you to understand what's going

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.400
on in the platform and how do you
take your product to the next level.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.000
This content really comes out of all
of those conversations and all of those

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.530
meetings and is an attempt on my part
to just clone those conversations and

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.400
share the information that we've shared
with so many other developers with you.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.360
It's not meant to be
all-encompassing in any way,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.590
shape, or form,
but I think it's touching on

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.380
the areas that I think people
have the most difficulty with.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.400
I hope you find it valuable.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.400
I'd love to hear your
feedback after the session,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.340
either through email or through
conversations directly with me.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.630
I want to talk about what it takes to
create a great product on the platform,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.710
and I want to do that by drawing
an analogy with the food industry

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.300
or the restaurant industry.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.670
And I want to begin with
the fast food experience,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.370
right?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.210
What do we know about
the fast food experience?

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.720
Well, we know that there's a lot
of unskilled kitchen staff,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.480
right?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.500
We know that there's a lot of
frozen mass-produced ingredients.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.250
It's all about getting lots of
stuff out there really fast,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.200
getting this material prepared
quickly for the customers,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.060
and a lot of mass-produced ingredients.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.680
Poor nutritional value.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.450
By and large,
most fast food joints aren't in

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.770
existence for good nutrition,
even though there's a lot

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.220
of advertising around that.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.480
But that's sort of a fact.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.560
And these are John's sort of statements
about the fast food industry.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.590
They're not, you know,
anything more than that.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.860
But take it for what it is.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.440
A lot of artificial flavor.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.320
I read a really great book
recently that said that chicken

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.180
McNuggets and such were,
you know,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.020
produced in a lab and the aromas that
you smell are completely fabricated.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.170
It has nothing to do
with the food itself.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.180
So interesting.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.780
What else do we know about
the fast food industry?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.340
Well, a lot of poor presentation.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.150
Most of the time,
stuff is slapped together

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.810
by unskilled kitchen staff,
thrown on a plate or in a container,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.310
and there you have it, right?

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.200
It's all about the speed with which you
get the food and address your appetite

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.270
than it is about the presentation.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.880
And lastly, we know that mostly the fast
food experience probably

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.770
isn't that good for you,
right?

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.940
I say bad for you,
but maybe that would be

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.610
misrepresenting things,
but it's not necessarily

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.070
that good for you.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.480
Now let's compare the fast food
industry to the fast food industry.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.920
experience with fine dining.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.560
Well,
unskilled kitchen staff is certainly

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.870
replaced by highly skilled kitchen staff,
people who have trained

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.880
their lives for this stuff,
trained to learn how to cook and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.800
put this stuff together in a really,
really great way.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.590
Frozen mass-produced ingredients.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:59.030
The Mac OS X is a great way to
develop your Mac OS X experience.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.280
You can use it to create
your own Mac OS X app,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.280
or you can use it to create
your own Mac OS X app.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.280
You can use it to create
your own Mac OS X app.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.830
Good nutritional value.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.760
By and large, you know,
if you go to a great restaurant,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.960
it's all about good food, right?

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.330
The flavors are mouthwatering.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.150
They're really good.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.380
It's not artificial flavors.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.610
It's the real stuff, right?

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.680
The real McCoy.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.820
Attractive presentation.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.680
I mean, some of the restaurants
that I've been to,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.020
and I'm no guy for haute cuisine here,
but I've been to some nice

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.310
places here in San Francisco,
and the presentation has a whole lot

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.370
to do with the enjoyment of the meal.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.170
The food is fantastic,
but certainly the presentation is great.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.250
And lastly, by and large,
you know the fine dining experience,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.720
the food that you eat,
the whole experience, in fact,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.440
is probably, in a holistic sense,
really good for you.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.090
It's probably good for you in
terms of nutritional value,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.970
but the overall experience of
going to this fine dining evening

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.560
or what have you is good for you.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.930
And so I want to draw this analogy
between the fast food experience

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.030
and fine dining experience and
software development on the platform.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.110
I ran the Apple Design Awards this year,
and I do that every year,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.040
and we get a ton of submissions.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.850
This year we had less time to judge even
more submissions than we've ever had.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.380
And I'll tell you,
a lot of submissions fell in the

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.320
category of fine dining experience.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.180
It was a fine software experience.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.600
But there was a percentage
that was really fast food.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.950
It was somebody just
threw something together,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.790
shipped the product,
and threw it into Design Awards.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.560
And I think, not I think,
this session is all about teaching you,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.680
giving you the insight and
expertise to create a really

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.820
great fine dining experience on
the platform with your software.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.110
So, what does it take to
create a great experience,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.650
a great dinner party?

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.810
Or if you're the manager
of a great fine restaurant,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.660
what does it take to
pull this all together?

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.770
Well,
essentially there's kind of five steps.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.640
And again, I'm in the software industry.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.260
I don't run a restaurant,
but this is kind of my perspective,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.760
so take it for what it's worth.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.630
But I think to create that kind of
an experience for your customers,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.260
it takes these five steps.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.190
Planning your menu,
extending a warm welcome,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.860
creating a great ambiance,
sweating the details, right?

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.590
Choosing the right silverware, utensils,
choosing the right linens,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.350
picking the right music,
and all of the stuff that goes

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.420
into an evening that you might
put together for your friends or

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.890
if you're running a restaurant,
right?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.780
All of those things matter,
and if some of them aren't there,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.220
the experience can go
downhill pretty quickly.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.710
And lastly, ensure quality service.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.730
A great restaurant can totally torpedo
in your opinion if the service sucks.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.940
If nobody's there to get what you want,
when you want it,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.800
or get rid of stuff when
you want to get rid of it,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.800
your opinion can go down really quickly.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.800
Well, let's take that and compare it to
the software development process.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.930
To create a great
application on the platform,

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.870
you don't need to choose your menu,
but you do need to plan.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.940
You also need to create
a great first impression.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.570
As you walk to a restaurant with your
date or whoever you're going with,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.300
that first impression,
as you walk into the restaurant and you

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.470
smell the aromas and the temperature is
right and the ambiance is just great,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.320
that can set the evening off either to
a great start or it can totally ruin

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.540
the evening right from the get-go.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.330
Sweating the details for software
development is all about paying attention

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.840
and choosing the right fundamentals,
including the essential ingredients,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.650
the essential elements in your product.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.210
And we're going to talk
about all of these.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.480
Creating an attractive
ambiance in the software sense,

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.140
I'm talking about creating a great
ambiance with your software through Aqua.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.410
And we'll get into that detail.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.320
And lastly, I think great service,
the analogy to software,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.510
is delivering a really responsive,
high-performance application.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.440
And if you think of the experience
that you've had running software,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.310
the products that are less likely to
be on your top choice are the products

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.960
that are not really responsive,
or they're either lagging somewhere,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.380
that don't really respond in
the way that you want them to.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.060
And I think that's a lot like the
experience we have at restaurants,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.850
where the waiter isn't
there when we want it,

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.440
and our needs aren't met exactly.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.790
So, let's go through these individually.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800
First of all, planning.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.810
This is about deciding what to
make and whom to make it for.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.990
There's about four or five steps here,
and this is not the all-encompassing

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.240
list of what you need to do
for planning your software.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.850
This is, based on my experience
working with developers,

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.520
these are the areas that most developers,
I think, don't spend enough time on.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.980
So the first thing that's critical,
I think,

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.790
is understanding who your users are.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.160
First of all, first and foremost,
you're not your user.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.500
You might come from the
experience of your users.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.480
You might have been a teacher
previously in your previous life,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.420
and now you're a software
developer for K through 12,

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.350
or you might have been an accountant,
but now you're writing software for

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.280
personal finance or what have you.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.610
So you might have some
sense of who your user is,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.930
but you are no longer your user.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.020
You're the developer,
and you have business pressures,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.300
and you've got all kinds
of things that are going to

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.990
influence the decisions you make.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.500
It's important for you to understand who
your users are and what their needs are,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.530
what their priorities are,
what their expertise is.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.330
And understanding,
based upon their expertise,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.820
that some users who aren't that
sophisticated are going to become

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.020
proficient in certain tasks,
and your software needs to lead

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.270
them towards that proficiency,
and they're going to graduate

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.100
to more complex tasks as well.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.570
But highly sophisticated users on
the computer with your software are

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.090
going to be masters at some tasks,
novices at others,

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.900
and are going to be frustrated mostly
when your product gets in the way.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.990
Well, this seems like common sense,
right?

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.960
Truth of the matter is,
I think most software developers

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.610
are trying to aim for whoever
the heck will buy their product.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.920
It's like, okay,
let's just throw everything into this

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.170
puppy and hope that anybody in the world,
you know,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.330
whoever can buy it will buy it because
it's just another customer for us.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.680
But the truth is,
I think some of the best products on the

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.200
platform are the ones that are focused,
very focused on a particular market

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.900
segment and at a particular set of users.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.820
And they address the
needs of those users,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.740
and they address the
needs of those users.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.380
perfectly and those products
totally dominate that space.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.330
And think for a minute of some
of the software that you use

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.470
that fits into that space.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.390
I mean,
I think all of us could probably identify

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.730
a product or two that fits into that.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.710
So it's critical, I think,
to pick your audience and know what

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:34.520
their needs are and pay attention
to how sophisticated they are.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.980
And a great example of this, for example,
is if you were going for

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.820
less sophisticated users and
producing an iMovie type product.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.960
I mean, right from the get-go,
Apple said, you know what,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.340
iMovie is for home users.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.360
They're infrequently on the computer.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.970
They're going to be bothered
or hindered in some way by the

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.980
multi-windowing environment of Mac OS X.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.460
We'll just give them a full
screen experience because

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.040
they're totally focused on
that exercise of editing video.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.880
That was a very deliberate decision
on our part to create a product

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.750
for less sophisticated users.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.720
Clearly, the experience with
Final Cut Pro is different than

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.690
the experience with iMovie,
right?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.140
So there's two examples of
how the product design was

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.980
influenced by the user base,
and that's kind of the point

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.780
I want to make for you guys.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.630
So the first step in planning
was understanding your users.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.240
The second one is sort of
knowing your application.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.110
Understand your application.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.270
Understand what it is that
you really want your app to do

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.140
and get a good grasp of that.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.120
And I think as you come to define what
it is you want your application to do,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.570
you need to take into account
the fact that you have a lot

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.440
of experience with the app.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.320
You, your company, you as an individual,
you, your company,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.800
have certain value add that you can
bring to the market with your product.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.760
You have certain expertise.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.550
You have certain inherent strengths as
a company or inherent sort of assets

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.350
that you can bring to the product.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.300
And your product should be
built around those primarily.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.880
It's important to design for usability,
understand what the

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.960
workflow is of the users.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.910
How do users expect to
work with this product,

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.490
and how can we make the
product map to that experience?

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.320
Think about the interaction
with other applications.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.210
If your application is aimed
for less sophisticated users and

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.140
you're a single window product
like iMovie was originally,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.310
it's unlikely that the user's
going to be interacting with other

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.220
applications at the same time.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.440
They're editing movies.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.170
They're not doing drag and drop.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.320
They might do cut and paste, perhaps,
but not likely.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.360
And so within the application,
they might do cut and paste,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.860
but not any data exchange with
other applications in that sense.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.130
Interaction with other applications
is important to think about as you

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.880
consider who your user base is.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.330
And all of these things,
in terms of planning,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.460
help you to craft what your product will
be and what its feature set will be.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.360
I find as I meet with developers
that everybody's trying,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.200
you know, most people are trying to
do everything for everybody.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.860
And so then they're demoing the
product for me as I do a UI review

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.260
and they're showing off how,
you know,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.570
the app can do this and it can export
and import and drag and drop and,

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.840
you know, it can stand on its head
and it does all this stuff.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.870
And I keep coming back to them saying,
well, who's using this product?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.980
Well, you know,
we've got some customers here and say,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.070
well, you know, who's using this?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.900
What are their needs?

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.600
And as I keep driving on that point,
developers realize, you know what?

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.610
Actually, we don't need that.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.120
We could drop that whole feature.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.080
No one would care.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.060
And the usability of the
product might increase.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.040
So I don't want to belabor the point.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.380
I've got tons of stuff
to go through today.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.070
So let me move on.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.270
All right.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.610
Deliver solutions and not features.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.530
I hammer on this every year at WC,
and I think we're getting

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.970
better in this as a community,
as a platform,

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.980
we're getting better in this regard.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.140
But still, and there's some examples
I'll show you later on,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.790
still there's this tendency to just
pack in the features because there's

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.820
pressure from your marketing team or
whoever it is that's giving you pressure

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.330
as an engineer to get those checkboxes
on the side of the product box,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:03.680
right?

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.830
It's not about features for the user.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.580
It's about whether the product
delivers on the promise.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.590
It's about what it can do.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.880
So you need to be producing products that
deliver an end solution for customers

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.220
that is the be-all and end-all for them.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.470
Use the 80% solution.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.800
This is really all about designing
for 80% of your customers.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.840
Once you identify who your users are,
then you can sort of aim for trying

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.770
to please 80% of those well-defined,
for that well-defined audience.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.120
A lot of people spend most of their time
developing for 20% of their audience,

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.100
who tend to be the vocal minority.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.320
It's the people who tend to be a
little bit more sophisticated who can

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.670
get that feedback into the developer
through a blog or through an email

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.400
or whatever mechanism there is.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.020
The less sophisticated users kind of go,
"Well, you know,

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.000
I'm not sure how to get the
feedback to the developer,"

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.900
so they're kind of silent.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.420
They're the ones you kind
of want to design for rather

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.270
than the vocal minority,
so keep that in mind.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.370
Don't always design
for the vocal minority.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.920
The best tools are the ones you're
not even aware you're using,

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.280
right?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.540
If you think of a carpenter
or a mechanic or any of the

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.500
tradespeople out there in the world,
they have whole vast

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.100
collections of tools.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.800
Why?

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.440
Because every one of those
tools is properly balanced,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.510
it's tuned exactly for what it does,
and I think it's no different

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.020
in the software industry.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.770
I think I would much rather have
a computer with hundreds of apps,

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.160
all that are tuned for what
they're supposed to do,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.810
all that are scriptable so I can
use something like Automator to

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.760
start connecting them together
and create a great workflow,

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.140
than having three apps that are just,
you know,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.430
got thousands of features in them
that I can't even find half of,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.960
half of the features for.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.140
All right.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.850
Third thing to do in terms
of planning your product is

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.210
understanding your market needs.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.050
If you think about the characteristics,
for a moment,

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.160
of some of the best software
you've used on the platform,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.420
what would you come up with?

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.970
Some of the characteristics of the
software and the best platform,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.600
I think,
are the ones down here on the left.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.880
Some of the best software I've
ever used was high performance,

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.360
very responsive.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.600
It was elegant.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.790
It was attractive.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.460
It was dead easy to use.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.180
I got into the thing and I was
able to do what I wanted to do.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.380
It was compatible.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.230
As I started using it, I realized, hey,
I need this image from over here,

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.970
this whatchamacallit from
some such other application.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.110
And boom, I could get it in there,
no problem.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.660
Very mobile, right?

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.720
Launches quickly in my PowerBook,
has no issues going to sleep.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.530
It's just a really mobile application.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.700
It's accessible.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.800
We'll talk about that a little bit more.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.600
I think these are some of the
characteristics that we all want

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.320
in the products that we use,
whether they're the ones we write

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:45.670
or whether they're the ones we use.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.410
So if we look at some of those
characteristics and then contrast

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:55.660
them with some of the market segments
that many of you are participating in,

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.280
and certainly Apple is participating in,
it's interesting how some of

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.990
them map to those market needs.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.260
This isn't meant to be the definitive
statement of where Apple's participating,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.780
doing business.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.930
This isn't meant to be the
definitive statement of what

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.420
the characteristics are for any.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:17.560
Again,
it's John's perspective on this point,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.160
and I think the whole point here is
just to get you to think about what

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.870
are the characteristics that you
want in your application and how

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.540
do those map to the market segment
in which you're participating.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.760
As you understand who your user is,
you're going to identify them and

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.280
place them within a market segment.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.890
So let's just take the first two columns.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.620
If you're developing a
game for the platform,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.840
what are likely to be the highest
priority characteristics for you

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.410
that you have within your product?

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.730
Well, high performance is key for games,
right?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.200
Great responsiveness,
great fast rendering of stuff on screen,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.250
attractiveness.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.600
A lot of the sex appeal of games
is how cool they look and what the

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.380
audio is like and how attractive.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:57.520
The game is a game of games.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.400
That's what the whole experience is.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.660
And easy to use, I think,
is important for games, too.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.110
If it's too hard to play, it's like,
well, forget this.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.500
Contrast that with the home user,
with the home market, you know,

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.940
high performance isn't
as big a deal for them.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.680
In fact, I chose not to put it on the
slide as an option for them.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.010
I would say for home users,
for the home market, infrequent,

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.730
less sophisticated users typically,
elegance, attractiveness,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.240
and ease of use are key.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.590
Once you identify which
characteristics you want to go after,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.690
it's important to prioritize them.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.210
So take those same markets.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.520
Again, this is John's opinion.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.160
This is not meant to be the authority.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.060
But I would say for games,
number one is performance.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.530
So if you're writing a game
and you haven't run some of the

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.420
performance analysis tools and
tuned that product for Mac OS X,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.590
I think you're missing the boat in
terms of your opportunity to stand out

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.620
and distinguish your application on the
platform relative to your competition.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.920
Responsiveness is, again, key.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.930
I think the two go together.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:55.910
And attractiveness.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.330
Home users, I think the number one thing
for most users who are less

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.010
sophisticated is ease of use.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.790
If you don't get that right,
your product, I think,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.660
isn't going to be nearly as
successful as it could be.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.960
All right.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.980
So once you've done all those things,
you sort of throw it all into the pot,

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.940
you stir up the soup,
and I think out of that comes a great

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.100
starting point and a great understanding
for what your product can be.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.930
And then it's from there that you go on
to your development plans and you sort

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.760
of figure out what you're thinking about.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.880
What your feature set will be
and how are you going to end

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.290
up delivering the solution that
you think that market needs.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.210
And again, you know,
I touched on this a little bit before,

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.310
avoid the market buckshot approach,
buckshot market approach,

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.950
which is kind of like stick
the product in a gun and shoot,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.510
you know, and hope it hits as
many users as possible.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.310
It doesn't work, I don't think.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.990
And most of the developers I've met with
agree that if you focus the product,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.240
you're going to get a great,
great experience and great business.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.130
So that's planning, step one.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:54.870
The second thing is creating a first...
Creating a great first impression.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.510
This is all about surprising and
delighting users from the start.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.710
Remember,
you go to this restaurant and you get

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.540
this great aroma and the music is great
and you think the people you're with are

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.990
great and the whole thing is awesome.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.310
I think that is true
for software as well.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.760
And I've reviewed tons of software in
the years at Apple and I'll tell you,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.780
some get this right and some do not.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.000
I think first of all it
starts with packaging.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.600
What is your physical packaging
like if you're in a retail store?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.160
Clearly some of you might be
developing for enterprise or

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.620
for in-house or for schools.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.790
There may not be a real package,
so that's fine.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:29.720
Just ignore this.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.670
But for those of you in a retail store,
I think packaging is a big deal.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.890
If you're not communicating the
system requirements in the package,

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.330
you're setting yourself up
for a tech support call,

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.010
which costs money because a
user's going to call in and say,

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.850
hey, I bought this product and it
doesn't run on my machine.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.960
So make sure that system
requirements are really clear.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.990
If it runs on Mac OS X,
put the badge on it.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:53.500
Distribution.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.040
A lot of software goes in retail stores.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.770
It's on a CD.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.530
It's in a box.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.720
But equally, there's a lot of you selling
software directly on the Internet,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.540
and that's great.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.590
Disk images are the way to go.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.070
Put your software in a disk image.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.100
It's already compressed.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.500
You can put a password on
it if that's important.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.740
But avoid compressing the compressed.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:22.800
I have seen some really, really awful,
really scary situations where I've got,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.460
you know,
I get a CD or I download something,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.020
and there's stuff inside, you know,
there's a stuff inside an HQX,

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.560
inside of a DMG, inside of a... I don't
know how that happens,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.940
but it just does, and it's something that
we should all avoid.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.740
Installation is a great way to
create a great first impression.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.140
Make it dead easy.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.230
Users buy the product, they spent money,
they want to get this

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.860
thing up and running,
they probably have a real need

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:56.730
that they want to satisfy,
and if your product is a pain to install,

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:56.730
it's going to just knock down
their impression of the product.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:57.980
Drag installs are great.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.110
Disk images support drag installs.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.640
The thing mounts and you drag your
icon over to the applications folder.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.780
The user can put it wherever they want,
which I think is really

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.690
critical for installs.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.850
Disk images,
I don't know if you knew this,

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.960
but disk images allow you to display a
software license agreement or a EULA.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.060
It's a little bit hokey
getting it to work,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.560
but you can make it happen.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.010
And so if that's the only reason
you're using an installer,

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.460
so you can display some sort
of legal license agreement,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.910
you can actually get away from installer,
go to a disk image, and put that license

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.330
agreement in the disk image.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.920
or go with the
Mac OS X package installer.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.640
So there's a session later on today,
I think, about using the installer.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.480
I think it's important to avoid
shutting down other processes.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.600
Recently, I installed some software
for the Apple Design Awards,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.430
and the blasted installer forced
me to shut down everything

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.150
that was running on my machine,
my browser, my mail, everything,

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.880
just so it could install the software.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.750
I'm not sure why,
and it was a total pain.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.900
Avoid unnecessary authentication.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.820
If you're not installing outside of
the current logged-in user's domain

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.160
and just put stuff on that inside
their home directory or what have you,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.560
there's no need for authentication,
so don't ask me to authenticate.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.570
It's a bother.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.520
And avoid custom installers.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.500
Don't write your own thing.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.900
Just use what's available today on
Mac OS X or from some third parties.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.260
There's some good software
installers that are available.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.340
And the other thing is
consider first-time launch

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.300
initialization or configuration.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.080
So allow for a drag install,
but then the first time

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.510
your app is launched,
build in sort of your own

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.720
custom installer at that point,
but don't make it look like an installer.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.520
Just sort of display an alert that says,
one moment, please, while we get set up.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.280
Or if you're a game for kids, say,
one moment, please,

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.000
while Mickey Mouse gets ready to
play with you or what have you.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.980
And in the background,
you're installing some stuff.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.290
So I have four little girls,
and there's no more frustrating thing

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.300
for me than when my wife calls and says,
we got this CD from you that you

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.880
brought home from work to try.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.640
And she says, we can't install it.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.160
And my nine-year-old calls.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.900
And there's multiple installers.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.680
It's a total pain.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.700
And I think this is a great way to
create a great first impression.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.900
So I don't want to belabor the point.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.900
Now, I was going to do an install,
a lousy install demo.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.420
And I decided not to in the end because
to save the face of the developer.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.140
But I'm going to tell you about it
so that there's no logos displayed.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.510
This is an app that is an
installer from a very well-known

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.440
manufacturer of printers.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.090
And it is.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.260
It's actually for a scanner.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:30.020
And so you download this disk image,
and you run this thing,

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.160
and it mounts on the desktop,
and there's a single icon.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.030
And you think, okay, great.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.860
But it's clearly not a drag install.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.820
It's got a crummy icon.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.280
It looks like Mac OS 9.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.780
And you double-click this thing,
and you get a license agreement.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.500
And you say agree.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.640
And then it says it runs this funky,
custom,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.480
totally non-Mac interface look and feel.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.840
And so, okay, you figure, okay.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.520
And you click accept or
whatever the question is.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:53.900
And it says it's going to go.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.670
And it says it's going to go
off and install all this stuff.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.440
Remember, it's just a scanner installer,
okay.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.050
It's just making the
scanner work that I bought.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:00.920
And.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.400
Eleven minutes later,
seven authentications later,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.270
and 2,700 files later,
the software is installed.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.240
And you know what?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.540
I got a Rolodex software,
and I got this image editing thing,

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.590
and I got all kinds of other software,
some of which applied to scanning,

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.910
most of which did not.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:26:34.800
[Transcript missing]

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.170
The fundamentals.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.710
This is all about the essential
elements that your product should have.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.830
And I think pretty much
every product in Mac OS X,

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.470
if you're shipping to end users
and you're an application,

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.440
this is a big section that
I'm going to talk about here.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.120
But you know what?

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.140
This is the stuff that your
app needs to be leveraging.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.370
If it's not, you're going to be totally,
you're going to be,

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.560
somebody else is going to stand above
you in terms of the competitive space.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.270
Your competitor is going to come out
and adopt some of these technologies,

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.120
and I think they're going to stand head
and shoulders above you as a result.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.230
So, understanding what the essentials
are means that you need to understand

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.250
what the Mac OS X environment is
and what it brings to the table.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.390
Mac OS X environment
has a single menu bar.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.370
There's just one.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.720
So don't stick other
ones inside of windows.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.830
It's a layered multi-windowing system.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.950
MDI doesn't cut it.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.980
We don't want child windows
inside of a single parent window.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.510
That's what the desktop is, right?

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.130
We want multiple windows that
we can minimize to the dock.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.310
Don't create some other
dock inside of a window,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.880
you know, the MDI experience.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.120
That just doesn't cut it.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.040
So if your app's
shipping on the platform,

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.270
this is a basic that
you've got to adhere to.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.630
Another reality of Mac OS X is the dock.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:42.710
The dock is there.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.740
It's just there.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.650
Users can move it around the screen,
but it's a reality, and it is there,

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.150
and your application needs
to respect where the dock is,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.440
because there's nothing more
frustrating than unplugging your

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.640
PowerBook from a large display at work,
going on a trip, opening up your display,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.640
and suddenly now this app window
is hidden behind the dock,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.300
and you can't resize it, and, you know,
little things like that.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.180
So respect the dock's position
and size your windows accordingly.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.620
And there's some standard behaviors
for when your app icon is clicked.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:30.680
Mac OS X is an always-on environment.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.710
Don't rely on rebooting to clear out
caches or clear out temporary files.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.120
It's an always-on environment.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.570
My PowerBook stays live.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.180
I think I probably reboot
every couple of days for,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.810
well, I'll tell you why in a
moment on my next slide.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.460
But there's a reason why I reboot.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.000
But you know what?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.780
If I didn't have it for that situation,
I probably would leave my PowerBook on

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.580
for days and not have to restart.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.400
It's always sleep, wake, sleep, wake,
sleep, wake.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.760
The system is always on.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.930
Don't rely on login items to be the
way that stuff's going to start up.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.700
If users cancel a process somehow,
and you're relying on login

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.470
to start that thing up,
and there's no other way for the

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.130
user to start up that process,
I think you're in trouble.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.090
Well, actually, the user's in trouble,
and they may not know

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.890
to get you in trouble,
but...

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.010
Another thing about
Mac OS X's environment is

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.220
that it's highly adaptable.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.850
The beautiful thing about Mac OS X is
it adapts to all kinds of changes.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.620
I take my PowerBook on my
bike to work every day,

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.710
and I plug it into a
cinema display on my desk,

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.820
I plug it into the Ethernet network,
and I often unplug it throughout the day,

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.480
probably 16, 18 times.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.020
I'm going in and out of my office,
plugging this thing in, unplugging it,

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.070
going to meetings,
unplugging from the wired hard LAN,

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.000
you know, the Ethernet,
and going on to airport.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.860
So I'm detaching and attaching displays.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.000
I'm detaching and attaching the Ethernet.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.140
I'm unplugging and
plugging my USB printer,

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.000
and that's the reason I have
to restart my machine,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.940
because it doesn't realize that
it's an adapting environment,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.060
and eventually,
it just kind of craps out,

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.540
and my machine has to be rebooted,
because I can't print anymore,

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.280
because this driver hasn't adapted
to the fact that I'm going to be

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.710
unplugging and plugging constantly.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.260
If you're developing
software for the platform,

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.880
understand it's a highly
adaptive platform,

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.460
and therefore,
your app needs to be highly adaptive,

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.020
too, and I'm sure you can all
identify products you've

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.400
used that are not adaptive.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.160
Another key element of
Mac OS X is multiple users.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.840
This is true multi-user stuff.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.270
It's not,
for those of you who came from Mac OS 9,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.500
it's not pseudo multi-user environment.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.460
Mac OS X is a truly multi-user system,
and there's some implications for you,

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.420
the app developer, because of that.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.380
If you have shared resources,
shared blocks of memory,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.300
or what have you, understand that-- well,
first of all,

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.300
if you allocate memory and you expect
that if you have multiple instances

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.200
of your app running that they're going
to use that shared block of memory,

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.760
then you can use a little
trick called identifying

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.860
those blocks with session IDs.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.100
But understand,
because of multi-user environment

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.240
and fast user switching,
a user could launch

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.100
your app in one session.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.840
Somebody else could come along and say,
oh, hey, can I just borrow the

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.860
machine for a second?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.720
Or, you know, can I borrow the machine?

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.180
Get on it,
switch out to their environment,

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.340
and launch your app as well.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.460
So now you've got two
instances of your app running.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.840
What are you going to do with
some of those shared resources?

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.400
And can your app handle that?

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.130
Can it run in multiple contexts?

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.300
Don't assume exclusive
access to resources.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.640
You might be running
in multiple contexts.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.960
If your app is using the
iSight camera right now,

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.900
and another user comes along and swaps
out fast user switches to their account,

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:32.080
you need to give up that camera
so that if they're using iChat,

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.260
or some other software that needs
the camera or some other resource,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.580
that that's freed up.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.980
Don't lock it and hold it so
that nobody else can use it

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.210
in any other user context.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.760
Not all users have the
same access privileges.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.520
So in one context,
if your app is making some assumptions

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.480
about privileges on the hard drive,
it can't necessarily make the

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.300
same assumptions in the other
context in which it's running.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.730
Not all users can write to
the applications directory.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.730
Multiple users,
if your app is running and users save,

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.900
default to their home directory.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.800
And while I'm talking
about home directories,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.410
let me just make a point here
that the documents folder

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:10.620
is only for user-created,
double-clickable documents.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.480
Don't stick anything in the
documents folder that relates to

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.570
supporting application support files.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:25.300
Fast user switching introduces or brings
to light an interesting user experience,

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.520
which is I might be working currently
on the machine in a bunch of software,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.100
and I'm editing a bunch of documents,
and I didn't save them yet,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:33.880
because that's how a lot of people work,
actually.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.940
And someone comes along to that machine.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.870
Think of the classroom,
context of a classroom or

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.910
higher ed or even in an office.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.440
Multiple users using the single machine.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.530
Current user is editing stuff.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.710
Another user comes along,
switches out to their,

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.810
logs into their account,
so these files aren't saved, right,

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.980
because the context is just switched out.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.300
And now the second user
shuts down the machine.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:02.080
Well, your app can do some basic stuff
to deal with that and really

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.520
create a great user experience.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.560
And the Mail app does this today.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.260
Basically,
it's called Fast Logout and Auto Save.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.550
As long as your app handles
the standard quit Apple event,

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.620
you're going to get notification
that the machine is going down

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.220
or that your app has to quit,
basically.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.490
And at that time,
make sure that your app can deal

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:24.300
with saving a file to a temporary
location provided by the system

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.350
without any user interaction.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.400
So just assign it some name,
untitled or what have you,

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.810
put it to the temporary
location as a draft,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.280
and then when your app
restarts next time,

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.760
check that temporary location for
any files that are of your type and

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.230
open those things up automatically.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.540
Try it with Mail.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.320
It does a great thing.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.500
You're drafting some emails, boom,
the system goes down.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.560
Next time you launch Mail,
those windows open up.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.670
How cool is that?

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.650
Every app on the platform
should be doing that.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.320
Another thing about the
Mac OS X environment is that it provides

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.370
consistent interface for common tasks.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.550
The beauty of common interfaces is that
users have the experience of picking

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:07.690
people or fonts or whatever they're
interacting with from other applications,

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.370
and so they bring that experience
to bear in your application.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.980
If your app then allows them to pick
fonts or choose colors in a completely

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.510
different way that's custom for your app,
the user has a problem.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.870
So I think just using all of the
APIs that are available in Mac OS X for

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:23.560
common interfaces is just great.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.340
It's just good.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.630
It's a good thing to do.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:27.950
Some examples here,
Address Book Framework,

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.280
Disk Recording for
standardized UI for that,

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.470
Apple Help for user assistance,
and many more.

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.890
I didn't even list half of them here.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:40.620
Yet another fundamental and essential
on Mac OS X for every application on

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.900
the platform is the accessibility and
spoken interface feature of Mac OS X.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.480
Spoken interface today is
in a public or beta preview.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.100
It's going to be shipped and
built into Mac OS X Tiger.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.340
If your application,
if your product is shipping

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.590
into education at any
level or into government,

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:02.150
you need to understand that
Section 508 is a big deal.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.780
Most customers aren't going to
be purchasing software that's

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.280
not Section 508 compliant,
and there's stuff you can

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.660
do today to prepare for this
capability coming in the future.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.000
It's actually a lot of this
is in Mac OS X Panther today.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.100
The accessibility stuff in Spoken
Interface was designed for users who

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.210
are blind or have low vision or other
vision disabilities and other learning

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.270
disabilities or learning disabilities.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.520
It's built in, not bolted on.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.900
There's no extra installer,
no licensing to be done from you.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.610
It works the same way
in every application.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.450
It leverages the keyboard shortcuts
that you have in your app.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.570
It just works with
everything that you've done,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.020
provided you follow the rules.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.000
And there are rules for how to develop
accessible applications for Carbon,

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.980
Cocoa, and Java.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.320
Every developer can do this,
and the experience is basically

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.560
that everybody can participate
and use your product,

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:50.690
all inclusive.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.950
John Geleynse

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.820
Another reality on Mac OS X,
and this is really cool stuff,

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.640
is the multilingual capabilities.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.480
The international technologies and
Unicode support in Mac OS X enable

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.040
you to ship an app that is
deployable in dozens of languages.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:10.340
Mac OS X, out of the box, ships with,
what, I don't know, 16 languages?

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.450
Your app doesn't need
to do anything extra.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.360
You don't need to
license any extra fonts.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.250
You don't need to create any extra code
for rendering these fancy characters,

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:23.120
Japanese or Chinese or Hebrew or
whatever language you want to display in.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:27.090
It's just there, and it's for free,
provided you adopt Unicode.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.600
Well, some of you might sit
in the audience and say,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.660
well, it doesn't matter.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.250
I just ship in the UK,
or I just ship in North America.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.400
Well, you know what?

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.950
There's more and more schools,
for example,

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.710
that have students coming in from
other countries who don't speak,

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.960
in North America here, for example.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.710
More and more students coming
in who don't speak English,

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.960
who have a foreign, you know,
mother tongue, and they're coming

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.100
into an English school.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.400
How cool would it be if
the software they used,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.580
displayed an interface in their language,
in their mother tongue,

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.400
and the curriculum in English?

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.940
Well, let me show you what
that would look like.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.240
It's a real quick demo,
but this shows off just how a standard

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.490
app that's currently available
in Mac OS X can show multiple

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.100
languages in a single document.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.420
So I'm just launching this RTF file.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.440
It's showing in TextEdit one document.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.540
No extra code in TextEdit to do this.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.460
It's just Unicode compliant.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.780
Your app can display
all of these languages.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.880
It's all selectable text-- Thai, Greek,
Hebrew, Arabic, Korean, Russian, Hindi.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.860
Hey, something happened there.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:36.580
It worked last night.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.890
But anyway, you could select this stuff,
drag and drop it to the desktop.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.270
It's just standard behaviors,
and your app can do this.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.600
And I don't have time,
but we could switch out

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.530
TextEdit to the Finder,
change its default language.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.830
It would launch in Japanese,
and this content would

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.170
display exactly the same.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.630
And I was just recently at NECC,
which is the

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.180
Education Computing Conference,
or whatever, anyway.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.380
It was for educators.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.360
And this really hit home
for the developers there,

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.660
the fact that they could deliver an
app on 10 that could display curriculum

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.630
in one language or multiple languages,
and the interface of the

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.560
application display in the
native tongue of the student.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.920
So just because you're not
necessarily sending your

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.870
product to multiple countries,
you might have users right

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:22.800
at home who are multilingual,
and your app can take advantage of that

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.260
and deliver a great experience for them.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.070
Another reality of
Mac OS X is gorgeous graphics,

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:28.500
right?

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.820
Quartz 2D and OpenGL deliver
some of the great stunning

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.920
effects you saw in the keynote.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:37.350
And all of that's great and
all of it's coming in tiger,

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.520
but the truth is

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.610
A lot of developers are nowhere near
developing products that look like some

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.380
of the stuff we showed in the keynote.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:54.650
The reality is a lot of developers
that I've interfaced with and that

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:55.740
my team have met with over the last
couple of years are still struggling

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:55.740
with this cross-platform thing.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.620
And the problem with cross-platform,
I mean, from a business point of view,

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.400
I understand completely,
and we're going to do everything to

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.410
help you deploy on multiple platforms.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:09.200
But the struggle from a user experience
point of view with cross-platform

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.770
development is that you typically
end up delivering a very sort of a

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:18.150
lowest common denominator experience,
whether it's through the

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:22.270
visuals or the interaction or
the quality of stuff on screen.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.540
It typically isn't
optimized for the platform.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.250
The great graphics on Mac OS X enable
everything you see on screen,

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.130
the transparency, the shadowing,
the animations that are going on.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.670
All of that stuff now is going
more and more through the

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.240
OpenGL pipeline and onto the GPU.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.530
If your app isn't leveraging that stuff,
you're not going to get

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:39.940
that great experience.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:46.700
And the truth is, if you take education,
for example, in the education space,

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:46.700
K through 12,

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.000
students are are getting gorgeous
graphics and surround sound

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.190
and a fantastic multimedia
experience on their game machines,

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.380
Game Boy Advance, Xbox, right?

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.300
And so they're having that experience
at home and then they come to school

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.030
and they're running with your product
in the classroom and you're you know,

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.580
on Quick Draw,
or you're doing something cross-platform.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.950
So it's just, it just doesn't cut it.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.300
And let me just show you,
I don't have stunning, you know,

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.750
rippling water kind of demos,
but I want to show you three

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.300
products that I think really
demonstrate this well.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.440
So the first is, I just want to contrast
Quick Draw with Quartz.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.490
Let me get rid of this.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.120
And here on the left,
we've got a fine product

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.510
called Apple Works.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:39.530
And on the right,
we've got a product called OmniGraffle.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.010
and OmniGraffle does diagrams and stuff.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.150
Anyway,
the point is it draws with Quartz,

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:44.720
Quartz 2D.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.500
And so I'm just going to zoom in
on this stuff here and show you

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.400
what's going on a little bit.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.690
So first of all,
support for Unicode text.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.420
I don't know what this says in Japanese,
and for the Japanese in the audience,

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.290
I apologize if this
is anything... Anyway,

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:59.430
I just put some characters in there.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.120
But this is the same text in Apple Works.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.750
Great Unicode support.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.400
So there's a problem there.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:07.870
Notice this.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.340
Let me zoom in even more here.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.700
Look at this gorgeous anti-aliased text,
right?

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.080
Look at the great smooth
line here that's drawn,

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.900
and the circle, fantastic,
nice smooth edges, right?

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:21.250
Knot.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.810
And you contrast that with great
anti-aliased text that displays

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:31.780
beautifully at any rotation,
any size, any effect you apply on it.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.360
Notice the circle is, sorry,
didn't mean to make you seasick there.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.940
Notice the circle is transparent.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.770
This one is not.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.440
No transparency support in QuickDraw.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.500
It's free in quartz.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:48.390
Gradient fills, a little bit more banded
here in Quick Draw.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.650
This is a really pixelated graphics.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.950
This is a rotated JPEG.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.460
Quickdraw can't handle
that very well at all.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.950
This is rotated in quarts.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.310
Now the picture itself
is a little pixelated,

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.670
so I apologize for that.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.260
I whipped this together and
I'm not a graphics demoing guy.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:07.580
But the point is, these curves, the text,
it's all great, and when you contrast

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.010
that with Quickdraw,
it just doesn't cut it.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.470
So it's up to you, right?

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.230
How are you going to
differentiate your product?

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:18.420
This is a great way to differentiate
it by leveraging Quickdraw 2D.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:23.730
Another app that I want to show you is

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:28.090
This application, it's Curvus Pro.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.940
If you think of on Mac OS 9,
there was the graphing calculator.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.750
Pretty cool app in its day, right?

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.610
But totally quick draw based.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.920
This is Curvus Pro.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.660
It takes full advantage of Quartz, 2D,
and OpenGL to do 3D models.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.060
Formulas, based upon formulas that
I have no idea what they mean.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.200
This is stuff I failed in school,
but nonetheless.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.910
You know, here's another one.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.560
This is pretty cool stuff.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.020
And you know what?

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.850
Because this app developer-- and this
was submitted to the Apple Design Awards,

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.130
by the way,
and it was written by a student--

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:06.240
Because this developer used Quartz 2D,
this stuff, they can print to PDF from

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.650
an OpenGL context.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.990
How cool is that?

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.080
Suddenly, that means that students
can take this stuff,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.280
print it to PDF,
send it off to somebody who

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.960
doesn't even have the app,
and say, Hey, teacher, look at, you know,

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.860
the formula that I came
up with last night,

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.760
and is this right?

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760
And what about this?

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.320
And, you know, whatever.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.380
They can distribute this through PDF,
so I think that's pretty cool.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.510
And so using the right graphics
technologies enables that.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.540
And lastly,

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.940
I want to show you the use of OpenGL.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.840
I think that really enhances
the student's experience.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:43.400
This is a product called Starry Night,
and I'm just going to go to...

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.520
A dark time of day.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.490
And essentially what you've got here
is you're in a field and there's some,

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.300
you know, some stuff in the background,
mountains and stuff.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:55.430
And as you point to the night sky,
any star, you're getting information

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.720
about that star and stuff is
moving along in real time.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.230
And so you see the night sky moving.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:03.170
This is a cool product, by the way,
if you just want to go out in

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.260
the backyard with your power book
and your children and show them

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.020
what's going on in the night sky.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.030
You can even turn on light
distortion from the city lights.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.480
Turn that on and it hides like a light.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.330
It's like most of the stars,
but you can get at some

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:16.300
of the brighter ones.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.340
Very cool stuff.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.500
Well,
what you can do is using OpenGL here,

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.760
I can just say go to, let's say, Neptune.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.140
So let's just say go there.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.740
And it takes us off from the earth.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.660
We go through the atmosphere.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.180
And hopefully this is
going to work nicely.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:42.210
I don't know if you can see,
there are stars flying by.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:42.210
Might be a little bit difficult
to see on screen here.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.880
I don't know, maybe it takes a long
time to travel to Neptune.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.230
Here we go, here we go, here we go,
here we go.

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.230
Here's Neptune.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:53.200
Not a very exciting planet.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:54.960
I don't know why we're a
little jerky all of a sudden,

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.210
but let's go back to Earth.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.120
We're heading towards the sun.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.580
And while that's running,
let me just keep talking,

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.400
and then we'll switch back to
the slides in a moment there.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.760
But you know, for students,
this is so compelling.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.860
This is so different than
looking at a textbook.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.620
And you couldn't possibly do
this kind of stuff in Quick Draw.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.530
So taking full advantage of the graphics
on Mac OS X are going to let you

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:28.520
distinguish your application like crazy
on the platform over your competitors.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.880
Okay, let's switch back to slides.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.430
I'm not sure.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.760
You know, the problem with demos is
sometimes they run great,

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.560
sometimes they don't.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.100
That's probably my fault.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.760
Another reality on Mac OS X is stuff
that you heard about in the keynote.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.420
It's the spotlight technology.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.540
This is certainly coming technology.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.180
It's not here today,
but I think there are things you

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.040
can do to start planning for this.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.590
You've seen the demos a couple times.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.870
I'm not going to go through that.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.660
There are some things you
can do today to support it.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.610
There's support for standard
stuff right out of the box,

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.310
but if you've got custom
proprietary file formats,

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.620
you can begin to think about
writing an importer for that.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.950
You can start using the standard
keys that exist in Spotlight,

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:13.060
but then you can help work with us as we
build a community around this technology,

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.620
help us define some of the custom keys
that we need to have for file types

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.160
that we maybe didn't think about or
for some workflows that are key in the

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.860
market segment in which you participate.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.400
So more information on the
community stuff that we're doing.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.250
So those are the fundamentals,
and that's a lot of stuff.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.220
But you know what?

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.490
When you bake bread,
you cannot leave out the key ingredients.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.880
If you create a great
dinner party for people,

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.880
there's some fundamentals
that have to be there.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.500
You've got to have
silverware on the table.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.850
You've got to have napkins.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.320
You've got to have a cup, right?

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.600
If you leave some of that stuff out,
the experience could go

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:46.830
downhill pretty quickly.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.390
It's the same thing with
software development.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.890
There's some fundamentals, I think,
that are going to enable

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.090
you to distinguish your
app from the competition.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.340
All right, designing for Aqua.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.660
Making things attractive and easy to use.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.570
This is all about the ambiance, right?

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.940
First impressions,
now I get this product going.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.300
Now how do I feel about it as I use it?

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.320
Is it great to look at and compelling?

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.570
Is our information organized well?

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.240
And is the usability, is it good?

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.420
And it's so important that it's almost
like the real estate expression when

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.000
you're selling a house or buying a house.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:21.700
I forget which it is.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:22.340
I'm not a realtor.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:22.720
I'm a software.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.690
But it's all about location, location,
location, right?

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:28.900
You can sell pretty much anything
if it's in the right location.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.170
And it's important.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:31.700
Location is important.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.530
Well, you know what?

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.300
Adopting Aqua and creating a delivery.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.830
a really great user
experience is that important.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.480
There's lots of stuff you need to do,
and we're gonna get

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.200
into this specifically.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.280
First of all, age old design principles.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.460
And you think, oh yeah,
I've heard this before.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.100
I read the human interface guidelines,
you know, 10 years ago, 12 years ago.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.560
Well, you know what,
this stuff is really important.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.320
We're still thinking about
these things as we design Aqua.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:02.200
And you should be, as you design your
application for the platform,

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.180
you should be thinking
about these principles.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.820
This stuff is not old.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:10.990
It's true, as true today as it
was when it was first,

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:13.880
you know, thought up and presented.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.180
And I'll give an example.

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:19.520
Feedback and communication,
I think one of the key characteristics

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:24.660
of Aqua today is the fact that it uses
animation through sheets and drawers,

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.940
the genie effect,
and different types of animations

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.780
through expose and stuff to
communicate status to users.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.050
It takes us to a whole new level in
terms of communicating status and

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.060
giving feedback as to what's going on.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.560
That's a real characteristic of Aqua.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.240
Modelessness.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:46.640
We've gone from being app modal for
many dialogues to being document modal.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.680
That's a trend towards modelessness.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.240
We're less modal now within the
application as a result of Sheets.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.560
So modelessness is a key
goal for us within Mac OS X.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.620
Aesthetic integrity.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.320
Aqua is just gorgeous compared
to what we had on Mac OS 9 or

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.320
compared to anything else elsewhere,
I think.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.730
The aesthetic integrity, the gorgeous,
the beauty of Mac OS X, I think,

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.920
just stands head and shoulders
above everything else.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.940
And if your app can't
fit into that world,

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.140
it's going to stand
out like a sore thumb.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.450
And if you've been in my sessions before,
I've showed lots of

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.840
examples of how that's true.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:27.590
Now, designing a good interface requires
that you follow those principles,

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.500
but also think about getting organized.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.520
And by getting organized,
I'm going to talk about something

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.840
called the user's mental model
or their conceptual model.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:38.020
What I mean by that is
that it's important,

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.840
as you understand your markets and
your users and what your feature is

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.200
going to do and the solution it's
going to provide to your users,

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.850
it's important that you
start to think about,

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:50.660
now, what is the user's conceptual model
or mental model as they approach the

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:52.880
task that your software is providing?

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.300
What are the concepts
they're thinking about?

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.260
What's the workflow that
they're experiencing?

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.270
What workflow have they experienced?

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.490
What objects and object
hierarchy exist in your product?

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:08.280
What expectations is the
user bringing to the table?

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.030
These are big questions to ask.

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.980
And a lot of developers that
I've interacted with haven't

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.890
even thought about this stuff.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.360
They've kind of just, you know,
their impression of what the software

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.020
should do and they've put it together.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.800
And while it's compelling,
it's not nearly as compelling

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.480
and doesn't register,
I think, with a lot of users.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.920
This is a really important
concept to get down.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.930
Once you've figured out
what that conceptual model

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.460
is for 80% of your users,
it's important to reflect that model

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.980
through the menu organization and layout
and organization of the main window,

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.840
toolbars, utility windows, et cetera.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.160
We'll go through a couple of examples.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.640
And when you design your product
to reflect that conceptual model,

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.640
it's important to keep these kind
of five points in your mind as well.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.600
Make sure that there are affordances.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.640
If something doesn't look clickable,
users won't necessarily know that it is.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.570
Design for simplicity.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.090
Keep simplicity in mind.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:00.960
Frequently accessed items
should always be accessible.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.960
Some of the best software
that I've ever used,

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.400
just instantly the stuff I needed
was right there when I needed it.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.400
And some of the products that
won the Apple Design Awards that

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.260
you'll hear about tonight really
reflect that concept well.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.890
Familiarity.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.240
People's mental model is based
on their previous experience.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.550
We talked earlier about leveraging
the existing UI that's delivered

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:22.640
through some of the APIs in Mac OS X.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.710
Take advantage of that
because it provides for a

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:26.280
familiar experience for users.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.980
Availability.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.230
It's a whole lot easier for people
to see something on screen that they

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:34.910
need to interact with than for them
to recall some menu command that's two

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.200
levels deep or some button in a dialog.

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:41.880
So expose the features that are critical
to users so that stuff is available.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.150
And provide good feedback to users,
and we'll talk about

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.310
that more specifically.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:52.970
So, how does that apply in the real
world in terms of the design that

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:54.600
we've implemented for some software?

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.730
Well,
if you think of iTunes and consider the

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:03.030
mental model or conceptual model that
most users have as they approach this,

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:08.000
they understand that it's a music
management piece of software.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.760
It manages their music.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.980
And so they have an understanding that
there's going to be songs in there.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.680
There's going to be some way
of organizing those songs.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.330
They probably have this idea
that you could play the stuff,

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:19.050
and then maybe they're searching.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.630
And so the UI is modeled
completely around that.

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:23.480
There's songs.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:26.220
It's a dominant part of the UI.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.390
There's the collections where we
organize the music into playlists,

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:31.330
smart playlists, etc.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:36.880
There's the playback controls, right,
very clearly on the interface.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.740
And lastly,
there's the searching functionality.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.850
It's all there.

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:44.460
So the UI reflects completely,
or almost perfectly,

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.730
the mental model that users
have as they approach the task.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.960
And so users just get up and running
with this product really fast.

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:50.850
They just get it.

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.500
That's what getting it means.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.980
Next example.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.030
This is a product called
Unison from Panic.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.780
These guys do great stuff.

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:05.880
This is a product that totally revives
the Usenet for Macintosh users.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.500
Now the Usenet's got lots of content,
and we'll not talk about

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.380
any of that specifically,
but there's some good stuff out there.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.750
And the mental model that
you approach Usenet with,

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:18.870
if you know what it is,
you understand what its hierarchy is.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.510
There's groups and there's
messages within groups,

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:23.940
and messages contain
pictures and other stuff.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.300
If you don't know what
Usenet's structure is,

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:30.450
Unison's product is so,
Unison is so well designed in

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:34.110
terms of the mental model that
it basically communicates the

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.490
model of the environment to you,
the user, and so you get it right away.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.000
And so here,
basically Usenet is all about groups,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.030
and so the main groups window is
structured in a way that you just

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.040
kind of go through the browser view.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.700
And there's a menu that
supports that key concept.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.370
And then within a message,
we've got the four elements of message,

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:55.930
files, images, music.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.790
And so there's a message
menu that is part of this.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:03.350
So the UI really supports
the model that exists.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.990
Soft RAID,
another great product in Mac OS X.

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:17.550
If you're doing RAID stuff,
you basically have a simple mental model,

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:17.550
which is you've got physical devices,

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:23.560
Which it calls "Discs." You've
got logical volumes on those

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:28.590
discs called-- You've got
logical volumes called "Volumes."

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:30.860
And there's a menu to support that,
sorry.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:34.500
And then there's a utilities menu,
which I don't highlight.

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:35.860
Sorry, I run through these slides again.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.280
There's a utilities menu,
which basically is,

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.760
you've got these hard disks,
you've got these volumes,

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.060
and then you do some utilitarian stuff
to these drives or these volumes,

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.800
and you format them,
or you partition them, or what have you.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.760
And that's it, that's the UI.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.240
And yet it's a highly complex,
highly functional product.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.200
It does a ton of stuff,
but most of it is hidden

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.510
behind the scenes for you,
the user, because you don't need

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:56.960
to be concerned with it.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.770
Another great product, Bike Route.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.610
If you're a cyclist,
this is a really cool product.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.090
It basically lets you download,
take map formats,

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:09.850
there's a certain map format out there,
I can't remember the exact details,

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:13.880
but there's maps out there about cycling,
biking paths or routes

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.700
that exist in the world.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.860
And you can load those maps
into the product and then come

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.470
up with custom bike trips.

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:24.960
And you choose different nodes
and then it's got this concept

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.920
of a map but then a route.

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:30.090
And then within a route you've
got the profile of that route,

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.390
which is the altitudes you might
cycle around and what the instructions

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.420
are for following that custom thing.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.990
Anyway,
the point is the UI totally supports

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.040
this model that you come to,
which is that I've got a map

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.800
and it's got routes on it.

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:48.120
And so the route could just
be between those two points,

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:50.320
and there's a menu associated with that,
and that's it.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.500
And so the mental model the user comes to
this product with is supported by the UI,

00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:00.390
and the hierarchy of objects and such
is set up in the main menu bar as well.

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:02.820
But it isn't always that easy.

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:04.460
It's easy to get this wrong.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:08.820
Here's a great product,
and this is in no way meant to

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.100
belittle the product in any way,
shape, or form.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:11.750
Mac Journal.

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:13.500
It won an Apple Design Award years ago.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.930
I think this is a really cool product.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.860
But there's one little
thing that I think is wrong.

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.050
And that is that as
I approach this product,

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:23.640
and as most users approach the product,
they have this concept of a journal,

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.720
which is kind of the container object,
right?

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.890
And within a journal, you've got entries.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.520
Well, the hierarchy of the main menu
bar doesn't reflect that at all.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:36.900
In fact, if you think about app menu,
document menu, right, file menu, edit,

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.180
and then other stuff,
which is where you kind

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.280
of go parent object,
child object, sub-child object,

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.870
et cetera,
that's the hierarchy you should

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:44.800
be reflecting in the menu bar.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.340
That's not reflected here.

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.500
So the journal,
which is the parent container object,

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.960
is actually further down
the menu bar than the entry.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:57.220
itself, because journals contain entries,
entry is really in the

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.420
place of the document.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:03.080
And I just -- personally,
I think that's backwards.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.290
So the change, I would say,
is just flip those around.

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.970
They call -- the window is
called the Journal Window.

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:09.970
It's actually the document format,
et cetera.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.500
And so I hope this drives home the
point that the menu bar needs to

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.600
reflect the hierarchy of your objects.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:16.560
Let's take another example.

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.840
If you're a multimedia
authoring application,

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:22.460
you probably have your document format,
which is your project.

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:24.900
Within projects, you've got a background.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.470
Well, you might have scenes.

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:28.940
Scenes have backgrounds.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:30.720
Scenes also have layers.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.130
Layers have, you know,
characters or objects.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.880
Objects have attributes.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.780
And so you could imagine
the menu bar going,

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:44.900
you know, app name, projects, edit,
scenes, you know, characters, format,

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.720
you know, for attributes, et cetera.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.960
And so your menu bar needs to reflect
that hierarchy from parent down

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.660
to the -- to the to the smallest
child sort of container element.

00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.000
And if you don't get the
mental model right at all,

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.600
basically you go back to what
I was talking about earlier in the

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.660
Knowing Your Application slide,
which is you get just feature creep.

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:07.640
Your product is all about
features rather than a solution.

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.470
Here's a product that is supposed
to be a to-do list manager,

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:15.220
but it's so laden with features
and buttons in the toolbar,

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:19.580
and I didn't even show the menu bar,
I don't even know where to begin.

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:23.460
I don't know what the model is
that this application works on.

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.820
And so it becomes a problem.

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.430
The feature, while it's a very,
very capable product,

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.280
and I'll just side note,
I'm working with this developer

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:34.780
to make this thing pretty cool,
but I wanted to show an

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:38.310
earlier instance of this window
because it's just messed up,

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.860
and you have no idea what
you're supposed to do.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.480
A to-do list manager product, to me,
should be very lightweight,

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:48.080
not in my face, be there when I need it,
and then go away when I don't need it,

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.460
and all that kind of stuff,
and this app doesn't do that.

00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:52.670
I can't size the window
beyond a certain small size,

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:56.290
which basically takes up my whole screen,
and there's too much stuff all over it.

00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:00.000
So, all right,
another element of designing

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.200
a great interface is providing
great feedback and communication.

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:11.080
You know, this is, in my opinion,
providing good feedback to your

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.710
users is like the feedback and
communication we need to have in

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.980
good relationships in our life,
whether it's to our bosses

00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:21.300
or our teammates or spouses
or children or what have you.

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.500
I think there's a great parallel
that can be drawn there.

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:27.800
And if you think about the feedback
that you provide in your application,

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:32.350
how you report errors or how you give
status updates or communicate progress,

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:35.670
it may not be so non-intrusive,
non-interruptive.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:35.800
You know,
this is a must for anyone involved

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:35.800
in developing a Mac OS X product.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:35.800
And if you think about the feedback
that you provide in your application,

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:35.800
how you report errors or how you give
status updates or communicate progress,

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:35.860
it may not be so non-intrusive,
non-interruptive.

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:35.860
You know,
this is a must for anyone involved

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:35.860
in developing a Mac OS X product.

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:35.860
And if you think about the feedback
that you provide in your application,

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:35.860
how you report errors or how you give
status updates or communicate progress,

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:35.860
it may not be so non-intrusive,
non-interruptive.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.800
in your application.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.960
You want to figure out what
are the reporting points?

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.800
What are those milestones that the
user really wants to know about?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.370
And then how do we effectively
communicate the reaching of

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:17.870
those milestones or the not
reaching of those milestones?

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.140
So only communicate status that matters.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.240
Use appropriate progress indication.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.300
So either an indeterminate bar
or a determinate progress bar

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.700
or the spinning gear thing.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:31.940
And related to that,
I think consistent placement of those

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.780
little gauges or dials or whatever
you're using to communicate status.

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.240
It should be consistent placement.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.160
If you look at mail, the spinning gear is
always in the same place.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.920
And users get accustomed to looking
in that location for an update as

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.630
to whether or not the machine is
busy or the application is busy.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.670
Consistent placement
of progress indicators.

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:57.820
Another way of communicating feedback
is through badging your dock icon.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.690
You can, like mail does,
you can show the number of

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.600
mail messages that are there.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.750
And other apps are doing some really
cool stuff with their application icons.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.080
And then providing users with useful
error messages and disabling commands

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.560
that don't apply in the current context.

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:14.810
I want to zero in on these
because I still see a lot

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:16.270
of difficulty in this area.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.180
So it's important to report errors,
but not this way.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.650
And this is out of a
shipping app on the platform.

01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:28.970
It's important to report errors,
but always check spelling.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.800
So this says, in case you can't read
at the back of the room,

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.880
it says, aim error.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.310
Could not add mformic at mac.com,
guy on my team, to your buddy list.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.950
Feedback error is zero.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:40.820
I'm not sure what a feedback error is.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:51.200
It's important to report errors or
report a situation that's occurred.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.340
It might not necessarily be an error,
but it's something that's occurred that

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.040
hinders you from proceeding further.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.670
Here's an app that I was
playing with the other day,

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:03.870
and it requires that you drag
and drop an image onto each side,

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.700
into these kind of giant
image wells or whatever.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:09.310
And so I dragged an
image in out of iPhoto,

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.760
and that was great.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.150
And then I dragged another image,
which happened to be oriented

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:15.850
differently than the first.

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:18.170
The one was portrait,
and the other one came in at landscape.

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.060
And I didn't know.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.300
There was no indication in the
UI that I couldn't do that.

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:25.700
And so I did that,
and I got this sheet came down,

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.840
and it said,
drag the image as a different size,

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:29.830
extend or crop.

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:38.820
Well, I just dragged an image in here.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.180
I don't want to extend or crop it.

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:43.100
And I'm not sure where distort came from,
actually.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:51.340
At this point, I'm thinking, OK,
but I can't cancel.

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:52.860
So now what's going to happen?

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.620
Now, in this case, it's not a big deal.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.140
But you know what?

01:02:55.140 --> 01:03:02.590
If this was some crazy 3D
rendering task that I just

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.500
started and I couldn't cancel,
I'd be screwed.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.310
Because this thing would go
off for a period of time,

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:11.580
and I'd be stuck because I couldn't
stop the thing from processing,

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.390
doing whatever it's doing.

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.700
So I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to do with this message.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.310
It doesn't communicate enough.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.820
I don't know where distort came from.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:28.730
It's important to report problems
effectively and provide users

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:29.720
with useful error messages.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.240
I've talked about this every year,
and I feel compelled

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:34.510
to talk about it again.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.240
I apologize if you were here before.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.680
What happened is what you
should say to the user,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.880
then tell them why it happened,
and then tell them what

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.760
they can do about it.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.310
What's the solution to the problem?

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.750
Avoid yes and no buttons.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.280
There's a lot of ambiguity.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.000
It's often very difficult to write
a good error message and then have a

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.020
yes or no button associated with it,
because the user can't, well,

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.960
we'll talk about why.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.260
There's that problem,
and then there's the other problem,

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.020
and that is that users tend
to scan the error message,

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.520
looking for kind of keywords, you know,
that indicate the problem,

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.800
and your button labels should
kind of capture those keywords

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:13.320
as the user scans that message
to know which button to click.

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:15.010
You know,
there's something about preferences,

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:17.140
and then there's a button that
says open system preferences.

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.500
So you just kind of go, whoop,
hit the button.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.200
and boom,
they're off to solving the problem.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.210
And then, of course,
you could prevent problems from occurring

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:28.420
in the first place by just disabling
menu commands or buttons that don't

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:31.500
make any sense in the current context,
but heaven forbid that that

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.220
would happen sometimes.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:37.780
So here's a way of reporting an error,
you know, error writing file to disk.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.860
Well, it's a good sentence.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.840
It's a complete sentence.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.960
Everything is there that you need
to have there to be good English,

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.440
but it's a little, you know,
it's not too outgoing.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:48.180
So a better report would be this one.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.520
The document cannot be saved
because the disk is full.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.870
Okay, so now I know a little bit
more about what's going on.

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:56.140
And I could probably, from this message,
figure out what I need to do,

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.830
which is if I want to save this document,
I've got to go to the finder and

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:01.670
get rid of something so I get a
little bit more space on the drive.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:05.870
But a whole lot better would
be to do something like this.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.860
And why is this better?

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.360
Because, first of all,
it communicates what happened.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.030
The document trip request
could not be saved.

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.860
Why did it happen?

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.250
Because the disk works stuff.

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:19.160
Not only is the disk full,
but it tells me which disk.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:23.210
A lot of us have partitioned drives,
multiple hard drives, iDisk, etc.

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:25.240
And now what do I do about it?

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.690
Try deleting documents from that drive
or saving the document on another disk.

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:31.790
That's a good error message.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.340
And I wish I would get this kind
of stuff in all of the applications

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.610
that I run on the platform.

01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:38.190
And it means a little bit of extra
work on your part as a developer,

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.300
as an engineer,
because you've got to start looking

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.220
at some of those error codes that
are coming back from the APIs.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.690
And that's hard, but you know what?

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.980
The end result is a great,
great experience for customers.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.330
And again, prevention is the key.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:55.120
Rather than display a dialogue
or an alert that's like this,

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.320
that says, "You must select at least one
student "before printing the

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:00.780
student attendance summary report,"

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:02.470
Disable the menu items.

01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:04.570
So I can't go up and say print
student summary report if

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:06.400
there's no student selected,
right?

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.070
It's easy.

01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:09.490
You can do this,
and a lot of apps are doing it,

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:13.560
and I hope to see this happening in
100% of the apps on the platform.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.280
So prevent the problem
in the first place,

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.440
then you don't have to look at the
error messages and report the alerts.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.050
All right, I've got a few minutes left.

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:25.040
Use standard controls.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.630
If you're delivering
software on the platform,

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:28.280
it should look like
software on the platform.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.340
So there's a ton of stuff in the system,
whether it's AppKit or HIToolbox.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.260
And these are just some examples
of the different sizes of controls.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.860
Many controls were shipped last year.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.440
They're available in Panther today.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.740
They should be used not
in your main dialog boxes,

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.070
but they should be used
in your utility windows.

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:46.690
And don't mix and match control
sizes within the same window,

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:49.380
whether it's a main window or
a dialog or utility window.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.220
All right, laying things out.

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:55.800
These examples are dialog boxes,
but they could equally be main windows.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.980
And all of this is true for any window
type that you're designing on screen.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.770
So there's a tendency in
Aqua to center equalize,

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.990
and I see people getting
this wrong over and over,

01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:07.850
so that's why I feel compelled
to talk about it for a moment.

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:12.810
Center equalize doesn't mean that
everything gets center aligned,

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.080
you know, so that you've got kind of
the centered effect on screen.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.320
This is a tab pane.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.630
So you basically lay out your content
according to the layout rules that

01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:27.330
are in the human interface guidelines
that I'm going to touch on shortly,

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:27.330
but then you take

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:30.190
I draw a bounding box around all
of it and then sort of center

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.650
that box within the tab pane.

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.560
And each tab pane might
have different edges,

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.440
sizes, but it all gets centered in there.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.820
Here's another example
of where it's done.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.000
Notice if you drew,
notice the orange box around the content,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.820
that box is centered within the dialogue,
and then everything else

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.200
is organized around that.

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:53.240
Here is another thing
that needs to be done,

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.300
and that is to right
align all of your labels.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.330
If you're labeling groups or labeling
radio buttons or what have you,

01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:01.290
those labels need to be right
aligned along their colons.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.240
They also need to have
colons behind them.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:09.280
Equally, you left align the
controls in those sets.

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:12.160
And when you do that, it looks great,
actually.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.840
Oops, my apologies.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.820
The last one was basically
showing that within,

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.920
under the size points there,
that that stuff is indented,

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.800
but it's left aligned with sort of
the parent controls that it's under.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.720
This is all about providing
appropriate spacing.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.720
I still see stuff crammed onto
dialog boxes and no margins,

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.010
and, you know, it just,
it doesn't feel like

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.240
it's cleaned up nicely.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.060
And so there's appropriate
margins that need to be there.

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:41.700
There's standardized
spacing for between items,

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.660
between related items in
groups that are there.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:53.400
There's a larger spacing between
sort of less related groups.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.880
And then there's a larger spacing between
sort of distinct groups on screen.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.420
And you don't even
necessarily need the line,

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.890
the horizontal line
that's on that screen.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.070
Action buttons go in the lower right,
nowhere else, lower right.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:13.040
And the OK button is on the right side,
and it's OK, O-K,

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.920
not okie dokie or OKAY or
different variants of that,

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:19.520
which I've seen.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.160
This is really something I see,
and if you get it right, it's great.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.180
It produces a really great design.

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.300
But start your labels and check
boxes and radio buttons with

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:34.770
verbs so that all the user really
needs to scan at a just glance,

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:38.210
and they know that if dither is off,
it means it's not dithered, right?

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.180
So it's really easy to figure
out what the check box or the

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.210
radio button really represents.

01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:46.090
And there's a ton more
I could talk about,

01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:50.030
but I'm already down to like
five minutes left in the session.

01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:54.630
But things like quality icons and,
you know, quality rendered icons and

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.960
well-organized toolbars,
you know, not populating your toolbars

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.180
with hundreds of icons,
or even 30 or 15 is

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.000
too many in many cases.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.370
You know, we can't get into that.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.340
File name extension support,
always display,

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.320
use the display name for the document.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.130
If the user didn't name
it with an extension,

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:15.930
they don't want to see the extension
in their document window title.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.550
Quality graphics, all of the graphics
that you draw on screen,

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:23.660
whether it's static images or anything
else should be drawn with quartz,

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:27.500
or at least if it's a static image
should be drawn by a graphic artist,

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.960
a visual designer.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.380
And reserved keyboard shortcuts.

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:35.560
Please honor the reserved keyboard
shortcuts that are... identified

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:36.820
in the human interface guidelines.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.910
So, that's the fourth thing you can do,
the fourth area that you can focus

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:43.920
on to create a product that's
distinguished from the competition.

01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:47.360
And the last area is really
about delivering quality service.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.060
Right?

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:51.250
There's no bigger turn off than
going to a great restaurant and

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:52.750
getting really crappy service.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.590
And I think when it comes
down to applications,

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.870
the analogy I'll draw is performance.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.970
And you're going to get a lot of
content on this at other sessions.

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:03.240
If you hadn't thought
about this material before,

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.230
you need to think about this stuff,
because it makes a difference.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:04.270
And I think when it comes
down to applications,

01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.290
the analogy I'll draw is performance.

01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:04.310
And you're going to get a lot of
content on this at other sessions.

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.330
If you hadn't thought
about this material before,

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:04.760
you need to think about this stuff,
because it makes a difference.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.160
Because it makes a difference.

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.950
It's a big difference.

01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:08.680
Performance is measured in two ways.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.720
I think when you talk to
users about performance,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.600
they think about either number crunching,
just raw data processing.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:21.380
How fast does the app blur an image
or do whatever transform it's doing or

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.900
whatever data processing it's doing.

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.050
And other users think of performance
as kind of productivity and

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:28.060
interaction responsiveness.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.460
All of those things can be
tuned on Mac OS X using a ton

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.400
of tools that are available.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.770
But really it comes down to you need to
build into your development cycle time

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.850
to do the analysis using those tools.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:45.720
Your engineers or you the engineers
need to be using these tools

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.920
because the results are dramatic.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.840
In developer relations,
we hold workshops.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.700
If you've been to one,
you know what the outcome is.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.470
But if you don't know about them,
there are workshops

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.320
that are held at Apple.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.800
And we run developers through
these programs for two days

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.120
or three days or four days.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.370
And we teach them these tools.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.600
And at the end of three or four days,
we see dramatic,

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:09.020
dramatic increases in the productivity
or the performance of products.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:12.300
Just by running these tools and
identifying bottlenecks in your code,

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.960
identifying where you could
optimize for velocity engine,

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.960
identifying older APIs that
you shouldn't be using.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.700
There are more modern
versions and that type thing.

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.370
If you're a Carbon app,

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.980
There's a bunch of
things you can do today.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.420
And the reason I bring up
Carbon Apps specifically is

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.570
it's the Carbon developers,
in many cases,

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.680
who need to spend a little bit
more time on these kind of things.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.770
There's a lot of stuff you can do
if you're a Carbon App today on the

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:40.740
platform to optimize for Mac OS X.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.520
Certainly, Cocoa developers can optimize,
too.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.290
I'm not saying that.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.620
But be lazy.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.060
Don't start up your app and initialize
every single buffer that your app's

01:12:50.210 --> 01:12:54.000
ever going to use that the user's
going to potentially run into.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.230
Don't load all the movies and get
all the files ready to go so that

01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:01.540
when the user clicks some feature,
it happens instantly.

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.120
Be lazy.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.590
Do all that stuff when the user does it,
because it makes startup

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.820
times really slow.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.640
Reduce your memory footprint.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.300
All this stuff.

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.580
Maco binary format, pre-bind, thread.

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.420
There's a great session on threading
this week by Xavier Legro on my team.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.080
Really, really good stuff.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:20.480
There's good content here at the
conference for making your apps totally,

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.060
totally fast on the platform.

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:27.780
So that's high performance,
great service, deliver great service.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.830
And so in the end,

01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:36.290
There are five areas you could focus on,
and I think if you did these,

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.290
you'd deliver great
applications on the platform.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.020
And the pushback we get from developers
as I meet with them often is,

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.330
yeah, but you know what?

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.220
At the end of the day,
you guys have really small market share,

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.360
and so it's really hard to get this done.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.740
Why would we do this stuff?

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:53.470
Why would we go the extra
mile for the platform?

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.010
And I always counter with the fact that,
well, whatever the current stat is,

01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:00.210
but Steve released,
the current stat that Steve released

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:04.840
yesterday in the keynote is that there
are 12 million Mac OS X users today.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.480
Sure, there could be 200 million.

01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:11.770
But there are 12 million users today.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:16.630
How many of you would like to have
even half of those as your customers?

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.710
How many of you would like even a
quarter of those to have a copy of

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:21.540
your product and run that product?

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.000
Right?

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:27.090
The reality is there are lots of
users out there on Mac OS X who

01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:29.100
are not running your product,
and they're probably not running it

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.970
either because they're not aware of it
or because they've run it and they had

01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:33.480
a poor user experience or what have you.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.690
There's a variety of reasons,
but there's a lot you can do to elevate

01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:38.980
your profile in the Macintosh community.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.840
And partnering with Apple and doing
stuff through developer relations,

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.230
we can help raise that exposure.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.020
Make sure your product is listed
in the Mac Products Guide.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.260
Make sure you're posting
on the right websites.

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.520
Make sure your app is optimized
for the platform and is designed

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.270
in a way that distinguishes itself
from every other application.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.910
Think of the apps that you
found out about just by reading

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:04.260
a review about them that were
totally awesome on the platform.

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.360
Why are they totally awesome?

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.660
Because they leveraged Quartz.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.340
They were optimized for the platform.

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.580
They have gorgeous UI.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.820
They've done everything
right or most things right.

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:18.280
And I would encourage you to look
at these five areas and a lot of

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.970
other areas that are covered in the
conference and deliver this stuff,

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.400
and you're going to have a really,
really great,

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.780
you're going to have a really great,
I think you're going to

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.400
get more customers and your
business is going to go up.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.180
So lots of documentation
available for you on the DVD,

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.080
I believe.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.120
And if it's not on the DVD,
it's certainly available on the

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.370
developer website or on the disk
image that's downloadable off of

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.900
connect.apple.com for this session.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:42.800
Great document is
Apple Software Design Guidelines.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.760
Check it out and the
Human Interface Guidelines.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.600
And then tonight,
come celebrate here with the developers

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.580
who did a lot of this stuff and really
produced great products because we're

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.680
going to highlight them on stage,
give them an award,

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.190
give them a PowerBook or a G5 and
a cinema display as a recognition

01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:59.810
of the great software and the
great work that they've done.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.240
So thank you for being here.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.880
I hope this was valuable for you,
and I look forward to your feedback,

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.330
and I hope you have a
great conference this week.
