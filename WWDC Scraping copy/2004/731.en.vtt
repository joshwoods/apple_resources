WEBVTT

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.710
Anyway, I started with Apple back in
February working on Motion,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.430
and if we could go to the
keynote machine please.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.070
Motion was developed from
the ground up in OS X.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.260
It was developed using Cocoa.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.470
And as such, it has all the advantages of
the Unix architecture and the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.400
OpenGL that goes along with that.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.640
But it's been a really great
environment to run in and to develop

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.400
motion graphics software for,
for a number of reasons,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
because we need real time
performance in motion graphics.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.400
We need to see what we're
doing as we're designing it.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.080
And it's traditionally been difficult
at best to get that type of performance,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.400
except on very expensive hardware.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.400
So Motion, out of the box,
is set to--there we go.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.400
Aimee Nugent's not here.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.400
I'm Kent Oberheu, in case we missed that.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.100
But Motion is designed out of
the box to be a really high end

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.370
motion graphics application.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.400
You can design in real time.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.240
You can see what you're
doing as you're doing it,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.250
which is unprecedented for
the desktop environment.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.400
What are Motion Graphics?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.400
What are Motion Graphics?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.370
What are Motion Graphics used for?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.330
Well, they're used for titles for movies,
titles for DVD and video,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.120
motion titles that you
would use in DVD Studio Pro.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.720
They're also used for lower thirds,
which is a common term used

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.360
in news graphics and in
things like documentaries,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.890
and where they, you know,
put the person's name and what

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.170
they do and how they're related.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.610
Graphics eye candy for raves and whatnot.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.710
So some of the advantages
of why motion is important,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.030
and we'll start out,
first one here is scalable interface.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.700
We have a really scalable
interface from basic to advanced.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.690
What that means is we sort of unfold
the interface as you need to see it.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.700
We don't actually force you to
see all the controls at once.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.450
So to start off we have a really
simple toolbar sitting across

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.700
the top of the canvas which you
can't see entirely in this image.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Layer view which allows
you to stack and composite,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.800
and a file browser which is
really like the Mac OS X finder

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.590
built into the application.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.590
On the other side of the
screen we have the canvas,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.520
which all is in one screen really,
which allows you to see

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.700
your composites as you work.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.420
The dashboard which is
your on-screen controls,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.830
it's a semi-transparent widget
that is context sensitive and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.090
updates with controls based on what
you're currently doing and which

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.700
object you currently have active.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.680
You have a mini timeline which
is a little bit more complex.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.600
It's collapsible so you don't
actually have to see the full

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.660
on timeline all the time.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.620
It sits across the bottom of your
workspace and allows you to see where

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.700
your object currently is active,
is sitting in time.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700
It allows you to scrub as well, controls.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.700
And then of course the full on timeline
which shows you compositing and layers.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.700
Our second key feature is
real time design engine.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.760
Well the real time design engine,
what that allows you is a dynamic

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.700
real time design so you can see what
you're doing as you're doing it,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.980
get instant feedback that accelerates
filters so we can see what

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.630
filters are doing simultaneously.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.700
So that's a really cool feature.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.180
It even gives us the ability to
do live recording of animations.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.000
and of course scalable performance
based on whatever your hardware is.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.860
So if you've got a faster
graphics card you're going to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.060
see that much better performance.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.760
Next key feature is behaviors.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.670
What are behaviors?

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.370
Well,
behaviors are procedural based animation.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.710
They're actually objects that
connect to another object that say,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.200
"You do this over this time,"
or "You do this over this time."

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.900
Simple things from fade in,
fade out, to spinning,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.490
to advanced things like
simulation behaviors where we

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.870
have gravity and wind interacting,
collision detection and things like that.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.240
and it allows you to interact with
multiple behaviors simultaneously,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.590
so you can even stack these behaviors.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.170
We'll go through that a little
later in the presentation.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.200
The next key feature is integration.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.930
How do we integrate with
the Apple Pro lineup?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.490
Well, it's actually really incredible.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.550
We have XML export straight from
Final Cut Pro that will actually

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.940
save a motion file from your entire
timeline or a portion of your timeline,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.590
opens directly in motion,
it's not importing,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.430
it just is a motion file that opens,
allows you to move objects around,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.780
add text, add filters,
add different composite modes,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.510
different translations to these things,
and then you can save that,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.900
and immediately that is visible
in the Final Cut Pro timeline.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.890
The same thing works with DVD Studio Pro.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.600
You don't even have to
render these things.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.080
You can just take a .iomo.tn file and
just open that up in DVD Studio Pro,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.270
make changes, update it instantly.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.030
Of course,
you can do your final export to tape

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.640
or to disk or you're burning your disk,
it does the rendering at the same time.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.600
Some of the feature highlights.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.480
So I mentioned earlier the user
interface design is rather innovative.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.040
We've got a dashboard, semi-transparent.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.650
You probably saw the
Mac OS X Tiger dashboard

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.100
that comes with widgets.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.760
It's a similar type of interface.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.110
It's context sensitive.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.960
It's floating.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.090
It's transparent.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.080
You can move it around in your
workspace to have it where you need it.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.100
And it changes based on whatever
it is you're currently using.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.100
So if you're using a scale widget,
it changes the scale widget.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.820
If you're using a spin behavior,
it updates with the spin

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.100
behavior you see here.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.300
Also we have on-screen controls
for all the transformation scale

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.830
and rotation so you can dynamically
resize things in the canvas window.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.060
Gestures are fully supported,
which is a tablet-based interface.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.100
Any of you who have ever
seen a flame artist work,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.430
they use a tablet and they're constantly
going like this on the tablet and you're

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.050
wondering what in the world they're
doing and stuff's happening on screen.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.220
We support gestures.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.100
It's using the ink technology.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.960
It lets you work in a full screen mode
where you can actually have the canvas

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.660
filling your screen and you're not
actually required to have all your tools

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.100
visible if you don't want to see them
and you're working with a client live.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.950
It's really great technology.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.100
And of course we have
the keyframe editor.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.380
Filter effects, of course,
are important to any graphics

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.100
application these days.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.220
We use hardware accelerated,
actually GPU accelerated filters are

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.100
very important to motion and they allow
you to see things like Gaussian blurs,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.310
light rays in real time,
which is pretty much unprecedented

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.100
at 30 Hz in the past.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.010
Light rays support for
After Effects plug-ins as well.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.090
Particles is an integral part of motion.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.460
They're actually built into the
motion engine so they're integrated

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.090
with the whole application.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.100
They're not just an add-on.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.440
What that means is it's a
sprite-based implementation so you

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.100
actually have things like movies,
graphics files, text,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.100
anything can be turned into a particle.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.100
It's actually a really dynamic system.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.140
We also include presets for smoke
and sparkles and things like that.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.780
Unlimited layering, and of course in any
graphics application,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.590
anyone who's ever opened a Photoshop file
lately from their graphics house

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.300
has seen 99 layers of things
layered over the top of one another.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.690
And of course we support that.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.660
We also support nested layers,
which is incredibly important these days

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.990
because blend modes can get very complex,
and you can have logos that

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.100
are made up of 10 layers,
and that gets incorporated with a piece

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.270
of footage or something like that.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.550
All of those elements can
be independently animated,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.500
but in the smallest context we have
a layer list that affords you to

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.710
reposition those in the visual queue.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.610
Templates are,
we actually ship with templates,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.100
we ship with a number of professionally
designed templates for motion.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.250
And what templates are,
as you can see in the

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.550
animation that's playing here,
is just a basic structure that

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.850
has a piece of footage that you
can import your own and replace.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.980
It replaced the text, obviously,
that you see coming in here.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.130
You can even save and create and
save your own templates for use if

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.290
you're working on some corporate
project that you need to do.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.600
So let's go over the system requirements.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.960
They're admittedly fairly extensible,
so what this grid here

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.630
shows is what the system,
what is actually used by

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.740
different parts of the system,
what is done in the different

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.600
parts of the system.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.600
So the CPU actually handles our text
rendering and handles our behaviors.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.030
The graphics processor, the GPU, OpenGL,
handles filters and compositing

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.600
and particle effects.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.100
And the RAM, of course,
is used for faster and

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.540
better video playback.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.350
So the more RAM you have,
the more layers of video

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.500
you can have streaming live.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.890
So with that in mind,
the PowerMax system requirements,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.950
the minimum requirements,
1.6 GHz PowerPCG 5, best, you know,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.590
faster the better.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.890
Dual 2.5 with the 9800
Pro XT and 256 MB of RAM just

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.600
is like sailing on smooth ice.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600
It's amazing.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.640
The minimum system
requirements for PowerBook,

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.600
which we just talked about,
is the same as the PowerBook,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:34.600
but it's a little bit different.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.600
So the GPU, which you can run on,
are 1.33 GHz PowerPCG 4.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.540
Most of this is because
of the graphics card.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.750
The graphics card, the FXGO 5200,
will run the effects and the compositing,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.600
the pixel shaders that
we actually use in GPU.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.210
The recommended system, of course,
is the 1.5 GHz because you need

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.420
the GPU for the processing of those
particles with 128 MB of video RAM.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.120
We even run on a G4.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.080
The silver door is a cut off,
and the reason for that is it has a

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.700
fast enough AGP bus that allows you
to use the video cards that are shown.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.960
And before that,
the AGP bus wasn't fast enough

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.700
and those cards weren't supported.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.700
So, Motion will be available this summer
at the landmark price of $299.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.690
So, without any further ado,
let's move over to machine number

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.690
three and dive into our demos.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.470
So, some of you might have seen
this before on the web,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.420
so I'm going to... Who all has seen this?

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.930
The KAPL on the website?

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.500
Has anyone seen KAPL?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.500
So, this will be new to some people,
good.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.490
I'm going to go through that.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.340
I'm going to start...
As I mentioned earlier,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.500
user interface sort of
flows from left to right.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.590
We have a file browser, library,
and inspector,

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.490
which allows you to see properties,
behaviors, filters, and objects.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.500
In the file browser,
it's really like the finder.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:02.360
So, you can see over here is my hard
drive and desktop and the user folder.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.500
So,
I'm actually looking at my finder here.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.460
I'm going to start by
dragging in the background,

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.620
the Golden Gate Standard Definition
movie,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.380
and hit play.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.500
It instantly starts playing.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.620
Now, while this is playing,
I'm going to scale it up

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.500
to my full resolution here.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.500
We can, of course, resize it,
zoom around it,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.470
and adjust it in real time while it's
playing and do wacky things to it.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:33.530
We can even go in and take the
four-corner pinning so we can actually

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.570
do distortions in real time as well.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:11:02.600
[Transcript missing]

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.800
Get this guy going here.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.830
I'm going to change the shape
to be filled with a gradient,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.970
and set my points for that gradient here.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.700
There we go, something more like that.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.580
I'm going to scale this guy up to fill.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:12:12.600
[Transcript missing]

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.560
Then of course it starts going
around like crazy on my screen,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.890
which is not what I wanted to do.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:25.340
So what I'll do is I'll bring in
a predefined Channel 8 animation.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:38.700
The animation is still sitting there,
by the way.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.760
It's just been disabled so we
don't actually have to look at it.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.400
I can still position it live on the fly.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.600
Very cool feature for anyone who's
done massive amounts of keyframing

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.480
and just wants to turn off the
transparency channels so they can

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.400
see what they're doing at frame one.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.400
So in this case,
we've got this going here.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.400
Well, we can add text.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.400
Let's add some text to this.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.340
Go back to my inspector for this object.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.860
Hang on a second,
I've gotten to a bit of a state.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.400
Open my layers list and
actually do this properly.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.910
Make a new layer for my text.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.220
I'm going to hide my layers list again.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.320
Go over here and type in KAPL8.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.250
It's ready to go.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.500
This is still annoying me.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.440
Turn off the disable animation.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.500
There we go.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.670
How about just reset parameters?

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.670
There we go.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.130
So now that's ready to go.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.400
And unfortunately,
I appear to have found a bug.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.210
Anyone want to file a radar for me?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:40.800
There we go.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.630
OK, so I got my object sitting here.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.440
So let's bring up the dashboard.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.070
And in the dashboard we
have controls for our text.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.190
Again, semi-transparent,
you can see all our objects through it.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.400
It's all good and fine.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.400
But how do we know which
text we want to have?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.010
Well, we can pick the font
through this dynamic pop-up.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.190
Feel free to gasp at any moment.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.990
There we go.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.700
So I'm going to go back here
and pick Helvetica Noya.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.360
Check the regular.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.600
I'm going to actually use the bold font.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.630
Yeah, we want it bold.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.940
Change the size there.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.520
We can, of course, change size, tracking,
spacing amounts, things like that.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.760
So that's ready to go.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.620
I'm going to add a simple behavior
called fade in and fade out.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.740
Closed that a little too early.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.870
Now you'll notice we have frames
in and frames out that are

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.260
immediately visible for our object.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.640
Um, down here, again I was saying it
was contact sensitive,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.450
you can actually sort through the
stack of behaviors and filters that are

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.500
applied to each object in this fashion.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.500
So, um, I've got a 35 frame in,
a 0 frame out,

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.010
I'm going to add a behavior called throw,
so I can throw this to the right hand

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.500
side just by clicking and dragging.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.430
Um, you can zoom out,
get really crazy with it.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.490
Um, zoom back out here, that looks good,
it's moving about right.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.390
So, I'm going to option
click and drag this guy,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.480
and I've got two copies here.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.510
Um, bring up file browser again,
inadvertently close that.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.700
Set that to be right justified there.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.700
So I've got KPL8.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.840
Well,
I want to change this text on the fly,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.490
so I'm going to type in San Francisco.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.220
Right about now there's a joke
about 120 words per minute,

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.780
but that's someone else's.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.820
So I'll take that size
down a little bit here,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:35.490
change that to say the light font,
navigate back to my throw behavior,

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.280
and take this on over to this side.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.770
Now it's throwing in
the opposite direction.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.000
They can even move that and get it right
position there at any frame as I go.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.370
That back down a bit,
because I want it to

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.220
start right about there.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.870
Okay,
so now I've got two different behaviors.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.870
They both have the same set
of behaviors on top of it.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.740
I want to bring in one,
show one more text behavior,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.320
which is a text behavior specific
to text that lets you animate text,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.180
how it's drawn on and things like that.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.340
So I'm going to type in evening news.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.000
Again,
dismissed that a little too quickly.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.300
So change this to Helvetica.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.730
I'm going to select this and
change it to Bold Italic.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.730
Enter that.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.330
So a text behavior,
we can add behaviors in two ways.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.860
We can either add them through
this pull down here in the toolbar,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.800
where it says text behaviors.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.960
Or we can add them to the library,
which is over here,

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.690
and go to the behaviors tab,
and go to text animation.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.440
And whoops, text sequence, sorry.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.860
Text zoom at our behind camera.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.140
Simply drag and drop it onto our object.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.040
Now you notice when I did that,
that there's a little

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.100
purple bar down here.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.530
This purple bar is showing me
the duration of that behavior,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.700
so if I simply make
that behavior shorter,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.800
it's a lot zippier.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.840
If I bring up my dashboard,
I can change the spread of the effects

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.800
so I can sort of smooth out how those
characters get landed onto the canvas.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.010
So that being said,
let's import our news anchors,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.280
because what is a newscast
without news anchors?

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.790
I would say it's a news feed.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.790
Anchors SD project, oops, sorry.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.800
Anchors SD, I'll bring this over here.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.300
This is actually a Photoshop file.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.120
You'll notice when I hover for a second,
it lets me pick which

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.180
layers I want to import.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.450
I can import them merged,
so it's a single layer,

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.790
or I can import all layers.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.190
In this case, I'll select all layers.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.290
We'll see why in a minute.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.800
I'm going to scale this guy,
these people rather, sorry.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.300
So they're ready to go.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.300
And I want to actually add a fade in
and fade out behavior to these people.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:45.300
So what I'm going to do is open my
layers list and select these three,

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.800
go to my add behavior, and add a fade in,
fade out.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.680
Now you'll notice over my layer
list that I have a fade in,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.800
fade out behavior for each one of these.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.150
It's all ready to go.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.300
So if I bring up my dashboard again,
I can go up here, take the out behavior,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.800
take the out behavior, these three.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.800
Now it's all ready to go.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.800
I could have actually created
it once and duplicated it.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.800
We'll get into that a little
bit later as I go around.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.520
If I bring up my,
I don't want them all to

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.440
come in at the same time,
so I can actually go down here

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.740
in my timeline and drag the,
select Natalie here, and let's put

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.800
Natalie starting about here.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.800
Let's have Gregory coming in second,
and Chandra, she'll come in third.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.800
And I'm going to bump
her up a little bit here.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.800
So right now we have these three anchors.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:33.800
They're just the same.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.800
They're just sitting there.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.790
All they do is fade in and fade out.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.210
I'm going to add a little bit
more dynamic to the piece because

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.800
this is motion graphics after all.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.720
So let's go and add a simulation
behavior of drift attractor.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.630
And what drift attractor does,
I'll close these up so we

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.770
don't have to look at those.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.720
Drift attractor is a simulation behavior
that allows us to attract objects

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.640
to the thing that it's applied to.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.300
So if I turn up the strength,
she's really attractive,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.800
and everywhere she goes,
people like to go to her.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.800
And so I'll put her here.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:07.800
That's a little--if we wanted to,
we could actually go and sometimes,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.800
depending on who you're working with,
you don't always like those people.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.800
She might actually be
repulsive to some people.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.230
So we could go and add a
simulation for repel from--repel,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.790
rather, and everyone, whoa.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.680
That's a pretty strong behavior there,
a very strong reaction.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.180
So as you can see,
Monty Python would have loved to

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.740
have had this back in the day.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.640
But that's a really basic
way to add-- interest to your

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.800
projects is to add these things.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.800
One last little bit here.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.790
I've saved a particle system,
which you can see over here,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800
which isn't playing,
so I'm not going to import it.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.570
But we'll get into particle systems
a little bit later and how those

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.800
get integrated with your project.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.800
So let's start--whoops.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.680
Don't actually minimize it.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:58.480
Another great feature of the
OS is the fact that you can

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:04.390
I actually do that while it's--
do expose while it's playing back.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.320
So let's start with
the basic file browser.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.820
And I'm going to go-- this is
not the app you're looking for.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:15.760
Going to go back to Motion here
and zoom into our file browser.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.880
When Motion launches,
as we've been so gracefully

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:22.580
blessed by the demo gods,
we're going to start,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.940
we can have different options.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.080
We can view the quick tours
which are available on the web.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.440
There's several available now.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.740
There's going to be a bunch
more in a short period of time

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.080
because they're already done and
just waiting to be published.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.010
You can begin with a new tutorial,
so we have tutorial things

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.090
that ship with the application.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.100
You can start with a template
which opens a template browser.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.010
You can pick the browser
template from there.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.690
Or start with a new project,
which is of course what

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.890
we want to do by default.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.100
So, we'll start with this and I'll
briefly show you what's actually

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.090
in store in the file browser.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.010
So, the file browser again shows you all
the different formats that you have.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.050
Here we have a PSD file.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.100
Here we have a movie file.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.060
And you'll notice that it instantly
starts playing as we click on it.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.100
I have an emitter here,
which is spitting things around.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.000
I can grab the emitter and drag it around
and you see it's spitting files out.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.800
Filters can be stored there.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100
It's a filter icon.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.660
You can even have a whole
stack of behaviors that can be

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:24.070
saved off as one behavior icon,
which is an incredibly flexible tool for

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.770
when you're trying to reuse elements.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.900
I'll go into that later as well.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.100
PSD files, transformations can
also be saved as well.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.100
It's a really great tool.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:41.090
So, I'm going to start by bringing in the

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.350
I'm going to show you an
Adobe Illustrator file here,

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.400
which is this logo.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:49.620
And this logo is,
it's actually an Adobe Illustrator file.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.510
Adobe Illustrator's format,
native format, lets you save as a PDF.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.600
And we import PDF files as
one of the supported formats.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:58.600
So if I go over to my, uh,

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:03.510
Oops, if I go to my transformation tab,
you'll see here that when I imported it,

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:08.740
I imported it with Rasterize
on the fly turned off,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.140
which is a feature that we support.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.850
So what I want to do is go
back to my media tab here.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.620
There we go.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.250
Go back to my media tab, select that.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.160
Over here in my inspector
under the media,

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.490
we can say turn off fixed resolution,
and now this is rendering on the fly,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.540
so that it will render at
the frame rate of your comp,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:37.180
so you can even, you know,
in real time animate this,

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.190
and just to drive the point home,
we'll...

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.930
Sorry about that.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.980
So as you can see, we've got crisp,
clean, sharp edges anywhere on

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.890
this brush-stroked PDF file
that we've imported.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:23:00.520
So I'm going to delete that
and let's go to show-- oops.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.430
That same principle applies, of course,
to how we interpret footage.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:10.290
So if I bring in my race car here,

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.960
Let this play, turn that off.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.080
So right now my race car is selected.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.220
You've seen the mini timeline
down here that it ran out of road,

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.790
essentially.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.480
So the race car is there,
but it's obviously not at that same

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.730
point in time where the playhead is.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.340
It wraps around, it's playing back again.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.130
Close the dashboard for a minute here.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.640
So if I go into my media tab,
I can adjust that so I can change

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.800
how it's interpreted over time.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.020
The media tab, of course,
allows us to change things

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.040
like the alpha type,
whether we invert the alpha,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.320
pre-multiplied channels
and things like that.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.030
But the pixel aspect
ratio is field dominance,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.790
lower, upper, things of that nature,
frame rate.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.290
And the end condition
says whether we loop,

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.520
ping pong, or hold.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.060
So we loop, it just keeps repeating,
starting at frame one,

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.930
ping pong goes back and forth.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.640
We can even set it to reverse.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.940
So I've set this to ping pong,
and all that's left to do

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.960
now is to extend that out
through the duration there.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:14.150
Now you'll see it'll play
forwards and backwards as it goes.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:20.140
I'm going to bring over our logo so
we can show how composite modes work.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.980
So I'll say choose to import all layers.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.920
You see my layer list that
I have two different layers here.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.760
Well, the Channel 8 logo,
the actual color part

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.730
was set to hard light,
so I can set that to overlay.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.980
These of course were set in Photoshop,
they weren't set in the application.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.890
It just reads the transfer
modes and brings them in.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.630
I'll change this to add,
and now I've got this logo

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.270
that maybe looks a bit better
in these lighting conditions.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.160
And even, you know,
of course support transformation for

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.780
these independent layers as you go,
so I can move these guys around,

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.240
I can move them around as a group.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.390
But if I've done something
drastically wrong,

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.900
or I've done something I liked, and say,
well, I've got this thing going,

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.200
it's ready to go,
but this needs the exact

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.550
same transformation matrix,
I can go and select my position,

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.460
rotation, and scale values,
and I can actually drag

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.800
those over the other object,
and it instantly snaps and says, oh yeah,

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.770
let's just use those.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.900
So you can actually take
an entire animation.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.900
Thank you.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.920
It's a really incredible,
important feature that I'll be

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.030
showing off a couple places.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.960
We don't even really talk about that.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.900
It's people like you that
probably appreciate it,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.770
so that's why we show it here.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.000
And of course,
all of this can be saved off

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.550
back to the file browser.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.800
So, I've got my file browser here.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:42.790
I want to bring this,
I'm going to name this "Trash Me".

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.860
"Thrash me" in this case.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.510
Bring that over here and you'll notice
instantly I have this pop-up that says,

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.460
"By the way,
you're going to put it over here now.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.810
Thrash me." Now,
what's really cool about this,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.450
that's a little non-obvious,
is when I click on that,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.200
it does start playing
back in my preview window.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.400
So it knows that even though it's
this composite of these things,

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.780
it's not rendered,
it's a .motn file that's sitting

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.200
on my hard drive right now.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.200
It's previewing in this window,
which is a very important feature,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.200
which is how we preview
particles and things like that.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.200
So, letting that play for a second.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.200
I'm actually going to quit here.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.110
I'm getting a little sluggish.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.900
So next we're going to
cover some compositing,

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.930
how transfer modes work with compositing.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:37.600
So to do that, I'm going to start by
showing off the layers,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.050
showing the layer list here.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:44.890
And I'm going to add a simple square
and bring up my parameters for that.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.730
In the shape,
you'll notice my tab immediately

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.060
changed to this active object here,
and my dashboard also changed

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.840
to the currently active object.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.290
So I'm going to go and right
click on the fill color,

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.160
and I'm going to change this to red.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.480
And if I want,
for those of you who don't like

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.950
picking a color from a gradient,
you can go there and

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.460
change your exact values.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.970
So I'm going to option click
and drag to duplicate this,

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:12.370
scale it up a bit here,
because that's not the right size.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.900
Scale this up a bit,
this one will be set to green,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.040
and this one will be set to blue.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:21.540
Right here.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.670
So now I want to add a
bit of motion to these,

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.490
so I'm going to have,
put a sort of a dummy layer

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.130
here that's just going to be,
I'm just going to call it null.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.200
And it will serve as the pivot
point for a orbit behavior,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.500
which is a simulation.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.100
So I turn on orbit around,
and it's notice over here the

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.430
behavior tab instantly comes
up and it says object none.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.430
Well all I have to do is
click and drag over the layer,

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.590
and you'll see this little pop up,
the context changes to this arrow.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.450
I can drag it to the image well as well.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.240
So drag it in there,
and it's ready to go.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.190
It instantly starts animating
around that null object.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.270
So if I select all three rectangles,
change the blend mode to add,

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.740
now you'll see we've got the white,
you know,

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.600
so they're all actually additive there.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:19.500
So next, sorry I need a drink.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.260
Drink music.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:30.320
So, while those are running around,
we can go in and add a...

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.950
I'm going to go back in and I want
to add in my composite project here,

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.720
I'm going to add these
four clips of video.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.990
And I'm going to drag these
into their own private layer.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.440
Not the song by the B-52s.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.130
Set the out point here.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.440
Yes, we get to listen to all those.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:04.990
Set the out point right about--
just for demonstration mode.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.120
So now these will be playing
back shortly in real time.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.130
So what happens is, as you noticed,
we have a little bit of a sluggish

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:16.900
hold as we're loading four clips
of video into RAM simultaneously.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.060
But now, as our frames per second
indicator is showing,

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.100
we're playing back at 30 frames per
second once it's already loaded.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.270
So I'm going to drag these files around.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.840
I'm going to put these guys here,
and I'm going to set

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:29.940
another orbit around.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.820
I'm actually going to just
option drag this onto this layer,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.470
and that layer immediately knows
that it's supposed to reference

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.100
the exact same object that
it's supposed to orbit around.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.760
So now I can go and select different
transfer modes for each of these.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.520
In this case I'll select--oops.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.160
Set this one to multiply.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.560
Set this one to, oh, I don't know, add.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.950
And set this one to overlay.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.700
So we've got eight objects
instantly moving around.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.870
Now, since these are orbiting,
we're actually updating the

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.380
simulation in real time.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.060
So if I go and I grab
one of these objects,

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.830
I'll just pick something at random here,
you'll notice that it's

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:13.990
drawing the motion path.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:20.020
You see the faint red line
that's being drawn around there.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.020
And I can try and grab
it while it's moving and

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.140
"I'm going to move it around in real
time just to show you that it's not

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:29.250
actually cached in some sort of hardware
render that's completely isolated."

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.400
So, with that in mind,
in case I hadn't mentioned,

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.810
this is still beta software,
so I do have to treat it with

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.900
kid gloves every now and then,
restarting and talking nicely to it.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.890
I'll start with a new project here again.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.810
Let's talk about filters.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.580
So filters, again,
as I mentioned earlier in our intro,

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.160
filters are GPU accelerated.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:05.430
So I'm going to bring in
a golden wheat image here,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.360
which is out point of
which is right about there.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.200
Yeah, that looks good.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.260
Actually, let's delete that.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.760
Let's bring in our marionettes.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.470
Sorry, Barry.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.850
They have our marionettes
dancing happily about here.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.460
And this was taken
somewhere in San Francisco.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.160
I don't know.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.870
But we can go and simply start
adding some filters to this.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.380
So let's add a Gaussian Blur.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:35.800
And you'll notice that we've
got a kernel size of 64.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.360
And it's, I think,
slowed down to about 20 frames a second.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.840
So pretty decent kernel
size for Gaussian Blur.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.030
Now let's delete that.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.760
Let's add the Colorize filter.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:32:03.220
Color eyes: Color eyes allows you
to tint your footage.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.230
You can choose to use
the Apple Color Picker,

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240
or the handy-dandy
Grab Something from the Gradient.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:03.490
You can even set the
intensity of the color.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.800
I'm on that.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.740
Let's delete that.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.710
Let's go and add a light raise.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:24.500
[Transcript missing]

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.300
Not too bad though for
LightRays I have to say.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.290
And you can even do
things like add a filter,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.140
a distortion, a black hole.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.980
Okay, cool, huh, first one.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.000
Obvious as that.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.540
Move that point around in real time.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.900
Zoom in a bit here so we can see this.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.570
So,
behaviors work in several different ways.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.600
I'm sort of bouncing in and
out of what a behavior is,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.140
and which behaviors work
in different circumstances.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.900
In this case, I want to go to my
inspector and my filter tab,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.350
and that center point, as you'll notice,
is updating over here in my

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.160
inspector tab as I drag it around.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.400
So, I can actually go and apply what's
called the parameter behavior,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.300
and apply a randomize to that,
and now it just gets kind of crazy.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.040
And if I want to see
that move around a lot,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.080
I can change it to, oops,
change the amount that it is to .5,

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.700
set it to add and subtract,
so that it adds and

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.030
subtracts the position,
maybe take the frequency down because

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:24.700
I don't want to have a seizure,
and take the noisiness down to like,

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:28.820
I don't know, .3, something like that.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:34.710
So, this is actually... *whispers*

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.280
Yeah, moving about 22 frames a second,
something like that.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.180
Not too shabby.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.880
So, oops,
let's go back to our layers tab here.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.940
Delete that guy.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.040
So let's add another one here.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.400
Let's add a line screen
under the stylized filter.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.380
So, go down here.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.700
Not line art, we've seen enough of that.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.080
Filter.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.500
It's ready to go.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.410
Speaking of seizures.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.720
You can change your angle on the fly,
change the scale of these guys, contrast,

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.860
stretch and skew it, things like that.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.330
And I want to actually go back and
add a distortion so I can drive

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.340
the point home that you can stack
your filters in a layer order

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.330
that actually makes a difference.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.940
In this case,
I have the twirl above the line art,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.390
which has a very different
effect than if I put the twirl

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.430
underneath the line screen.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:41.240
So I'm either twirling the
line screen and distorting it,

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.520
or adding a line screen over that.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.840
So of course we give you complete
dynamic control for this,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.820
and how you can order your projects
so that you get the effect you want.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.810
And it's non-destructive,
so you can go back into a project

00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:01.460
and reopen it later and adjust
all your filters and things.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:08.380
So, let's cover behaviors
a little more in depth.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.180
I'm going to go through and add a
series of behaviors to a single object,

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.590
just to show you how we can
stack these behaviors and they

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.430
interact with one another.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.280
Go back here.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.750
I'm going to start by just
using a simple rectangle.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.040
And I've got this rectangle here,
dashboard updates, go and add a fade in,

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.350
fade out behavior.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.040
So as I hit play, it's fading in,
fade out.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:35.030
We've seen that before, nothing new.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.430
Let's go back to our throw behavior,
let's throw it in a direction.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.390
You point and drag,
you notice there's the red

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.760
line that shows you which
direction it's going to go.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.750
A cool thing about throw behaviors,
you can actually duplicate them

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.130
and run two on the same object.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.970
Back here in my timeline,
you see I've trimmed it

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.300
actually in the mini timeline,
but here it is in the main timeline.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.650
So if I select that,
and I option drag it, now I've got two,

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.370
and I can actually have it
go in a different direction.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:03.320
You notice now it shows two
different vectors that the object

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.220
would be thrown as it goes.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.830
So I'll collapse that back up.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:13.580
Let's add a spin behavior to this.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.580
I just simply click and drag,
start spinning.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:19.590
That's good.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:23.100
Let's go and add a grow shrink behavior.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.120
Grow shrink,
you can either choose to grow it

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.970
over time or shrink it over time.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.920
And that's pretty cool.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.750
So let's actually do something a little
bit more interesting and maybe add

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.660
an edge collision to this project.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.690
Let's close this.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:43.400
Down here, leave this in view.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:47.290
And under simulations we
have an edge collision.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.240
Edge collision interacts with
the edges of your screen.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.700
It doesn't actually have alpha collision,
which is just not available yet.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.320
So right now,
you can see as it's growing,

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.610
it's running into an edge.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.040
And notice my path has changed.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.960
It runs into an edge and
actually pushes it around.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.650
I've actually made trap squares
that can't get out of your project.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.140
It's kind of crazy.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.330
But if I go back to my throw
and just really whack this out,

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.670
you'll see it.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.940
You'll see the beach ball.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.490
Let's see if it recovers from that.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:27.030
All right.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.130
This is motion quitting.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.800
So the point I'm trying to
make here though is that you

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.200
can stack these behaviors.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.200
They can interact with one another.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.200
They can interact with the project
as a whole or things on layers.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.730
And we can actually apply them in
several different ways that makes

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.190
it a little bit more interesting.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.120
So let's start with that.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.020
Anyone remember the game
Super Breakout back in the day?

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.200
Okay, I'm not the only old one here.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:01.200
It's good to know.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.240
So I'm going to start with this is
motion because it's my favorite phrase

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.200
I like to type over and over again.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.200
And paste, whoops, paste, paste, paste,
paste.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200
Okay, great.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.180
We got a Super Breakout block.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.890
So of course we need our
protagonist which is the

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:19.200
Super Breakout block ready to go.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:19.900
Turn off that.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.200
Go to the head of my project.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.200
I'm going to zoom out just a little
bit here and turn off the dashboard

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.130
because it's in the way at the moment.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.200
Go up here, get it ready to go.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.200
If I turn on record and
just wiggle this object,

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.780
it's recording the parameters for the
position right now because it's the

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.120
only thing I touched in the project.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.200
Auto record lets you record any parameter
that you move at any given time.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.590
So you don't have to think, well,
did I set a key frame at the beginning

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.200
of the project or anything like that.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.190
It just knows, oh,
you want me to record that animation.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.200
It's ready to go.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:54.200
So I've got my position up here and I'm
going to go a little bit forward in time.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.200
Drag this down here a little bit forward
in time and just make a general sort of,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:04.050
whoops, make a general sort of,
if I was Super Breakout,

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.100
where would I be going?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.440
Move up here.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.450
And down to here.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.520
Set my out point.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.520
So now I've got this object moving along.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.540
It kind of waits over there for a second,
thinking about things.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.640
It zips around, comes over here.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.660
It's ready to go.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.350
So I don't actually want to see my
Super Breakout character right now.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.080
I'm going to select my
This Is Motion Super Breakout block,

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.780
and go and add a simulation
called Repel From.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.340
I'm going to write down here.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.420
So when I do that,
I go back to my inspector and the

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.330
behavior is instantly available.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.080
Affect objects means that
it's going to affect all the

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.800
objects that it's attached to.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.930
It's set to none right now,
it doesn't know what it's looking for.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.330
The super breakout block is
still of course moving around the

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.240
object that I just turned off.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:01.000
I'm going to set my strength to
1000 because I'm feeling crazy.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.990
I'm going to take my influence and
that's the influence is the region

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.400
of how repulsive am I for how long,
how far do I stink.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.040
And then that's all
set up and ready to go,

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.240
but it doesn't have anything to repel
from until I drag that down there.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.290
And then it goes down and it
continues to break those things out.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:22.140
So if I had to keyframe this thing,
call me in a week.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:26.380
I mean it really is amazing
to see that it's that simple

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.840
to do something like that.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.990
If I want to, driving the car,
I'm going to point home again,

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:38.110
go back to our behaviors and drag
in our friend the striped ball.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.540
If I want to use the striped
ball instead of our protagonist,

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.260
the rectangle,
because he's been replaced by

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:46.050
the next generation of the game,
I could go in and bring

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.420
that ball in and I say,
well I've already got

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.830
my rectangle animated,
but the ball now needs the same

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.090
animation because we're just
swapping the character here.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.080
So I go to my inspector tab and I grab
the position and I drag it onto the

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.370
ball and the ball is instantly the thing
that's now pushing things out of the way.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.830
So, it's actually still referencing
the previous rectangle,

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.370
but we just won't tell our users.

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.810
Oh, I mean our customers of the game.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.740
So that's super break out,
but let's do something a

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.770
little bit more obvious,
like I've got to do a title animation

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.290
for a kids book that's being made
into a show and it's a little

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.170
animated feature and it's called,
"Who's Afraid of the Dark?" It's about a

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.640
little ghost who's playful and it helps
this girl get over her fear of the dark.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:30.890
And so I'm going to start this
new project and do a little title

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:35.410
animation here without harming
any keyframes in the process.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:41.760
So start out here and I'm going to
bring the ball back into the project.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.730
So the ball's ready to go.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.640
I'm going to make a ghost.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.490
This is going to be my ghost object here.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.080
Don't really care because
you can't see a ghost.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.410
It's just going to be a square.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:55.360
So I've got the square here and
I want the ball to be attracted to the

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.980
square as if the square is magically
dragging it around the canvas.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.400
So I've got my square ready to go.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.800
I've got my ball and I'm going to add a
simulation behavior called Attracted To.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.360
So when I hit play, nothing happens.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.840
The reason nothing happens is because
it doesn't know what it's attracted

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.430
to because it has a problem with that.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.410
So I drag that and as you can see--

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.800
As I drag this object around,
what's actually happening is

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.120
the alignment guides are on,
which is why you're seeing

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.620
the yellow bouncing around,
but I just turned that off.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.570
The reason the ball has this
jumpy behavior is actually

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.210
something that's really cool,
and it's really non-obvious.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.020
For those of you who are programming,
it's actually calculating from

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.350
the beginning of the point in time
to that current point in time,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.780
what the simulation is on the fly,
that fast.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.400
So it's not that impressive right
here because it's a single ball,

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:44.840
right?

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.420
But it's actually
recaching the simulation.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.370
It's even more impressive
to see it run on particles

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.480
because it does it pretty fast.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.200
Obviously, the longer it has to cache,
the longer it has to figure

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.750
out all those points.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:57.980
So I'm going to go in here.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.750
I don't want to actually
harm any keyframes in the

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:04.500
process of making my project,
so I'm going to go to my project tab,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.360
and I'm going to apply
a randomized behavior.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.000
You'll notice that parameter behaviors,
which is what these are,

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.910
right click on these objects,
you have things like oscillate, ramp,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.620
and things like that.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.180
But I'll just use a randomize.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.910
And you'll notice that
instantly it goes into a frenzy.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.360
I can make that frenzy even
greater by changing this to add

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.600
and subtract and ramping that up.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.570
And now my ghost is
going all over the ball,

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.160
and the ball is kind of sluggish.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.580
It doesn't quite know where to go.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.780
So let's do something about
that because it's not quite

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.010
as impressive as I wanted yet.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.920
So I'll go back here,
change the frequency down to 1.0

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.570
and change this to about 0.35,
which gives a little bit

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:43.690
more of a sane thing.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.490
And the reason this is important,
the reason procedural animation

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.500
is important in this case,
is that I need a random path that

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.520
this thing is supposed to go around
because I want this ball to look like

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.490
it's being played with and toyed with.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.740
Well, if I had to keyframe an object
for it to do all that with,

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.700
it would take me hours.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.700
So I have this randomized
behavior already applied to this.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.960
By clicking the Generate Seed button,
you can see that it instantly

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.890
has a different path.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:22.900
[Transcript missing]

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.600
So with the randomized behavior there,
now I've got a path that I sort of like.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.630
My ball is kind of going off,
drifting off where it wants to.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.450
I don't want it to quite go so far away.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.700
I'm going to change the
attractiveness to 500.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.810
So it's really looking
hard for that object.

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:39.780
And the influence,
I'm going to leave it 1,000.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.370
And change the drag to about 1.3.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.780
So now it keeps up with the
object a little bit more,

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.560
since I have some drag applied to it.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.110
Sorry, I need a drink.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.850
Go full screen.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:02.900
This behavior path, the red path that's
being drawn on the fly,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.590
is really important of course when you're
working with simulations because you need

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.900
to see where the objects are going to go.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.890
So that object is going around.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.850
I want to add an edge
collision to actually keep

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.900
this thing inside the frame.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.610
So now if I turn off my ghost so
we don't have to see him because

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.300
we don't have x-ray vision,
we have this ball bouncing around

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.550
the room and it's trying to get out
of the room and it looks like it's

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:24.900
sort of being thrown around this guy.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.720
Well that's pretty cool.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:31.050
Well the ball looks good but it doesn't
have much depth yet so I'm going

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.590
to actually duplicate my randomize.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.370
by option dragging it in the layer list,
and you'll notice I have

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:39.850
randomized copy here.

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:42.120
Well, if I delete this,

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.340
I'm going to call it Rand Scale,
so I'm going to actually apply

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.520
this to the scale parameter.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.730
So over here in my behaviors stack,
which is under the behaviors tab,

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.140
I can go and say, well,
instead of being applied to none,

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.460
why don't you actually do something
with your life and get a job,

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.380
and apply it to the all.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.570
Now immediately what happens is
it's bouncing all over the place and

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:05.380
looking all crazy because I don't
have the X and Y values linked.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.820
So I click them and I link them,
and now it's just kind of going to town.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.280
530% is a lot to change the scale,
so I'm going to change it to 80%,

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.700
and I'm going to set it to subtract.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.440
So now it's a little bit more sane.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.820
It sort of looks like it's going
back in space a little bit,

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.590
bouncing around the frame.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.170
I want to give it one more cue,
and I'm going to

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.220
actually add a depth cue,
and I'm going to add

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.250
opacity to the stack.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.990
Rand opacity here and click on that guy.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.990
I'm going to go and apply that property
to the blending of the opacity.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:42.100
Change its value to 80% so
it's subtracting 80% from that.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.500
Of course this is against a black frame.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.050
I could have picked
another way to change it,

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.900
but this is the fastest way to show.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.930
And now as it goes back in the room,
it looks a bit more like it's getting

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.410
darker as it goes back and away from us.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.970
So that's all good and fine.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.900
Let's add one more behavior
to this because we can.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.300
I'm going to say snap
alignment to motion,

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.140
which as you can see here,
what it's doing is it's flipping the

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.950
ball around in the direction that it's
heading as it goes that direction.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:12.680
So now I've got five different
behaviors applied to an object that

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:17.540
are all interacting with one another
and contributing to the look of this

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.950
ball and giving it some character.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.960
So I need to actually stop it at some
point because I have to get text.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:24.980
Sorry about that.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.630
I need to actually get some
text in here and have the--

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.210
the ball needs to calm down,
the ghost needs to just chill for a bit.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:33.160
So what I'm going to do
is apply a stop behavior.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.040
I'm going to go over to two
seconds and apply a stop behavior.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.490
Whoops.

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:46.240
I'm going to apply a stop behavior
to my rectangle's position.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.510
Go into the property
tab and apply a stop.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.810
And so what stop does, it just says,
stop.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.860
Don't do anything.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.920
Just stay wherever you are
and don't do your thing.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.700
It can be applied to any parameter.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.380
It sort of stops the
simulation in this case.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:04.600
So I want to go to the out point
and actually drag this-- excuse me.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.420
Let's go to four seconds.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.240
That's ready to go, hit the out point.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.520
And so now what happens is,
I'll turn this back

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.320
on and zoom out a bit,
you can see, it actually wraps back

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.010
around here to the beginning.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.460
It goes down and it just stops,
it just says, "Huh, wait,

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.850
okay." And the ball still
tries to get to it and it goes,

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:27.250
"Oh, I'm coming back for you." So,
it's a great way to get objects

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:30.330
to stop their simulations.

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:40.060
So next,
let's add some text to our project.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.220
So I'm going to go over here,
actually add a new layer,

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:47.500
because we need a new
layer to control our text.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:52.600
Click over here,
type in the title of our piece.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.190
That's our piece.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.700
I'll go and pick a font.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:07.830
I'm going to pick American typewriter
up here at the top.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:07.830
Come on.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:07.830
There we go.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:13.760
Regular weight, size looks good,
ready to go.

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:15.980
Okay, so I don't want the text
coming on at the beginning,

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.360
so I'm going to go down here
to about the two second point,

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.820
and set the end point
by hitting the I key,

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.440
instantly snaps to that point in time,
it's ready to go,

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.560
but I actually want to bring
it in using a behavior.

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.910
So using a text behavior,
as I showed earlier,

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.580
I'm going to use behind camera because
it's the fastest way to show it.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.860
Change the duration to about there.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.090
So now my text flies in,
looking all groovy, cool.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:44.960
Change the spacing of my behavior.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.360
Change the spread parameter.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.990
There we go.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:50:04.900
[Transcript missing]

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:08.490
Now it's in my stack of behaviors,
it's ready to go.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.630
But it doesn't have any of
the values I need in it.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.630
I'm going to change its strength to 1000.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:18.860
We changed that to 1000,
the fall off rate,

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.100
influence down to about 50.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:27.230
And this is where it's really important
to know what your simulation is

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.500
doing at the end of your frame.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:32.030
So you see right here at
the end of my project,

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.390
there's one letter left standing,
and I don't want that

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.510
letter left standing.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:43.170
So the way to find out how to remedy
that is to go to the end of my project.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:46.820
There we go.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.780
OK, so now I know that at
the end of my object,

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.230
it's going to go all the way and
it's going to get crazy here.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.110
Who's afraid of the irk?

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:55.210
Well, we've got to fix that.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.300
So in order to fix that-- boom,
takes out those last two characters.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:01.280
In order to fix that,
the repel behavior is a point in time.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.680
It's set by default to
the length of your object.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.380
So I actually want to go
grab this guy and say,

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.490
well, where did it mess up?

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.900
For some reason, when it lands there,
those aren't showing up.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:14.570
So maybe if I go and I slide this-- oh,
there they go.

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:15.540
They pop back on.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.710
So now those are ready to go.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.640
Now it goes and it takes
out all the characters.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.180
Boom, takes those last two out, good.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.340
So, I want to keep them in frame.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.990
I'm going to apply a
simulation edge collision.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.290
Now they're just going
to bounce off the edges.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.340
Let's add a... Yeah, that's looking good.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:41.960
We can actually go and add a drag if we
don't want to see them go quite so far,

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:47.660
so I'll add a simulation drag behavior,
and change this down to about,

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.800
I don't know, value of .7.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:59.380
And I can even tell that text so that
the simulation aligned the motion so that

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:04.080
as they're bounced around the canvas,
you'll see here that they actually go

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:13.120
to the direction that they're headed as
they bounce off the walls and things.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.880
So a great way to do a title animation,
not a single keyframe.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.260
Thank you for that.

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.410
All right.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.110
Moving on.

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:32.700
So let's talk about text
sequence behaviors a bit.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:53:03.300
[Transcript missing]

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.280
A little bit of a longer phrase
so you can see what we're doing.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.340
Our dashboard.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.590
So we have a number of different
types of text behaviors.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.940
Basic sequences in from left,
text animation, scrolling up,

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.840
scrolling down, text tracking,
where it just tracks over time,

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.910
change the rate of how that's applied.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.650
Go and add some text glow behaviors,
beam out.

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.840
It's kind of fun.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.520
Wait till it gets to the beginning there.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.690
There we go.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.120
So those down a bit with blurs.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:43.950
You can add a number of
these types of things.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:47.140
I added the behind camera,
but there's a number of ways.

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.740
You can actually build these on your own,
actually.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.600
I'm going to show you how to build one
rather than just talking about them all.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.450
So I'm going to go to text animation and
add a sequence behavior to this object.

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.270
So now by default, again,
the sequence behavior is

00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:59.600
the duration of my object.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.100
And since we don't want to sit around
for 10 seconds waiting for that to draw,

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.620
let's go ahead and shorten the
duration of our behavior and

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.600
set our out points so we can see
this loop back around as we go.

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:12.150
If I go to my behaviors tab
over here in the inspector,

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.530
you'll see that the sequence
behavior doesn't have anything in it.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.470
It allows you to add any
parameter that's available for

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.600
your text under the outlines,
opacities, the glows, the drop shadows.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.600
Any of those can be
animated in a sequence.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.590
So I'm going to start by adding
the position parameter and

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.600
crank this up to a value of 200.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.590
So right now we have the -- our
sequence is moving through the object.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:36.540
It's isolated to a narrow region,
which is the character.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.150
If I change that spread,
you can change it so it's

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.600
more of a vibrant thing.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.600
You can even change it so that it
repeats through the duration of that.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.670
You can set it to ping pong
so it goes back and forth.

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:51.560
So I'll leave it here on
ramp and take it back to one.

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:56.660
If I change it to all,
now it's the type of behavior which

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.240
is what we saw in the behind camera,
which is where the object is

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.040
ramped through as it goes.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.570
So I'm going to take
this to a negative 50,

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.780
and I'm going to add another, whoops,
yeah there we go,

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.140
I'm going to add a scale parameter to
this and crank up the scale to 600.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.170
So now it looks all nice and
ugly at the beginning and oh,

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.240
suddenly we can read it.

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:19.960
But let's add maybe the face
opacity so we can see this thing

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.150
go transparent and land like that.

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:25.080
So that's the basic premise
of how this was created,

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.720
the behind camera parameter.

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.180
And as you'll notice,
the sequence behavior is just,

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.380
can be dragged in time.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:34.150
We can set the in and the out
points so it takes even longer to

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:36.670
reveal or even less time to reveal.

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:44.690
We can even add something like,
let's add a face blur,

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:48.700
just so we can see how that pans out.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:52.110
Nice depth of field look
as the text comes in.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:56:00.250
So that is our basic
text sequence behaviors.

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:05.200
Is this clock down here right?

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.700
OK.

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:11.640
It's going to be a short demo.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.150
Let's move on to particles.

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:20.300
So Particles in Motion,
we ship the number of presets that are

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.300
ready to use straight out of the bag,
and those are really easy

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.340
to apply via the library.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:28.070
We go down to our particle emitters,
we click on it,

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:30.430
and we instantly see a playback up here.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.200
We have different categories, abstract,
nature, smoke, and sparkles,

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.770
sparkles being the most
fun of it all because

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.860
There we go.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:45.290
Because of course we all, you know,
like to play in the Magic Kingdom.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:49.210
So, again,
when I drag this in by default,

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.980
it doesn't have any
animation applied to it,

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.280
so it doesn't know where to go.

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:58.420
So if I go to the beginning of my
project and turn on record keys,

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.190
And set it there.

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.540
Now it's going to go from
there to there over my time,

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:07.830
and you can see my particle
system is being drawn on the fly.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:14.080
Let's make a new project here,
and go back to my file browser.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:19.590
Go to my particles folder
and grab some source.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:23.940
So I'm going to grab a,
let's grab the pinch grab,

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.270
and I'll show you how these
are built from the start.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:28.690
It's really easy to make a particle.

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:32.370
You drag in a piece of footage
and you click make particles and

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:34.330
you instantly have particles.

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.850
So,
that's how easy it is to make particles.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:39.900
Of course it gets a lot more
sophisticated than that.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.900
I'll run over those controls for you.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:46.690
In the emitter control,
which there's different

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:48.440
cells that can be applied,
so you can actually have

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:50.540
different types of particles
living under the same emitter.

00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:54.300
The emitter is where you control
what type of emitter you have.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:56.050
You can have a line,
so you can have things

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:59.720
being emitted from a line,
a circle, a fixed circle, geometry,

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.500
sort of a roto shape.

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:05.100
You can have it being emitted
from a line on a Bezier spline.

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:06.940
And also an image.

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:11.810
You can use an image alpha channel
as the source for the emitter.

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.800
So I'm going to go down here.

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.040
You see we have a birth rate that
controls how many particles come out.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:21.490
You have a birth rate range,
so you can have it be sort of erratic.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:24.530
You can take that even to zero,
and now it sort of spits particles

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:25.800
out when it feels like it.

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:27.830
Change the initial number,
change the life.

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.090
The life is the duration of
how long a particle lasts.

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:38.180
Change the life range so that some
particles last longer than others,

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.740
and some don't last very long at all.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.390
There you go.

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:47.110
Things like speed range,
so some particles can

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:48.540
go faster than others.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.200
Particles can go in different directions.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:52.950
It's a really great sort of like star
field thing where you have different

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.580
particles going at different speeds.

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:58.400
A scale range,
which allows you to change the overall,

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.870
you know, some particles are big,
some are small.

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:08.410
Click on generate your random seeds,
so you get a random seed

00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:08.410
variation of all these as you go.

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:12.300
If we want to change our color,
we can change our color

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:15.540
really simply by going using
several different color modes.

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:20.460
If we use an over life mode,
now as the particles get older,

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:22.800
we'll change this to a value of three.

00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:26.290
So you can see that the
particles that are red,

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:30.470
it should actually be inverse for
those of the astronomy buffs among us.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:33.510
Start out as a nice blue
neutron star and go to a red,

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:34.920
you know, whatever.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.520
But anyway,
you can turn on additive blend mode,

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.520
which gives you more of a glowy effect.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.690
If I go and simply add a...

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.510
"Driving that point home,
they go and add a middle knot

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:50.690
here and make that green,
now we have this nice sort of glowing

00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.600
star field sort of thing going on.

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.790
Much more glowy effect.

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.810
Show how these interact with, uh,

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.480
Interact with your simulation behaviors.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.700
I'm going to go here really fast since
we're running out of time and add a,

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.700
under my properties tab, add a randomize.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.310
Go back to behaviors, crank that up.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:33.800
[Transcript missing]

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:38.540
And put the drag at about 0.7.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.980
There we go, that's looking good.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.270
Turn off my rectangle.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.490
It's a little too hyper.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:45.960
There we go.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.750
That's a little bit better.

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.050
Close off my dashboard.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:50.090
Go to that.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:51.300
Go full screen.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.400
And that's about all
the time that we have.
