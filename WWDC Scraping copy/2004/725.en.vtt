WEBVTT

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
I'm, as you said, George Capalbo,
and we're from Backbone Networks,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.820
and we're based out in Boston,
and we make Internet radio

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.780
automation software.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.720
And actually, before we get started,
I want to do a little informal poll.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.870
How many people here,
just give me a quick show of hands,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.880
are actually broadcasting
on the net right now?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.980
That sounds great.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.240
How many people came here because
they want to go and start doing that?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.080
How many people missed their
flight and they're on standby

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.590
at San Francisco National?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.480
No, I'm just kidding.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.100
So, I'm going to do something
a little different.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.920
I know this is the Worldwide
Developer Conference,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.880
but I think whenever new
technology rolls around,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.810
weird things happen,
and Internet radio has been

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.000
no different than that.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.670
And I thought we should take a look at
things in sort of more of a total view.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Let's look at radio itself and
how that evolved over time.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.700
And then also,
rather than just talk about the tech,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.530
and we will talk about some tech,
I want to go into the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.750
business side of it.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.650
Because some of you may or may not have
heard there are royalties associated

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.100
now if you're streaming music.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.040
And it was a very, you know,
in the press,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.310
inflammatory issue a few years ago,
and things have kind of settled out.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.530
And I think a lot of people, you know,
one story or another,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.000
and I want to kind of try to
straighten that out a little bit so

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.600
that you'll feel more comfortable
about getting back into broadcasting.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.250
Because things are
settled out to do that.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.800
So, we're going to,
we will look at all the things

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.040
you need to do to go ahead and
put up an Internet radio station.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.050
And that includes, like I mentioned,
the royalties and the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.540
regulatory environment.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.080
So,
we'll go back and look at some history.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.440
We're going to go back about
100 years and talk about

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.640
radio in a very short time.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.620
We'll go a trip through time in
about maybe three or four minutes,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.350
not too long.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.860
We'll talk about Internet radio and how
that fits in with other types of radio.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.210
We'll, you know,
we'll look at the regulations I've said.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.140
You know, basically, you know,
how are you going to pay for doing

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.300
this if you have to pay royalties?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.900
How do you go about getting some
money in to cover your costs or

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.440
maybe even make a small profit?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.770
And then we'll talk,
this is the plug part.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.090
We'll talk about what we do,
which is automation

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.630
systems for Internet radio.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.220
So, let's see.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.100
How's my clicker doing?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.320
Here.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.930
I don't want to, hopefully I don't blend
in with this laser.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.320
They showed me how to use this once, but,
you know, it's okay.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.460
So, it's interesting.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.180
The Internet radio is very similar.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.480
You can look at it very similar
to the way you do regular radio.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.270
If you're driving in your
car and you switch it on,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.410
you come in and you're in the middle of a
broadcast and you maybe hear some music,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.620
you hear some commercials, a DJ talks,
and there's a transmitter

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.830
somewhere up on a hill that,
you know,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.270
that broadcasts that signal and you
receive it in your car or your home or,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.990
you know,
your FM device connected to you.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.490
to your iPod, right?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.280
And basically,
Internet radio is very similar.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.270
We have a computer sending
the streams out to computers,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.500
and there are now going to be in the
future other devices that are not

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.060
just computers that you'll be able
to listen to it in a portable way.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.480
And we think that that's
when Internet radio is

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.000
really going to explode.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.950
And then it's going to become
less Internet and more just

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.900
another way of broadcasting,
just the way radio is.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.640
So, well,
I would hope one of the reasons you're

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.040
here is you want to find out about
doing radio with OS X and QuickTime.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.010
And as you know, I'm sure if you've
attended other sessions,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.520
that OS X and QuickTime are
all standards-based,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.500
and it's the same for Internet radio.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.730
And we prefer using MPEG-4,
which is the same codec that gets used

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.620
actually for the iTunes Music Store,
because it sounds great,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.290
it plays on a number of devices,
and it'll play on more in the future.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.380
And finally, as we go on,
we're going to talk

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.380
about the Internet radio.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.370
we go along in the technology framework,
we're going to look at

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.800
the radio automation.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.120
And that is a way to simplify
the operation of your station.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.160
Now if you're -- if you're a -- you
look at -- think of a traditional radio

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.450
station where you're spinning desks,
you have to have somebody

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.580
sitting there doing that.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.020
So, you know,
a lot of radio has moved to automation,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.650
and we've decided to build a product
that allows you to do that for the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.260
Internet and very simply with just a
few computers or even one computer.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.100
So let's move on.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.600
So -- so let's talk a
little bit about radio.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.120
So now we'll start going back in time.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.890
And, you know,
you can look at -- there's a

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.140
definition of this that says
it's a way to -- to broadcast

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.270
information by electronic means.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.140
Well, Internet radio would fit
into that definition.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.040
And it's really an old technology.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.220
It's been around for 100 years.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.240
And, you know,
it's all based on through-the-air

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.940
-- radio frequency spectrum.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.040
And basically, originally,
there were -- there was actual data sent,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.580
Morse code, you know, dots and dashes.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.730
Have you watched Titanic, right?

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.430
They were sending their -- their
messages with Morse code on radio,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.680
and that was really just about maybe
10 years after radio existed that they

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.530
had that ability to do that on ships.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.440
And then from the 1920s,
it really blossomed because they

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.480
had the ability to do voice.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.660
And, you know,
things got pretty interesting.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.340
So if you all look at this -- ooh,
this slide changed from

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.180
when I gave it to people.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.160
That's exciting.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.760
You see about 1901,
Italian gentleman named Marconi went off

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.860
and did a first transatlantic signal.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.580
And then you see in the '20s,
he started commercial broadcasting.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.770
And then radio at home, you know,
Amos and Andy and all those old shows,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.560
the Green Hornet, you know,
people would -- during the Depression,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.360
didn't go out much and
radios were inexpensive.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.840
So that really became -- it was
what pretty much television is now,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.900
but obviously television
hadn't existed yet.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.420
If you go back -- you go
further ahead in time,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.990
about the 1960s,
there were other forms of

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.340
media competing with it,
television.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.820
So, you know, radio changed as well,
and you get the better quality of FM.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.920
And then in the 1970s,
we had the first satellite networks.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.440
And I'm not talking about like
XM or Sirius where you listen

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.720
-- you listen from a satellite.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.540
I'm talking about using satellites to
distribute programs around the world,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.570
to affiliate stations.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.680
So imagine if you're listening to a
nationally broadcast baseball game,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.820
that's most likely coming over a
satellite into a radio station.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.960
That all originated back in the '70s.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.340
And then in the 1980s,
there was actually low-speed data that

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.940
was sent along with radio signals.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.600
And there were these proprietary devices.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.340
You get stock quotes and weather.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.740
And, you know,
that kind of pre-sages things you

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.570
can do with internet radio and things
you can do with paging networks,

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.240
et cetera.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.660
That's where all that started.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.970
And then the 1990s,
talk a little bit about

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.520
the business side.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.120
They changed the laws about how many
stations a single owner could have.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.840
So you suddenly had these
huge groups coming out,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.140
like Clear Channel,
Infinity Broadcasting,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.880
where there are hundreds and thousands of
stations that are owned by one company.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.590
And that changed the flavor of radio.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.060
Radio maybe before those days
was very individual to a city.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.780
And now there's a little bit
more of a homogenization.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.610
So it's kind of -- it's, you know,
some people like it.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.560
Some people, you know,
don't understand that it's -- it

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.800
isn't different in every city.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.490
But some people don't like it.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.520
And then, of course,
talk about the later '90s, we start,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.520
you know,
we start talking about convergence.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.330
And when I -- I remember when I would
go to the National Association of

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.660
Broadcasters show,
in the mid '90s, they were all saying,

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.550
"You know, radio is going to get
run over by convergence.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.890
Convergence is really about -- about
video." And funny how radio seems to

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.700
have done pretty well at surviving this
and found its way into other mediums.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.280
And it translated very nicely to it.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.580
So you want to broadcast.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.580
So it's very expensive to
do traditional broadcasts.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.880
Why?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.500
Because it's based on nature
provides radio spectrum.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.920
And there's a limited amount of that.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.600
And there's regulations for, you know,
how stations can be organized in

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.380
a certain city so that otherwise
they interfere with each other.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.280
And that's all done by the U.S.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.640
government,
the Federal Communications Commission.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.340
And they actually came up with
the rules for all this back in,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.060
really, the '20s.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.500
And they did treaties
with other countries.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.390
So if you ever go to Canada,
you see a lot of radio

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.380
stations along the border.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.020
They have to send their signal
way up into Canada so they

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.230
don't interfere with U.S.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.820
stations and vice versa.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.860
So there's a lot of things that
go on that you don't know about,

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.470
you know, with radio.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.480
And you have to have a regulatory body.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.430
And you have to apply for a
license to be able to broadcast.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.950
There's not a cost to it,
but you have to prove that you're

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.480
doing things in the public good.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.480
And there's a lot of
competition for them.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.480
And once a station gets a license,
it's very hard for them to lose it

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.400
unless they've broken a law or whatever.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.450
And that's, you know,
that's limited by spectrum.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.650
So if you want to go buy
or build a station in,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.480
let's say, a market like San Francisco,
you're talking maybe $50, 100 million,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.460
which is, you know, not a small change.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.370
But if you're talking
about a smaller market,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.460
let's say, name a town out in, you know,
the middle of California,

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.460
you're talking maybe millions
for a small AM or FM station.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.860
So now recently, in the last five years,
we have satellite radio.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.080
We talked about the different
kind of satellite distribution.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.830
This is actually,
I'm talking about Sirius and XM and

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.520
how you can listen to that in your car.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.490
Well, unfortunately,
if you want to start one of those,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.360
you need a satellite.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.570
Now there may be some channels available,
but there's a limited

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.420
number of channels on those,
a few hundred at most.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.720
And basically,
that's pretty much taken at the moment,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.120
so that's hard to do.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.890
So there's pirate radio,
and I don't know, you know,

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.450
if you've heard about people
putting ships out at sea off the

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.250
coast of California and New York,
and they broadcast, you know,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.280
out on international waters,
and you can hear the station, and, well,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.880
you know, it's sort of dangerous, and,
well, it's all sort of illegal as well.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.000
We actually, a few years ago at the
broadcaster show in Las Vegas,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.170
there was a group of pirate broadcasters,
and they met in a church,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.670
so they were granted asylum,
so they couldn't be arrested by the FCC.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.500
So, that's, you know, not too much fun.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.060
That might be an exciting
life for some people,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.700
but, you know, if you're a pirate,
you're going to have to do a lot of work.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.810
If you want to start something
and have a business and

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.920
something you can enjoy doing,
you don't want to be on

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.510
the run from the police,
right, or the FCC for that matter.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.430
So, to address that,
the FCC decided to put out

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.630
a regulation that said,
well, you can do low-power

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.760
FM stations in cities,
because that won't interfere

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.840
with other big stations.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.080
Well, of course, the large broadcasters
have blocked all that,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.030
because they say, no,
it's going to interfere with us,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.370
and plus, it's also competition.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.470
So,
that's what you would expect them to do.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.130
So, that's, you know,
there's only a few hundred of

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.680
them that have been on the air,
and there's about, let's see, what is it?

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.240
Say, there are 30,000 inquiries
about doing this.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.990
So, obviously,
there's a demand for radio.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.740
So, finally, we come to internet radio.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.190
So,
instead of using electromagnetic waves,

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.690
we're using the internet.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.820
So, that's another electronic means,
as we talked about earlier, to transmit.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.390
And, well,
it's a lower startup cost to do this.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.820
So, really, you could just get some
computers and some bandwidth.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.160
If you're at a college,
you might already have bandwidth.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.280
You can rent machines, you know,
through ISPs.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.560
There are services that will give
you a... a stream where you can have

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.740
some number of people listening.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.890
And, you know,
it's very easy to go out and

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.410
reach a worldwide audience.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.470
You can pretty much, you know,
hear things all over the

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.440
world without having to,
you know, with radio,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.190
you'd have to wait for the ionosphere
to bounce the signal to you,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:20.680
right?

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.340
Or, you know,
or get something on a satellite.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.400
Well, with this, you can pretty much just
do this from any computer,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.140
and it doesn't cost you,
the person running the station,

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.560
anymore to reach that person
on the other side of the world,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.550
in Australia, we'll say,
then it would be to just be local.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.600
So, it's a pretty wide reach.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.580
So, the other thing now, well,
radio frequency, we talked about,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.680
is a limited spectrum.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.740
Well, there really isn't a
limit to the spectrum.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.700
It's really just if there's
enough IP addresses.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.740
How many IP addresses are there?

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.720
There could be that many stations.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.740
So, it's really a lot more
things that could be done.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.400
And, we talked about it's the
same cost to reach people.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.740
And, one of the cool things about
internet radio is you can enhance it.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.740
You can have text
annotation along with that.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.740
You can have images.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740
You can have it as part of a webpage.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.620
And, you can do things that
people can have feedback.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.740
So, it's... It's... You know,
it's a pretty powerful medium.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.740
And, a lot of people that we work with,
they're trying to reach a very narrowly

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.740
focused audience of just one type of,
you know, of music.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.510
And, you get a lot more in-depth
and interesting things that

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.740
way than you do with just,
you know,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.740
kind of the commercial radio station that
has to appeal to everybody in the town.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.740
So, they do...they choose
a very broad spectrum.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.270
So, and you can also... One of the things
you can get from internet radio that

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.630
you can't get from... How many of
you have ever gotten a ratings book

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.700
where they ask you to fill this out
and say what stations you listen to?

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.740
Right?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:38.740
Okay.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.740
So, that's... What they do is
they do statistical sampling.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.740
So, they get, you know,
100 people in an area.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.740
And then,
they base that...the population on that.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.300
And, they say, "Well,
this is how many people are listening

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.740
to station X." With internet radio,
you can track very precisely

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.740
exactly how many people are
listening to your station.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.740
And, you know, if you want to know where
they're coming from.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.700
So, right now there are
about 12,000 stations,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.330
traditional radio stations in the US.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.490
and it took them about 80
years to get to that point.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:12.820
Excuse me.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.570
And Internet radio, well,
less than 10 years.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.880
The first stations came
on the air about 1994.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.200
We're about 10 years out from that.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.320
And there's about 30,000 worldwide
and the number is growing.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.060
It's a little hard to
find the total number,

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.340
but that seems to be a pretty
good approximation if you add

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.180
together all the different
services and people broadcasting.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.090
So that's pretty phenomenal growth.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.520
So, you know, for now,
let's go back a little bit and

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.090
think about traditional radio.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.450
It took it a very long time
for that technology to get,

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.220
you know, embedded and mature.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.700
And Internet radio,
the curve has just been a huge spike.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.550
So this is kind of explosive growth.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.900
Well, not only are the number
of stations are growing,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.880
but the number of listeners are
growing by about 25% per year.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.830
So how many of you have ever
tried to listen to the FM inside

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.970
an office cubicle and all you get
is you get the noise from the,

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.690
you know, the fluorescent lights or
you can't even get a signal?

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.150
So a lot of people listen at work.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.660
That's one of the biggest
audiences for Internet radio.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.240
And you get other things, you know,
people promoting their

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.460
product or services,
looking for a particular service.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.230
A lot of stations are things
that are promoting something,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:13.640
right?

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.670
And, you know, last night I was--how
many--anybody from Boston here?

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.430
I was listening to the
Red Sox game last night,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.360
sorry, over the Internet radio,
which was terrific to do,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.530
but the outcome wasn't too good.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.590
But we'll get them later, I'm sure.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.460
So that's pretty cool.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.070
So now let's go into some of
the business side of this.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.420
Let's talk about some costs.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.210
Well, so you have setup costs.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.350
You've got to get
yourself some computers,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.020
and I actually have a
typical kind of setup here.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.940
Oh, this is really only kind of prop.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.460
This really isn't all connected up,
so we actually could broadcast,

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.240
but we probably won't, but it looks nice.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.610
So I have a nice studio mic here.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.580
I have a friend that makes
these down in Pasadena.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.330
They're actual ribbon mics,
so you talk through this,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.150
you sound like Edward R.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.310
Murrow, if you know who that is.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.030
It sounds great.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.460
And I've got a little mixing board,
and I can connect that into a Mac.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.760
I actually have a nice
Pro Audio card here.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.740
There are a number of
manufacturers for this,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.300
but this will do actual,
if you know what balanced audio is,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.570
and if anybody's an audio person here,
you can do really good sounding stuff,

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.680
you know, to hum.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.460
And all that.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.490
It'll actually take digital inputs,
so there's a lot of power that, you know,

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.000
OS X actually enables this.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.210
It's very easy to go and add devices in.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.270
So that would be pretty much
all you would need to be

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.100
broadcasting from anywhere,
and, you know, we can look at,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.900
we'll look a little bit at that later on.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.290
We'll go do a demo at the
end of the presentation here.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.490
So, running costs.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.570
Well,
if you're a traditional radio station,

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.690
you need power to power your transmitter,
and you could have some, you know,

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.380
large power bill, electricity bill.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:40.470
You could have some, you know,
large power bill,

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.660
electricity bill every month.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:40.710
You could have some, you know,
large power bill every month.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.790
Well, with internet radio, the cost is,
or there are some costs of bandwidth,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.450
and that's basically for each person
that's listening to your stream,

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.970
you have to send those bits, however,
you know,

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.200
however many you need to have that person
be able to hear the audio to each person.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.400
There are a couple of ways to do this
that we'll talk about a little bit later,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.850
but mainly, you know,
you have to pay for that bandwidth,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.300
and that's one of your running costs,
and the more people listen, it scales up.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.220
There are,
depending on what kind of deals

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.330
you can get for bandwidth,
there are some economies

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.720
of scale to some extent.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.020
Like, you may... You may be able to get,
you know,

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.580
a bucket to start out with that gives
you pretty much your normal listenership,

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.340
and then if you go over that,
you pay more,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.960
so you can predict what the costs are.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.600
Well, so the other part is royalties,
and this is kind of the contentious part

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.410
that's evolved over the last few years,
and there are two types of royalties.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.290
So, they're actually the new royalties
that apply to internet radio,

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.820
which do not apply to broadcast,
are performance royalties,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.500
and that's all done through the RIA,
and there's a group called SoundExchange.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.080
We're going to be
talking a lot about this,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.840
just so you know.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.900
And there's also composition royalties,
which traditional radio pays,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.380
and that's pretty much, you know,
a percentage of your revenue,

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.620
and it's a fairly low number,
and that goes to the composer

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.840
and to the lyricist for the song,
and that's been done, you know,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.350
for years.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.770
And so,
they're also... There are reporting

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.970
requirements for both traditional
radio and for internet radio,

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.560
and the internet radio ones
are a little more detailed,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.670
and... But computers help
you solve some of that.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.760
So let's talk about our setup costs.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.600
So your computer.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.600
Now we talked about the
client server model,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.820
the transmitter on the high hill.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.110
So kind of the equivalent
of Mount Sutro out here in

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.400
San Francisco is an ISP that's
connected to the Internet backbone.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.530
So you can locate your server there
and then do your remote broadcast

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.150
from wherever you need to be.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.720
That would be your studio.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.970
So that server takes
connections from your listeners,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.620
we talked about,
and sends some bandwidth to them.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.620
And you can also track
that when they come in.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.620
You'll know who they are.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.620
And you have some kind of
encoding client or control client.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.940
We'll talk a little bit later on about
the different models that are typically

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.800
used for doing Internet broadcast.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.610
And that can send a stream to a server,
that control client,

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.600
or it can just control what's
going on in the server.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:57.580
So bandwidth-- so basically,
the way bandwidth works out

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.950
is the more bandwidth you use,
the better quality your sound is.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.070
And that's probably pretty obvious.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.740
But with new codecs,
you can actually keep

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.650
lowering that amount down,
so you can actually get

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.460
more listeners from the same
amount of internet bandwidth.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.480
And the AAC codec-- we're going
to listen to some samples of that

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.480
later on-- is pretty terrific.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.060
And there's better stuff coming along.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.270
It's really kind of a moving thing.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.720
The technology is getting better
and the sound is getting better.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.710
And the ability of people to
listen at their homes-- a lot

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.980
of people have broadband now--
that's gotten better as well.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.930
I talked a little bit earlier
about saying there are a

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.210
couple different kinds.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.070
A unicast connection to a server
is you're sending the same

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.500
bits to each person directly.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.400
Multicast is a pretty cool concept,
but unfortunately,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.440
it doesn't really get used in practice.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.830
And that is you let the Internet routers
decide who needs the stream.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.840
So only one copy goes into your network.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.100
So if there's 1,000 people
inside your network listening

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.810
to this network segment,
listening to your station,

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.750
there's only one copy of that going in.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.810
So that minimizes cost.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.600
The problem is most of the Internet is
not really set up for that.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.520
What happens is multicast
gets thrown out by routers.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.290
So multicast is very close to what
it's like to do traditional radio where

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.580
you're just sending one signal out and
everybody listens to the same thing.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.350
OK, so now we'll get into
the interesting part,

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.240
the royalties.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.480
So I talked about composition royalties.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.470
And those are, there's a group, BMI,
ASCAP, and CSAC.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.240
There's also something
called the Harry Fox Agency.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.080
And basically you're paying, as I said,
you're paying for the composition

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.930
and you're paying for the lyricist.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.340
And that gets split up
by this organization.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.560
And it's based on a
percentage of revenue.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.350
And I think I have an URL down here.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.610
If not,
it's on the end of the presentation that

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.880
you can go there and there's a calculator
and you can punch in the numbers.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.930
Based on how much revenue you
have and they give you a number.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.180
And it's a fairly reasonable thing.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.270
And all Internet broadcasters have
paid that back to when they started,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.170
pretty much.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.200
So the interesting royalties
are the performance royalties.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.290
So when the DMCA came
out back in the late 90s,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.280
there's a provision in the law
that said you cannot stop someone

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.040
from broadcasting on the Internet.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.350
There's a compulsory license.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.680
You can guarantee you're not breaking
the law by broadcasting on the Internet.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.400
However, you have to pay a royalty.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.100
And this ended up turning
into a performance royalty,

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:28.510
which they've modified now to say you
can be charged either for how many people

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.640
are listening to a particular song.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.920
This is for streaming music.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.530
And how many people are listening at a
particular time to when that song played.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.260
Or you can just count the
amount of listening hours.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.390
And they have a number.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.460
They say, well,
you played 12 or 14 songs in that hour.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.390
And we'll give you a value based on that.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.780
And that's collected by a group.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.610
But a new organization
called Sound Exchange,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.710
and I have an URL for that.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.540
You can check that out.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.020
And there's all the real
details of that as well.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.660
So once again,
traditional broadcasters are

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.730
paying the composition royalties.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.700
And that's based on a few percent.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.960
And there's a minimum of about $264.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.090
And there's the URL.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.530
Okay.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.260
There we go.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.990
That's the URL at askcap.com.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.320
You can find all that.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.450
Okay.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.500
So, as I've mentioned,
the performance royalties

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.880
are very contentious.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.310
I mean, it was really,
you may have seen stories about this

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.340
is going to kill Internet radio,
it's going to shut down.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.990
A lot of people pulled their streams
off the air and there was a lot of,

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.240
you know, fear and panic and it
really made a lot of news.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.220
And that was because
this was a new thing.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.660
And especially for the traditional
broadcasters who were putting

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.680
a stream on the Internet,
they're not used to paying

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.800
performance royalties.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.740
They say, you know,
we provide a promotional value.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.530
So it was deemed that radio, you know,
had a perceived promotional

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:46.820
value back in the 20s.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.330
And so that's helping the record
industry to promote their music.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:54.020
So because I think of,
because of the reasoning for it was

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.620
because of the fragmented nature
of a lot of Internet stations,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.890
it's just a small audience.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.750
It's not, you know,
the more general thing

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.950
that commercial radio does.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.320
So they were able to,
they kind of negotiated it out so

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.340
they had to pay performance royalties.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.820
Well, so the political turmoil lasted for
about two years and Congress got involved

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.680
and there was a settlement act for a
lot of people that were broadcasting.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.690
At that time,
we're able to get in and get something

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.880
that allowed them to stay in business.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.770
So, and as I said,
this all goes back to the DMCA.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:28.300
And that was,
it was intended to address the rights

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.740
holder concerns in digital media.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.560
And, you know,
you can imagine if you were in a

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.470
business and you owned something and
suddenly people were able to get it,

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.720
you know, for free,
you'd be nervous about it.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.640
And if you're someone that
was already doing this,

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.140
you know, well,
then you'd want to keep doing it, right?

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.260
Why should I pay for something
I haven't paid for before?

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.100
Why do I want more costs?

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.560
So the players in all this are the RAA,
which I'm sure you've heard of.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.580
It's a group that's made up of,
they represent all the

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.160
major recording labels.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.760
The U.S.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.030
Copyright Office,
they're the arbitrators.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.520
And there's a Digital Media Association,
which is the best known

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.200
of the webcaster side.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.100
But there's various other things.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.040
And some technology companies
are involved as well.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.920
So, the law said that, you know,
these groups could sit down and

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.370
negotiate something and come up
with their own settlement and decide

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.360
this is what we're going to pay.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.160
Well, of course, they couldn't do that.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.570
As I said, you know, the webcasters said,
we don't want to pay anything

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.940
because we're not paying it now.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.330
And the recording industry said, well,
we'd like you to pay a lot.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.400
So they couldn't agree.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.060
So at that point, the Copyright Office,
by law, gets involved and arbitrates it.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.160
So they have something called the
Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.040
And these meet,
they set the rates for about two years.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.120
So we're actually coming near
the end of a two-year period.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.980
The rates will be possibly
different next year.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.980
So the first set of rates were very
high and they were retroactive in 1998

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.690
and that's what caused all the uproar.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:53.060
So, and there are of course different
rate levels for college,

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.350
non-commercial or commercial.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.440
We're going to look at those a bit.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.400
So first we'll talk about
college Internet radio.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.040
And this is the current rates now.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.820
So this is actually a
fairly reasonable thing.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.360
It's actually,
only if you go above a certain

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.280
amount of performances or tuning
hours do you actually own more.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.150
There's actually just a flat
rate of a few hundred dollars.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.710
And you pay $50 to the data fund,
which I'm not really

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.760
100% sure what that is,
but I believe that has to do with how you

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.380
collect the information about the data.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.850
So, and that's a little
bit different in 2004.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.490
If you have,
if your college is based on college size,

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.680
if you have more than 10,000 students,
your rate's a little bit higher.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.740
But this is pretty reasonable and,
you know, college could easily make sure

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.160
their Internet station could go,
could stay on the air.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.360
Now they do limit the
number of stations you have.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.350
If you go,
if you try to do a bunch of stations,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.410
once again we said the
spectrum's unlimited.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.110
Well, they kind of put a limit on you.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.480
Then you have to start paying the,
you know, the per rates for hours.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.410
So if I'm non-commercial,
you actually pay a flat rate of $400,

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.250
and if you do news, it's less.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.670
And when you say, wait a minute,
I'm doing news and talk,

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.970
why should I pay a royalty for that?

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.170
Well,
you might be using some bumper music,

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.360
you know, and things like that at
the start of your show.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.900
So they kind of just blanket
in that you're doing that.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.160
And there's a flat rate
for all this as well.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.680
And once again, if you go over a certain
amount of streaming,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.660
well, you know, then you kind of get
yourself into a quandary,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.360
and you have to pay a little bit more.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.790
but you've got to get
fairly large to do that.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.160
So now we'll talk about
the commercial entities.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.660
And this is the compulsory license again.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.040
And basically, one performance is one
listener listening to a song.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.130
So if there are 1,000 people listening
to a song playing on your music station,

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.030
that's 1,000 performances.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.070
And so the rate is,
we're set at about .07 cents,

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.900
which adds up over time.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.500
And they say that, well,
4% of your performances bear no royalty.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.260
That's to kind of deal with
people that only stay on for a

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.670
short amount of time and missed
connections and things like that.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.550
So they give you a
little leeway for that.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.330
The earlier rates actually had
something called an ephemeral fee,

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.880
where they charge you for
storing music on your computer,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.390
some percentage of your royalty.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.420
And that's not in this.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.400
They simplified it for this next round.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.780
So you can see it's kind of moving toward
something a little more... reasonable.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.190
So there's a minimum fee for this.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.000
So if you really don't stream much,
you still owe them $500.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.340
And if you have multiple stations,
the minimum,

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:19.300
and they only have a few listeners,
the maximum you can do is $2,500.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:26.880
So, okay, so I have some examples
here of the rates,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.440
and this is for the
aggregate tuning hours.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.520
And you can see that if you're
an Internet-only station,

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.110
you pay the most.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.810
If you're doing news talk,
you pay the least.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.770
And if you're just simulcasting
your radio station,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.600
you pay a little less.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.190
So that's for traditional broadcasters,
get a little price break and all that.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.080
And so I have some examples
here of what things would be.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.800
And I came up with,
let me get a little closer to this,

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.930
I guess my eyes are going bad.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.500
I can't read my own slide here.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.520
What,
this should show us what that'll be.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:54.840
Okay.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.660
Right.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.010
To pay for this,
you'd want to run commercials.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.640
Okay, so if you imagine someone
that's running so many,

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.620
you know, listeners per hour, and,
you know, they had a bill of, you know,

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:12.200
of $800 a month, they'd have to do about
$3.50 an hour in commercials.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.170
So, you know, you could easily get some
kind of revenue in just to,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.820
you know,
that's not a lot of money to have

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.620
to go out and raise or get an
underwriter to cover those rates.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.130
And they do go up as
your audience goes up,

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:30.050
but that's more valuable to your,
you know, to your advertisers as well.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.380
So, we can talk a little bit about the
Small Webcaster Settlement Act.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.320
Now this was designed for people
that were already webcasting to help

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.610
them avoid a very onerous spill.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.400
So they really put a flat
rate for the years that,

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.430
you know, they didn't know this was all,
what things were going to happen, 1998,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.300
1999.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:55.040
And basically you're eligible for
this if you fit in a range of things.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.690
And if you're in that, and this actually,
I think this expires this year,

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.690
turn of the year,
and this basically allowed a

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.020
lot of people who were already
broadcasting to stay on the air.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.200
And it was, you know, a compromise.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.150
And, you know,
compromise is not a perfect thing,

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.800
but it allowed people to stay on the air.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.620
So it was probably, you know,
it was a good thing that it all happened.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:19.960
So, part of the compulsory
license is you must report.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.260
So there's reporting, which requires,
which you're required to decide,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.040
you know, what you have to pay,
and that's based on what you play

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.380
and how many people are listening
or how many tuning hours you have.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.260
And there's also something
called the broadcast complement,

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.220
and that's the mix of music you can play.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.950
This is, they provide rules that say,
you know, how many songs you can play by

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.390
an artist in a two-hour period,
et cetera, and repeat them, you know,

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.300
within a day.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.180
And you're supposed
to follow these rules.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.980
They give you a little leeway,
but you're supposed to

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.060
roughly follow these rules.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.480
It's, you know,
a little bit of a restriction,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.170
but it's something that, you know,
traditional broadcasters

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.040
have always done.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.340
And then there's finally annotation.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:03.980
So you have to display the name and
artist of the title artist of the

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.810
people that have made the music,
its music, as part of the...

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.340
So let's look at the
reporting requirements.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.330
So every three months you
have to do two weeks of log,

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.120
and basically you have the name
of your service and what type

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.450
of transmission categories,
whether you're a news station

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.850
or a music or a non-commercial,
etc.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.980
Then you talk about each song and say
how many performances of that song.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.790
So you have to give
them a two-week period,

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.110
and you can just select
that from whatever you want,

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.200
and that's how they kind of,
they do a statistical thing,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.260
and they say, okay, yeah, okay,
he's pretty much playing what

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.810
he says he's going to do,
and they base your rates on that.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.050
So, here's the detail on
the sound performance,

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.980
sound recording performance complement.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.500
And this is a thing,
a follower I said from

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.900
a traditional radio.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.970
And it's designed to keep
listeners from recording music.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.900
So the idea is it kind
of randomizes everything.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.860
You don't know what's coming up.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.410
So you can't say what's
going to play next.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.710
And you can say what's played,
but you can't say what's

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.630
going to play next.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.240
And you can't play the same things
at the same time every hour so people

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.560
will know if I tune in now I can
get that U2 song that's popular.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.950
So this is basically, like I said,
there's some leeway to this.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.130
You can do about 10% out of it.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.830
So if there's some special thing and
you play a lot of songs by one artist in

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:25.640
the music realm for a special someone,
let's say if an artist passes away,

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.060
you can do that and not violate it.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.090
So, here's an example of an annotation.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.060
This is actually from a
station that we stream.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.040
This is a Beggar's Banquet record
recording company Internet radio

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.470
station called AV Deck.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.790
This is a track that they
had a few years back.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.560
And you can see it's got copyright
and it's got artist and title.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.150
And, you know,
as a bonus for Internet radio,

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.530
which is pretty nice,
you can embed a link in that.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.180
So, if it's commercial,
you can have it point to the

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.680
website of the company that's
buying the commercial time from you.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.250
If you're promoting music,
you can have it go and point to,

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.610
you know, the recording label or
maybe a music store,

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.850
you know, or a number of things.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.140
So the royalty summary.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.600
You only owe royalties if you play
music that you don't own a license to.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.200
The compulsory license that
we talked about is not just

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.320
absolutely for everybody.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.990
If you can work out a deal with
someone or some particular record

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.550
company or let's say you're a
band and you own your own music,

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.970
you don't owe any royalties.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.270
You can go and broadcast what you want.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.590
So there are a lot of things,
but this allows people to kind of

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.510
play music that they like of different
genres and do it in a legal way.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.430
So you may have to
prove that you do this.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.080
They may come after you.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.200
They may come after you and ask you,
you know, wait a minute,

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.860
you're broadcasting,
show us you can do that.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.000
So you may have to show a contractor
a log that shows what you've played,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:49.330
etc.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.350
But you can do that.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.060
So, well,
here's where computers start to come in.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.400
Now, we talked about all this
reporting and the royalty rates,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.370
and there's a lot of math there.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.600
And if you had to sit
down and do that by hand,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.940
looking at your logs,
you'd just be doing that

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.400
day after day after day.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.560
It would take up all your time,
or you might have to

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.380
hire someone to do that,
and that would be a terrible job to have,

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.000
really.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.400
You know,
so computers make that a lot easier.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.000
And that's one of the things that we do,
is we track Backbone Radio, my product.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.030
We track who's listened in your log,
and then we put it all

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.670
in a relational database,
and we allow you to go in and just say,

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.280
you know, hey, what did I play?

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.320
And we give you actually some example
queries of what that looks like,

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.640
and you can actually just calculate
that stuff with a few clicks of a mouse.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.220
So that saves you having to
have a person in to do that.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.220
So, and of course,
you can write special software

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.600
now that you've got this data.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.660
And there might be some
interesting things you could do.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.640
You could show the people that are
buying commercial time from you,

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.920
well, look,
here's who was listening at this time.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.760
So you really, you know,
you really got a good, you know,

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.390
a good response based on this,
because a thousand people were listening,

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.960
you know, at that point.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.040
Or if you're promoting music,
you can look at those

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.760
demographics and say,
well, what was more popular?

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.980
What did people like to listen to?

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.590
When did they turn off their stream,
you know, in the middle of a song?

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.980
Maybe that tells me something.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.950
So, and you can look at what
times things are more popular,

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.980
so you can decide, you know,
what's the most popular.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.560
What's the best,
what's the prime time to charge,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.080
you can maybe charge
more for commercials.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.110
So you can pretty much
do your own ratings.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:26.160
Okay, so that was all the legal parts and
the parts that you're required to do

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.400
to be able to do the station legally.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.780
So let's talk a little bit about the
technology of what's behind all this.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.180
So we talked about encoding briefly,
and really you get a trade-off.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.800
If you send more data to your listeners,
you get better quality,

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.990
but it costs you more.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:51.060
We talked about the client-server model,
and we're talking about QuickTime here,

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.220
right, because you're at WWDC.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.840
So we use something called
the Realtime Protocol,

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.340
which is an Internet standard
for streaming,

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.440
and each QuickTime file contains in
it something called a hint track,

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.640
which tells a server how to go about
building the Realtime Protocol packets

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.570
that need to be sent to a listener.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.900
And we standardize an
MPEG-4 AAC just because,

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.690
you know, it's pretty cool,
and it sounds great.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.360
And also, we're going to look at
some broadcasting models.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.840
We're doing this, so we'll say,
what is encoding?

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.480
Well,
your source material could be anything.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.800
It could be a CD,
it could be an MP3 that's high quality,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.490
and you basically perform math on
this with some software that says,

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.280
if I take out,
how much data can I take out

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.560
and it still sounds good?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.250
So you can do that and
minimize the amount of data

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.460
you have to send to somebody,
yet keep the quality.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.790
And as I said,
it's a very subjective thing,

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.590
and it's really a trade-off
of how much you want to use,

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.300
of bandwidth you want to use
and how much you want to pay

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.060
as to how good the quality is.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.930
And, you know,
it's a very personal thing.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.760
So obviously, higher data rates,
higher quality and higher cost,

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.980
lower data rate, you know, basically,
it can sound okay,

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.180
but it's reduced quality.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.290
For example, like the baseball game I was
listening to last night was sent

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.690
at about 10 kilobits a second,
and it's just voice,

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.250
so it really sounded like kind
of a bad telephone connection,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.760
but I can understand all of it.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.960
But if you're doing Tchaikovsky, well,
you might want something that's

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.540
stereo and a much better quality.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.210
So you might want to be able to have
different encodings for different types.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.280
So there's some other
trade-offs you can do.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.150
Stereo is great,
but you can get as good a quality at

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.830
less data rate by just choosing mono.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.730
So we'll talk a little
bit about MPEG-4 AAC.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.500
And this is done by Dolby Labs,
and this is included in QuickTime.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.240
And it's currently kind of the
state of the art for streaming.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.820
And this is really,
it's based on standards.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.340
So if you and I wanted to go
out and build our own codec,

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.280
we could go get a copy of the
standard and sit down and write some

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.710
code and come up with something that
put out the same format as MPEG-4,

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.120
and it sounds better.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.840
And we could have an MPEG-4 codec,
and that's exactly what's happening.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.610
So there are codecs that are on the
way that I'm sure that QuickTime will

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.380
adopt as time goes by that sound
even better at lower data rates.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.180
But once you're in the standard,
it's guaranteed to be backward

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.450
compatible and forward,
which is one of the great

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.300
things about standards.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.410
And also,
standards mean that as new devices

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.380
come up that support the standard,
they're going to be able to

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.830
play your audio natively.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:29.110
You don't have to do anything
special to make all that happen.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.390
And there are actually
no royalties as well.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:45.620
So I have some music samples.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.460
Let's see if we can hear this.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:56.070
"That's 128 kilobit a second stereo
MPEG-4 and that's kind of what

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:59.230
comes out of the iTunes Music Store.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.900
And it sounds pretty good.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.890
Okay,
so we'll go to music sample number two.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.940
I didn't start.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.400
Well, the demo gods are not
completely with me so far.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.080
But I do have a 48-kilometer here.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.910
Let's try to see if
number three goes here.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:39.390
http://www.gmail.com/news/radio-radio-rad
io-radio-radio-

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:43.080
So let's talk a little bit more in
depth about the client server model.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.610
So as I said, listeners on the
Internet are your clients.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.970
It's very similar to traditional radio
where you've got the transmitter in the

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:53.820
high hill and people listening in their
car in their home to a radio station.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.480
Well,
if you're listening on your computer,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.610
it's a very similar thing.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.710
So the difference with Internet radio,
of course, is we mentioned that there

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.680
can be two-way communication.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.420
So I can get some
information back from you.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.800
You can send me an email.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.070
We can do a chat, etc.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:13.600
And there's a lot of things that are,
you know, that's a very interesting thing

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.640
that traditional radio can't do.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.420
So in most cases, as we said,
we talked about multicasts and unicasts.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.660
There's a stream sent to every listener.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.060
So that's different
from traditional radio,

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.180
but it's there.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.640
So let's talk a little bit about that.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.550
The real-time protocol is the
way that the data that's in the

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.030
stream is broken up into small
pieces and sent to the player.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.250
And it's designed so if you're
ever driving in your car and you're

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:02.330
listening to FM and you go under a
bridge and FM drops out for a second,

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.960
a real-time protocol is designed to
make that possible with computers.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.710
If there's some disruption in
the stream for some reason,

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:10.020
it won't just fall over.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.560
It knows that it can throw some
data away and so it can be lossy.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.260
So it's designed to kind of
exist in harsh environments.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.000
and you can still get
a pretty good stream.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.700
And of course all the packets
have numbers and so they're

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.880
all sent from the server.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.450
They may arrive in any order at
the player and the player decides

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.300
how to put them back together
based on their sequence number and

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.770
when to play them based on there's
a time stamp in each packet.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.810
So, there's also something called the
Real Time Control Protocol which

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.500
basically it tells the player,
this is more important

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.050
if you're doing video,
but it tells the player basically,

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.000
you know, this video frame is at the same
time as this audio so that you

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.970
can sync lip sync and all that.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.190
But there are actually also reports sent
back from the player to your server which

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.390
talk about the quality of the service.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.990
So your server can
automatically adjust itself.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.500
So this guy's having a loss,
I'll send him some repeat packets

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.460
and there's kind of a you know,
there's only a certain point of

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.860
loss that you can go to before,
you know, things fall over.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.850
But if there's just a little
bit under say 10 or 20 percent,

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.060
you can actually compensate a bit and,
you know,

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.520
and get a still keep a good quality
stream by sending a little extra data.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.710
This is the control protocol.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.550
So when you're in your
QuickTime player and you hit play

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.990
and pause buttons or open a stream,
you're sending RTSP commands to

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.820
a server which say just that.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.270
I'd like to listen to the stream,
set it up.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.440
You know, I want to play or pause.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.080
If it's a file you listen to the stream,
you can actually move around randomly.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.310
You can't do that in a live
stream because obviously,

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.720
you know, it's live, right?

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.190
So you're hearing what's in the now.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.350
It'll also tear down the connections
so the server knows if you've

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.920
disconnected from the server that it
shouldn't be sending you those packets.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.500
It can use that bandwidth
for somebody else,

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.990
and that's all done under the covers.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.800
So you can take a player,
and you can encapsulate that, you know,

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.860
inside.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.070
You can have a stub movie that
actually just has information

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.840
about what the stream is,
and you can put that inside a web

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.740
page or you can mail that to somebody,
you know,

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.840
or you can have your web page launch
an external player so they can be

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.200
scrolling through different pages as
they're listening to their radio stream

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.040
so there's a lot of detail to that.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.590
I won't go into a lot of
that just because that's some

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.840
things that are going on in,
you know, other sessions.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.460
I'm sure they've covered
that in a lot of detail.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.030
So let me talk a little bit
about broadcasting models.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.310
So how is Internet radio done?

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.410
So let's kind of look at,
this is more of a

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.740
traditional broadcaster,
and, you know, they've got a studio.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.320
So they've maybe got a radio automation
system that just puts out audio,

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:50.860
right?

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.320
So they've got a hard drive somewhere,
or they've got some CDs,

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.050
or there's some places
they still do tapes,

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:55.180
right?

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.300
And they put that through a mixer,
and there's a microphone, et cetera.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.480
And at some point, that comes out,
and it'll go maybe to a, you know,

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.740
obviously it goes to a
transmitter up on the high hill,

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:10.150
the real, you know, RF-based broadcast,
but it goes into a compressor,

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.860
and that compressor sends either
over public Internet or sometimes

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.040
they just use an ISDN line so
they have guaranteed bandwidth,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.180
and they send that off to an encoder
or they send the encoded data,

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.480
you know, from the station.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.660
It's really a choice of the
people putting it together,

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.130
and then that goes to a server.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200
So.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.140
The good part about this
is it's pretty simple.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.960
Well,
the bad part of it is you don't actually,

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.040
other than, you might be able to,
you can track the number

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.300
of hours people listen to,
but you don't really know,

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.270
you have to go correlate your logs to
that if you want to do performances.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:44.630
You really don't have that correlation
of who listened to what was played.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.660
Okay, so another typical thing
is an MP3 hosting service.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.330
So you upload some files manually
and you build a fixed playlist,

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.640
and that fixed playlist runs,
and it can be very long, you know,

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.520
and it can do some things randomly,
but it pretty much just repeats,

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.800
and you have to go and manually go
change that to get that to be different.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.800
And once again,
you could get some information on that,

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.870
on who's listening and all that,
but that has to be built

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:11.700
into that software.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.900
Typically those are very simple.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.890
They're just really just
sending out a stream.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:17.890
They're not doing all the logging.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.510
So we can talk about
Internet radio automation,

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.160
which is what I do.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.160
And in this case,
there's a control client that

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.080
actually controls the server remotely
from anywhere you are in the world.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.900
So really,
your server just does what it's told,

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.480
and the server has a lot of intelligence.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.100
So it can do,
we talked about the broadcast complement,

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.420
there's a set of rules you have to do,
or maybe you want certain broadcasts

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.810
to go on at certain times.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.490
The automation system can make
your station sound very fresh.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.780
And at the same time,
if you want to broadcast live,

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.880
you can now cut in.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.740
And just send that live
stream to that ISP,

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.290
so avoiding having to
have a stream that's,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.910
if there's some disruption in that,
if you're not broadcasting live,

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.450
your station's going to stay on the air.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.790
And of course, that server is up on the
high hill at the ISP,

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.890
and you've got your
listeners listening to that.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.350
And that server can now
keep track of all the logs,

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:12.520
it can keep track of who's
connecting and who's listening,

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.990
and allows you to go off
and build your reports.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.280
So.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:18.340
Bye.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.340
Basically, with an automation system,
you can encode the clips ahead of time

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:28.300
and put them actually physically on
the server so they don't have to be

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.260
streaming from the client all the time.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.760
They can just sit on the server
and run when they need to,

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.440
and you can let that run autonomously.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:40.520
So you could have people on the air that
are just looking at what's playing now,

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.830
and they know what they can talk about,
or you can have them pre-recorded.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.070
There's a number of concepts in radio
that are built in automation systems.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.200
At the same time,
your program director could

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.540
be choosing what's played.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.150
You can have people doing
commercials that track that,

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.640
and that's called traffic
in traditional radio.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.240
They could be doing that offline and
programming the station ahead of time,

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.190
and it all works very seamlessly.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.200
At the same time,
that could be done from anywhere,

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.200
so those people don't really even have
to be in the same physical building.

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.820
They could be at a live remote somewhere,
they could be in their home,

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.890
in their office.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.540
You can pretty much do a station and have
a lot of different people involved in it,

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:21.070
and not need a lot of bricks
and mortar to go and do that.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:24.760
So I talked a lot about
doing dynamic playlists.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.780
Basically, if you use rotation rules,
you can come up with something

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.150
that sounds very fresh,
and you're not doing anything

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:33.580
to do that because you know
it's going to be randomized.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.570
You'll be following the law of
what you have to play to broadcast,

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.060
and you can have that set up
with a month's worth of music,

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.940
and it'll play without you
having to go to see the station.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.260
So a lot of stations do
something called voice tracking,

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.890
where they actually
record the live inserts.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.620
If you say, hey,
it's a great sunny day and it's raining,

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.150
well,
that doesn't quite work out the next day.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.770
But you can do that in the future,
and a lot of radio stations do that.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.990
It allows them to create
something that sounds pretty live,

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.210
but without having people sitting there.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.440
The air talent can come in and
do their show in 20 minutes,

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.210
half an hour,
instead of being there all along.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.840
But you can also do live assist.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.220
You can actually have
somebody doing a show,

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.130
and they can... be
talking over their music,

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:19.260
or if they're doing a live broadcast,
you can have, you know,

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.880
material running and recorded...

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.300
You know, that's appropriate,
and then they can cut in and do

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.380
the live show if they're doing
a sporting event or whatever,

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.420
or use the playlist to have commercials
while you're doing your sporting event.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.510
And, of course, an automation system does
all the logging as well.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.420
So where is everything
heading at this point?

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.400
Well, the royalty situation
has really stabilized.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.190
You know, one of the problems in
the period of the early,

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.090
you know,
2000s was that people didn't know

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.060
what the rules were going to be.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.910
So that's a tough thing if you're
trying to run something where

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:57.720
you're going to have to pay and
you don't know how much that is.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.170
Well, now it's very well known,
and now it's going to

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.530
evolve every two years.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.780
So all of you can get
involved in this process and,

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.260
you know, lobby, you know,
Congress and do things

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.930
to try to get things to,
you know, come down even further perhaps

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.120
or make it easier to report.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.300
So it's not going to be a fixed thing.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.730
It's going to be
revisited every two years.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.770
And, of course, well,
there are lots of mobile

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:21.180
devices on the way.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.010
In a few years, you'll be able to,
your radio station will be

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.170
able to stream to phones,
you know, 3G and other things

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.600
that are coming along.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.060
There's other standards
for high-speed data.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.180
But the thing is radio
doesn't need that much speed.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.760
You don't need the one and
a half megabits a second.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.480
If you have a phone that can do that
and you're just doing a 56K stream,

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.250
it's going to sound great.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.680
And, of course, this year the theme of
NAB 2004 was IP broadcasting.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.290
So this convergence thing
has really happened now,

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.730
and everything is moving into being IP.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.980
And I think over time you may see,
you know,

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.320
traditional terrestrial broadcasters
become a little less important,

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.470
especially with these portable
devices because you can imagine the

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:58.070
next thing might be in your car.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.040
And that's where a lot of
traditional radio is going to be.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.820
And that's where a lot of
traditional radio is listened to now.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.000
And given the unlimited
spectrum of the Internet,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.970
you know,
that gives you as a station operator

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.640
a large audience to go choose from.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.960
So it should be a pretty cool future.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.700
Well, so I have a final thought before we
go off and do a little demo here.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.110
Well,
there have been millions of downloads.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.740
I think they just said 250 million
downloads of iTunes since it came out.

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:21.990
Right?

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:22.720
That's about the number.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.850
I mean...

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.140
I'm sorry, of QuickTime, excuse me,
of QuickTime, thank you.

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:29.980
And well,
and also when you download iTunes,

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.600
you do get QuickTime for free.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.340
It comes along.

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:36.210
So everybody that's downloaded iTunes
for Windows has got a copy of QuickTime.

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.640
So that means you've got people
that can listen to a stream

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.990
done from an OS X server and,
you know,

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:46.460
there's a lot of market out there that's
really been untapped and you can do it

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.650
much easier and much better quality,
you know, in our world.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.880
Okay, well,
so I'm going to do a little demo here.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.580
We can switch to the demo.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:47:58.590
Actually,

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.000
Whoa, look at that.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:02.450
There we go.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.800
Okay, so I have an automation
system here that's running.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.720
So we're actually looking at a
server that's running in Florida.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.050
And I've got a time of what's
playing on the air now,

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.510
and I've got a countdown time.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.000
I've got the time and date.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:17.470
There are various things I can
do to change the microphone gain,

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.320
what my source is, etc.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.470
I can look at a database.

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.080
Well, so I actually want to
do a little live insert,

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.090
and I need a volunteer from the audience.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.250
Let's see if I can do
some stage diving here.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:31.890
And I'll pick someone to do that.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.040
How about you, sir?

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.400
Would you like to be a DJ?

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.520
Okay.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:59.900
[Transcript missing]

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.180
Okay, so I'm going to start.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:06.860
This is a little playlist.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:07.840
This has got a little jingle.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.780
And actually, we bring up the audio
just a little bit on this.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.390
So we're actually going to go to...

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.100
So in 23 seconds this
playlist will start.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.860
There's going to be about
a seven second intro.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.920
Then you're going to see a script come
up and you just read what you see.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.200
Just read what you see.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.450
And you can translate into
Dutch on the fly if you'd like.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.900
That won't work.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.400
I can try.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:33.940
Okay.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.710
And so this would be
kind of a live assist.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:46.140
You're standing on the rock, Z Rock,
WZHB.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.550
Okay, so.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.700
Hi San Francisco, you're here.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.490
This is WWDC 2004.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:02.310
And you've just heard Internet Radio in
Depth from George Capalbo.

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:03.190
Is that your name right?

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200
Close enough.

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:09.390
Up next before we go to back
and ten great hits in a row,

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.140
it's your turn.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.200
Step up and ask some questions.

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:16.670
Hey, thank you.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.360
So now there were a lot of things
that were going on in that.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.500
Let's talk a little briefly about
this in this automation system.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.090
So the streaming is based on delay.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:31.380
And there's about a five second
or so delay when things happen.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.650
Our automation system actually
synchronizes his live voice

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:36.100
to what's playing on the air.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.260
So to him,
he just has to look at a live cue and he

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.170
doesn't have to think about any of that.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.210
And that, you know,
we were streaming to a

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:43.710
server that's out in Florida.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.090
And that's now off
playing the next thing.
