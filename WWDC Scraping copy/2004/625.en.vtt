WEBVTT

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.500
Good afternoon.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.940
Well, hopefully all the demo
guards are still in the room.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.930
We have a lot of demos this afternoon,
so hopefully it will all go very well.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.810
I can feel a lot of
positive karma in this room,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.470
so I think we'll be fine.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.780
I actually manage the
Apple's professional services

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.280
group for the enterprise,
and we do a lot of integration

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.500
work with a lot of you in the room,
a lot of our customers,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
enterprise customers,
people buying Xserves, Xserve raids.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.910
We're helping a lot of our publishing
customers migrate from OS 9 to OS X,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.500
setup network home directories,
integrate with Active Directory.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.560
So basically,
this session is all about integrating

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.480
those Macs into your environments,
into your corporations, on your networks.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.370
And so we'll talk about
a lot of that today.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.820
So we kind of see ourselves
as like a jumpstart team,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.490
right?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.340
So we come in for a few days,
and we kind of help you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.500
do that integration work.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.090
We're not a consulting firm that stays
for months in your company and spends

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.500
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.740
We're just in for a week,
and we basically help you get

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.500
all that stuff up and going,
and then basically mentor you

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
and help you basically maintain
the system moving forward on 10.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.500
So this is kind of what our team does.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.880
So, what's really interesting,
the reason why we started this team

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.300
and this enterprise professional
services group is because of Panther.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.360
I mean, if someone would have given
me that job before Panther,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.400
I wouldn't have taken it.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.900
Panther is really the first
operating system that is truly

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.900
an enterprise operating system.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.040
And I feel we're very confident
when we go in that we can get

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.990
the job done in your companies.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.850
And so, really, it fits beautifully in
a lot of environments.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.310
What we're going to talk about
today is kind of review a little

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.330
bit of the desktop solutions that
are out there that make that Mac fit

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.950
into that enterprise properly.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.100
And then we'll talk a
lot about the back end,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.110
because the back end is also very key,
and that's why we have

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.950
on stage right now,
you know, XSERVs, XSERV RAIDs,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.000
which will all be part of the live demo.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.990
We'll also talk about some
third-party solutions.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.000
There's tons of third-party solutions,
of course.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You've seen a lot of them this week.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.890
But I'm just going to focus on a few
that I thought were kind of interesting,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.910
again,
that have come out in the past few months

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.990
or that will be shipping this month.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I'll also talk about
some myths versus facts.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.990
I meet a lot of people,
and there's still some networking terms,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.960
and people still think that we're
running AppleTalk on our network.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.000
So we'll kind of talk
about those as well.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.420
And then a lot of people, when we go in,
they're like, "Well, you know,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.960
I'm running OS 9," or "I'm
running 10.2." "Tiger's going to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.000
be shipping next month," which,
of course, we all know now it's not.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.660
"Should I wait to deploy?"
And we'll talk about those.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.130
So, fitting in, right?

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.220
The first thing that's important
today is for the Mac to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.480
fit into your corporations,
and we all understand that.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:06:18.200
[Transcript missing]

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.100
Active Directory support.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.860
This has been key.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.810
This is something that
we shipped in Panther,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.760
and we've improved it tremendously
since we shipped 10.3.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.000
In 10.3.3, we added full support for
network home directories.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.860
That has to be done.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.840
This is not a UI.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.110
That has to be done
from the command line.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.020
You need to edit the
Active Directory .plist file.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.240
But basically,
it allows you to truly have an

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.620
SMB network home directory and not just
have it mounted on the desktop like

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.060
what happened when we shipped in 10.3.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.380
We just hadn't finished that feature yet.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400
But we have that.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.180
Also, very interesting,
we even have wireless support

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.370
when using Active Directory.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.360
So once you're bound or you're
setup with your wireless account,

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.440
you can actually reboot your machine,
log in, and we actually have

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.840
wireless support through AD,
which is a feature that some

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.390
third-party products don't.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.870
One feature we are missing that
is interesting is DFS support,

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.170
and love to get feedback on that.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.080
Right now, you have to use the
Thursby product for that,

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.400
and we understand that.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.400
Love to get feedback if
that is important to you.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.290
You'll have my email address at the end,
so we'll be glad to

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.400
receive that feedback.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.390
Mobile accounts is also very important.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.400
Laptops,
a lot of people use laptops today.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.280
You want to make sure that
your credentials are cached on

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.350
the laptop so you can log in,
log out, reboot your machine.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.400
When you're not on the network,
you can log in.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.400
So we've got all those
features in the AD plugin.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.990
Some of the other directories
where we are compatible with,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.430
because of Open Directory,
and if you went to the

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.830
Open Directory session this morning,
you have a better understanding

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.400
of how our directory system or
directory infrastructure is in the OS.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.320
We're very open,
and we're all based on standards.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.290
A lot of those other
directories use LDAP,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.700
and so it's really simple to plug
in a Mac desktop into a Sun iPlanet

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.400
backend or into a Novell backend
or an IBM directory server backend.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.440
So we fit in very, very well,
even with some of the other

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.400
directories that are out there.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.400
We've been NIST.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.400
For those of you who still use NIST,
it might be time to upgrade,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.600
but we still have that support
in the operating system.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.080
I wanted to quickly touch on a
few applications and web browsers.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.490
So, of course,
Safari is Apple's browser of choice.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.570
And, again,
we've improved Safari tremendously.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.320
And Eric will show some of the
cool Safari demos in just a second.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.240
A lot of applications are web-based.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.990
And you saw some of the
announcements this week with,

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.770
like, PeopleSoft and Salesforce.com,
who are also very committed and

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.650
that are basically fully supporting
Safari as the browser of choice.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.400
A lot of banking.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.390
We've been talking to all the
major banks as well to make sure

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.400
they fully support Safari as the
browser of choice on the Macintosh.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.670
We also added in Safari 1.2,
we added Live Connect support,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.660
which is huge for a lot of customers.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.850
And, again,
just mentioned some of the few tools

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.100
that are really useful when you're a
Mac user and you need to connect to a PC.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.160
You know, a virtual PC,
but RDC is a great tool as well.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.320
Remote Desktop Connection.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.060
It's free.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.200
Many people don't know that.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.980
And we'll demo that today as well
just so you can get a feeling of

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.590
what you can do with Microsoft.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.220
Microsoft RDC.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.720
I say it's free,
but it also requires a CAL, of course.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:35.180
Virtual PC 6 and 7 shipping
this summer or later this fall.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.940
And then PeopleSoft 8, SAP, Java, GUI,
people who are using SAP.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.750
Also, there's a client on the PC,
a Win32 client, but there's also a great

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.940
Java client that is available and
that is compatible with Mac OS X.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.220
So we also have SAP availability.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.050
And Oracle 11i and Salesforce, of course.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.650
And then 2004, Office 2004,
if you read Steven Wolfstrom's quote

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.550
from Business Week a few weeks ago,
he basically said that Mac users now

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.500
have an Office suite equal to Windows,
which is really good.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.830
And we actually have even more
features than the latest version

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.740
available on the Windows side.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.980
Hopefully my clicker keeps on working.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.570
There we go.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.900
Quickly touch on Java and X11.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.570
So, again, we've got some great tools
available on the Mac,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.250
and we're seeing more and more
developers actually use Mac OS X as

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.860
their development platform.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.900
Great tools, JBuilder,
Sun Java Creator Studio.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.800
That was announced this week
at the Java 1 conference.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.870
IBM Eclipse.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.900
There was a session on
Eclipse a few days ago.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.500
And Eclipse is really,
really important because, I mean,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.270
I'm seeing a lot of developers move to
Eclipse to write their own applications.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.370
And because we have
Eclipse on the Macintosh,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.570
it's going to help us even get
even more applications on the

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.700
platform because it truly is a
cross-platform development environment,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.450
and it really helps IBM and
others to bring even more

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.100
applications to the Macintosh.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.460
And then JBoss, Macromedia, and,
of course, the X11 client.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.400
This is great.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.980
I mean, if you've been to... downstairs
to some of the vendors,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.960
if you went to the vendor fair,
a lot of them, the first step,

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.560
like in the backup area,
they bring up the X11 server and

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.200
the X11 client for the Macintosh,
and then it takes them a few months,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.070
and then they come up with a
really nice native Cocoa GUI.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.590
But at least we have X11,
and people can actually run

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.620
their applications through
X11 on the Macintosh as well.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.330
VPN clients.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.800
Just wanted to quickly touch on that.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.280
So we have a native L2TP and PPTP over
IPSec client built into the OS,

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.230
so for small and medium businesses,
also on the server side,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.040
we have a built-in VPN server that
is compatible with Mac and Windows,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.780
so make sure you take advantage of that.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.440
I mean, if you buy an XServe,
it's really very simple

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.950
to set up as a VPN server,
and, again, it'll work with both

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.500
your Mac clients and PCs,
and I still know quite a few accounts

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.230
that are dialing in using Dial-Up,
and the beauty of this is if

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.600
you set up an XServe with VPN,
you can go to pretty

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.820
much... You're on the road.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.920
You can go to any hotel.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.590
They all have... They pretty much
all have DSL or cable modems,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.940
and you can get on your network
without using any Dial-Up,

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.210
which is kind of pretty much outdated.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.680
Cisco as well.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.270
Oh, by the way, we also, in 10.3.4,
we also improved tremendously

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.270
our Nortel compatibility,
so there was a bug on the

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.600
Nortel side in their VPN box,
which we basically addressed by

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.820
adding some new functionality on
the client to work around the bug,

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.440
basically, and now you should really
look at having your admin,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.100
turn on L2TP on your Nortel box,
and you should pretty much...

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.840
It should pretty much just work,
so you can actually use

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.580
the built-in Mac client to
connect your Nortel backend.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.140
There's some other ones.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.680
Netlock has a client for Nortel, Equinox,
a VPN tracker, V1,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.660
and Grayshawn Software.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.970
So that's kind of a quick
summary on the enterprise side

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.040
and again on the client side.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.570
And again, I didn't touch on everything,
but I also wanted to focus a lot

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:19.040
on the back end and on server
solutions and how we fit in into

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.980
your networks on the server side,
especially with Panther and

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:22.980
then with Tiger,
it'll just get better.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:16:32.200
[Transcript missing]

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.590
Another thing that
we've been doing a lot,

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.040
pretty much since Panther's shift,
is policy management.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.730
Now that we have a truly
enterprise-level operating system,

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.080
people want to lock down and manage
their policies on the desktop.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.560
There's a couple of ways to do that,
and that's what this slide talks about.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.210
The first way that usually we go with,
and probably 80% of our customers,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:05.180
when we go and talk to the Windows admin,
they manage their schemas.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.940
Usually, we start talking and say, "Well,
the first thing they ask is,

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.690
'Are you going to modify
my schema?'" It's like,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:16.440
"Don't touch my schema." That's
usually the way the IT people behave.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.100
That's fine.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.970
We've got no problem with that.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.680
We'll work both ways.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.820
We can put Xserves in there and basically
use the Xserve as a dual authentication.

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.420
You're still authenticating
the user to Active Directory,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.150
but you're being managed
through the Xserve.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.080
That means that you don't have
to do any schema extension,

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.640
and Eric will show you that
in the demo in a few minutes.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.360
That's the first way.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.320
You put an Xserve,
and you're basically still

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.280
authenticating to AD,
but you're being managed through the

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.400
Xserve using World Group Manager.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.190
The other way we can do it
is we can actually extend the

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.720
schema on your Windows server.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.300
That's stuff that we also
do on the consulting side.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.400
That's also, there's about 30,
what is it, Eric?

00:17:59.440 --> 00:17:59.900
37?

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.670
There's 37 attributes you need
to modify on your AD server so

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.600
that basically you could actually
run World Group Manager against

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.760
the Active Directory directly.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:18.030
You can manage users, groups,
computers when you're modifying

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.900
the schema on your AD server.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.050
People usually don't
like doing that manually,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.120
even though we have that.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.370
It's all detailed in the
Open Directory guide.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.370
But you don't want to make any mistakes,
especially on 2000 because

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.000
you can't delete attributes
once you've put them in.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.590
We basically developed a script
that just goes in and does it

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.170
all pretty much automatically.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.450
That's the other way of doing it.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.760
What I want to do now is basically
bring up Eric to show you some AD demos

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.040
and go through a bunch of them.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.720
Eric?

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.510
Thanks, JD.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.840
What I want to do now is basically
bring up Eric to show you some AD demos

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.430
and go through a bunch of them.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.430
Eric?

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:13.070
It's actually located in your Utilities
folder under Every Applications folder.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.120
I need to unlock here.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.480
So you notice there's a plug-in
here called Active Directory.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.900
Double-click on that.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.800
It'll ask you for a
little bit of information.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.990
Pretty easy.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.620
Some of your admins have a hard
time figuring out what it is,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.600
but it's very easy
information to find out.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.000
You're looking for your force
and your domain information.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.500
It's already entering here,
but I'm not bound yet,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.690
so I'm going to actually
bind this client to the AD.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.340
Now you can use a
pre-created computer account,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.790
all the kind of stuff you
would do on a Windows side.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.100
If you've got privileges to do it,
it will let you bind to the directory.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.090
Return.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.100
Now I'm bound.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.600
That fast,
it created a computer account and

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.330
it's bound to the Active Directory.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.100
There are a couple of things you've
got to do before you're done.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.590
You actually want to say I want
to use this for authentication.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.000
I've already done it in advance here,
but you add that to the

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.090
authentication chain.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.000
One very important thing
people don't realize,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.700
if you've got Exchange,
you want to add it to

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.860
the context one as well.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.130
And I'll show you why
you want to do that.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.400
All you do is switch to custom,
click add, and add it to the list.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.380
So that's pretty much
how hard it is to bind,

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.730
but if you launch the terminal,
the quick test to make

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.050
sure it really worked.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.570
So I know there's an
AD user out there called

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.640
Okay,
that's a user out of Active Directory.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.290
You'll notice, partially because his UID,
for those with the UNIX IDs,

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.400
is very large, because that's dynamically
generated from Active Directory.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.740
You'll also notice a group based
off of the domain information.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.000
So he's actually part of
the engineers group in AD.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.110
So now I know AD's working great.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.940
Now I'm going to log out.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.700
I'm going to log in as
that user I just checked.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:54.700
So I went home.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.910
What's important about this user is,
I call him WinHome because his home

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.490
is actually on the Windows server.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.800
No changes.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.020
It's not running AFP.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.940
It's running just regular
Windows file services.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.660
I'll also show another user where
we're connecting to the Xserve,

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.780
another example of how
you can split that up.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.700
One thing that happens for you is one,
your home directory on the network

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.940
gets mounted on your desktop.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.090
And I actually put a shortcut

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.080
In your doc.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:38.200
So I can actually create a folder here,
you know, this is from the Mac,

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.010
this is stuff for home, etc.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.710
So those are files that are
up in my network home network.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.240
I could copy files over, etc.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.940
from my local machine if I wanted to.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:46.840
So you see how that works.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.870
It's normal SMB share
from a Windows server.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.560
But let me go ahead and log out.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.650
And now I'll log in as an OS X user.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.100
Now what's different here is
the home is actually on one

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.540
of our Xserves in the rack.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.790
Now the Xserve is actually
integrated to AD as well.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.100
You know,
it's the same OS X home added to my dock.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:25.090
And in this case,
it's actually using SMB to an Xserve,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.100
which is kind of interesting.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.100
In reality, as JD mentioned,
you can actually switch that.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.720
Just to show you real quick,
there's a command line

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.100
tool called DSConfigAD.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.630
If you run that,
there's a little option here

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.100
called Local Home and Mount Style.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.100
You can switch the Mount Style to AFP.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.140
So if I were to switch to AFP,
it would actually use

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.100
Apple File Protocol to connect
to the Xserve instead of SMB,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.100
which is more reliable for us.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.100
So that's pretty much it
for actually logging in.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.100
It's amazing how easy that is.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.100
But a little more detail people don't
realize is I can actually launch Safari.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.060
I've actually got Exchange 2003
installed with Outlook Web Access,

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.100
so let me just click
to Outlook Web Access.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.700
You notice I didn't do anything.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.430
It signed me in.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.680
It used my Kerberos credentials
that I got when I signed into

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.700
the computer and just logged
right into Outlook Web Access,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.870
just like you do on your PC.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.810
I can click on email, read email,
send email, etc.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.340
And I can show you the fact that I've got
credentials from the command line with

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.520
a simple Kerberos command called K-List.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.830
This is the credentials
I got when I signed in,

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.290
and this is the credentials to
connect to the Exchange server.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.200
All automatic.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.770
But remember that comment I made
a little earlier about the Context

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.200
tab and why that's important.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.830
Most of us don't realize
once you do that,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.260
if you launch Address Book,
you can actually look at

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.200
Active Directory and find users.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.250
You know,
I want to send an email to somebody.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.960
I know there's a demo user out there.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.460
Actually, there's three of them.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.620
I can double click on the user.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.390
You know,
this is all kinds of information.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.390
All of this is coming
out of Active Directory.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.990
I can, for example,
I can actually drag that to my

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.360
personal address book if I want,
so I don't have to worry about being

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.940
on Active Directory and now that
user is now in my local directory.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.430
All completely seamless for you.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.270
So just to prove a couple of things,
let me go ahead and log in.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.240
Eric, go back to address book
and show them the syncing,

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.900
the iSync with Exchange.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.910
So inside of address book,
you can actually go to preferences

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.400
and you'll notice there's a
synchronize with Exchange.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.430
So if you actually got an
Exchange account and you've

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.900
integrated your mail as well,
launched your mail and set it up,

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.680
you can actually sync your address book
with mail and Exchange back and forth.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.200
So all your addresses are always in
sync for your personal address lists.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.400
Your GAL, or what people call the
GAL on the Windows side,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.890
is auto-ready and
address book by default.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.100
So there's nothing to synchronize.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.590
The great thing is if you launch
mail and you type in usernames,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.500
it will find them in AD automatically.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.500
The autocomplete that we have in mail,
it works with AD as well.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.520
All automatic.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.980
This is server number four, please.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.560
So let me actually show you
real quick those users in AD.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.780
I've actually got the
AD administrator up here.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.160
Those two users I just logged in as.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.500
You'll notice the OS X home.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.400
You'll notice his account,
just a normal account,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.630
but his profile was on the XServe under
the Users folder with his OS X home.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.880
And same thing on the WinHome.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.300
You'll notice the difference is,
it's actually on the Windows 2003 server.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:42.790
Now, let me log in on another
PC with that same user.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:55.890
So that's a home folder stored
on an Xserve from a Windows box.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.400
If I actually click on
the short link here,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.960
you'll notice that it's actually going
to the server and the files are in there.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.960
You can also go to my computer
and notice that it's actually

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.600
mounted on the desktop,
or on the system as a drive.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.110
All transparently,
they don't even know it's

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.120
an XServe on the backend.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.300
So that's kind of it for that,
but let me now go through

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.900
some policy examples.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.810
Can we go back to number two, please?

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.800
So I've got a couple other users set up.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.110
Actually, number three, please.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.110
Oh, three, sorry.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.220
So I've got a couple of the users set up
to actually show the policy management.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.430
First of all,
let me show you a user that has

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.590
actually been extended directly in AD.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.480
So this is a,
we've done the schema changes

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.600
and I've applied a policy to
the user in AD using our tools.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.010
Nothing special, I log in as user just
like I always would.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.800
Now I didn't do anything special here.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.540
This actually came from
the policy management.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.180
I said to put his dock on one side.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.370
Actually enable magnification.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.990
And this is all coming
from the policy management.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:20.190
It's always a slight
delay logging in here.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.660
Notice the network home
isn't listed in the folder.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.610
So I've kind of controlled
that user's experience,

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:26.540
which is very handy.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.070
I could lock out applications.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.170
Anything you can do in worker management,
you can do to the user

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.680
right then and there.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.820
And I'll show you what that looks
like in our tools so you see

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.810
how I actually set the settings.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.690
Now I'm going to log
in as a different user,

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.820
and this is a group user,
and this is because I'm going

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.150
to control his policies from an
OS X server with a separate directory.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.390
I want to log in first
without anything set up.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.320
So you see it's just a normal user,
everything exactly the way you would

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.760
have first time when you signed in.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.560
But I'm going to make a slight change.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.340
I'm going to add the OS X server
to that authentication tab you saw.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.330
What that's going to do is find any
other groups the user might be part of.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.060
But I'm going to make a slight change.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.770
I'm going to add the OS X server
to that authentication tab you saw.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.840
What that's going to do is find any
other groups the user might be part of.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.700
Yes, I'm only part of staff,
no extra groups.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.120
Last director access.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:35.170
Now I'm going to actually
add the LDAP server from

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.330
our server into the list.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.290
Now if everything is working right,
for us here I should log in

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.910
with the same user again,
and notice everything

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.090
will look different.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.830
Demo gods aren't with us.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.300
Let me double-check to make sure
I actually talked to the server.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.720
Managed settings are cached,
so there was some danger in this,

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.230
and the fact that it didn't go to
the director again because he knew

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.360
that it didn't have any managed
settings that needed to be refreshed.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.050
Just open up a terminal
and show them that.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.850
You'll see that I'm actually
part of another group.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.760
Actually, it did.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.920
Take that back.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.970
Oh, there you go.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.560
I have a simple finder.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.530
So that was the big change.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.330
Boy, Simplifiner is really simple.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.300
So it worked.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.330
So next thing,
let me launch the worker management

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.700
tool so you can see what this kind
of looks like in the directory.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:46.770
Couldn't run it as easy as it is,
it's pretty restricted there.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.940
So let me connect to the
Open Directory Master.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.380
And let me connect to the Xserve
that's bound to AD as well.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.600
So this is the Open Directory Server.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.060
Notice there's some other users.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:10.260
I didn't do anything special.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:10.260
But you'll notice the
group called Manage Group.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.010
Yes, the group user is in that group.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:17.850
You come over here, this is the XServe,
and here's a machine connected to AD.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.680
I can do the same thing under
the menu and you'll notice

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.480
there's a view directories.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.800
I see the same list because I'm
connected to AD as well as on a client.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:31.490
If I click groups,
you'll see the engineers, etc.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.030
So the nice thing is,
if I click on this extended

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.840
user and go to preferences,
you'll notice he has

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.670
some preferences set up.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.660
Now I can authenticate.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.380
I can actually change
some of this some more,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.700
but if I click on one of these
settings and come in here,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.750
say always,
even though I didn't make a change,

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.100
and it just saved that
directly to Active Directory.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.630
So I'm modifying the user directly.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.090
Now if I go to the Open Directory server,
I can click on the Manage Group,

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.140
go to Preferences,
and you'll notice the Finder

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.670
setting that I had set.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.250
And I said always make
it a simple finder.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.590
So that user got that policy from
a completely different directory.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.380
That's it.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:14.890
Cool.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.500
Thank you, Eric.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.300
So see, demo gods are actually with us.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.280
It's a good thing.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.170
And there's more coming.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.400
Next thing that I wanted to
talk about is Mac OS X as a PDC.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.280
That was pretty interesting.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.230
Last year, we did a similar session,
not as in-depth as this one,

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.720
because of course,
Panther wasn't shipping at the time.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.970
And a customer came at the
end and basically told me,

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.600
"Hey, you know, we've got about 500
Macs and about 100 PCs.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.520
Should I go to
Active Directory?" And I said,

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.600
"Absolutely not.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.990
I mean,
there's no reason to do that because

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.340
Panther now has PDC support built in.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.000
So really, I mean,
you just basically set up

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.850
an Open Directory master,
an Open Directory replica,

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:09.630
and you have the PDC built in,
so all your PCs can authenticate directly

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.650
to the Open Directory master box.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:16.480
So there's no need for deploying any
Active Directory server to manage your

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.150
PCs and log in and so forth and so on.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.130
So basically,
we've got native support to act as a PDC.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:27.840
And as you saw in the session,
we'll also add a backup domain

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.520
controller in Tiger as well,
which is useful when you

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.920
need to manage the server.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.520
And then what's also interesting is
we also mentioned that we were going

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.460
to come up with a migration tool.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.420
But again,
Panther is shipping today and Tiger will

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.660
ship in the first half of 2005.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.410
And we understand that the NT support
is going away at the end of the year.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.620
So I wanted to make sure that
people--there are two tools.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.820
One is available today.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.240
One is coming very shortly.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.830
One is from DAS Technology and
the other one is from Versora.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.020
And basically,
they're going to have a tool that

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:06.540
will allow you to migrate your
NT servers over to a Mac OS X server,

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.520
an Open Directory PDC.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.000
So those tools are
available--or one is available.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.380
One will be available
shortly by this fall.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.290
And then we also have some documentation.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.580
So please look at the
Windows documentation.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.470
It's not as easy.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.370
We don't have that automatic tool yet.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.270
But the documentation is pretty
explicit on how to help with

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:22.550
the Windows documentation.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620
So please look at the
Windows documentation.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
It's not as easy.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
We don't have that automatic tool yet.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
But the documentation is pretty
explicit on how to help with

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
the Windows documentation.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
So please look at the
Windows documentation.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
It's not as easy.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
We don't have that automatic tool yet.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
But the documentation is pretty
explicit on how to help with

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.620
the Windows documentation.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.170
on how to help with the migration.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.620
And, again, our recommendation is,
you know,

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.570
if you have about under 400 users,
our PDC will work great.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.060
400 to 600,
it's a perfect solution for that.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.730
So if you have less than 400 to 600 PCs,
you'll be fine.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.470
Of course, when you go, you know,
in that enterprise level, you know,

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.050
the PDC is, you know,
Active Directory or a Sun solution

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:51.120
or a Novell solution is probably
better for the high-end enterprise.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.540
For the small to medium business,
it's a great solution.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:59.140
So what I'm going to do is
have Eric give you a PDC demo.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:33:59.610
Yep.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.440
So first on the Mac here,
I want to just show you the fact

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.280
that I have a user in Open Directory.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.800
This is a LDAP server.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.120
Let me close out the AD one over here.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.510
So you notice there's a PDC user,
but he's got a Windows setup.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.990
I didn't create any profiles,
so obviously I don't feel like

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.340
dealing with creating a login
script and profile and such.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:21.700
But you will notice I'm going to map his
home to the server or the Mac server.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.570
So he's got a typical path.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.540
I'm going to map H to our X server.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.880
This is number four, please.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.110
All right.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.920
So now I'm on XP, and you can see I'm
actually bound to the ODPDC.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.170
Let me just sign in here.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.450
"I typed the right
password?" "Actually good,

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:55.100
it's actually a security
feature in Windows.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.810
It doesn't let you in if you
don't type the right password."

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:05.090
And you'll notice my H drive got mapped.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.750
Automatically.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.190
Nothing special.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.960
Can I just talk about
number three real quick,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.310
please?

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:12.930
Hold on.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.620
Go to the start menu, the start button,
just a second.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.050
Click on the start button, Eric,
just to show them that actually

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.260
you can see that the PDC user,
it's actually the PDC user.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.850
And again, the beauty of it,
you can change passwords on the PC.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.450
It saves that back to the Mac.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.890
You can change it on the admin side.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.750
I mean,
all that stuff is totally transparent

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.060
on the desktop and on the server.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.050
Number three, please.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.860
So you saw what I was looking
at in Worker Manager real quick.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.570
I just want to actually bring
up Server Admin so you can

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:49.790
see that particular setting.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.490
As you can see, some of the logons have
been a little long,

00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:00.600
and that's because of our little
mini DNS server we set up at lunch,

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.260
so bear with us.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:07.900
The DNS might not be completely
configured properly here.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.480
And DNS is extremely important for those
of you who have set that up before.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.500
So you notice under Windows,
there's some settings.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.650
I'm going to finish refreshing there.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.500
And I'm just configured as
a primary domain controller.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:25.050
I set my domain as ODPDC,
my computer name, and it's set up.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500
Great.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.770
Thank you, Eric.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.900
So I wanted to touch base
also on another topic,

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.420
which is migrating to Open Directory.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.960
Well,
what's also interesting is we've been

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.880
talking to a lot of people who have Sun,
Sun iPlanet servers.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.900
And again, you know,
they're spending a lot of money

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.740
with Sun servers and especially the
maintenance support and the support.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.620
And so what I wanted to mention
is it's actually pretty simple

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.740
to migrate if you're only using
your Sun for authentication.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.590
And again, we're not talking, you know,
500,000 user records, right?

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.050
I mean, again, you have to,
within reason, you know,

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.100
our server can support
today in Panther over,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.910
you know,
we've tested over 100,000 user records.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.660
So if you're in that area, you know,
zero to 100,000,

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.750
you can definitely use our
master replica scenario.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:27.110
And definitely very interesting
from a migration from iPlanet.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.970
What's also interesting is, again,
built into directory services,

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.570
you can very quickly
authenticate to iPlanet,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.000
but also you can use Workgroup
Manager to help you migrate that.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.560
So what you could do is you could
basically tie into Workgroup

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.900
Manager on your Sun box.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.300
You see all the list of users
and you basically use the export

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.360
feature in Workgroup Manager.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.900
You save that file and basically you
bind to your open directory server and

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.350
then you import that file and you've
got a great way to basically import

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.670
and export the basic user settings,
right?

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.250
SN, CN, password, definitely not.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.080
You know,
usually what we recommend there,

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.570
password migration is not easy for those
of you who know that in the audience.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.280
But, you know,
you can use Workgroup Manager to

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.900
quickly set up a default password.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.000
And users can come in and
change it at first logon.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.880
But a lot of, you know,
we've talked at least four or five

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.830
people in the past few months who
want to migrate to open directory

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.180
from Sun and you can do that.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.460
Because, again, Sun uses LDAP.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.420
We use LDAP.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.880
Therefore, we're very compatible.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:30.080
Next topic I wanted to
cover is high availability.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.140
And so, again,
if you were in the session,

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.930
you saw some of the announcements
around Tiger and Tiger Server where

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:40.960
we're basically going to have an
active-passive failover mechanism.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.880
But, you know, Tiger, again,
is shipping next year.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.300
And a lot of you in the publishing
world or in the enterprise world want,

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.060
you know, the XServs, you know,
they have one power supply.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.500
So I hear that all the time, right?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.040
People want to make sure
that if the server goes down,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.690
my users get back online, you know,
immediately, right?

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:04.040
And so what we've put together
is basically a scenario.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.180
This is a simple scenario.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.810
And the scenario is I've got
a master server serving files,

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:11.900
right,
or serving network home directories.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.990
Again, AFP, SMB, NFS, you know,
it doesn't really matter.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.580
And so this master server is actually
connected to a fiber channel switch.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.020
You know, it doesn't matter.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.210
It could be, you know, VXL, Brocade,
QLogic.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.200
Those are the three that we
support and basically the server

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.020
is connected to an XServ RAID,
okay?

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.460
It could be one, it could be two.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.560
In the demo today we have one, but,
you know, no big deal.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.500
The more ports, the merrier.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.180
And then you've got this failover server.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.630
And this failover server is
basically in a waiting mode,

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.280
right?

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:49.220
And, yes, the server is not doing much,
but at least, you know,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.080
you're back up and running.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.600
If something happens, you know,
that server will pretty

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.700
much instantly take over.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.900
And that's really what people care about.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.390
And, of course,
none of the volumes are mounted

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.030
on the failover server right now,
right?

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.920
That's a big thing that
people have run into.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.110
They think they can have both volumes
mounted from the RAID on both servers.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.180
Not at all, right?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.340
You don't want that because then
that's how you cause corruption.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.120
So all the volumes are
mounted on the master server.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.310
And when the failure is open,
we basically automatically

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.940
mount all those volumes
over to the failover server.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.470
And we'll do a demo in just a second.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.760
What's also interesting is usually
those kinds of solutions are,

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:25.980
you know, pretty expensive.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.160
They're, you know, $10,000 to $15,000.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.210
And, you know,
basically we have a scenario where,

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.980
you know, we sell it for, you know,
probably in the $4,000, which is really,

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.830
really good using scripting.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.040
And so what I want to
do is bring up Eric.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.550
And Eric is going to basically show
you this high availability demo.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.650
To set up the best way, we actually put
Apple Remote Desktop on our servers.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.100
I've got two windows open here.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.200
You notice I've got the master
and I've got the failover.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.980
You notice the desktops are similar,
but all the volumes are set

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.300
up on the master over here.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.590
Let me show you these
are really live windows.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:02.590
So I can create a...

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:04.530
New window.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.140
Sorry, I'm observing.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:08.120
In observed mode.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.260
So these are real live windows.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.880
And I'll actually connect to,
try connecting to the master.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.700
It's going to prompt me.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.040
They're actually there.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.790
So notice that Eric is connecting.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.870
Notice the IP address.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:27.450
He's connecting to 162 and
he's connecting to the volumes.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.100
And basically,
you can see we have 10 volumes,

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.970
but we've only shared four in this case.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:35.440
So he's connected.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.190
Everything is going fine.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:41.000
What I'm going to do now is
I'm going to simulate a power

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.410
failure or a power supply blow-up.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.800
So, you can see there's no
trick here in this demo.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.870
I'm going to turn off the server.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:57.450
Server is now off.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.900
And you can look at the failover server
and in a matter of a few seconds,

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.060
it takes usually, you know,
around 10 seconds,

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.940
you'll see that not only
all the volumes mount,

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:14.100
but also what we do is we start
AFP as well on the services side.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.180
And you can see all the volumes mount up.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.400
I'm going to connect to
the exact same IP address.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:29.010
And Eric is going to be
connecting to the same IP address,

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.800
right?

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.180
AFP's probably still launching,
so give him a moment.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:33.180
Hopefully.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:38.700
We might not have started AFP.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:44.200
Can you make sure AFP started?

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.540
Or just run it from ARD?

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.050
I'll try to connect to it real quick.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.850
Yeah, AFP's not running.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:59.500
Yeah, AFP might not be running.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:07.200
There you go.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.260
Just a matter of time
for things to come up.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:14.260
So again,
we have a little bit of DNS issues here,

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.900
but usually it's pretty instantaneous.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:22.210
So the user will get disconnected,
and there's nothing we can do about that.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.720
But the point of it is
that anything could happen.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.050
Your switch could be going bad,
or there might be a power

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.180
failure or something.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.420
And in a matter of 10 seconds,
your user will say, oh,

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.210
I got disconnected.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.020
Let me just reconnect to the server,
the same server I was connected to.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.160
And it's very transparent for the user
they'll be connecting to the failover.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.120
But again, the RAID will move underneath
the failover server.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.020
And then we also have failback.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.950
And again,
that's for you to decide if you

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.150
want automatic failback or not.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.570
Our scripts are able to
do automatic failback.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.260
And so if I start the server again,
all the volumes will move back

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.820
over to the master server.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.660
Thank you, Eric.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.400
So moving forward,
what's also very interesting,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.840
as you've all heard and maybe a lot
of you have been to the XSAN sessions,

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.800
and what's interesting is if you
deploy this high-availability failover

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:19.740
solution that we talked about,
you can deploy that today, right?

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.830
But when XSAN ships later this fall,
what's interesting is you could actually

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.760
install XSAN on a very similar scenario.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.380
Now, granted, I didn't put the
metadata switch in there.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.080
It's not all fully wired up,
but it would be a very similar

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.900
scenario where you would load XSAN on
the master and on the failover.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.940
And what's interesting
there is because of XSAN,

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.940
now your RAID volume could actually
be mounted on both machines,

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.680
right?

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.870
And so you could actually run other
services on that failover server,

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.590
right?

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.090
So you wouldn't be running AFP,
but you could run some of the

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.760
other services that are out there.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.250
You could use it.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.280
You could use that to do Netboot,
Netrestore, QTSS.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.990
I mean, you name it, right?

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.520
Anything but AFP or SMB.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.790
And when that machine fails,
basically you start those

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.970
services on the failover server.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.600
So great migration path.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.380
You start with the high availability.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.440
Can't really use that
second server for now.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.570
But when XSAN ships,
you can basically buy two copies of

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:26.370
XSAN and load it on the master on the
failover and basically come up with a

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.250
really nice little XSAN environment.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.590
environment.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:39.090
What's also very interesting moving
forward with Apple XSAN and XSAN is

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.700
really the whole SAN environment,
and we talked about that

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:43.970
in the XSAN sessions.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.110
But again, what's interesting here is
you can have a mixed platform

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.100
SAN solution using XSERVE RAIDS.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.060
And that's really interesting
because that gives you true

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.600
enterprise data management.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:59.300
And using some of the
wonderful tools from ADIC,

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.410
you could actually have a
mixed environment of XSERVs,

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.000
of Windows servers, and Linux servers.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.610
Because of our compatibility,
because we're 100% compatible

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:13.770
with the ADIC file system,
you could actually host XSERVs,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.710
Windows servers, Linux servers,
and your back end could

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.600
be all Apple XSERV RAIDS.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.390
What we see in the enterprise
a lot is people have

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.500
EMC storage or Hitachi storage.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:28.250
And what you can do now is you can
basically still use that storage.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:33.460
I mean, that storage is really expensive,
and usually you don't want hundreds of

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:38.310
terabytes of that storage because it
will cost you a couple million dollars.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.000
Quite a few Porsche GTs.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:42.600
That's my car.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.090
I mean, I'd love to have one.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.010
But anyway, so what's really interesting
is you can use the XSAN in

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.520
that middle storage range.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.400
So using ADIC's total life.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.400
And then you can use the
ADIC in the management system.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.450
Basically,
when the files haven't been touched

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.200
for a few days or a few weeks,
that's for you to set up the policies.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.400
Those files will get migrated
automatically to an XSERV RAID.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.820
And then if they haven't been
touched in another month,

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.360
then they could be moved to tape.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:13.400
And that's all done totally
automatically using ADIC software.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.260
And we can integrate with that very,
very nicely.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.350
So again, just food for thought on the
enterprise side using XSAN.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.700
I also wanted to quickly touch
base on backup solutions.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.210
And, again,
we had a great backup solution

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.940
or backup session yesterday.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.310
But, again,
I think it's important to mention that,

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:39.590
you know, last year, you know,
we didn't have a lot of backup

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.140
solutions available for Mac OS X.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:46.040
And you can see that the list has grown
pretty dramatically from IBM to Veritas,

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:51.520
EMC, Legato, CA, Backbone, Tolus, Dance,
Attempo, Avail Solution.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.120
Actually,
a lot of the vendors were downstairs,

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.190
if you saw them, for the past three days
in the vendor fair.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.370
So a lot of great backup
solutions available for Mac OS X,

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:05.390
both on the client and as well
as on the client server side.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.960
And that's really exciting.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.780
And, again, the reason why we have
all those is because of,

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:14.960
you know, Mac OS X's Unix foundation,
is that it's much easier now

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.260
for developers to come on the
Mac platform and write tools

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.420
because they support Linux,
they support Windows.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.450
And now it's reproducible.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.390
really easy for them to support Mac OS X.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.460
Another big thing is nearline backup.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.660
And that's a solution that
I wanted to talk about because

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.700
this is actually a true deployment
that we did in Washington,

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.280
D.C.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:39.200
And basically the customer decided
to completely get rid of tape.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.860
No tape libraries.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.820
They wanted basically
true disk-to-disk backup.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.330
And basically they bought an XSERV and
they bought four XSERV RAIDs.

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:54.970
And about 20 miles away or 10 miles away,
they have another set, one XSERV,

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:56.410
four XSERV RAIDs.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.500
And basically the way they're doing
it is they're doing their backups,

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.580
their daily backups.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.000
And they basically kind
of segmented the backups,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.890
you know, day one, day two, day three,
day four, day five, up to day eight.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.840
And then at the same time,
every day they're mirroring

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.430
the data over to the off-site,
to the disaster recovery site.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.620
And so that's the way they're doing it.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:16.860
And so that's the way they're doing it.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:16.860
And so that's the way they're doing it.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.780
And I don't know if you guys can,
can you guys actually

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.030
see the performance,
the throughput number right here?

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:27.020
Okay, this is 2,720 megabytes per minute.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.860
Okay,
that's the throughput they're getting

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.640
when they're doing disk-to-disk backup.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.600
Okay, and that's actually using
Retrospect on Mac OS X.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.240
Retrospect 6 with 10.3.4.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.370
Pretty amazing.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:41.820
Now, how many people know how much
you get when you backup the tape?

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:44.910
Yeah.

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:45.370
Yeah.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:46.660
It's a big difference.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:48.900
And we're not saying that you
shouldn't back up to tape.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:53.820
We're just saying that basically the
disk-to-disk to tape is a great scenario,

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:58.830
and that's what people are moving to,
simply because there's not enough time

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.680
in the day to back up all your machines,
right?

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.580
And in this scenario,
they're backing up about

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.500
250 to 300 desktops,
and they're doing that

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.990
in less than two hours,
okay?

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.140
So,
that's the kind of -- You can't do that.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.820
I mean, people leave at night.

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.520
They've got about eight to 10
hours to back up their systems,

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.560
and the users are back
up online in the morning,

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.350
and if the backup is going on,
what happens?

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:24.490
User calls the IT guy and says, "Hey,
my machine is really, really slow." Well,

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.400
yeah, it's slow because I'm still
having to do the backup.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:27.420
Right?

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.960
I haven't picked up your machine yet.

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:31.550
And so that's the beauty of disk-to-disk.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:33.690
You back up the disk,
and then you can take whatever time you

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:37.900
want to back up that disk over to tape,
right, and then take that tape offsite.

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:42.460
But disk-to-disk is a great scenario,
and again, with the XSERV RAID,

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.520
for those of you who don't know this,
an XSERV RAID is $3 per gigabyte.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:46.820
Okay?

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.280
That's our cost, $3 per gigabyte.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.180
It's unbeatable, and the performance is
absolutely stunning.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.750
I mean, you're looking at 350 to 400
megabytes per second on the throughput

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.200
on the XSERV RAID sustained,
and so we've got a really great

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.680
solution for nearline backup.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:08.240
Quickly talk about
Apple imaging technologies.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.980
And that's because, again,
a lot of you are migrating

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:16.640
from 9 to 10 or from 10.2 to
10.3 or from 10.3X to 10.3.4.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.980
And basically you tweak your
Mac OS X image and you want to

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:24.220
basically reload it on your desktops.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:29.240
And we did that actually at a customer
probably about six months ago.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.000
And they had about 600 Macs.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.880
And in less than five hours,
we basically loaded a three

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.180
gigabyte image on each desktop.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.820
Less than six hours,
all those machines were

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.680
upgraded from 10.2 to 10.3.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.080
And that's using some of the great
imaging tools we have in there,

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.790
using network image utility.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.300
We used a little bit
of net restore as well.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.260
We used disk utility.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.120
So you use disk utility
to make your image.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.150
And then we used ARD as well to basically
set up the machines to net boot.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.260
And the machine would net
boot in this net install mode.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:05.220
And it would basically load
in less than 10 minutes,

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.870
would load the image on the desktop.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.560
And that's how we were able
to achieve that migration.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.250
And so for those of you
who are in the room,

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:13.930
just wanted to give
you a little heads up.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.500
So as you know,
network image utility today

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.390
does not support block copy.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.980
And so it usually takes 20 to
30 minutes to load an image.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.800
And again,
this is a confidential session, right?

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.240
So you don't repeat that, of course.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.180
But in a very near
future software update.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:35.260
Network Image Utility will
now support block copy.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.990
I knew I would get applauses for
that and I asked the product manager,

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.160
"Can I say that?" I said I really
wanted applause around that.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.480
So he said, "Yeah, you can do it.

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.290
Just have fun."

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.960
So quickly talk about third parties.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.950
And this is a very
interesting few products here.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:03.300
We have a couple of really big ISPs who
are now using XSERVs to basically make

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.750
sure that they're not being attacked
or not being hacked into their network.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:10.090
And the XSERV is a phenomenal
box for doing that.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:14.790
This customer, which I can't name,
basically did a lot of testing.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.000
They tested, you know,
Dells with Red Hat.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.570
They tested Sunboxes.

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.990
They tested Computer Associates,
$100,000 systems that basically do,

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:27.690
you know, check their network and make
sure that you're not being,

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:28.480
you know, hacked into.

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:32.920
And when they did all their testing,
we also shipped them an XSERV.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.980
And what they did is they used Snort,
which is an open-source tool,

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.940
and they installed Snort.

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:42.880
And the XSERV was the only machine,
and you're talking, you know, ISPs,

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.430
so you're talking a lot
of packets going on.

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:47.700
And the XSERV was the only machine
that did not drop a single packet.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:53.320
And any solution under $100,000
couldn't even come close to the XSERV.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.450
So they were really blown away.

00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:57.600
And that was last year.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.650
And in the past six months,
there's been two, you know,

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.680
enterprise-level solutions
that are now available.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.930
Symbiot,
which is a company based in Austin,

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.140
and not only they defend your network,
but they'll go and attack.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.680
They'll attack back at the hackers.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.810
So that's kind of cool.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.840
And then ArcSight is
another solution available.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.400
It's available as well on Mac OS X.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.690
So it's two great solutions to
put XSERVs in your environment

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.600
and basically secure your network.

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.860
You know, another really fun one,
I talked to this

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:31.580
developer on Monday night,
and he told me that basically he's,

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.490
you know,
he's working on some solution that runs

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:39.360
on the Mac that'll basically go and find
the worms that are living on the PCs.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:44.150
And it was funny because a few years ago,
another big account,

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:45.400
they were using PowerBooks.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.820
All their Windows servers were
down because they were all on Mac.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.320
They were all hit by the code red worm.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.820
And so they were using PowerBooks to
go in and shut down all the servers and

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.980
find the servers that were infected.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:55.510
That was pretty funny.

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.230
Another solution that was
announced this week from Versora

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:00.690
is called Progression Web.

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:04.720
And that is basically a migration tool,
and it sells for under $300,

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.620
which will basically migrate from IIS,
from Microsoft IIS, over to Apache.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:13.710
And as you know, Apache is pretty,
you know, well used on the web browsing,

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.320
on the web serving side, you know,
over 60% market share.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:21.290
And this is an automated,
a tool to migrate from IIS to Apache.

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.400
And then one that I thought
was really interesting,

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.020
that was announced this week,
and they'll be shipping

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.680
by the end of the month,
is Cario.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:33.820
And Cario 6, Cario's been around for
about four years now,

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:37.780
and they've shipped quite a few
versions of their email solution.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:41.570
But what's really missing, right, I mean,
you all know that, what's really missing

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.610
on the Mac is calendar,
right?

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.520
There is no email,
there is no solution today

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.030
that has really good,
that is kind of medium-sized business,

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:54.690
right,
that has good calendaring and good email,

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.320
and that is cross-platform.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.140
And so what Cario saw that,
and what they did is they basically

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.200
developed their version 6,
which basically allows you,

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.540
they have a migration tool,
which allows you to totally migrate

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:12.200
from Exchange over to Cario,
and it's very seamless on the back end.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.510
So you just migrate the
server over to a next serve.

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.760
Also very interesting is that you don't
have to touch any of the other servers,

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.560
you don't have to touch
anything on the client,

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.890
you just load this Mappy
connector on the Windows side,

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:24.370
but on the Mac side,
they're totally compatible

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.080
with Entourage 10 and 2004,
right?

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.280
So basically, you've got a really nice
solution that is cross-platform,

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.600
and they support FreeBusy,
and they've got all that

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.170
nice Microsoft stuff.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.920
And so really,
for small to medium business,

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.850
they've got a really good solution.

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.560
Their pricing is amazing.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.880
I mean, you're talking, you know,
with the antivirus,

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.620
with the McAfee antivirus,
and the spamming, and the backup,

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:53.760
all that stuff,
you're talking $700 for 25 users,

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.740
and you're talking, you know,
$5,000 for an additional 1,000 users.

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:01.260
So that's $5 per mailbox, right?

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.220
That's pretty cheap.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:05.700
If you know how much Exchange is,
you know, it's usually $100 to

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.320
maybe $200 per mailbox,
so it's not cheap.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.290
But again, you know, this is not...

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:15.160
I wouldn't go beyond a thousand
users on the product yet.

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:19.240
We're working with them on adding
XSAN support as well for clustering.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.270
But for small to medium business, great,
great solution,

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:26.400
all running on Mac OS X and
great migration tool.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.400
And they also tie right
into AD and Open Directory.

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.320
So on the back end,
you can keep your AD infrastructure

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.670
and you just basically migrate your
Exchange 5.5 or 2000 over to Kerrio.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:42.350
And then finally, I want to quickly talk
about myths versus facts.

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.340
And, you know,
it's pretty funny because I talk to,

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:47.860
you know, again,
some pretty large companies.

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.460
And, you know,
there's a lot of people think that AFP,

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.180
the Apple Filing Protocol,
is basically Apple Talk.

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.560
And just, again, to make sure that,
you know, we've gone away from

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.230
Apple Talk years ago,
right?

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.330
So there is no more
Apple Talk running on the network.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.300
So AFP is like SMB for the PC, right?

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.640
It's pure TCP IP protocol.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.900
There's no Apple Talk going
on on the network.

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.940
So that's just, you know, for you,
if your network person, you know,

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.890
tells you, you know,
we don't like Macs because

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:17.530
they still run Apple Talk,
we really don't.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.900
SMB is faster than AFP.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:20.930
That is not the case.

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.080
And, you know, really, we've tuned AFP.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.020
Because our customers work
with really large files,

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.650
you're always better
using AFP when you can.

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:35.140
And even today on the Mac OS X side,
it's always better to use an

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.260
XServe to serve your network.

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:41.000
Simply because the protocol has
evolved throughout the years.

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:44.880
You still, you know, Microsoft still uses
AFP 2.2 on their servers.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:49.030
And that is just not the,
it's just not a good protocol to use,

00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:50.960
especially when people
are running Photoshop,

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.500
InDesign, and all those big
applications on a daily basis.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.560
And then they still have to deal
with resource and data forks.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:01.080
So really, it's better to have the
Mac connect to AFP than SMB.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.080
AFP is chatty, not at all.

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.760
That, you know,
that used to be the case with Apple Talk.

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.580
But, you know,
NetBIOS was also very chatty.

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.150
But AFP is not chatty.

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:13.250
Okay, again,
people confuse Apple Talk with AFP.

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.220
And then Rendezvous is
proprietary or chatty.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.360
Well, this week, we basically announced
Rendezvous support for Windows.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.590
You've got a Rendezvous browser
for Windows and for Linux,

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.780
which is available if you saw that.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.360
And it's open standard and open source.

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.580
And since we announced Rendezvous,
I mean, you've seen how many printer

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:36.320
manufacturers and game manufacturers and
devices are now supporting Rendezvous.

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.800
rendezvous, and,
and so it is not a proprietary

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.000
standard whatsoever.

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:42.940
So what about Tiger, right?

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:46.220
So, you know, should you wait for Tiger?

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.900
Well, you know, we don't think so.

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.150
We think that, you know,
Panther is a phenomenal

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:53.860
release on the desktop,
on the server side.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:58.570
And really, when you look at the
maintenance plan that we have,

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:01.920
we've got this three-year maintenance
plan where you buy for $1,000,

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.540
you're covered for three
years on the server side.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.600
And we've got a similar
maintenance plan on the desktop.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:10.980
And when you see all the stuff that we're
basically announcing in Tiger Server with

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:16.560
no more 16-group limitations,
full ACL support, nested group support,

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.940
software update server, you know,
high availability, iChat server,

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:24.330
WebLock server,
full syncing of my home directories,

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.030
you know,
it's really important that you plan

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.700
ahead and that you get that maintenance.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.400
Because, you know,
you will want to upgrade, no doubt,

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.220
to Tiger Server when it's available
because of all that functionality.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:36.980
So make sure you get that.

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:37.960
You get the maintenance plan.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.300
You're covered for three years.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.460
You know, Tiger ships first half of 2005.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.800
Get the maintenance today,
and you're covered.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.500
You get your software when we ship it.

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:50.820
And it's just the best way to do it.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.400
So, you know,
today we've got a great solution.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.880
Tomorrow is looking, you know,
a ton better with ACLs and

01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:59.910
no more group limitations.

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:07.040
So as a wrap-up, I just wanted to kind
of review again that,

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.900
you know, Apple has made great
strides in the enterprise,

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.400
right?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.130
I mean, if you look at all the solutions
that are available today from key

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.730
enterprise developers like IBM,
Microsoft, Oracle, I mean,

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:20.110
you saw all those people
today or this week.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:22.940
We've got phenomenal solutions
on the enterprise side,

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.590
and they keep coming, right?

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:28.160
Every week, every month,
we get new solutions on the platform.

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:31.040
And the reason we have
that is because the server,

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.880
our server product is so affordable,
and our storage is so affordable.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.740
Those developers don't have
to fight for the hardware.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.570
They can focus on selling
their software solution,

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.520
and the hardware is now, you know,
it's nothing.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.860
I mean, a $4,000 server is nothing
compared to a 16-way,

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.980
you know,
HP Superdome or some other box like that.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.640
And then in summary,
I just wanted to say, you know,

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.500
we've done a lot of work.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.480
We've done a lot of work in Panther,
Panther Server around the enterprise.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.250
We keep moving forward with
Tiger in that direction.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.220
Pick your directory wisely.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.050
If you haven't gone to
AD and you're still on NT,

01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:11.330
please consider Open Directory.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.140
I think it's a great alternative to AD,
much less expensive.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.320
Deploy technologies
around open standards.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.960
And if you need help to
set up those environments,

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:24.800
that's our email address,
consultingservicesatapple.com.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:25.760
And we'll be glad.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.440
Send us an email.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.440
We'll be glad to help you
with your integration.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.060
We'll be glad to help you
with your integration projects

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:30.890
and help you get started.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:36.310
So this is my email address,
jd.apple.com.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.770
And Chris Bledsoe,
who's the Enterprise Alliance Manager on

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.140
the developer side.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.120
And, you know, more information.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.420
We've got a lot of documentation.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.380
You've got all your CDs.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.420
So all that is available.

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.130
Great server documentation,
which is available for

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.380
free off our website.

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.500
And of course, a lot of information on
the Apple RAID and Exan

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.880
and ARD available as well.
