WEBVTT

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.440
So, good afternoon.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.380
I'm glad you stuck around.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.500
A few minutes ago I was counting, "Wow,
five people.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.560
Cool." So, my name's Dennis Biela.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.260
My company's called Lightspeed Media.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.350
We do a lot of VR work.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.920
We're going to talk about
some of our projects and such.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.460
I've been taking
pictures for a long time.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.480
All this tells you is that
I've been out there a while.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.110
Part of the thing is I'm also a pilot,
which is kind of like a love/hate

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.140
thing I have with the museum.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.390
We'll be talking about the projects.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
I've been teaching for Apple for
like five or six years now,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.570
doing presentations and such.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.450
Normally I do a running dialogue.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.160
If you want to ask questions
during the presentation,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.870
feel free.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.780
But today they want me to hold you
or hold the questions till the end.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.620
So if you have a couple of questions,
please try to remember those

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.050
at the end of the presentation.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.760
We'll have some Q&A and I'll be happy to
answer anything that you may think of.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.560
And usually I have one rule.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.390
And my one rule is this:
There's no such thing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.830
as a stupid question.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.470
Right?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.300
So if you think that you
have this stupid question,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.240
just feel free to ask it.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
If it's really stupid, I have a prize.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.800
So it's a chance for you to win.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.770
It's a chance for you to look
really stupid in the crowd,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
but get something for it.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800
So feel free to ask questions.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.800
My current project, I'm working with the
Smithsonian National Air and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800
Space Museum.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.800
And last year they started
up a whole new museum.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.800
We had,
while they were doing the construction,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800
we had a bunch of aircraft and space
artifacts that we had to photograph.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.590
How many of you were here last year?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.690
Can I, anybody here?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.740
I got one, I got two, three, four.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.740
All right, so I got about four people.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740
So most of you, this is new material.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.740
So I can run my old jokes.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.730
I don't need the new jokes this year.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.740
So anyway, this is an unwrapped
image from a QuickTime VR.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.740
And we'll talk a little
bit about some of the uses.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.730
This is the Enola Gay.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.660
This is the B-29 that dropped
the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.740
That's the actual photograph.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.630
And then we have 3D rendering
of water on the outside.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.680
The museum thought it
would be kind of tacky.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.810
to have a mushroom cloud,
so we just stayed with sky.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.940
So what is QuickTime VR?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.430
So we have a couple different pieces.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.600
If we could switch really quick.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.390
Ah, there we go.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.690
So QuickTime VR is
basically like an animation.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.080
It's a series of still
images to build up an effect.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.200
So here is a monocoop,
and it's called Little Butch.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.800
And I can click on one side,
and I can rotate the aircraft.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.700
We get a full 360 of the view.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.520
Let me close that.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.670
That's an object movie.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.510
And then I'll show you a panoramic of--

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.730
There it is.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.240
That same B29,
let me put that full screen for you.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.700
So this is the inside of the Enola Gay.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.560
And I can look, I can go down.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.380
For the museum,
we'll talk about some of the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.640
advantages and the reasons why in
education this is all of a sudden

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.560
starting to really take off.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.800
But I've got this full 360
environment that I can look around in.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.040
So this is a series of still images.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.800
I'll talk more about the hardware later.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.790
But it's 18 shots, 18 still photographs.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
And we use an application that
goes in and blends them together.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.460
We shot the windows with like blue
tarps outside so then we could drop

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.730
out the windows and run in a sky.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.800
So let's close that.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.620
If I could go back to my presentation,
please.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.870
Okay,
so we have over 200 aircraft to shoot,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.820
144 space artifacts.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.590
The project was going to take
like eight months when we started.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.970
Actually,
it was going to be three to six months.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.990
And now it looks like I'm going
to be stuck there nine years.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.000
So I have a lot of stuff to shoot yet.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.600
The other thing is that
I learned a whole new vocabulary

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.790
working with the government.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
You know,
things like we have a funding shortfall.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.240
Now, for those of you that have never
dealt with the government before,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.680
funding shortfall means that you
can work as long as you want,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.580
but we can't pay you.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.960
Okay, so that was the first term that
I had to like grasp the concept.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.600
The next term is a really major one.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.410
If anyone ever uses this on you,
like in Washington, DC,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.550
you know that the rug's going to
be pulled out from underneath you.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.880
It's called fiscal responsibility.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.600
Anytime you hear that,
you know that the ax is

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.540
falling right on your head.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.120
So anyway,
we photographed a lot of rare aircraft.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.400
I have approximately 90 airplanes
shot so far and about 40 space

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.730
artifacts and a lot of cool things.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.360
I mean, for me as a pilot,
it was really unique because

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.570
like I'm inside the Enola Gay.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.640
You know,
I'm inside the original Learjet.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.060
You know, you learn a lot of things
for trivia pursuit.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.290
You know,
you're really good at games also.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.060
But so it was like a big privilege.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.630
a big honor for myself.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.140
we'll have shot 60,000 images.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.180
So there's a lot of issues.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.620
I was used to smaller projects, you know,
maybe 10,000 pictures.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.760
Now I'm looking at 60,000 images.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.220
We'll have about a terabyte of data.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.220
And there's a whole slew of things
that you have to keep track of,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.220
and there's a whole slew of
issues that start propping up.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.980
So one of the things that I never
counted on in the beginning was the fact

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.920
that I would become an administrator.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.350
Now, I'm a photographer.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.880
I love taking pictures.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.720
That's what I do.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.270
I do a lot of different
projects and stuff,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.200
but I always get involved
in taking pictures.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.280
Well, this was a project where
I had to start focusing on,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.300
like, managing other people,
but also managing the content,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.860
making sure that everything is
taken care of and keeping track.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.290
All right.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.170
The new museum had opened up
in December of this past year.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.110
They had 85 artifacts in
place when they opened up,

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.100
and they're averaging
330,000 visitors per month.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.910
So they had a big celebration
a few months back for the

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.100
first millionth visitor.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.090
The museum is on track for hitting
4 million visitors per year.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.670
But what you have to remember
is that the Smithsonian,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.990
the National Air and
Space Museum specifically,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.100
is the most visited museum in the world.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.000
They average 14 million
visitors per year.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.100
That's over a million visitors per
month walking through the facility.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.410
So we have a lot of issues in dealing
with electronic content when we're

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.870
talking those types of numbers.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.010
So basically, the reason why we got
involved in the project,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.100
the major thing that the
museum has an issue with,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.100
is you.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.100
You, the visitor.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.100
We have a problem with you.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.040
We want you to come.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.980
We want you to visit.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.390
But don't get too close.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.970
Don't touch that artifact now.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.080
You know, when you hit that type of
volume of people coming through,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.100
you can't allow them to touch anything.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.910
You know, just think about having to wipe
off a countertop after a million

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.920
people have touched that countertop.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.100
So it's that type of analogy.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.540
So we got involved with creating content
for the museum so they could put in

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.000
kiosks so people could electronically
visit the interior of the aircraft.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.030
That's the number one
complaint that the museum has,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.100
is there's no way to see the interior.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.370
They have cutaway drawings.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.850
They have pictures.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.100
But you can't get inside.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.190
So we allowed the Smithsonian a way
to actually get inside the aircraft,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.080
to be able to look around and
visually see what's going on.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.330
Hardware, a little bit about how
we shoot and what we use.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.770
This was from last year.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.470
Apple Computer helped
out on the computers.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.000
If they hadn't, I wouldn't be here.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.520
Nikon and Canon digital cameras.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.240
We have a couple cameras
from each manufacturer.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.210
Bogan supplied lighting.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.200
Kydan with VR heads.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.100
I had a, we'll talk more about later,
but I had a special robotic head created

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.600
for shooting some of the aircraft.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.300
Alexa, Compact Flashcards,
and then Gray Tag Macbeth for color.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.000
Color became a big issue for
us in the very beginning.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:34.960
Smithsonian has certain standards and
we had to fit in or meet those goals.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.400
Part of the thing that we're
doing for the museum is that,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.650
remember earlier I talked
about the VR and I had shot 18

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.100
still images of the interior.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:51.000
I'm using a Canon 1DS and that 1DS
is making a 31 megabyte file each.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.680
Okay, so we're making like 600 to 700
megabytes of data of each node,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.030
each rotation,
of the interior of every aircraft.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.000
So to Smithsonian, the VR is really cool,
but the other thing that they're

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.330
accomplishing is they're documenting
the interior of every aircraft.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.290
It was something that
they never had before.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.000
So it was a great thing for
them to be able to have all this

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.390
information and we'll show you
some high resolution VR later as

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.390
far as how the interiors look.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.360
Okay, we had five computers,
two photographers,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.200
myself and David Palermo.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.540
We had a couple volunteers.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.520
You know, there's that funding shortfall,
right?

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.900
So if we give you people
that you don't have to pay,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.870
we could do this for less, right?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.050
So there's always people
who are volunteering,

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.480
wanting to come to the
Smithsonian to work.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.310
They assigned a staff member,
and the one CES staff member,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.890
that was the janitor.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.160
You know,
he would come by and clean up the floor,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.260
take away our trash.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.010
But to the Smithsonian,
that's a line item.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.550
Well, we have to pay that guy.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.720
You know, you make trash,
we have to pay him.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.380
I was like, yeah,
but there's this funding shortfall.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.060
If we leave the trash
for an extra two weeks,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.540
could you pay me?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.090
So anyway.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.310
Our areas in the museum,
we had to do blue screen

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.740
for chroma keying,
for the object movies,

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.580
also for some of the interiors.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.170
Originally,
I had all these fancy drawings of,

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.180
"We're going to make a blue wall," or,
"We're going to put up a wall

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.140
and paint it blue," and all that.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.620
Well, we didn't have funding for that.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.820
We didn't have the cash.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.400
Those are drop cloths,
those big blue tarps that they

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.910
use at construction sites.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.870
It's 60 feet tall and
about 100 feet long,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.070
but they're really shiny.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.620
When they first came in,
I had to sit there with a broom

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.260
with sandpaper tied to it.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.120
I sat there and took the sheen off,
all 100 and whatever feet long,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.890
sitting there sanding away.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.850
People would come by,
and they would ask me these

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.530
really intriguing questions.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.870
"Are you painting that?" or
"Are you just trying to brush it

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.930
off?" Nobody ever got it right.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:11.070
I was just trying to take
the sheen off the material.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.210
So this is the museum when we
were first getting started.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.300
You can see the long hall,
the blue tarp being hung.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.300
We had to come up with a
way to rotate the airplane.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.280
There's a real intriguing
company in Seattle,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.300
Washington called Hover Air.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.300
Now Hover Air makes these
what they call air bearings,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:37.300
and they're basically little
pallets that you can put weight on.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.020
We were going to get four of
those and then kind of like bolt

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.300
them together so we could roll
the aircraft up on these pallets,

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.300
you know, inject air and then be able
to lift the airplane up.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.220
Each pallet is rated at 10,000
pounds and then rotate the airplane.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.250
Now each of those pallets
cost like $5,000 to $6,000.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.300
They were going to give us a discount,
but it never happened.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.300
Again, it was just a funding issue,
so I had to think.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.300
I had to think of ways to solve problems.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.240
So one of the ways that we did that
was we had to do a lot of research.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.030
One of the ways we did
that was we had these,

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.210
they're called basket dollies.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:17.930
We have up to, we have several,
and some of them can handle 20,000

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.290
to 30,000 pounds each basket.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.290
They're used on ships.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.310
Specifically,
they're used on aircraft carriers

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.300
to move the jets into tight spaces.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.420
After they land and bring
them down below deck,

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.300
they could move the jets so
they could really stack them in.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.450
So we got three of those.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.360
And then we would like use the girders
and then bolt them together and then

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.000
roll the airplane up and then we have
a 150 pounds of weight and a little

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.550
rod coming up as our spindle so we
could rotate the aircraft in place.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.460
And if you can't see it here,
I'll show it to you in another shot,

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.600
but there's pieces of blue tape.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.290
We sat there one day and we just
measured out every 10 degrees so

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.540
there's 36 pieces of tape and we would
just physically move the airplane

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.430
so it would line up on the tape.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.280
This solution here costs us 29 bucks.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:18.460
Okay, so let's see,
I can spend $15,000 or I can spend $29.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.750
Okay, so it was one of the ways that
we were able to overcome the

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.710
challenges that we incurred.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.450
This is the space where I shot now.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.470
Okay, you saw how it was before.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.020
It's now the food court, you know,
because times change, the museum's open,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.090
stuff like that.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.580
So I have to shoot at
night when nobody's there.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.720
Before I could shoot like normal hours.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.620
Now I have this.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.000
You can only work at
certain times of the night.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.200
But you also have to leave
before the sensors kick in.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.300
And the sensors,
the motion sensors are so

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.100
sensitive that they can actually
show you your heartbeat rate,

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.500
you know, in the museum.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.300
So when there's only one
or two people in there.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.990
So our project is continuously evolving.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.900
This is for heavier aircraft.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.880
This is the blue lines
that we were talking about.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.400
This is just two-inch steel pipe.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.940
And we have slides and we
can just quickly move them,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.420
the slides in and out.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.280
And then it's bolted to the heavier
basket dollies and then we can rotate.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.390
So this particular airplane
is about 14,000 pounds.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:39.310
And so we had to come up with ways to
rotate heavier and heavier airplanes.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:45.400
Now I've rotated a lot of interesting
airplanes up to the Concorde.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.400
It's a little bit big, a little heavy.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.400
It can only fit in one way
through the museum doors.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.660
But pretty much everything else
down as far as size and weight,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.400
we were able to rotate.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.870
rotate.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.560
Okay, this is our new office.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.380
We'll talk more about that.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:11.600
We now have two G5 Power Macs,
a PowerBook, just myself.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.700
I have three volunteers and one NASM,
National International Space Museum,

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.260
staff member to help out.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.280
So that's my new office.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.300
My old office was a storage closet,
which was 10 by 11.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:29.260
So now I have a space that's 10 by 20.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.800
So I'm just styling now.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.300
I mean, I've got all this room.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.660
We have a 7600 printer also.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.280
We do a lot of posters.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.750
The current project,
or current phase of the project,

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.140
is to shoot missiles.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.300
We're in the space artifacts.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.280
They're getting ready to
open up the space hall.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.300
So I'm shooting a lot of these missiles.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.300
What's the purpose of the project?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.090
We're shooting a lot of these
older missiles at this moment.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.510
We're also shooting space capsules,
and in two weeks I shoot

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.300
one of the space shuttles.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.820
So we'll be actually going through
a functioning space shuttle,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.300
not one of these simulators.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:20:08.600
[Transcript missing]

00:20:09.100 --> 00:22:26.000
[Transcript missing]

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.450
Okay, no two shots are ever alike.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.640
Every time I go to shoot something,
it's a consistent variable.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.920
You know,
the cockpits are different sizes,

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.530
we'll have different setups.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.010
This is a Kynan head right here,
and we had to build

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.490
like wood form factors,
you know, kind of like, you know,

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.280
like a box so I could bolt it down
so I could rotate the camera around.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.450
This is my own homemade rig
where I could use a fisheye lens.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.790
I would do four shots going around.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.090
This particular glider, it's, I'm sorry,
this is a wooden glider from the 30s,

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.250
and the wind screen,
or however I want to call it,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.160
the shielding was molded
to the guy's head,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.120
all right?

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.280
It was only six inches across,
so there was no way I could

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.800
get a regular VR head in there
once the piece was set over it.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.240
So we came up with the shooting
with fisheyes for that.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.130
The other thing is
I have an automated head,

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.160
a robotic head.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.740
It takes the camera and
moves it into position.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.510
That's really great for
jets because on the jets,

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.940
the hydra, usually the, like an F-15,
okay, the F-15,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.700
it's a hydraulic mechanism
to raise and lower.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.810
Well, unfortunately,
the hydraulic fluid's all drained out,

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.500
everything's turned off,
so there's no way to raise and lower it.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.060
We can, we have to crank it.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.560
So let's say 18 shots, you crank it,
it takes 15 minutes, an aircraft,

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:57.350
all right, 15 minutes up and 15 minutes
down to crank that sucker.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.290
So the robotic head became really
important to us just so we didn't

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:06.030
have to sit there and wait the,
you know, wherever that would be,

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.580
you know, third, no,
18 shots times 15 minutes,

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.790
like four hours.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
Color.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
We talked about this earlier.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
I use a lot of Apple technologies
in what I'm doing.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
So color became a big thing for us
because it wasn't that I couldn't

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
get the individual images,
you know, let's say 36 shots to match.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
I could do that pretty well.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
What the Smithsonian wants
is this is a visual record.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
Remember what I'm doing?

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
I'm documenting history.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
You know, like I get a phone call from
a friend of mine at like,

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
I forget what time it was.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:42.980
It was like 8 o'clock.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.000
at night.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.220
And he's like, you know,
calling me up and I'm like really busy.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.000
So I'm telling him, look, I'm sorry,
I have to go.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.340
I'm shooting the right flyer.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.070
And his response was, you know,
if you didn't want to talk to me,

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.450
you could just say so.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.730
So I'm like, I'm photographing and
documenting history.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.370
So, Smithsonian is very paranoid,
I would have to say,

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.140
about color reproduction.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.170
So we had to go through and really
work on color sync and work on

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.100
calibrating the camera and getting
everything a very good consistency,

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.820
so that they know if they open up an
image that that's the correct color.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.780
We actually got to the point of GrayTag
Macbeth makes a color calibrator for

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:33.490
the screens that can also be used to
take measurements off of anything,

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.910
any flat piece of art or whatever.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:42.100
So usually what we do is we photograph
the gray card and the color wedge chart,

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.450
and then we take the
GrayTag Macbeth sensor,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.150
and then we take a color
reading off of the artifact.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:52.540
We then, and if it's a multicolor piece,
we'll be taking multiple readings,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.610
and that can actually be
added into the metadata.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:00.230
So now all these files, and we script,
we do a lot of scripting

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.560
so we can automate,
all these files now have all that color

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.310
information right in the Photoshop file.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.100
So that way there, somebody opens it up,
they say, well, okay,

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.700
I want to reproduce that color.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.700
What color was it?

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.950
They have that actual
densitometer readings to tell

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.460
them exactly what that color was.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.700
So it became really a concern of mine and
something that we had to work through.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.430
So Kevin O'Connor,
he's one of the ColorSync

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.620
specialists for Apple.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.700
He goes out there and teaches and stuff,
got involved, helped me out.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.640
He brought GrayTag Macbeth in.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.490
They supplied the calibrators,
the software.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.250
They continuously give
us updates and support.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.700
It works out really well.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.640
And then, of course,
Apple Computer with ColorSync

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.700
became a big issue for us,
working with, you know,

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:47.700
with the color sync and color sync,
and then, of course,

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:47.700
Apple Computer with ColorSync
became a big issue for us,

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:47.700
working with, you know,
with the color sync and color sync,

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:47.700
and then, of course,
Apple Computer with ColorSync

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.530
became a big issue for us,
working with, you know, issue for us,

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.300
working with color sync so that,
you know, what we shot,

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.960
what we saw became what we actually got.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:28:19.900
[Transcript missing]

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.750
My volunteers.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.910
I asked for, you know,
they came up to me and said,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.790
"What would you be looking
for in a volunteer?" I said,

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:31.890
"Blonde, blue-eyed, 24 to 30, single.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.090
I got Doc Harvey."

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:38.380
So, Doc Harvey is actually
a famous neurologist.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:45.870
He has some of the medications like,
what's that one, Zorloff,

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.990
is Doc Harvey's creation.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:52.980
So, he's an avid photographer and
he wanted to do something with

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.240
photography in the Smithsonian,
they sent him my way.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.060
And then, right behind him, that's Dr.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.720
Elliot.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.620
So, and Doc Elliot is a dentist,
so every time I go in

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.360
there while he's always,
"Did you floss today?" So,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.900
they tend to work on all
the retouching for us.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.660
They, we have about, I think,
about a hundred or so, I think,

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:13.660
about a hundred

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.500
Oh, 320 gigs in each machine,
and they'll come in to

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.720
have a regular sequence.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.880
We have a very precise sequence of things
that they have to do to the images.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.160
They just can't jump on anything.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.960
They have to follow a certain routine.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.260
We have a lot of off-site backups.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:41.160
We have several FireWire hard drives at
the museum where we keep all the data.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.940
We also have several FireWire drives
at the main museum with the same data,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.880
and then I personally
keep a couple of copies,

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.710
two sets of copies of all the images.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.750
Again, it's just that, you know what?

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.640
If the place burns down,
there's no way I could

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.020
replace all this work.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.610
So paranoia kind of finally crept in,
and I just started making

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.640
more and more copies.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:13.420
Doug is our museum gopher.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.690
That's all I can call him.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.740
He helps us out.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.700
He makes sure that everything happens.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.680
But at times,
he's ready to do himself in because

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.500
he has to deal with the museum,
so I'm always giving him his chance.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.270
This is a Navy prototype.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.630
It actually flew in the '50s.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.700
It was for... They would
launch it off-ship.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.700
All these types of missiles
have hanging points,

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.650
so we've started now,
instead of making casters,

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.700
we actually suspend
everything from the ceiling.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.690
So we have a whole rig
set up now with a crane.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.700
They'll bring in the artifact.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.700
We hoist it up and get going.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.640
I'll show you some more images
of that in a little bit.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.700
Use a lot of software.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.700
I'm going to talk a little
bit about the software.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.890
Canon... I don't have Nikon up there.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:01.700
I apologize.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.700
Canon and Nikon both have, like,
their equivalent of remote control.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:09.700
We tether the cameras to the computer.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:14.410
Now I'm using a laptop
before I used to use an iMac.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.380
But I'll have it hooked
up through FireWire,

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.700
and I'll fire it from the computer.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.700
And the reason why I do that
is I save the download time.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.630
I'm not going to the card,
taking the card out,

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.700
putting it into a card reader.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.700
I'm going right to the
drive of my computer.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:30.700
And the other thing is
that the little displays,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.710
you know, those little displays,
those little screens on the back of the

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.700
camera aren't always the most accurate
things to judge color and density by.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.620
You really need to use a thing called
a histogram if you want to be serious.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.620
So I just found that going to
the computer saved me time.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.700
Plus now I'm using a calibrated screen,
and I have the histogram show up.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.690
So it was a much better
way of doing things.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:56.700
Photoshop CS.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.700
Who could live without Photoshop?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.690
Photoshop.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.700
Apple computer.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.700
I actually use Preview.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:09.700
I tend to drop the images over Preview
when I want to review things quickly.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.240
iPhoto.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.700
A lot of professional photographers
give me a problem with iPhoto,

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.700
but I'll show you some cool
stuff with iPhoto later.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.520
Shake.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.700
Shake is saving me tons of time.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.930
I have a lot of people saying, "Shake,
you know,

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.700
it's $3,500." And your point is?

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.700
So, do you think I really bought that?

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.250
So, but anyway,
Shake is saving us a lot of

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.750
time because when you see
those pictures of the airplane,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:41.710
you know, against the blue background,
that's what Doc Harvey and Lewis,

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:44.590
or Lewis, um,
Elliot would actually draw a

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.700
path over each individual image.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.180
What we're doing now with
Shake is we take a picture of

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.700
this background without any image,
I mean without any aircraft,

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.690
and then we start shooting our sequence.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.680
We bring the images into Shake, and we,
what is Shake?

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.610
Basically,
it's a high-end rotoscoping program.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.580
It has a lot of other features,
a lot of other powers,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.650
but I'm only interested in
the rotoscoping aspect of it.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.360
So, it looks at the background
without any missile in it.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.560
It then looks at the
missiles and it says,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.700
"Okay, well, everything that is yellow,
it stays,

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.020
and everything else outside of the
yellow now gets dropped out." So,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.780
before, it would take us two days
to do one object movie,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.680
alright?

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:30.580
Running Shake, it takes three hours.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.700
So, you know,
people talk about how expensive it is.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.700
It is an expensive app.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.700
It's not a cheap thing.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.530
There are other things out there
I understand that could probably do it,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.540
you know, but at least I get tech support
with Apple where I wouldn't

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.670
get tech support with some of
the other products out there.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.700
But look at the amount
of time I'm saving.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.700
Then think about the amount
of images I have to shoot.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.700
Two hundred airplanes.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.710
Two hundred airplanes at
thirty-six shots each,

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.590
you know, times X amount of days.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.700
Shake pays for itself in a few, you know,
few weeks.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.700
It's already made it, my life,
much easier.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.680
So, that's why it's highlighted.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.700
I just like, I love the thing dearly.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.700
QuickTime VR Authoring Studio from Apple,
I use that.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.830
And then Mail,
because the government is all email,

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:19.700
you know.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:20.690
What are you doing today?

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.700
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.700
Where are we at?

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.640
Can you send me that in an attachment?

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.670
So, email is like my big thing.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.660
Realvis Stitcher 4.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:33.110
Now, this product here allows me
to create cubic VR so that,

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.470
you know,
we can do the full 360 view inside.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.680
VR Toolbox, the Works 2.5.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.700
That particular product we use
a lot when we're wiring together

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.700
or putting together like nodes.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.700
Nodes are rotation.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:49.700
And like in the B29, we do that.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.540
In the B29, we want to do a walkthrough.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:56.700
Now, the reason why we like the Works is
that it's pretty easy to use.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.130
So, I don't have a lot of training
that I have to worry about

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:01.700
with some of my volunteers.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.700
And it allows us to do
linear video in between.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.470
We'll see some of those
samples in a little bit.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.600
Great Tag Macbeth for color and fetch.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.620
I do a lot of uploading of images.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.700
Smithsonian,
they can never wait for stuff.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.700
They're always like, could I get that?

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.700
Like, you know, and I'll be like, yeah,
when do you need that?

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.700
Oh, can I have that now?

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.260
So, I do a lot of FTPing.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.440
Okay, so we're going to look at
some of the QuickTime stuff.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.650
We're going to talk about
some of the benefits of the

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:38.830
QuickTime VR and why I see it as like,
you know, this whole big growth market.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.020
So we'll go to the demo.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.470
I love it when technology works.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.470
So like we were talking about before,
we have this full 360, right?

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.470
I can look around, I can go up,
I can go down.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.470
So for the museum, this was a natural,
right?

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.470
I've got a cockpit,
I want people to see how the

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.470
interior of the airplane looks.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.470
My number one complaint.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.920
But then we started doing
so much more with it.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.380
So let me show you.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.390
Object movies.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.200
This is a standard object movie.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.160
This is a moon suit.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.990
The moon suits are, you may not know,
they're disintegrating to dust.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.960
It's that, differential metals,
there's a term for it, I'm sorry,

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.400
I'm just a photographer.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.680
So, but when you have this similar
metals touching each other,

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.400
they start to break down
over the course of time.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.400
There's several different metals
made into the weave of a space suit.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.060
They're stored in like lockers
that they would use for bodies,

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.380
which they got from some
department in the government,

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.380
which kind of creeped me out.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.420
But, so, anyway,
they've got all these space

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.380
suits in these lockers,
these frozen lockers,

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.380
and they'll pull them out
and pull out the space suits.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.300
So, I've shot a bunch of space suits.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.810
It's kind of like a big
honor because they don't just

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:04.400
pull them out for anybody.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.050
And here,
I can click and then I can rotate

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.400
and I can see the different sides.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.880
sides.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.980
So an object movie.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.040
Let's close that.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.980
And then we looked at
the airplane before,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:18.340
of course.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.310
You know,
I can look at the different sides.

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:24.650
I could zoom in if I wanted,
but I started doing

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.170
more things with motion.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:31.140
You know, they wanted to show, like,
different aspects, so...

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.950
Now I have to put out a disclaimer here.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.770
I've used this piece a long time.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.530
This is a friend of mine.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.800
I had to do a VR for a
clothing manufacturer.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.340
And they were trying to figure
out after they had saw this,

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.800
like, okay, we'll make a big turntable,
you know,

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.800
we'll spin it at a certain rate,
we'll try to have her stand still.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.410
And, you know, I'm sitting there like,
you know, that's not your job,

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.790
that's my job as a photographer.

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.800
Besides, I'm worried she'll throw up.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.720
So all I did was, you know,
take a video camera and videotaped her.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.800
By the way, I have to put this out there.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:08.660
There's a tire right behind her butt,
so her butt's not that big.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:23.830
This is just a video clip.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.150
I'll grab it here, I'll rotate,
you can see the tire,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.150
now I can see the back of the jacket,
I can see the front, I can rotate,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.150
see the back of the jacket,
I'll come a little bit off.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.500
there so now the tire shows.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.920
Anyway as streaming video or
as compressed video that's

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.430
about a meg to a meg and a half
depending on the screen size.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:44.180
As an object movie in QuickTime VR it's
410k so I've shrunk it by a factor of

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:49.410
I know what is that two hundred percent
something like that a little bit more

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:54.580
so and we don't need all those frames
right videos running at 24 frames per

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:58.580
second I don't need all those frames
just to show a turn so when I started

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.600
showing this to the museum and we
started working on stuff they came up

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:07.310
with a whole new way to use this so now
what we're doing is we're photographing

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.310
or we're videotaping landings we're
going to be doing some aircraft carrier

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:18.320
landings and we're going to show through
QuickTime VR how the aircraft comes in

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:23.500
when it flares you know the highlight all
those different points when the aircraft

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.760
comes in and it's more interactive
than watching a straight video right

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.170
because you have control you can click
and start moving the cursor back and

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.600
forth as opposed to just letting it play

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.040
I didn't do this piece.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.900
An actual friend of mine
wired this together.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.990
It kind of gives you some
aspects to think about.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:48.100
This is a skinned movie.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.100
Skin is the shell or the casing,
the outer wrapper.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.060
It's my crude attempt at a video camera.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.100
That's why I'm a photographer,
because I can't draw.

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:04.120
I have a lot of features put into this.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.500
You know, I can look around.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.200
This is a standard cylinder.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.120
Alright, but maybe you want some
information out of this.

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.700
So now I'll click on angles.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.490
And within this VR, now as I rotate,
that's degrees of a compass.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.770
So I'm at 107 degrees.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.490
I'm at 8 degrees.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.670
A lot of applications out
there now being able to give

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.000
you the capability to do that.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.810
But think about education.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.800
Think about being in the middle of,
you know, like the Titanic, underwater,

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.960
rotating around,
having information start showing up,

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.120
telling you what you're looking at,
all embedded in the movie.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:44.560
It's not an asset that's going to go,
like, lost, or it's not something that

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.800
you need to worry about.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.800
It's part of that movie.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:54.310
So QuickTime with the skins and the
able to script and do wiring or that

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.100
type of stuff became a big deal for us.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.400
Let me turn that off.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:04.500
So now I've got,
let's say I've got 50 caves.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.600
Alright,
and I want to go to the next cave.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.300
I'll click.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.390
I now have this transition.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.200
So it's actually just a linear movie.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.790
And now I'm, that was rendered out,
and it's just taking me to the next cave.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.000
Now it dumps off.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.000
I'm inside that cave.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.400
Well, let's say I had those 50 caves.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.300
You know, that video transition,
the first one, man, that's cool.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.980
The second one, yeah, it's okay.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.980
The third one, I'm way over this, right?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.600
You've got 50 caves to go through.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.200
That's 25 tunnels.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.000
So now we just have it wired in.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.200
I turn off the transition.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.900
I'll come back around.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.700
I'll click.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.000
Now I just jump to my next cave.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.080
QuickTime is pretty impressive because
it has all these wired capabilities

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:51.900
that you as content creators or
people putting the data together,

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.500
or you can have somebody put
this data together for you.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.400
So I found that that became
a big selling point for us.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.400
It wasn't also creating the
content and also shooting

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.900
with high resolution cameras.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.000
It was the fact that I could
give them more features,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.250
more abilities with
QuickTime than any other media.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.150
Close that.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.180
So, Concorde,
I'll take you inside the Concorde.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.720
So this is the Concorde.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.980
As you know, or you may know,
that Air France and

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.480
British Airways gave Smithsonian,
one of their fleet,

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.390
they gave away seven different aircraft.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.500
And, you know, I can look around.

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:38.700
See the different sides, I can go up,
you know, that type of thing.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:42.400
But, you know, I'm a kid,
I'm interested in, like, stuff, right?

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.430
I just want to learn something,
so I'm going to zoom in.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.700
You know,
now I can read all the information,

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.700
all the detail,
figure out what the gauges do.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.700
In the latest creation that
the Smithsonian is doing,

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.240
as you would move your cursors through,
you know,

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.950
text would show up and it would start
telling you what this device does and

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:05.440
how it interacts with the airplane.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:08.700
So, as I said, a great educational tool.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.310
Let's go back.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:34.810
I'm going to show you something.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:34.820
I got permission to do this today.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:34.900
It's actually really cool.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.240
If I say it's really cool,
then it has to be really cool.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.980
I hope I grabbed the right one.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:43.880
No, hold on.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:48.000
Don't change that, Donald.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.000
It's this one.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.600
Isn't it opening?

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.390
I hate demoing beta stuff.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.640
All right, we'll do this.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.840
We'll try again.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:01.580
We'll start over.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.340
There we go.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.790
Okay, so you're wondering,
"Why is this guy excited about this?

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.500
We're just seeing some cars pass by.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.810
I'm excited about this
because I can do this."

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.940
This is like video VR.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.760
At any point in time I can
start like scrolling around

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.670
looking at the different aspects.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.740
It's actually set up to do cubics though.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:31.100
You have to think about like how
to fill in the top and the bottom.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.110
But we're seeing linear video
that we can rotate around in.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:39.540
So for, let's just jump out of the
box and say for a Smithsonian,

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:40.380
it's real easy.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.020
I've mounted cameras on airplanes.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:43.310
Right?

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.560
So now as you're coming in
for a landing to the carrier,

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.620
you can actually spin around
and see everything that's going

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.260
around inside that cockpit.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.800
What a great training tool.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.610
Race cars.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.000
Think about the fact of
having this inside a race car.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.450
And you can see everything that's
going around inside the driver's

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.300
environment as he's driving.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.720
So this player is kind of neat.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.550
It's not the actual player that
will play back in QuickTime,

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.500
but I can do a combo.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.880
So this is the actual unwrapped piece
on the bottom and the blue box signifies

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.000
what we're actually seeing in the top.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.080
This is done with a standard
mini DV three chip camera.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:33.020
So we're not talking like lots
of high end hardware in that way,

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:38.060
but it does require some
accessories for the lens.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.320
Basically we're shooting
up into a sphere.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:42.540
So it's like a one shot solution.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.380
And then that sphere is being
unwrapped in the software.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.200
All right.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:51.040
It's a tough crowd.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.460
I can tell it's a long day.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.240
If I can have my slides back, please.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.500
Okay, so working on a large,
we're now going to kind of get into some

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:10.960
of the meat of the project and some of
the problems I ran into that if you're

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:17.200
doing even a small QuickTime project,
I think it's good to know.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.200
So the Smithsonian tests out everything.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.200
You wouldn't believe how many times
I had to make like prototypes.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:27.180
Even before we started on the project
and I knew I was going to do it,

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:33.150
I'd have to prototype interface and
stuff all the time for them to look at,

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.200
to test.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:39.200
They wanted to figure out about the
kiosk on the floor at the museum.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:43.190
So they actually went out
and they did focus groups.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.700
Focus groups are, you know,
they bring in a group like

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.060
you and they sit you in front
of a screen and they say,

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:49.510
"Tell us what you think."

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.110
So they got past the first focus
group and then they started

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:56.400
deploying a couple of kiosks and
they brought in these people.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:01.440
Now, I didn't have any content for
them to put onto these screens.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.360
At the time we were still shooting.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.620
So what they did was they just shot,
they had an old VR of a model

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:11.200
airplane shot against black,
a VR of it.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.020
And they threw that on the screen.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:21.640
So the acceptance rate on a scale
of 100 was at 25%. 25 people out

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:26.040
of 100 that looked at that said,
"Yeah, it was cool." The others said

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.840
they wouldn't bother with it.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.940
So of course all the administrators
are now getting upset because

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.880
they've got this project,
they've got all this

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.570
imagery being created,
and they're not sure if

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.280
people are going to accept it.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.040
So the first thing they do is they
go to the screen and they say,

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.870
"Hey, I want to see this." And the first
thing I'm going to tell you when

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:47.220
you start creating content or you're
involved in a project is never,

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.040
ever show bad samples.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.000
Okay?

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.800
Only put out good work.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.250
I know it sounds kind of corny,
but it's very important because as

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:02.160
soon as we put the Learjet up there,
you know,

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.270
shot and rendered out in high res and
blue background and all nicely clean,

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:12.000
the acceptance rate jumped
up to 72% overnight.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.360
Just going from a plastic model with
a black background to the real thing

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:21.840
with blue increased by almost 50%
how well people responded to it.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:26.240
They did some interface changes,
they did some other cool things

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.700
with information about the artifact
as the artifact would rotate,

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:35.300
and it jumped up to 84%. You know,
anything above 70% is

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.960
acceptable to a museum,
and when you hit 80, they're like grins.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.720
They're really happy with you.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:44.320
So I'm always telling people if
you're going to put out samples,

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:49.280
even if it's just for a test,
never put out anything but your best.

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:52.230
Remember that whatever you
put out there represents you.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.120
And if you're willing to put out crap,
then that -- sorry,

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.970
that's my technical term for it.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.520
If you're willing to put
out substandard work,

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.710
because this is a
family computer company,

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:05.360
then, you know,
that'll be the perception of

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.260
the clientele and the public.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.590
your best foot forward.

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.240
I have a lot of people asking
me about digital cameras.

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.580
What's the best digital camera to use?

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.880
And I tell them, yes.

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.770
Whatever you can afford.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.880
Whatever you need.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.800
You know, they're all concerned about
usually the wrong things.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.380
You know, they want to know, like,
how many pixels does it have,

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.900
and this and that.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:34.510
And you know what?

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.900
It's really based on
what the client needs.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.740
The client's needs,
and I'll throw in another thing,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.880
also what, how should I phrase it now,
what you use as a sales tool.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:50.850
Part of my sales tool when I talk to a
museum is I shoot all high resolution.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.900
You're going to have the highest
quality possible from a digital camera.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:00.050
And if you've got 18 shots,
that means you've got 18 12 by 14 inch

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.900
prints that you can make of the interior.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.900
So for a Smithsonian or a museum,
they're all about the quality.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.880
The resolution.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.720
So I need a high end camera.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:13.690
I have another client that
does bathroom remodeling.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.900
Okay.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.900
So what am I dealing with?

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.560
White porcelain.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.900
Do you think I have a lot
of detail I need to show?

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.300
So if I was just shooting
that all the time,

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.060
then really all I need to
worry about is an acceptable

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.900
quality of image resolution.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.900
You know, how sharp it looks.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.900
But probably more as far as tonal range.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.900
How much white to black it can be.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.900
How much color it can show.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.960
I may be looking at an entirely different
camera than say like a Canon 1DS,

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.900
which is more for the resolution
than it is for maybe the tone range.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:53.900
So my standard response to people is
to try out several different cameras.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.900
You know, manufacturers want to make sure
that you're happy because there's,

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.900
you know, you can go out and say
I really love this camera.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.430
You know, and you'll tell all
your friends and maybe,

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:04.850
you know,
one or two people will listen to you.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.900
But you know what?

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.900
If you buy a camera that
you're displeased with,

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.900
not only will you tell all
your friends you're not happy,

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.900
you'll tell anybody that will
listen that you're not happy.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.750
And a manufacturer doesn't
want to lose sales.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.900
So he wants you to
make sure you're happy.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.450
So I tell people go to a camera shop,
try out the different cameras,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.900
see about the software,
get on a couple of lists,

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:23.900
see what people think.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:28.900
But it really should be what you are
used to and then what you accept.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.900
I love high-end stereos.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.900
I'm really big into music.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.900
I bartered for a pair
of $12,000 speakers.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.770
I mean,
there's really cool stereo system.

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:40.810
And, you know, stereo audio files,
we even test out cables.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.710
Anything more than $50
is real money to me.

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.900
Hell, now, sorry.

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.810
Right now, anything more than $10
is real money to me.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:49.870
So I try out everything.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.900
So even on the cameras and computers.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.900
You know, they want you to be happy,
so go out and try it.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.900
Make sure you get the right
product for what you need.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:02.820
By the way, compact flash cards,
they're getting bigger and bigger.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.010
Now we have companies
making 8-gigabyte cards.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:06.960
It's great.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.670
I love having all that storage.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:13.690
The problem is that I've been
in a field where I've dropped

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.680
a memory card and lost it.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.700
It was from 10,000 feet, but that's okay.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.690
One day I'll find that right field.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:24.530
I tend to use smaller cards,
maybe like 1-gig cards,

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.570
and swap them around.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.700
I never shoot all to one card.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:30.700
I keep moving the cards in and out.

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.170
Just so that if one goes bad,
I'm not replacing all the data.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.700
I'm only replacing a small portion of it.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:41.700
Just another little tip: cataloging.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:48.230
My God,
cataloging is a whole separate class.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:54.840
So, at least keep a simple database of
how you have your stuff organized.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.600
Remember, we have a lot of images.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.880
We have our catalogs
all broken out by days,

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:05.200
by artifact numbers, catalog numbers,
by colors.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.200
We also have to do searches by color.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:14.080
Photoshop CS makes it really easy to
put that data in there in batches so

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.200
you can get through it really quick.

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.120
Anything that saves me time.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:24.930
My business philosophy, my billing,
is a little different

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.200
than a lot of people.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.200
How many photographers are in the room?

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.040
Two?

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.200
Three?

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.160
Okay.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.060
Four?

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.100
How many web developers?

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.150
Okay, good crowd.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.200
Put your hands down.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.200
How many just use me as an
excuse to get out of work today?

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.060
There we go.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:49.210
So, my business philosophy is that
the first thing you do wrong is

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:53.530
they'll come to you and they'll say,
"How much will this cost and how long

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:57.200
will it take?" And you'll answer them,
and you'll answer them pretty reasonably.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.200
But that's a big mistake.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.190
You'll come to me and say, "Dennis,
I want you to do this project.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:02.890
How much is it?

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.200
How long will it take?"
I'll figure 10 hours.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.130
I want to make $150 an hour.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:08.180
It's $1,500.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.070
I'll tell you $1,500.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.200
And you'll be trying
to look for a number.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.760
Well,
if I gave you 10 hours at $150 an hour,

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.050
right, you're going to say, "Well,
can't you do it in eight?"

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.200
I don't have budget for 10.

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:21.200
Could you do it in eight?

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:24.810
You've already started giving away
part of your negotiation by giving

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.200
them numbers that they can shave.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.080
All right?

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.140
So, in my head,
I'm doing the calculations.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.090
10 hours, I want to make $150 an hour.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.200
It's $1,500.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.200
So, I put out $1,500.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:36.200
Okay?

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.200
It's really tough to do that.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:37.200
Okay?

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.720
It's really tough for the U.S.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.050
government to deal with that.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:43.290
You know,
they are so -- they actually want to

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:45.170
know what your markup is per hour.

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:48.200
You know, so it's alien to them.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.120
But the flip side is, for me,
it was a great business model

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.200
because I give you a price of $1,500.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.200
What's my goal now?

00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:00.200
I want to get through
that job as fast as I can.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.200
If I can do that job in
seven hours instead of 10,

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.200
look at how much more profit I make.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.050
Now, I had this big discussion
with this -- you know,

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:11.320
Smithsonian and part of the government,
and there's this

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:16.160
organization called Ocon,
office contracts and -- anyway.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.500
And you know, they want to know the
hours and stuff like that.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.300
I said, you know what?

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:21.660
I'm giving you the per unit price.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.770
What are you worried about?

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.580
And they're like, well,
we want to... I'm like, no, no.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.940
If I get done faster,
and they're like thinking, well,

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.330
then we're overpaying you.

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.880
No, you're not overpaying me.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.120
Look at it this way.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.880
You have so many personnel assigned
to me to work on that project.

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:37.920
If I get done faster,
look at all the money you're saving, too.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.340
Look at my incentive.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.440
If I can finish off faster,
I'm saving money.

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.860
I'm saving expenses.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.750
I'm making more money.

00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:46.060
But I'm saving you money, too.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:47.590
Let's look at your model.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.170
You want to pay me per hour.

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:51.710
What incentive is that
for me to get done fast?

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.780
You know, I want to spend an extra
week working for you.

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.590
You know, and that means that you'll have
X amount of employees and X amount

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:01.740
of insurance and X amount of this
and that all tagged into that,

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.200
too.

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:06.190
So for that model,
it took me a while to get the government,

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.160
at least with me,
to accept the fact of like, oh, yeah,

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:15.430
we could save money if we just pay per
unit as opposed to paying per hour.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.200
So all my stuff is per units.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.100
You know, in my head,
I know how many hours it'll

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:22.180
take and what I want to make,
and I know what the government will pay.

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:25.830
But, you know,
as far as what I show them on paper is,

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:27.810
you know, a per unit price.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.350
Okay, cataloging.

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.850
This is the current way we're doing it.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.870
There's our weights taped down to
the floor at all the 10 degrees.

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.140
This is what we call a beauty shot.

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:44.100
It hasn't gone into Photoshop yet
for retouch or anything,

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.040
but it just shows you the lines.

00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:50.200
We're suspending the
artifact from the ceiling.

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:54.800
There's actually special
clamps bolted onto the I-beams.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:59.030
They actually, Smithsonian knows how much
each beam can support,

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.300
you know,
because when you're the government,

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.800
you have lots of time.

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:07.630
And so we know what our
weight limits is as far as

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.680
I'm using strobes.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.900
I'm bouncing them up into the ceiling.

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:18.300
The ceiling was painted white
and then silver on the sides.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.300
We did that.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.300
They didn't do that.

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:24.810
So that way I could bounce the light up
and then have it come down as opposed to

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.210
building a big softbox or light modifier.

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.300
It allowed me to get a nice soft light.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:35.170
You may be wondering about the glare,
but I'll show you an image in a minute.

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:37.840
Sealy Posturepedic Mattresses.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:43.500
Their factory is two blocks away from
the museum where I work on this stuff.

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.300
So we get free mattresses all the time.

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:49.500
So they use them to protect the artifact.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.920
So, you know, like, if that, you know,
ever broke, you know,

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.500
that artifact is only going to fall like
a foot and a half down into a mattress.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.500
So that's why that's there.

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:03.260
This is a German glider bomb.

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:08.350
It would be on a large aircraft,
two prop job.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.500
They would get close to the target.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.000
They would release it,
and it could glide up to 50

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.330
miles towards its target.

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.490
So it has a little radio homing beam,
that type of thing.

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500
It's extremely rare.

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.890
So the Smithsonian,
one of the things they do is

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.490
they publish a lot of books.

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.280
They do a lot of books.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.500
So part of all this imagery I'm creating
is going to be used in the museum.

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.500
And I'm going to be using
this image in the books.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:35.430
So here's that same shot that's
appearing in a book about this artifact.

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.500
You know, so all we did was drop
out the background.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.660
And then in Photoshop there's a real,
you know, two second technique for

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.500
darkening where that glare was.

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.500
And there's the artifact.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.500
It looks great.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.500
So 31 megabyte file.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:53.300
I tend to shoot as close to the
artifact as possible because I can

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.270
always put in extra background.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.500
Okay.

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.500
We use this particular blue
because it's real easy.

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:02.500
For the Smithsonian to key in,
they have some weird applications

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.500
to key into the blue and
drop it out if they want.

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:08.500
So a lot of that stuff.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:14.660
Okay, so some of the things the
Smithsonian does with the work.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.390
Kiosk, we talked about the kiosk.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.520
Plasma displays, they have,
that's a big thing in museums.

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.770
Also, what you need to remember if you're
looking at creating content is

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.480
you have to make a leap of faith,
but think museum and then

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.780
all think commercial.

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:34.340
You know, stores, you know,
other entities, stuff like that.

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:39.650
So a lot of plasma displays going into
museums right now to display content.

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.720
So the kiosk here actually,
in the final rev,

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:51.300
will have the kiosk and then two large
flat panel 42-inch plasma displays.

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:54.990
As the person starts
moving around on the kiosk,

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:58.280
the two flat panels will mirror that.

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.600
So that, you know,
those 330,000 people that come in per

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.220
month can get through all that content.

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:08.100
Right now,
part of the problems are is that

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:12.060
they can't put in enough kiosks
to handle that type of volume,

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:14.060
especially at the main museum.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:18.350
So some of the things that we're
doing is working on where you could

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:22.540
have sections on the web you would
view so much it would time out.

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:25.700
And then it would give you a web
URL that you could go back to.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.720
We actually have more sophisticated
stuff with smart cards,

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:35.720
but then the government has these, like,
knowledge, you know, we can't, you know,

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.290
like on the bottom of the websites.

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:39.330
You know, none of this will be
used for anything else.

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:42.900
So they figure if we don't ask for it,
then we have no problems.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.880
It's always easier to say no.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.940
That's what I've learned in government.

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.470
So final thing is handhelds.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.400
So I'll show you this.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.600
I don't know if you can -- can
you see this okay a little bit?

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.780
Afterwards, if you should want to see it,
I'll show you.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.920
If you want to see it, come on up.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.560
This is an iPack,
and it has a little screen on it.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.460
It's like a little radar screen,
and it's rotating around,

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.760
and there's airplanes
on here for sections.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.590
So I can go in.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:12.540
Click on an airplane.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.800
Now I have a little screen.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.300
I'm sorry, this is so tough.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.420
I have a little screen
with other pictures,

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.790
and then I can click on those pictures,
and then I can pull up the stats,

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.300
so I have all this information.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.780
We also have QuickTime movies,
the regular movies playing on this,

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.300
and we also have
QuickTime VR playing back on this.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.210
So when you go to a museum,
you remember you used to rent

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.300
the headsets with the narration?

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.300
Now you rent these.

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:43.970
They're going to rent them out at $9.95.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.300
They're trying to get
down to the $5 mark,

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.300
but it's just not going to work.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:52.720
So $9.95, you rent this,
and you do your whole tour through the

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.110
Smithsonian on your handheld device.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.050
Now there's like a picture,
it's a map with the outlines

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.210
of the airplanes you can click.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:07.300
This actually goes into
a larger plastic box.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.300
They take your credit card.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.170
When you come in,
you take the credit card.

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:16.300
It's authorized for the
value of the IPAC at list.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.300
So that if you should walk out with it,
the museum's making a profit.

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:23.940
And you do your little tour,
and then when you're done,

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.300
you turn this back in.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:29.160
They take off the authorization,
or they'll leave the $19 on it.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.300
So it's pretty cool.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:35.250
This is considered the
latest thing in museum tours.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.300
Museums in Europe are doing it.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:42.890
Smithsonian is going to deploy, I think,
5,000 of these throughout

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:44.300
the Smithsonian.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:50.300
So the thing I wanted to bring up is
5,000 of these things all need content.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.300
You know, I love these things,
because it needs pictures.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.300
They found out that people really
don't like renting these with text.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.300
They like renting them with pictures
and VR and all that good stuff.

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.300
So I do a lot of work now getting
ready for handheld devices.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.130
for handheld devices.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.000
Okay, so we're going to do a little tour.

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:16.320
You have our lovely and
talented Apple representative.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.940
It's going to pass
around some 3D glasses.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.560
So she'll pass those around.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:38.040
I think we should have enough.

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:42.560
Oh, I'm sorry,
the cyan should go to the right.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.920
So, hand to the right,
can you see that there?

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:46.920
Okay.

01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.630
I need to launch iPhoto.

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:00.650
Can we switch to my screen?

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.650
So iPhoto is this really cool,
great tool because I have a lot

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:12.400
of people who come to the museum
and they need a little slideshow

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400
for a PowerPoint presentation.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.400
And I drop the pictures in here
and then I'll just tell them,

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.290
"Okay, tell me how long the
movie," and stuff like that.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.400
So I'll put something like
this together for them.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:24.400
Sound?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.400
Do we have sound?

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.400
I'm hoping this is going to work.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.400
Okay.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:54.140
♪ ♪ Is it working?

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:55.440
I'll take a picture of
you with the glasses.

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.820
I go to presentations all the time.

01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:00.690
I think creative people
have a thirst for knowledge.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:05.700
I was involved in a survey
recently where the people asked,

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.720
I had like three or four
psychologists interviewing me,

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.700
and they're doing a study on creativity.

01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:14.990
And they asked me,
"What's creativity to you?" I said,

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.630
"Creativity." And I had
to think about it.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.610
I responded, "It's the application of
knowledge." Think about it.

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:24.700
You've all been in the
office and somebody will say,

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.960
"You know, that's a really creative
use you found for that." So,

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.350
you know, Apple used to have this saying,
"Knowledge is power." And to me,

01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:35.690
creativity is the
application of that power.

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:39.000
So, you know, we have to

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.440
Look at different ways that
we can use the applications.

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:49.010
I went to a presentation on –
can I have my slides back please?

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.700
Thank you.

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:55.450
I went to a presentation years
ago on digital photography

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.880
by another photographer.

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:00.540
And at the end he did
this whole thing on 3D.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:03.490
And I was like, wow, that's really cool.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.140
So afterwards I went up and
I talked to him and I said,

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:06.920
how did you do that?

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.130
And he's like, well,
I'm not going to tell you.

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:11.520
I was like, what do you mean you're
not going to tell me?

01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.750
Well, if I tell you,
you'll want to do it.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.980
I was like, well, yeah.

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:22.170
So I've made it kind of like my quest
to tell everyone I know how to do this.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.420
So if you should be
interested in how to do it,

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.000
it's super easy if you have like
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.

01:09:30.150 --> 01:09:32.000
You take two photographs.

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:35.900
You take two photographs
about four inches apart.

01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:37.400
Okay?

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.260
So take one shot,
move the camera over to the

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.000
other eyeball or slide it over.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.500
I actually have a little
piece I made up to do this.

01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:46.000
Take the second shot.

01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:50.280
Open them up in like Photoshop Elements,
Photoshop, CS, whatever.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.500
Take the red channel, you know,
go into channels, select the red channel,

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.800
copy it.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.520
Paste it into the red channel
of the opposite image.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.900
And that creates the offset.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.000
That's how easy it is to do it.

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:06.670
So if you ever go to a presentation on 3D
and the guy won't tell you how to do it,

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:07.780
say, "I know.

01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:09.380
Dennis told me."

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:14.640
250 million downloads.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.850
So I bring this up because, you know,
part of my business depends on QuickTime.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:25.600
And so I want to see that number
as large as we possibly can get it.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.860
One of the reasons why I like
these big numbers is this:

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:31.920
think about if you create content.

01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:34.240
If you create content,
and especially if you're

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.530
selling something,
I've actually sold several

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.190
things over the internet,
and I've had the 1% rule work.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.200
So I've sold training CDs,
I've sold CDs of VR,

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.430
and I've sold 1% to my database.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.630
So 250 million times 1%.
That's a lot of numbers.

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:56.320
That's a lot of sales.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:00.480
Right now we're creating a
CD-ROM for a Smithsonian of my VR,

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.510
and we're going to sell
it at the Smithsonian.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.630
You'll take the tour,
you'll get all excited, you know,

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:06.720
you'll want to buy.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.390
So let me run the numbers for you.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.760
330,000 visitors per month.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.110
1%. Okay?

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.680
At $20 a CD.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.340
That's almost like real money there.

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:20.680
You know,
in a year that can be like a quarter

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.700
of a million to half a million dollars
in sales of just a CD of VR images.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.590
So I'm real excited when
I hear Apple saying about,

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.160
like, you know, we're selling more.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.040
Apple's empowered me to
do a lot of creative work.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.220
I'm a big fan of creative things,
and I use creativity as my sales tool.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.710
How can I compete against
another photographer?

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:44.640
Well, first off,
there isn't a better photographer

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.560
in the room than myself.

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.490
So now that I've got all
the photographers alienated.

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.630
But that's my physique,
that's my attitude.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.560
I'm really good.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.830
So if I don't get the job,
I never say lose,

01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:59.720
if I don't get the work,
it wasn't because you

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:01.000
were better than me.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.150
It was because your style,
the way you create the content,

01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:07.330
the way you shoot the
pictures fits that campaign,

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:08.460
fits that ad campaign.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.860
When I was shooting cars,
that's the way I looked at.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.960
My style, and I used to get paranoid.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.330
I'd have somebody call me up and say,
"Yeah,

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:19.610
we're interested in you because you have
this classic style." I was like paranoid.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:20.480
I was pigeonholed.

01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:22.760
I'll be the classic guy for life.

01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:23.200
Right?

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.250
So I started looking
ways to reinvent myself.

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:30.660
And one of the ways I could reinvent
myself was through my creativity.

01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:34.030
So I'm always looking on what
the latest technology is.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.360
I was doing DVDs with... Actually,
before Apple.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.360
Apple bought DVD Studio Pro.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.700
It was made by the
company that made Toast.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:46.320
And I was making DVDs way back when.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:49.660
Now, one of the other things that
you should think about is that

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:53.550
if you're going to make a sale,
usually the first or the last phone

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.920
call is the one that gets the job.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.210
Right?

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:59.220
And the odds are more for
the first than the last.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.800
And usually if it's the last,
it's because they were cheaper than you.

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:05.600
And you don't want to compete on price.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.720
Never compete on price.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.260
Always compete on quality.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.360
And results.

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:16.160
So I actually still have art
directors who call me up saying,

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.310
"Dennis, I saw this on the web.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.560
I don't know anything about it,
but it looks cool.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.680
You must know it because
you know everything about

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.750
technology." And I'm saying,
"Yeah, I've been doing it for months."

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.140
As I surf the web saying,
"What the hell is he

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.700
talking about?" Right?

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:34.720
But they called me first because
they know that I'm really

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.560
trying to push the envelope.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.160
I'm trying to be really creative.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.160
I have a new project.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.000
It's called the QuickTime Bug.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.160
So we picked up a Volkswagen Bug.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.060
I have several sponsors involved.

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:51.160
We actually have a URL,
the QuickTimeBug.us.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.160
By the way,
today if you should have gone to the web,

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.160
Macworld, they gave us booth space.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.250
They did a press release
specifically on the Bug,

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:04.160
and we're getting about
8,000 hits every half hour.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.160
The server's kind of like overloaded.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.060
So I'm kind of happy about that.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.060
In a, like, oh my god way.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.060
So we have the QuickTime Bug.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:17.060
We're going to be -- it's
going to be here at the show.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:17.940
It's being tuned.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.060
We're getting an XServe installed.

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.030
We have a touchscreen up front.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.040
It's going to be like
this big technology piece.

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:29.060
If any of you have, like,
associates involved in a mug,

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.680
I'm going to be crawling
-- or crawling -- traveling

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:35.000
around the United States doing
presentations on QuickTime.

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:37.960
I'd be happy to swing by your mug.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.950
My only rule is you fill up the tank
with gas and it can only hold 12 gallons.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.770
So it's not a big deal.

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:45.800
I'll be happy to do a
presentation for you.

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:49.850
While I'm traveling the countryside,
I'm going to be creating QuickTime and

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:51.900
QuickTime VR of really unique things.

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:53.860
I've already set up with
the Forest Preserve.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.960
I'm going to be shooting
VR of the Statue of Liberty.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.100
The Statue of Liberty is closed,
but you'll be able to do a

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.960
virtual tour of the inside.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.960
We actually have a government helicopter.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.810
We worked it out.

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:07.860
So we're going to try to make
an object movie of the outside.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:11.860
The Pueblo Indians, you know,
they have those ruins.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.860
The Pueblo Indians live in those bluffs.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.740
So that's on the list to shoot.

01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:21.790
General Electric is having me
shoot a train engine interior.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.910
I photographed some actual -- you know,
have you ever wondered what

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:25.860
the hell those cabs look like?

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:27.860
You know, the big truck drivers.

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:28.860
You see them driving.

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.810
What's it look like inside of those?

01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:33.820
So I have some VR of one of
the interiors of a truck.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.850
It's pretty interesting in there,
actually.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.760
So they got their TV, their fridge.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760
Their bed right there.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.760
It's hilarious.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:44.760
So we're creating a lot of content of
places that you wouldn't normally go.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.590
We're going to be showing
it at the website.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:49.760
I have to phrase it this way
because of legal parameters.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.780
At the end of the tour,
the content will be turned

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.360
over to a national museum,
which will then put it on

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.760
a two-year traveling show.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:03.580
So you'll be able to visit 90 different
locations throughout the United States.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:07.660
It will be the first time that they have
ever done an all electronic display.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.660
So it's kind of cool.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.660
We're setting a lot of firsts with it.

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.660
So that's a quick time bug.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:17.760
I'm still shooting at the Smithsonian,
but our project's kind of like gone

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.140
into this when they're ready for
me to shoot with X amount of stuff,

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:21.570
I go in and shoot.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.610
When they're not,
then I'm free to do whatever.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.610
So I'm going to drive around for a bit.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:38.400
A little bit.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:38.400
We'll be hitting all the
spots across the country.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:38.400
So, it'll take us about a year.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:38.400
So, at the end,
then we'll be donating all the stuff.

01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:41.190
Okay, so I have two minutes left.

01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:42.150
I'm right on time.

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:45.400
So, last year I had three
most important things,

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.530
but now that I've got more experience
dealing with the government,

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.400
I have a couple things I added.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.400
So, let's talk about the five things
that you should probably remember.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400
Perseverance.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.400
You know,
no job ever comes easy that's worth it,

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.240
at least for me.

01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:04.700
So, I spent a lot of time
chasing after Smithsonian.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.120
It cost me about $10,000 to $20,000
in like a year to a year and a half,

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.480
just going back to
Smithsonian all the time,

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.620
doing demonstrations, presentations,
a whole bunch of things that I had to

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.400
do to prove that I was really good.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.380
And I really wanted that job,
so I really went after it.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.340
So, anything you do that's worthwhile
is going to take some effort.

01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:29.130
So, perseverance,
probably my most important thing.

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:31.300
Thinking outside the box.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.080
One of the cool things that's
going to happen at the end of this

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.400
year is that the Smithsonian is
going to have an art show of my VR.

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:40.780
We can make large panoramic prints.

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:44.320
Remember that first slide where you
saw the interior of the Enola Gay?

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.400
They're taking a bunch of that imagery,
since I do it all in high res,

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.400
and they're making them into prints.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:54.400
They'll be about 30 inches tall
and about 7 to 8 feet wide.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.860
They're doing about 20 of those,
and they're going to do

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.400
an art showing of it.

01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:01.400
And then it's going to become
part of the museum's collection.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.400
So, you know, I'm just a photographer.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.400
I'm in the Smithsonian.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.400
This is really cool.

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.990
So, that type of thing.

01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:13.420
So, thinking outside the box,
new ways to use the same content.

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:16.580
Whatever you're charging,
it ain't going to be enough.

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:20.200
You can never recoup all the
expense and knowledge and stuff.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.420
Somebody has to pay you for
being up at 3 o'clock in the

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:26.960
morning trying to figure out,
"How am I going to fix this?"

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.900
So my dad was an accountant.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.600
He used to tell me,
"Whatever you think you should charge,

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:35.370
I want you to double it." So whatever
you think you should be charging,

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:36.400
you should double it.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.510
Now, there's this other
thing called cash flow.

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.880
I need X amount of money going
through the bank account so I can

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:44.890
pay my bills or pay the electric.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.580
So I need a certain amount of cash flow.

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:50.120
So I'll do barters when it makes sense.

01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:53.410
And sometimes the barters
are things as simple as,

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.710
"Could you put my name and
link on your website?" That has

01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.890
an advertising value to me.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.580
So I'm constantly looking for
ways to make sure I get the work,

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.350
get some cash,
but also have some extra exposure.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.160
Contracts are always
open to interpretation.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.000
This is what I've learned
from the government.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.420
So make sure that you get everything
that you can in writing and get as close

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.040
to what you should have as possible.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.390
Okay, because somebody's going to say,
well, we didn't think that meant that.

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:29.930
Right,
we thought it meant that over there.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.150
So always make sure that you
can get as much information

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.480
into your contract as possible.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.520
And nothing is ever as easy as I thought.

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.000
I always run into issues.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.800
I always run into roadblocks.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:47.340
But the flip side is the way I look at
it is that I love being a photographer.

01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.470
I love what I do,
and people pay me for it.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.210
What better life can I have?

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:57.180
I do something that I enjoy,
and I haven't worked a day in my life.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:02.530
So what I can pass on to you there is
that you really have to enjoy or you

01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:05.390
really need to love what you're doing
because you're going to have plenty

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:10.110
of times where you're going to start
wondering what the heck am I doing here?

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.040
Okay, so just another thought.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.240
So I want to thank you for coming.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.810
I'm glad that you hung in
there through my presentation.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.530
And we're going to have a Q&A.
