00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.940
Good morning.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.120
Thanks for waking up with us
this morning and coming to

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.890
check out this great session.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.870
This is session number 711,
Enhanced Learning with QuickTime.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.680
And I'm very happy to
introduce our speaker.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.200
He was one of the most highly
critically acclaimed speakers last year.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.660
So it was a no-brainer
to invite him back.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.400
So I'd like to introduce
to you David Egbert.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:04:04.600
[Transcript missing]

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.120
Okay, here we go.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.870
Now this is an oldie but a goodie,
probably about four years

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.740
old that we created.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.440
It's been remodified here
using some modern tools.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.870
This is a picture of Mona Lisa, right?

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.860
And did you know that the
painter of the Mona Lisa,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.950
Leonardo da Vinci,
let's get it going here, there we go.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.110
Look at that resemblance.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.590
Isn't that kind of spooky?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.820
A professor requested this,
and originally we did this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.060
in another authoring tool,
but this is a great example of

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.320
being able to compare and contrast,
right?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.830
You've got two images and
you want to compare them.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.240
Wow, this is great.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.970
So we brought the
Mona Lisa into Photoshop,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.980
put Leonardo da Vinci right on top,
saved about as two images,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.010
brought it into iPhoto,
and saved it out as a QuickTime movie.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.440
That allowed us to put
that transition in there.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.600
So it was really easy
to be able to do this.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.590
Now, the professor loves this
because in the past,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.270
the professor had transparencies, right?

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.460
He's flipping the
transparencies in and out,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.440
trying to get it to line up or whatever.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.570
It just didn't work right.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.000
But now, with the projector in the
classroom and the computer,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.800
they can pull this up and
use it in the classroom.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.440
The professor also has
this in his online course,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.040
so the students can go back and
kind of fool around with it as well.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.790
So, just a quick and easy way
to be able to compare and

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.370
contrast two different images.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.500
Here's something a
little bit more advanced.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.620
This was done for a cinematography
class where they wanted to show the

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.540
students the difference between an
unrestored and a restored video clip.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.100
There we go.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.200
So there's the unrestored version.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.400
If we click this button,
we get the restored version.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.000
If you click back here,
we get the old version, right?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.890
This is something
QuickTime does extremely well,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.140
and that is the ability
to swap tracks out,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.650
video tracks, audio tracks.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.020
It's really easy to do this inside
of some of the authoring tools

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.660
that are available for QuickTime.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.130
This is really hard to
do in other technologies,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.900
especially the fact that
when you click that button,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.460
it's syncing.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.340
It's frame-level accuracy syncing.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.990
It's swapping out those
tracks right at the frame.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.980
It's great.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.840
So let's look at another example.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.460
Here's another one.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.080
A professor brought in a series
of images that they had taken.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.720
"We've been shooting some flames.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.310
Now each one of those quadrants,
they've added a little bit

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.000
different property to the flame.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.980
And they wanted to be able to analyze
all the flames at the same time.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.360
So what we did here is that
these are all image sequences,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.000
right?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.090
So we brought in each,
created a separate movie

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.140
for each one of those,
and then we combined

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.000
all the movies together,
right?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.470
And now they're playing
together with frame-accurate

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.970
synchronicity all together.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.430
Now we added a little twist to this.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.150
They also wanted to be able to take
this little square here and move

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.350
it around and analyze just that
specific portion of that little flame,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.000
right?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.010
So after we actually
created most of that,

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.000
we created the frames
with QuickTime Player Pro.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.190
We added a little time code track
so they could stop the clip.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.330
At any point and just
analyze that still frame.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.030
And then we brought in the live stage
to be able to add the interactivity.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.920
That we could move around that
little square so they could analyze

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.250
a specific portion of that flame.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.540
Not terribly tough as far as
the authoring is concerned.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.400
Let's move on.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.070
Here's a digitized film strip.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.040
We've got all kinds of film strips,
you know, with the audio cassettes

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.640
in our libraries.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.280
This one, let's bring it up.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.900
There we go.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.150
This one's in Russian.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.000
And the students were required
to check out the film strip and

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.940
the cassette tape from our LRC.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.460
And this thing was
deteriorating really fast.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.930
So they wanted to archive it and
just save the original version

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.460
and make this available digitally.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.500
We created this.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.480
We digitized it.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.690
We scanned the slides.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.540
We digitized the cassette and put this
together with QuickTime Player Pro.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.520
It wasn't terribly tough.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
In fact,
I'll show you how to do this today.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.060
Now there were some copyright
issues and things like that.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.580
And fortunately on our campus we have
a copyright and licensing office.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.600
So we don't have to worry
about the copyright issues.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600
They do.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.960
So once it's cleared,
we have the go ahead to go ahead

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.580
and digitize these materials.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600
So this is a great example of
being able to repurpose materials.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.750
And make it available in digital
form so that the originals

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.600
will be archived and safe.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.690
That was another great example
also of language learning.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.110
You've got to learn foreign languages,
you've got to listen

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.210
and you've got to know,
listen to the native voice.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.420
Here's another language learning example.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.310
This is another oldie.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.700
This is about four years old.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.720
Here's a video clip that has,
this is kind of like a DVD, right?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.030
You've got the French audio,
you've got...

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.470
The English audio.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.990
And again, you can swap the tracks at any
time while you're viewing the clip.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:56.530
What a great way to be able
to learn a foreign language,

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.490
at least starting out
learning a foreign language.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.010
You can flip through the tracks.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.670
There's also an English subtitle.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.900
You can turn the subtitle
off if you want or not.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.410
So you can listen to the
French and read the English.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:13.250
Try to get that going or
listen to the English audio.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.360
Just another thing that
QuickTime does extremely well,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.400
and that is that swapping of the tracks.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.270
Okay,
here's another really simple example.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.910
The professor,
this is an entry level class,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.400
and the professor was tired of
bringing the students into the lab.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.410
Every single class,
putting that steel rod in that machine

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.620
and showing the students how that gets
stretched and what's going on here.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.760
So what we did is we recorded
the experiment and added a

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.160
little flash track down here that
shows what the meters are doing.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.040
This is great because this frees
up the lab for the higher level

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.050
classes for their experiments,
right?

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.260
And it still gives the students
the ability to kind of see

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.300
what's going on with the steel.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.300
The professor uses this in the classroom.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.450
And again,
makes that available in his online

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.100
course so the students can check
it out and review it later on.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.100
Another great,
pretty simple way to create

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.070
an instructional object.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.240
Okay.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.740
Alright,
this was done for another professor.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.800
This is using,
this professor wanted to combine

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.310
assessment with the video clips.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.600
I kind of wanted to help the students
a little bit in helping to retain

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.720
some of the information they did.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.600
So what we did is we created,
this is just a QuickTime movie

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.560
with an href track at the very end.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.120
So if you skip to the very end.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.970
It has an href track that
takes you to a question,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.310
an assessment piece, right?

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.100
Now this is self-assessment.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.100
The student just comes in here
and can check their answers.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.040
But nonetheless,
this is another technique that

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.570
you can use to help your students,
help them comprehend the

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.590
materials that you're doing.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.770
This is kind of a template that
we created for them and then

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.230
the professor went and took this
and created a whole website.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.660
Again, if I skip to the end here,
there's just a little href

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.310
track that at the very end takes
you to an assessment piece.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.960
Again, not very difficult to do and
we'll show you how to create href

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.840
tracks here in just a minute.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.430
Alright,
here's another fun little example.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.530
This one's 24 kilobytes.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.670
It's a little drill and practice.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.660
Computers are great for drill and
practice because they never get tired,

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.160
right?

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.260
So sometimes they call it drill and kill.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:44.920
So here, let's see,
I'm supposed to find an interval here.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.640
Doggone it.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.590
Let's see here.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.570
Let's get one right.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.810
What's cool about this is that it
leverages the QuickTime instruments,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.040
kind of the MIDI playback
that's inside of QuickTime,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.960
so it's extremely lightweight.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.940
And it has all kinds of potential.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.910
We've got some really interesting
examples in testing with

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.530
music and things like that.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.120
This one also,
you can test the interval as you...

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.060
Again,
this was done with Live Stage and it

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.000
leverages those QuickTime instruments,
which makes it really lightweight.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.730
So the students can just drill
and kill until the cows come home.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.280
Alright, here's another one.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.320
This one's a listening guide.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.870
Originally this was done in Flash.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.360
I think it was like Flash 2 or something,
Flash 3.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.050
But we brought it into
QuickTime because it seemed,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.140
at the time, it seemed to perform
just a little bit better.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.300
So what this is, is a listening guide,
right?

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.990
We've got the Beethoven's
Fifth going in the background.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.540
We've got some visual information.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.160
It's also interactive,
so if you want to just

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.820
skip to the French horns.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.500
Terrific.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.160
Oh, let's see,
what's the CODA sound like?

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.300
The professor can use
this in the classroom,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:01.800
right?

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.560
And in the past, the students had a set
of CDs and the workbook,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:13.100
and they'd have to find the track on the
CD player and look in the right page and

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.500
kind of sync them up as they're learning.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.650
Now, we can do that all on the screen,
right?

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.560
And it's interactive,
so they can jump through,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.040
and you can use this in all
kinds of different ways.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.140
Again,
pretty easy to put together in Flash.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.040
Here's another one.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.270
Video, of course,
is great for performance analysis.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.580
Can you hear that?

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:38.780
No?

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.840
"Performance analysis,
especially when a movement is involved,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.300
right?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.660
So what we have here is the
professor just sitting by the

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:52.170
camera with the microphone,
videotaping the student."

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.870
Giving some feedback as they're dancing.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.660
This is great because the
professor really loves this.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.820
And the technology has come down now that
we don't even have to do anything now.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.720
The professor knows the whole workflow.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.820
Has students help him
shoot the video clips.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.820
In fact, every, of course the course is
broken up into units.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.990
And every single unit,
the end of the unit,

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.040
every single student in the
class gets some video feedback.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.340
And the students love that.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.740
They can go through and review
that clip multiple times.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.020
And he'll lead us on the fourth.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.040
And it just makes it a little bit more
convenient for the student as well.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.800
All the video clips are up
online on the course site.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.170
And a great simple,
it's really not that high tech,

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:41.090
he's just sitting by the camera
offering feedback as they're dancing.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.830
Great example of kind of a low
threshold technology that you can use.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.570
Okay, let's see, what else we got?

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.780
Okay, time lapse photography is also
kind of a fun thing you can do.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.950
Turn that down a little bit.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.740
Of course this is really easy
to do with QuickTime Player Pro.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.590
There's an option in there that
you can import an image sequence.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.950
After we did this, we thought,
the next rev what we're going to

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.920
do is actually put the times in
there and maybe add a chapter track

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.130
or something that you could kind
of jump through specific times.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.760
All kinds of interesting things there.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.170
Okay, so we've kind of got a broad range.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.440
Now let me show you some presentations.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.100
This next presentation was done in Smile.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.920
And what we've done is basically,
let's see here,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.000
open it up in QuickTime player.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.790
This particular example is basically
synchronizing video with slides,

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.600
right?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.220
But we've added a few extra things.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.460
We've added a table of contents
and you can click on the table

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.580
of contents and it'll go.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.340
There we go.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.300
We also have a chapter track down here.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.990
You can jump to a specific
place with the chapter track.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.860
And we have a caption as well.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.600
And we'll show you how
to put this together.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.800
But the advantage of using Smile,
of course, is that it's a text-based

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.020
markup language.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.340
So editing this material is really easy.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.100
You just go in and change some of
the parameters in the text and those

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.280
things are immediately changed.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.930
This particular example also,
I'll make available at least the source

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.330
code for the Smile piece as a download.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.830
So if you want to check it
out and kind of see how all

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.090
those things are put together,
you'll have access to that as well.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.510
So there's an example with Smile.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.120
Here's the example of the
same thing as an href track,

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.720
using a href track and
using HTML frames instead.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.260
This is another advantage.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.160
Now if the professor has a lot of
HTML files that he wants synchronized,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.610
this is a great way to do that.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.320
I'm sorry that the audio
wasn't quite as loud.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.460
Again, you have a chapter track here,
so if you want to jump

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.360
to a specific piece.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.190
In order for you to make an
intelligent and informed decision...

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.900
This is extremely lightweight because
it's just HTML over in this frame here.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.150
It makes it so that you
can embed other materials,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.900
flash files, other movie clips,
those kinds of things there.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.900
And we'll show you how to put
together an HREF track presentation.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:29.700
Okay, now this,
I really want to show you this one.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.210
Sorry about the audio.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.590
This one is just one slide.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.700
It's just very short.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.610
And I want you to pay attention
to the quality of the video.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.100
I'm going to return to
this later in some slides.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.840
This particular professor really wanted
us to shoot him inside the classroom.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:54.170
And I think there's some
disadvantages to doing that.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.940
One is the lighting was
extremely challenging.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.660
The other one, we just missed it there,
but the student is actually

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.740
answering a question and at the
time we weren't set up with the

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.270
proper micing and things like that.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.060
This is kind of a
lessons learned example.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.800
Also with this particular piece,
the content,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:21.100
he's talking with the students, well,
I'll leave it to another slide.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.850
Another thing that it does,
measuring this is... So there's shooting

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.810
a professor inside the classroom.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.070
Let's contrast that with another...

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.790
This presentation was shot in a studio.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.400
The professor is reading a
script off a teleprompter.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.400
And there's some reasons
why we really prefer this.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.400
And we'll discuss it here shortly.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.590
This particular piece was
created in Live Stage.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.400
And one thing we really like
about Live Stage is the ability

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.400
to sync this right down inside
of a nice GUI to the frame level.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.180
And then talk about how to implement
those three elements in a good,

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.400
reasonable way.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.700
Again, we have a chapter track
down here so we can jump to

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.400
specific points in this piece.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400
Let's just go down to agenda.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.580
We're ready to move to the
fourth part of the preview,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.400
and that is the agenda statement.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.510
Now the agenda is just a
listing of the main points

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.700
that we're going to talk about.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.300
Okay, great.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.300
Let's see.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.260
Let's show you one more.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.140
This is kind of over the top.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.300
This particular example.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.750
What is statistics?

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.910
You know, I really hate to say it,
but this particular

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.840
professor is kind of boring.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.430
It's statistics, and the students were
getting really bored.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.640
So one thing that we did is that
we enabled multi-speed control,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.030
and the students love this.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.300
This is really cool because, you know,
our human minds,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.630
we can comprehend hundreds
of words per minute,

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.600
right?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.900
And yet, a lot of times we're
just stuck on one speed.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.160
So this allows the students
to actually get through more

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.960
material in the same time frame,
right?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.620
Another thing is you have to kind
of focus on what the person is

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.960
saying as they're speaking fast.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.680
So it helps the students kind
of focus in on the content.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.650
I'm going to show you
how to do this today.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.130
I think this is really important.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.690
I think you guys can really
benefit from what's going on here.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.370
So this is a quick example
of how you can do this.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.800
So you can publish a result.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.730
Now this was done in Live Stage 2,
and this has a few more, well,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.010
it has a table of contents again,
and some extra buttons and

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.800
links to different things.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.750
And this one actually later on in
the presentation has some areas

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.710
where the presentation stops,
and you have to answer a few questions,

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.800
and then continue on.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.490
There's all kinds of great things you
can do inside the video clip itself.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.550
Now,
one thing that I haven't mentioned yet is

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.780
that these slides here are still slides,
right?

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.790
We're not talking hundreds of frames.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.800
It's not a hundred frames per second.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.790
It's a still slide that lasts for,
you know, X amount of seconds.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.650
So these can be extremely lightweight.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.800
And of course,
it's all inside a QuickTime movie,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.810
so it makes it really easy to make this
thing portable and transport it around.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.810
We can throw this on a CD.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.580
We can throw it up on the web page.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.780
There's all kinds of interesting things
we can do once it's a QuickTime movie.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.960
So I think that ends the kind
of the dog and pony show here.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.290
Can we go back to slides, please?

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.860
Okay, here we go.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:49.200
So let's talk about why you would
want to create synchronized lectures.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.190
You know, it takes some time and
it takes some resources.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.100
So there better be some important
reasons why that we spend the amount

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.380
of time and money to do these things.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.120
Of course,
probably the number one thing is that

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.430
it supports different learning styles.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.500
Students out there
learn in different ways.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.590
Some learn more by listening.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.020
Some learn more by viewing visuals.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.590
Some learn more by just reading.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.270
And we want to be able to accommodate
those different learning styles.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.300
I think some of the things I showed
today help accommodate those things.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.250
It also involves more of the senses.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.300
There are studies that show that
when you involve more of the

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.720
senses in the learning process,
that the students retain

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.300
that information better.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.060
And definitely we're using a lot
of the senses when we're creating

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.580
these types of presentations.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.760
Probably the number one feedback
from the students is that it's

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.360
convenient and it's flexible.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.800
In the past, they've had to go to these
lectures at specific set times.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:50.110
Now, in a lot of our classes, what we do,
we do kind of a hybrid model where half,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.160
you know, the class met two times a week.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.570
Now, they only meet one time a week,
and that other class time,

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.400
they're assigned to go
through these lectures,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.500
the synchronized lectures.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.660
That allows them, at the other time that
they meet in class,

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.860
to do more active group-type activities,
more active learning-type

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.560
activities in the classroom.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.170
And students really love that.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.880
They can focus in on the content.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.780
A lot of times in the lectures,
when you're in a live lecture,

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.430
there are students that ask
really stupid questions and

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.120
hold the rest of the class back.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.200
Now, if there's a question,
a lot of times the students can

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.860
go and review those materials
again and again in the lecture.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.860
And if they still don't get it,
then they can ask the professor online.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:40.170
It kind of helps in time and not
wasting everybody's time in the lecture.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.220
Of course,
you can review multiple sections.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.680
You can jump straight to content.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.850
So if you have a phone call and then
you want to get back to your lesson,

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.800
you can jump straight to that lesson.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.910
And there are some ways that you
can make it searchable as well.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.090
Let's see, what else we got here?

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.200
So what kind of features
are we looking for?

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.860
We took a really hard look at
what kind of features we wanted

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.040
in a synchronized lecture.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.370
And we did a pretty good survey, I think,
even building some of our own little

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.710
things in different architectures.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.070
And this is kind of the
list that we came up with.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.150
It has to be cross-platform.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.100
All too often,
especially in our IT department,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.800
it's always Windows only.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.170
And they forget about that there's
other operating systems out there,

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.630
especially the Macintosh.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.870
And so we want to make this thing
as cross-platform as possible.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.750
And most of our users are using
either Windows or Macintosh on campus.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.590
And so QuickTime is just
a natural fit for that.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.920
We want full transport control.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.170
We want to be able to
stop that at any moment.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.380
We want to be able to
jump to specific points.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.280
We want full transport control.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.320
We want a nice table of contents
that the student can navigate so

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.290
they know exactly where they are and
they can jump to specific points.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.860
Of course,
we want the slides and the audio

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.500
and video to be synchronized.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.360
And we want the
synchronization to be tight.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.420
We don't want it after a second
after they're talking about

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.070
it to have materials show up.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.760
We want synchronicity.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.240
Compliant with accessibility standards.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.340
That's a very important
thing for us as well.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.770
Of course, you should be familiar with
Section 508 and also the

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.520
accessibility guidelines by the WC3.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.490
I'll have some more slides on that later.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.600
Let's see, we need a progress indicator.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.830
We need to let students know how long
this particular lecture is and where

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.740
they are in that particular lecture.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.310
We also need support.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.250
It needs to be flexible enough
that we can create a single

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.620
lesson or we can combine multiple
lessons in a single file.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.780
And probably most importantly,
we need options to be

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.270
able to deploy this.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.020
How many of you are familiar with Acacia?

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.600
Well, there's some patent suits going
on right now and some educational

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.190
institutions are being sued because
of these patent suits that have to

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.320
do with distributing video online.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.570
Now they're going after cell
phone and satellite companies and

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.500
all kinds of interesting things.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.730
It's going to be very
interesting how this plays out.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.090
But we want some options to be
able to bypass some of these

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.180
legal issues that are currently
available or are currently there.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.650
Here's some of the
things that we looked at.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.390
We looked at Breeze.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.660
Of course,
the architecture of Breeze is built off.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.760
It's built off of a flash
communication server.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760
It has all kinds of
really interesting things.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.310
But we found that we already
have a course management system,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.730
Blackboard, that we use on campus.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.760
That's kind of the direction we got.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.050
So there's all kinds of bells
and whistles that we really

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.760
don't need inside of Breeze.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.760
Plus,
the pricing is a little steep right now.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.760
And we wanted to look
for other solutions.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.760
Microsoft Producer is another
solution that's out there.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.760
But of course, it's Windows only.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.760
There was a lot of work on that.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.760
There was a short time frame where
Internet Explorer for Mac was compatible.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.760
But since that's gotten the axe,
it really is a non-solution for us.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:06.510
Empatica and also Flash MX 2004 are
other solutions that are out there.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.750
Incidentally, Flash is really pushing
hard their video solution.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:16.690
And we've kind of hit the wall
with some issues maybe you have too

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.760
with trying to synchronize things,
especially to the frame level.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.760
We ended up having to basically
keyframe every frame in the video clip

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.760
to be able to jump to specific points.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.760
Love to talk to anybody about
that if you want to afterwards.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.800
Alright, so why QuickTime?

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.660
Well, probably number one on
there is high quality.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.240
We have so much flexibility in
there that it really allows us

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.560
to kind of fine tune things.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.680
And we just noticed with
our Flash developers and the

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.500
QuickTime developers that we can
get actually a higher quality

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.170
out of the QuickTime stuff.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:58.750
It's of course a cross-platform
solution and I really like

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.180
the track-based architecture.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.580
That makes it so easy to be able
to put these kinds of materials

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.190
together and I'll show you
some development here shortly.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.810
Another great thing is that QuickTime has
frame-level synchronization.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:16.820
You can synchronize things down to the
frame and usually it's just rock solid.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.220
A long history of CD-ROM and web
support supports a single plug-in

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.750
instead of collection of products.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.540
That's very important to us.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.310
We really want to keep
the support costs low.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.550
With all the products that we release,
there's always a support

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.420
cost that's attached to that.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.410
We need to be really careful with that.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.780
There are some issues that
you should be aware of.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.650
Probably the toughest
thing for our students is,

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.380
some students, is the install process.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.680
There's just,
I can't remember how many there are now.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.420
13, 14 steps.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.950
And some of the technophobes
out there are scared to death.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.730
They don't know what any of
these screens mean and stuff.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.200
So you just need to be prepared to
kind of step them through the process.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.700
Of course, you know,
those techno guys out there,

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.640
the techno folks usually have
no problem installing QuickTime.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.140
They just click through, right?

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.060
There's also the NAG screen.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.170
Occasionally we'll put things in
the QuickTime player and some of the

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.130
technophobes just don't know what
to do once that screen's up there.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:16.680
Do I buy?

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.560
Do I not?

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.060
And we kind of need to help
step them through the process.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:23.740
Now most of the stuff we do nowadays
is through the QuickTime plugin,

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.220
which that NAG screen only shows
once when you make the install.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.500
And then it doesn't show again
if you're using the plugin.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.170
So a lot of the stuff we do,
even on CD-ROM, we'll actually just put

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.970
it in a web environment.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.990
Okay, here's kind of a process that we
use to create synchronized lectures.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.480
Of referring, well,
first we have them create a script.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.950
I think this is really important.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.900
There's all kinds of noise.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:54.440
We really feel that there's all kinds of
noise when we shoot in a live setting.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.770
It may save time,
but I think in the long run,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.860
if you bring the faculty
member into the studio,

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:03.370
you get a nice,
you get a more clear message.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.660
And so we have the
professor create a script.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.500
Of course, that script goes through
a review process.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.560
Once the script is finalized,
we actually create the slides

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.980
after the script is done.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.490
So it saves us time on that.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.460
Once the slides are done,
we usually use PowerPoint.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.800
That seems to be very popular.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.860
We'll talk more about that here later.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.160
After we create the
slides and the script,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.580
we create a document that has
all that information in it

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.440
and we go into the studio.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.600
We shoot the professor.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.640
The professor is reading the scripts
or if they're off the teleprompter

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.620
or if they're really good,
they just kind of recite it by memory.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.070
After that, we create an interface.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.920
We create a caption.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.140
The caption is really easy in
this kind of workflow because

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.810
you already have the script,
right?

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.440
Then we add an interface.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.960
We sync the slides together,
add a caption, add an index.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.330
An index basically is the chapter tracks.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.700
Prep for deployment
and then we deploy it.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.120
Now after this we have
also an evaluation process.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.010
We have student surveys,
make sure that the materials that we've

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.430
created are actually accomplishing
the objectives that we've set out.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.530
Since this is a development forum,
I skipped all that stuff.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:24.880
Okay, so when we create a script,
usually it's done in Microsoft Word,

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.230
and something very important to
the developers is they actually

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.190
label when the slides are.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.810
That's extremely helpful for us.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.610
Okay, when we acquire the slides,
usually it's through PowerPoint.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.610
And there's an interesting
issue with PowerPoint.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.020
Most of the professors like to use
one slide with multiple bullet points,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:45.640
right?

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.850
And they use a custom animation
to show the points one at a time.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:52.790
Well, we want to be able to export
that out into still images.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.300
And of course,
QuickTime supports all kinds

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.020
of different image formats.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.970
So you just need to export
to one of those that fits.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.760
Usually we've found that you need
to export those slides on the

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.590
same machine that was authored.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.190
That just usually simplifies
if you don't have the fonts.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.500
Of course,
there's font substitution that comes in.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.130
There's cross-platform issues,
especially with the latest version

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.980
of Microsoft Office for OS X.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.400
It has all kinds of really
cool graphics features.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.830
Alpha channels is
extremely important to us,

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.150
and it supports that.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.440
And Windows does a great job with that.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.000
So usually we like to
export on the same machine.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.010
The Macintosh PIC format
can also use vector text.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.540
But when you save out those
slides as Macintosh PIC,

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:45.030
you have to make sure that wherever you
deploy that particular presentation,

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.740
they have to have those same fonts.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.750
So usually for simplicity,
we just export out as PNG.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:56.060
Now, returning back to the issue of how
do you capture the slides if you want

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.000
all the bullet points to be separate?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.500
Well, we... We took a look at that,
and we decided that we were

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.150
going to create an Apple script.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:09.180
So we have an Apple script that
you can connect up to Snaps Pro.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.570
So basically,
you just set Snaps Pro up with the

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:17.340
file format that you want to save
as and the size and everything,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.220
and bring up the presentation
and let Apple script go through.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.340
Apple script will drive the
presentation in full screen,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.490
and Snaps Pro will take a picture of
every single slide that you've got.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.960
We found that to be extremely useful.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.770
So at the end of the presentation,
I'll show you a link where you can

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.290
download that and use that if you'd like.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.060
Okay, so after the slides,
we capture the video.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.580
You do have the option
to record in the class,

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:48.420
but we found that kind of the
noise to learning or noise to

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.020
content level is pretty high inside,
well, in a live setting.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.700
Also,
there's lighting issues that you really

00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.020
want to bring this person into the
studio to get a good quality video clip.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.460
Now,
I guess there's also issues on whether

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:07.070
you use talking head or whether you skip
the talking head and just use audio.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:11.880
For some reasons to use talking
head is if the professor is

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.490
using a lot of body language.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.090
You know,
nonverbal communication accounts for,

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.150
like,
I guess studies show that 55% of the

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:25.870
presentation is dependent on or is
impacted by the nonverbal language

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.620
that's going on in the presentation.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.610
So, some professors... you'll
probably want to use video,

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.230
and other professors,
you probably don't want to use video.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:38.010
So, that's kind of a judgment
call that you'll need to make.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.520
Of course, not using video,
you've reduced the size

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.290
significantly of the presentation.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.770
So, there's some things to look at.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.600
Of course,
you want to use proper lighting.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.130
You want to use a close microphone so
you can capture the audio nice and clear.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.350
Sometimes we've experimented
with capturing straight to a

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:02.280
compressed format using... a
broadcaster or some other tool.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.190
We actually found a way
to hack Final Cut Pro to

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.080
capture in sorts and video.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:14.380
Stick to the standard methods
of capturing the tape,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.460
dumping that down,
and compressing from a high res file.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.750
It does a better job.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.160
Of course, we do pre-processing.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.530
We use squeeze, cleaner, and compressor.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:29.630
It just depends on the project and what
resources are available at the time.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.600
After that we create the interface.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.200
Of course we use Photoshop.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.200
We leverage layers.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.000
Very important concept for us.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.300
It helps maximize things.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:43.870
Of course there's all kinds of cool
non-destructive things that you can do.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:48.400
Effects and things that you can do in
Photoshop that we like to leverage.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.400
This is just a simple interface
that we threw together.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.590
We have a portion for the video,
we have a portion for the slides,

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.330
and we just kind of put a skin on it.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.000
Creating the caption.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.360
This is, again,
very important for education.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.060
And why you might want to do that,
the government, of course,

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:11.130
has come out with Section 508,
which are a set of guidelines for

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:16.400
all of their products that they
need to account for accessibility.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:22.590
Basically, for video,
we need to accommodate a few things.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:27.930
For the visually challenged,
we need to add some

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:38.510
kind of an equivalent,
like an audio track.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.510
For the hearing impaired,
we need to be able to

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.110
We need to be able to show captions and
provide some kind of a text equivalent,

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.270
right?

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.140
And also the W3C has come out
with some guidelines as well

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.820
that we need to account for.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.970
So how do you go about doing
this inside of QuickTime?

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.210
Well,
because of the track-based architecture,

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.790
text tracks is one of the
track types that you can use.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.120
And so we actually do a lot of
our captioning just by hand,

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.860
pulling up QuickTime Player,
pulling up Microsoft Word.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.150
And going through and
typing those things in.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.370
There are some applications out
there that are available that can

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.380
kind of help streamline things.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:21.450
Magpie is a free utility that's out
there by WGBH that's built off of Java,

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.620
so it's a craft platform.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.520
And it does a pretty good job.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.200
It's actually a terrific application,
especially because it's free.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.340
It'll allow you to go
through and mark times.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:35.830
And then at the very end, well,
as you mark times in the video clip,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.680
you can add your text to it.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.490
So you can choose the text
that needs to go there.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:43.860
And at the very end,
you can export that as a QuickTime movie.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.640
We'll kind of go through the
process of creating some of

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.420
these things here shortly.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.330
But Textation and GoLive and
LiveStage all have options as well

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.080
that allow you to create captions.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.470
And we'll go through the
process of creating some of

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.040
those things here shortly.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.500
How we doing?

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.760
Okay, I'm going to just whiz through
some of this stuff here.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.790
Here we go, indexing.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.140
Indexing is very important.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:10.000
We want to be able to jump through
to specific points in a movie.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.950
Usually we do that
through chapter tracks.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:15.630
You can also create a visual
table of contents and there

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.510
are some facility out there,
there is facility out there

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.470
to do searchable tracks.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.660
Okay, here we go.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.040
So, I'm going to show you how to create
synchronized presentations in all

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.460
of these different solutions here.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.810
QuickTime Player Pro, Smile,
Live Stage and Go Live.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:38.590
And, can we go back to, oh this is good.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.200
Hey, guess what?

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.740
Okay, so let's see.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.630
Let's start off by using Smile.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.000
No, I take that back.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.710
Let's use QuickTime Player Pro.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.580
We're going to create that slide show,
the Russian slide show

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.700
in QuickTime Player.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.990
Basically what we're going to do,
you need to have Pro to do this,

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:04.530
is here's the audio track
and here are the slides.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.490
I'm just going to open up the first
five slides or so in QuickTime Player.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.500
Here we go.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.650
Okay.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.620
Alright,
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.300
to copy this slide to the clipboard.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.170
So here we go.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.040
Copy.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.050
Then I'm going to go to the audio track
and I'm going to hold down the shift key.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:27.720
Now this is a great example because
there's actually a beep that

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.500
tells me when the next slide is.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:30.500
Excuse me.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:30.500
So...

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.540
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to play this clip and I'm

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.540
going to hold down the shift key.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.830
What that does is as
the movie is playing,

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.540
it's going to select that
portion that I just played.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.830
So here we go.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.300
Aha!

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.220
Okay.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:00.000
So now I've just selected that
portion that slides on the clipboard.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.830
Now what I'm going to do is come
under here and choose Add Scaled.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.840
And what that does is that adds
that particular slide to that

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.810
duration in the movie clip.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.320
Now we're at the very end of
that clip so we don't see it.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:13.300
That's fine.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.620
What I'm going to do now is do Command-B,
which will take both selection

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.870
points and put them right at
the point where I just stopped.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.140
I'm going to hold down
the shift key again.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:31.700
[Transcript missing]

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.700
Okay, right there.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.840
And let's go to slide two.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.500
We're going to copy
this to the clipboard.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.620
And then I'm going to choose Add Scale.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.280
OK.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.620
Now that just added that
slide to the selection that's

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.960
made available right there.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.160
So I'm going to do Command B,
and we're going to do this one more time.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:03.660
.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:06.000
Okay, and slide three.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.300
Let's find slide three.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.170
Copy, add scale.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:11.200
Okay?

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.800
Pretty straightforward.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.680
The only disadvantage of
this is if you screw up,

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.050
you kind of have to do undo and back
up a little bit to see what's going on.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.670
But here, let me just show you
what that looks like now.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:41.500
[Transcript missing]

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.340
A little straightforward.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.900
Okay, so basically that's doing kind of a
presentation in QuickTime Player Pro.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.160
I guess what I could have
done is added a caption.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.700
We'll have to skip that today.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.120
We're kind of running short on time.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.820
So let's move to Smile.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.080
Let me open up this
presentation right here.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.220
Here's our Smile file.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.140
And can you see that?

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.140
Is that kind of small?

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.390
Let me see if I can zoom in real quick.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.490
Okay, let's go through kind
of what's going on here.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.660
So for Smile, of course,
it's based off of XML,

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:20.510
so we need to make sure that our
tags are all straight and that we've

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:22.860
got ending brackets and everything.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:27.090
At the very beginning here,
we kind of set up Smile and we

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:32.000
set an XML namespace here for
what kind of code we're using.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.430
QuickTime has all kinds of interesting
QuickTime specific tags that you can use.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.310
And you can see some of
these right at the very top.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.080
We're going to set the autoplay to true.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.680
We're going to add a time slider.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.540
We're going to,
immediate instantiation kind of means,

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.240
does this movie wait until everything
gets loaded before it plays or can

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.180
it kind of like fast start playing
before things are completely loaded.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.590
And we're using a chapter track in
here and so there's a chapter track

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.830
mode that we need to set for all,
which means this whole movie

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.890
clip gets the same chapter track.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.420
After that, we have a header here.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.480
And in the header.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.550
We get to put some annotations.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.780
These actually show up
as QuickTime annotations.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.080
And there's a whole set of different
parameters that you can set there.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.780
In the layout area,
this is kind of where we set

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.900
up visually what's going to be
happening in this Smile file.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.780
And so we set up a root layout.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:27.300
That's the basic dimensions
of the whole file.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.710
And then inside that root layout,
we can put in regions.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.250
And these regions are the different
containers that we have for

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.740
the different objects in there.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.740
So we have a region for the backdrop.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.490
We have a region for the background.

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:38.540
We have a region for the video.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.540
We have a region for the
slides and also the transcript.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.540
After that, this is kind of crazy.

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:47.180
This is kind of the solution we
came up with for the navigation,

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.490
the table of contents.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:53.360
We actually set up a region for
every single chapter point that's

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.540
there in the table of contents.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.530
Kind of crazy.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:02.120
I think there's been some fixes now with
QuickTime text that you can actually just

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.340
put one line of text in there instead.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.540
But we just set up regions.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.130
and each region has

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.960
Each region has a specific area.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:18.450
Also, right beside the region,
there is a little pointer,

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:22.300
a little dot that tells you
what chapter that you're on.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.360
We actually set up a
separate region for that.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:28.390
So let's see, how am I going to do this?

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:29.550
I guess I'm going to have to do this.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.540
Okay, let's scroll down a little bit.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.270
Alright,
here's where we start placing things,

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.360
the actual content in the presentation.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.880
So we have the body tag and inside
the body tag we have a parallel tag.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:47.200
So in the parallel tag everything
gets played at the same time.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:51.500
So we have a background image that
needs to be played at the same time.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.100
And we actually sent,
you notice that there's an end tag here.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.480
Can you see that?

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.500
Here we go.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.670
The end tag says, "Hey,
stretch this background image to the

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.810
entire length of the video clip."

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.060
And we also set a chapter point.

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:08.900
This QT colon chapter,
those are actually the chapter

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.630
tracks that get listed.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:11.700
Right?

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.020
And we set a duration.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.420
These are actually the slides here.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.980
So you have all the slides and

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.000
This is a little confusing.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.350
Sorry about that.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:28.200
At the very end here,
we have the table of contents.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.310
It's actually a text.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.870
In fact, right, let's see,
sorry about this.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:38.300
This is actually text data.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:42.760
The QuickTime basically has its own
little markup language for text.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.100
And that's basically
what you're seeing here.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.480
We're saying, hey, show this text.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.550
It's QT text.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:51.990
Show the font, show the size, bold,
width, all that stuff.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:55.030
And at the very end is
the content right here,

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:55.650
start.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.780
That's what actually gets
shown in that particular layer.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.390
We won't spend too much time on this
because you can download it and you can

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:05.130
check it out for yourself if you'd like.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.510
I actually wrote this by hand.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.750
I just find that just a
little bit easier to do.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.520
A lot of times, you know with HTML,
the editors kind of add extra code and

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.090
stuff that kind of gets in the way.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:19.800
That's kind of the same thing here.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.400
Now Go Live does have a smile editor
and actually I like developing in that

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.800
because kind of the markup changes
color and that kind of fun stuff.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.750
But I kind of still kind of code by hand.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:35.100
And hopefully this will kind of
give you a good idea of what's

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:35.760
available inside of QuickTime.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.330
Okay, so moving right along.

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.120
Let's see, what's next?

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.850
Let's do href tracks real quick.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.940
How much time do we have?

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.400
12 minutes.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:46.690
Okay.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.300
So here's an href track.

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.960
This is kind of what
we did to set this up.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.770
We used Go Live.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.650
Go Live actually has a really
good QuickTime editor in it.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.780
It's kind of tucked behind.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.300
There's not a lot of
marketing going on with the

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.250
QuickTime editor inside of Go Live.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.170
But the first thing we do with
this is that we set up a web page,

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:08.750
right?

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.270
And this is a framed environment.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.880
So we have an area where the
video clip gets displayed.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.930
And if I open that up,
here's the video clip.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.460
And it's basically an embedded
QuickTime movie that's there.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.030
We have just a blank space here.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.820
And then here's where the content is.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.620
And what's very important
here is you need to know the

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.120
name of this frame space.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:31.930
Because when the movie is playing,
we tell the href track to say, hey,

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.980
grab this HTML file and
put it in this frame.

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.880
And so we need to know that
this frame is called content.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.750
So if we come over here,
I'm just going to double

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:43.410
click on this video clip.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:46.360
And it opens up the
QuickTime editor in here.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.490
Now,
there's a timeline here at the very top.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:49.470
And we're going to show that.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.800
One thing I really like about
Go Live is this timeline.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.520
It's really nice.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.730
Let's see if I can move
some things around here.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:57.840
Okay.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:04.760
So this particular movie clip just
has an audio track and a video track.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.800
And what we want to do
is add an href track.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.660
So if you go over here to the
QuickTime properties area here.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.610
And if we come down, here is the href

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.610
So we're going to drag
an href track there.

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.530
Let's see if I can, oh well.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.000
We need the inspector,
so bring the inspector back.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.700
I'm going to select,
there's actually kind of a track view and

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.860
then this is the sample view down below.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.350
We need to select that sample
view and the very beginning here,

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:38.280
we need to select that first,
let's see if I can find this real quick.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.420
Okay.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.440
We need to select the first slide.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.400
So here's our slides and what
I did earlier is I created an

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.630
HTML page for every single slide.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:52.680
So this is the first slide
that needs to be loaded.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.710
So we're going to select that.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.960
We're going to select the target,
which is, since the page is already

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.650
open in the background,
it puts the frame name,

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:02.380
makes it available for me.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.480
And I'm going to select auto-load URL.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.340
Okay, so we've set up our first frame.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:11.570
Now what we need to do is,
I'm going to choose preview here,

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:15.300
and for some reason now,
that activates this little

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.160
transport down here.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.450
I'm going to play this clip.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.540
So I'm going to go ahead
and select the slide.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.940
And I'm going to go ahead
and select the slide.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.540
And I'm going to go ahead
and select the slide.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.510
Okay, so I'm going to go ahead
and select the slide.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:26.540
And I'm going to go ahead
and select the slide.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:30.600
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to take my slice tool and

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:35.540
line it up right there and create a
new sample inside this href track.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.530
Now, if I select that sample,

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:44.400
I can change this to slide two, right?

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.400
So now I have slide one
at the very beginning,

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.700
and now at that particular time,
it goes to slide two.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:54.800
Now,
all I do from this is I just continue on.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.070
Well, accounting is-- I think
it goes right about there,

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.120
somewhere in that area.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:04.420
So you just keep doing this till
the end of the presentation,

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.850
right?

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.960
All righty?

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:14.120
So that's basically how you'd go
ahead and put in an href track.

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.640
Now, you can do something very similar
with a text track inside of Go Live.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.900
Let's drag a text track here.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.160
Oh, and I need to bring
this all the way back.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.680
And here we have the
track representation.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.210
And then down below, we have the samples.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.450
And this is where we put the actual text.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.300
So what I'm going to
do here is-- and again,

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.900
you can just work linearly.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.640
Let's go over these questions.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.490
OK, so you can start there and say--

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:51.760
That's what he says.

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:52.890
Back it up just a little bit.

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.560
Try it again.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.790
Questions reflected here in this first...

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.860
You get the idea and then when you
apply that and then you can use the same

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:14.300
process here of breaking up those tracks
into different points and just kind of go

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.750
in a linear fashion all the way through
the clip and create that text track.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:21.150
Now one thing that I forgot to
do is you can actually go here

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:25.250
in the layout area and you can
change the dimensions of that.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:30.720
So if you wanted this to be, there we go,
and we could just move

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.080
that down to the bottom.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.570
And I guess I should
change this text here.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.010
If I select this sample here, I can.

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.200
Apply it.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:56.330
Okay, now when I save this,
and let's go and let's

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:58.890
see if this all works.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.400
Let's go over these questions.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.330
I think I've got some
issues with my frames here.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.580
The first one was,
why is accounting... Well,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.400
you see the caption is working
and you also see that the

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.390
HTML pages are flipping,
right?

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.890
Accounting is the language of business
because accounting seeks to provide

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:20.630
information... Does that give you a good
enough idea of what's going on there?

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.730
So there's a powerful tool inside.

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:24.670
Oh, and there's all kinds
of interesting tracks.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:31.390
You can do effects tracks and all kinds
of-- chapter tracks is basically the

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:33.200
same process of going through linear.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.360
Start at the beginning and
just go all the way down your

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:38.080
movie and add chapter tracks.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.010
And so that's basically using Go Live.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:45.590
We need to jump into
Live Stage real quick.

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:52.600
Livestage, of course, has some powerful
scripting tools in there,

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.300
but it also has some tools to
help you create presentations.

00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:04.580
Did you know that there's a
synchronizer inside of Livestage?

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.600
Okay, let me show you how that works.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.500
Okay.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.380
Let's create a brand new project.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.420
We're going to start
straight from scratch here.

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.240
Okay.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:24.160
First thing I'm going to do once this
is up is I'm going to do command I,

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.680
show the movie inspector.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:29.070
I'm just going to set right off
the top my dimensions of the

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.220
movie that I want to create,
and I'm going to erase that background.

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:33.330
Then I'm going to save it.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.080
This is really important
because before this,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.830
I actually created a library folder,
and inside that library folder,

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:42.680
I put all my media that I'm going
to use for this particular project.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.600
This is really important because
I want all my materials in that one

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.550
folder so that I can transport this.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:51.130
If I'm on different computers and stuff,
I want to be able to

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.170
transport this around.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.180
So you see the movie,
there's the background image

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.500
and the slides are in that area.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:00.060
So I'm going to save that one
level up from that library folder.

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:03.240
And this is called sample.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:08.510
Okay, now once I save that,
if I look at the local library,

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:11.470
it's pointing to that library
folder that's just been set up.

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:16.040
So now I can go ahead and I'm going
to drag in my background image.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.160
And I'm going to drag in

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.040
The movie clip.

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:24.190
Okay, I'm going to position that
movie clip so it's right on top.

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:33.170
"If I move my mouse over the duration,
well over the video clip,

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.400
it's telling me the duration.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.200
27, 22, 221.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.190
And I'm going to just,
this is kind of just an easy

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:44.300
way to make the duration of
the background clip the same."

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:53.500
So now, excuse me, you can see that,
oh my, what happened there?

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.540
I must have mistyped something.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.340
Okay, there we go.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:57.620
Now we've got the background.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.880
The background has the same
duration as the video clips.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.260
Now we're going to put the slides in.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.830
Now to do this,
what we need to do is that there's,

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:08.470
I guess,
a couple different ways you can do this.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:09.940
This is how I like to do it.

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:11.360
I select all these slides.

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.880
Here we go.

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.130
It's important that you
select every single file.

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.410
If you were just to grab the folder
and drag it over to this area,

00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:24.450
what it does is it creates a single track
for every single one of those images,

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:25.520
and we don't want that.

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.020
So here we go.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.680
So if we drag that over here,
what it does is it creates a single

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.060
picture track with all those tracks,
with all those pictures lined up.

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:36.320
You see how they're
all lined up together?

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.400
Okay.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.510
So what we're going to do now is
we're going to use the synchronizer to

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.470
specify the times of all those slides.

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.740
So how do we do that?

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.060
We select the soundtrack down here,
come under movie,

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.080
and choose media synchronizer.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.530
Here's the synchronizer.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:55.500
We get to select the source for
the audio or video track that

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:58.020
we're going to synchronize to.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:03.090
Then down here, we're going to select the
track that we're going to use.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.380
I forgot to do something very important.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.660
Don't follow me.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.820
Follow Michael Schaaf because
this is his recommendation.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.200
That is to name every single
track and then select the time.

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.400
And item explicitly.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.360
This can help you tremendously
in your development.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.340
So let me just do this real quick.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.780
Sorry.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.620
Creature of habit here.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.130
Okay.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.930
So here are my slides.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:30.210
There we go.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:34.740
So now if I have selected the soundtrack,
I go back to the media synchronizer.

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:38.710
Now I know for sure that I want to sync
to slides and not some other track.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.970
We could be syncing the
background track for all we know.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.340
Okay, so from this point we have the
opportunity to click the synchronize

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.930
button and what we want to do here
is as we're listening to this we

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:54.010
want to set the out point or the
in point depending on where we are.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:55.880
So let's see if we can do this.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.300
We talked in an earlier presentation
about how to plan a presentation.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.680
I think this goes on for a
little bit so I'm going to try

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.100
to jump a little bit further.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:08.600
We also want to talk about why every
good message has to be three elements and

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.020
then talk about how to implement those
three elements in a good presentation.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.680
So, what elements... Okay,
so right there I'm going

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.700
to have that slide.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:52.700
[Transcript missing]

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.100
Let's see.

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:59.590
Once it's done, you come back here,
you'll notice that, well,

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:02.740
once you do all of them,
you'll notice that the durations of all

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.290
those have been lined up exactly where
you want it to go all the way through.

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:09.290
How are we doing?

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:11.960
Oh, we've got one minute and 23 seconds.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.700
So, one last thing I want to show you
and that is the multi-speed control.

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:16.740
I'll show you how to set that up.

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:26.370
And to do that, I'm just going to pull
up another project.

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:31.140
Okay, here's how we set that up.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.640
We basically followed the
same pattern that we just did

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.250
with synchronizing the slide.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:42.800
I forgot to mention one other thing,
but we'll do that here shortly.

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:45.040
So we basically follow that same step.

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.730
This one has a whole bunch
of other stuff in there,

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.610
but you notice that there's
actually three different

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:52.450
tracks here at the very bottom.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:56.700
Track one, excuse me,
I'm losing my voice.

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.400
Track 1 is one speed.

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.400
Alpha, beta, power.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:05.400
Okay, track 2 is one and a half speed.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.400
Power and the relationships.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.400
Okay.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400
In our last lesson.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.400
Alright, track 3 is two times speed.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.280
Okay, now what's going on here?

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.400
They're actually slower, right?

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.470
But what happens is that when
you add your wired sprites here,

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.900
Let's pull up our wired
sprites real quick.

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:31.220
In the code here for wired sprites,
we tell this thing, okay,

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.170
if it's one speed, well,
set the movie rate.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.230
Let's see, where is this?

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.400
There we go.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.270
If this thing is,
when you click on the one speed button,

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.710
it plays one speed.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.100
When you click on the 1.5, there we go.

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.930
It speeds it up to 1.5.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.700
So the trick here is that you've got
to lower the pitch of the voice so

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.400
when you play one and a half speed,
it brings it up to the same pitch

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.300
level and plays it in that fashion,
right?

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.220
Understand how that goes?

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:06.830
So with 2.5, again,
since the pitch was lowered and then

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:11.190
you play it two and a half times speed,
it actually brings the pitch

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.300
back up and plays it faster.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.490
See how that works?

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.740
So basically use Logic or I think
there's all kinds of different

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.280
audio apps out there that will
just lower the pitch for you.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.590
And so you just want to make
sure that the durations are still

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.910
the same on your audio clips,
but they all have different

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.190
pitches to start out with.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.670
And then when you bring them in here,
when you create those speed buttons,

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:35.880
it brings the pitch back up
and just plays it faster.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.570
So the real trick here is to get the,
you know, get what level do you

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.040
bring the pitch down.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.950
And we've kind of found
that with different people,

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.670
you kind of have to
use different settings.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.460
So it's kind of a hit
and miss kind of thing.

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.950
But basically that's it.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.980
And let's see, can we go back to slides?

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.210
I think I got a ton of...

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:54.930
I think I've got about 20 more slides,
but we'll skip those

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:56.910
because we're over time.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.940
So, quickly, CD-ROM deployment.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.740
Two kinds.

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:03.960
We really prefer progressive.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.240
It just seems a lot more simple
to do progressive than to,

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.370
at this point in time, for us.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.800
We distribute all our stuff on CD-ROM,
even in our distance edge department.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.250
We do it all on CD-ROM.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.700
That's actually turned out to be
a silver lining because of these

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.210
patent suits that are going on.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.140
We don't have any problems with
the lawsuits going on right now

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.440
because we already were distributing
all our materials on CD-ROM.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.200
For us,
it just seems a little bit easier.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.690
Well, we'll leave it at that.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.410
I'm over time.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:36.490
So, we actually deploy a lot of stuff
on CD-ROM in the web browser.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.520
Just really quick and simple.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.100
There's one important thing I'll put
on my website that you'll need to know,

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:46.060
and that is in Internet Explorer,
if you try to develop a CD with

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:51.970
Internet Explorer for Windows,
it bypasses, well, I guess they have a,

01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:56.490
a feature inside of IE for Windows that
requires the whole thing to download.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.800
The whole movie has to download into
the cache before it starts playing.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.020
There's a workaround for that.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.350
You can use QT source tags and
all kinds of interesting stuff.

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:11.740
Occasionally we do deploy through HTTP,
but a lot of times what we do is

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.050
we'll make the movies available for
the students and the students can

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:17.420
download those and burn those to CD.

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:19.820
So here's a summary.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:23.320
QuickTime is an excellent
solution for this kind of stuff.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.320
There's all kinds of
great advantages to do it.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.580
And you know the development
process isn't that bad.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.590
There are different ways to create it.

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.240
Captioning is a very important feature.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.880
Sorry we didn't spend more time on that.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:38.570
Indexing, of course,
just adds value to your materials.

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:42.370
And time scale modification, I think,
can save a lot of time.

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:44.260
It's going to be very useful.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:49.190
And here's who you can contact
if you have any questions.

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:50.980
Just talk to us too, or Amy.

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.510
And that's it.
