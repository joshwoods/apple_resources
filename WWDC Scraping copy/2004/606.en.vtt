WEBVTT

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.800
At this time, if you would please welcome
to the stage JD Mankovsky.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.500
Good morning.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.940
Any donuts this morning?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.280
Oh yeah?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.720
Cool.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.610
So that's five days in a row, right?

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.490
Quite a few calories.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.080
Next week is going to be workout time.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.940
So I'm here to talk about third-party
collaboration solutions today.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.560
I actually manage Apple's professional
services group for the enterprise.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.970
And so we do a lot of integration
work in large enterprises.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.880
And so definitely collaboration is
a big part of the work we do and

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.380
recommendations for our customers.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.170
And I thought it was really important to
kind of review those enterprise solutions

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.500
that are available both on the client
side as well as client-server solutions

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.970
that are available for Mac OS X.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.090
So we're going to talk
a little bit about it,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.820
you know,
give you a quick market overview,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.790
and then we'll talk about some client
integration solutions from Lotus,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.590
Microsoft, and Novell.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.780
And by the way,
all those vendors that we're going

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.350
to be talking about today are going
to be coming at the end for Q&A.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.690
So we'll have one person from each
company available for Q&A at the end.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.590
So let's talk about the
collaboration market.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.070
Gartner defines this as basically the
integrated collaboration environment,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.490
ICE, as basically more than
just email and calendar.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.300
Collaboration today
means instant messaging,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.880
web conferencing, screen sharing,
file collaboration, knowledge management.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.700
It's way more than just
email and calendaring.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.250
And Apple has some answers in
some of those areas with Mail,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.030
with IM, with iChat, with, you know,
Address Book.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.610
And, you know,
we're based on open standards

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.930
using LDAP technology,
IMAP, and POP.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.270
And we also made some improvements
to integrate better into

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.600
Exchange environments as
well in our Mail application.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.820
And if you weren't into- if you
came to my session yesterday,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.160
you also saw how with the, you know,
Active Directory plug-in,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.680
we could also integrate
better into an AD environment,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.080
even using Address Book and Safari,
and getting, you know,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.270
nice single sign-on type capabilities
with some of our products into those

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.480
heterogeneous environments as well.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.240
And with iChat moving forward in Tiger,
as you all know,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.340
we'll be adding even more
functionality where you can host your

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.800
own iChat server back-end solution,
which will help further

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.290
the collaboration work.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.000
On the server side,
we also are very focused

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.540
on being standards-based.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.290
And so really,
we did a big migration when we

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.860
went from SendMail to PostFix
due to a lot of feedback from

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.300
IT folks that preferred PostFix.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.930
So we did that.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.080
So a lot of people use our servers
as PostFix servers on the back-end.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.480
But also, people might use, as well,
you know, Cyrus for smaller deployments.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.370
And, again,
that's a cross-platform solution

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.140
due to the fact that we support
Popeye Map and Kerberos.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.500
So the Mac is a good corporate citizen.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.430
And, again, we talked a lot about that
in the session yesterday,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.260
where we fit in very well with, you know,
if it's a Linux or Windows back-end or,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.660
you know, Solaris back-end,
we'll fit in really well

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.300
as a good corporate client.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.020
But we also, you know,
with the XServe and the G5,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.760
we also have a really good
server solution as well.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.470
And we'll talk about some of those on the
collaboration solutions in just a second.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.310
So let's talk first about client
integration and really wanted to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.240
focus on the top three vendors that,
you know,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.650
most of you use in your enterprise
or on the education side.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.700
And that's, you know, really Lotus,
Microsoft, and Novell.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.620
And so Lotus, you know, using Domino,
Microsoft with Exchange,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.440
and Novell with GroupWise.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.270
And the first one
I wanted to touch on and,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.360
you know, quickly overview is IBM Lotus.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.210
And, you know,
the Lotus software has evolved

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.660
tremendously throughout the years.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.030
And, you know,
IBM's main focus and Lotus software's

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:50.420
main focus is really,
you know,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:05:00.630
the on the platform due to their Eclipse
back-end development environment.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.040
So, IBM and Lotus,
they have a product family that is

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.460
basically based around Notes and Domino.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.850
The Lotus Workplace,
which is a new segment for IBM,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.340
they're up to version 2.0
in their Workplace product.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.700
Brand new product from IBM,
and then WebSphere.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.980
So really, there's three suites that
are available from IBM:

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.030
Notes and Domino,
which is very well known; Workplace,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.010
which is their newer suite of solution,
again, based on standards; and then

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.340
WebSphere for the backend
application and web development.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.320
So today, the version available from
Lotus is Lotus Note 651,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.120
which was very well
received by the community,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.940
and that is supported
against 10.1 and 10.2.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.400
And again, this product is on par with
the Windows counterpart,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.620
so it's pretty much identical
to the Windows version.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.650
On the roadmap, there's some really good
stuff coming from IBM.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.860
Basically, 651 and 652,
which support 10.2, this fall,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.770
they will release 653,
which will be fully

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.720
supported against Tiger,
10.3.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.720
And then, Lotus has announced that
they will release a version

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.940
7 of their Domino server,
and that'll be in the first half of 2005.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.740
And they will also have a newer version
of the client that will support that.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.220
Which is right now named Lotus Notes.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.200
You know, Notes, it'll be 654.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.400
And some of the new additions that are
being brought over to the Mac platform

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.830
is the Lotus Workplace Instant Messaging,
as well as Lotus Domino

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.300
Document Manager and
Lotus Team Workplace.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.280
So really good news from IBM as far as,
you know, keeping,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.270
enhancing their product
offering on the Mac side,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.740
especially on the desktop.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.320
Again, on that second suite of solutions
that is available from IBM,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.500
which is their new Workplace solution.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.060
Again,
they're up to version 2.0 right now.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.480
And with version 2.5,
they will now start supporting

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.720
the Macintosh client through
their web workplace solution

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.700
using workplace messaging,
documents, team collaboration,

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.450
web content management,
as well as their collaborative

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.720
learning solution.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.580
And that will be in 2.5,
which is in the fall of 2004.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:55.440
And later down the road,
they will have a full client of the

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:04.580
workplace technology solution that will
be coming to Mac OS X in the future.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.970
So stay tuned on that.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:11.700
But 2.5 will be coming on the Mac,
and then any other significant update

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.700
will be a full-blown client on the Mac.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.580
Macintosh.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:22.000
Just quickly on the technical
resources from Lotus Software,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.280
their Developer Works page is a great
area to go to to get more information,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:33.300
technical discussions, forums,
beta programs, documentation,

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.160
all that stuff is available through
this Developer Works Lotus website.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.650
So for people who are using Lotus,
it's just a great reference,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.860
especially for Macintosh support.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.020
So that's it for Lotus.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:52.610
Wanted to talk a little bit
about Microsoft as well.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.980
They are widely used on
the Macintosh platform.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.860
And I wanted to talk about Exchange.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.450
And for Mac OS X,
there's three great ways to

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.040
connect to an Exchange backend.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.040
There's Entourage 2004,
which Microsoft just released.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.510
Was it a month ago, two months ago?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.560
Their new Office Suite.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.110
Very well received in the community.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.220
Great product from Microsoft.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.120
And they also have their
Remote Desktop Connection Client,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.600
which if you came to
my session yesterday,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.790
we actually demoed.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.450
Great way to connect through to a
Windows Terminal service backend.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:39.990
And that's another way for you to get
to a full-blown Exchange platform.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.040
to actually use an Exchange version,
their Exchange Windows version,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.670
through RDC.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.770
And there's also Virtual PC 6 and
soon to becoming Virtual PC 7 on

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.890
Mac OS X that will support the G5.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.540
And so those are three ways to
actually get to your Exchange server

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.060
and get to your email and calendaring.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.660
On the Mac OS 9 side, of course,
we've been saying for many, many years,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.670
it's time to move off the platform,
but they still have Outlook

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.110
2001 for the Macintosh,
which can run in Classic.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.940
And they have Entourage 2001,
which is the Mac OS 9

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.400
version of Entourage.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.460
And then Web Access, of course,
through Safari,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.320
you've got a really nice experience.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.500
So here's a screenshot of what actually
the Outlook Web Access looks like when

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.260
you're actually connecting and getting
your email through the web with Safari.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.480
And again, we had a great demo yesterday
where when we were logged in

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.820
to an Active Directory backend,
we got sent... We got a single sign-on.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.050
We've got your Kerberos ticket,
so you don't have to put

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.160
any name and password.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.870
You just launch Safari,
click on your Exchange URL, and boom,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.680
you're right into your email.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.520
You don't have to type
in any name and password.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.400
And that's because
Safari supports Spinego,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.390
which is the way we would get in and
get to your email through Kerberos.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.600
So great, great experience,
great UI on the Web Access side.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.340
Remote Desktop Connection.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.940
So with RDC,
basically what you're seeing here

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.830
is actually the Exchange client,
the Outlook Exchange client on Windows.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.130
And basically through
RDC on the Macintosh,

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.380
you can actually run the Exchange,
the Outlook version on

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.740
the Macintosh through RDC.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.960
Some of the improvements that
Microsoft has brought to the

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.090
table with Entourage 2004,
synchronization of email, calendaring,

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.180
and address book via WebDAV.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.110
So they're not using
IMAP or SMTP anymore,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.950
they're using WebDAV.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:53.070
So when Entourage 2001 came out,
IT people had to turn on SMTP and

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.020
IMAP to support the Macs,
and now you don't have

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.000
to do that anymore.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.760
Basically, it's all done through WebDAV.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.530
They have scheduling,
they have searchable

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.600
global address lists,
which is new, so you have auto-completion

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.160
when you start looking for
contacts on your back end.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.640
You've got forms-based
authentication support.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.760
Core delegates.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.920
Access support for delegation.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:23.740
And they've got a really nice UI,
and that's a Mac OS X-only product.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.510
Here's a screenshot of
the Entourage 2004 client.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.750
And in this screenshot,
you actually see their new

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.020
support for Free/Busy as well.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.920
So you can actually look at
multiple people's calendaring,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:42.280
send an invite to multiple people,
and kind of see the availability and

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.500
pick that hour of meeting that you
want with those five people here.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.320
On the server side,
what is required to actually have

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.130
this Outlook 2004 client connect?

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.140
You need Exchange 2000 with
a minimum of Service Pack 2.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.570
That's pretty much a no-brainer.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.780
Outlook Web Access must
be installed and enabled,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.980
of course.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.280
And WebDAV needs to be
turned on as well as LDAP.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.690
And that's pretty much it.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.640
So again, Microsoft is very committed
to the Macintosh platform,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.840
and they've been throughout the years.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.520
And a great example of that is
when Entourage 2001 came out,

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.800
there were some limitations,
and they actually,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.250
in the middle of the year,
they had a really great update

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.560
that fixed a lot of issues and
connectivity to the back end.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.690
And again, even with 2004,
they're also committed to improve

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.540
the product moving forward.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:50.390
So again, we're very happy with the way
the Exchange integration and the

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:56.300
Entourage 2004 client is looking
on the Macintosh and for Mac OS X.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.680
Some of the resources to help you if
you're having some issues connecting,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.290
you know, there's some great
resources on their website.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:10.770
If you go to Microsoft.com/exchange,
or you go to Microsoft.com/mac,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.660
or there's also some great discussion
boards around Exchange connectivity

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.970
with Entourage 2004 that are available.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.540
So let's talk a little bit about Novell.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.840
And Novell has this, the OneNet vision.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.400
And what the OneNet vision is,
is you've got the Novell Engage module,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.090
which is basically their
consulting services.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.580
You've got Novell Extend,
which is their web services.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.850
Ensure, which is their secure
identity management solution.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.800
And you've got Novell Enterprise that
is basically comprised of GroupWise,

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.320
you know, Zenworks,
and the SUSE Linux edition when

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.610
Novell purchased SUSE Linux.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:05.490
So that's kind of the four modules
that comprise the Novell OneNet vision.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.940
And we're going to focus a lot on
GroupWise today because that's-

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.540
people have been very excited with
the release of 6.5 on the Macintosh,

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:17.910
great Java release on the Mac,
supports secure email, instant messaging,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:22.620
scheduling, contact management,
task management.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.960
And this is available
today on Mac OS 10.3.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.040
And again, it's a cross-platform client.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.620
You know, supports caching,
shared folders, proxy access, archiving,

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.000
all done in a secure way through OpenSSL.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.980
Multi-party conversation,
real-time contact lists.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.460
They also have their IM clients,
so that's pretty neat,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.570
that has customizable text,
and so forth and so on.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:59.050
They also have access through the web,
so web access through

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.330
GroupWise Web Access Client.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:59.900
[Transcript missing]

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.130
Some of the Novell resources
that are available.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.930
You've got the Novell product page,
cool solutions, success stories,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.820
as well as, you know,
they'll be available for

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.580
discussions in our IT lab.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:24.330
So that's kind of a quick update on the
client side from those top three vendors.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.150
And now I wanted to talk as well
about server deployments and about

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.990
solutions that are not only client,
but also have a server

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.100
component that runs on Mac OS X.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.100
And there are three solutions
that we wanted to focus on

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.600
today on the client server side.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:46.440
And the first one is Kerio,
and the second one is First Class,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.460
and then Stalkker with Communigate.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:18:37.300
[Transcript missing]

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.600
So this was announced, I believe,
this week,

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.630
and it will be shipping later this month.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.840
So it's really a complete
solution for Mac OS X.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.890
It supports shared contacts,
full calendaring support using

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:56.080
the Entourage 10 or the Entourage
2004 client from Microsoft.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.100
They also have a great
web mail interface,

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:06.700
and they also support Outlook client
on the PC side using a MAPI connector.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.580
Of course,
they support POP and IMAP as well,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.080
so you can use Mail.app or
pretty much any other client

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.090
that supports POP and IMAP.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.510
They have full antivirus
support from McAfee,

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:24.270
and again, their web mail support is with
IE on Windows and Safari on the Mac.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.150
Their administration is actually pretty,
very, very nice.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:35.440
They're actually using QT, QTlib,
and that gives you a

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.750
seamless admin interface,
which is identical both on Linux,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.980
on Windows, and on the Macintosh.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.380
So they've done a lot of work.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.190
They also integrate fully
with Active Directory from the

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.070
directory side or Open Directory.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.030
So that really allows you to
keep your directory backend and

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:59.410
install Kerio on the mail side and
basically migrate from Exchange 5.5

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.060
or 2,000 over to the Kerio server.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.520
And again,
this is a small to medium-sized solution.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.930
So they've got webmail support on Safari,
like I said, really nice looking field.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.100
They even have drag and drop
support in their web interface,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.150
which is kind of neat.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.940
They've got junk mail filter as well
available through the web interface.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.960
And again, entourage,
full entourage support,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.190
including email and
calendaring on the Mac side,

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.500
as well as Outlook on the PC side.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.570
One of the customers they have,
which is based in California,

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.940
we thought it would be good to talk,
since we're in California,

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.440
bring up Davis Ellen Advertising.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.040
They've got about 150 employees,
two IT people,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.990
and they're running Kerio on the back end
for their Windows and their Mac users.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.610
Kerio Resources, you know,
you can go to their website, kerio.com.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.150
Again, they have a knowledge base,
and then if you want any

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.840
information on the product,
info@kerio.com.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.160
And again, like I said,
version six is in beta right now.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.540
You can download it,
free eval and free technical support.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.020
Kerio Resources, you know,
you can go to their website, kerio.com.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.550
Again, they have a knowledge base,
and then if you want any

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.340
information on the product,
info@kerio.com.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.560
And again, like I said,
version six is in beta right now.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.940
You can download it,
free eval and free technical support.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.120
It's been, it's evolved tremendously
throughout the years.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.520
They just shipped their version
eight of the first-class product,

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.920
which basically supports email,
voicemail, you know, fax mail,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.530
calendaring, contact, instant messaging,
web publishing, and file sharing.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.420
It actually ties right
into your phone system.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.350
And basically you could get
your phone messages through

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.260
email as audio attachments.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.860
So it's a pretty neat solution.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:18.140
You know, very tightly integrated,
cross-platform, very scalable.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.120
Their version eight was released in June,
2004.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:27.260
And again, the servers they support are
both on Mac OS X and on Windows.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.430
And they've done extensive testing
with XServe and XServ RAID.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.640
So again, it just keeps the price
of the entire solution,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.750
you know, affordable,
very affordable with our backend servers.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.140
Of course,
they fully integrate with LDATv3,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.600
and they've got a single server for mail,
mail, news, and calendaring.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.180
This is a quick screenshot of their UI.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.390
And again, they support Mac OS X,
Mac OS 9, Windows, Linux, and again,

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.180
Safari and IE on the website,
as well as Opera.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.820
Version 8 is a major
milestone for first-class.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.500
They have a lot of new
enhancements around security.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.360
They even have SMIME support,
which is great for security.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.290
And they've added even a
directory services module,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:24.750
and they also have instant messaging as
well as presence management in version 8.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.580
So those are kind of the new
features that are available

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.240
in the first-class server.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:36.580
Here's a sample of some of the
customers that use First Class today.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.180
So you can see there's quite a
wide variety on the education side

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.690
as well as on the business side.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.960
So if you want any information,
George Matthews, again,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.430
from OpenText will be here, and again,
will be available for Q&A later on.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.370
Stalker.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.180
So, Stalker Software Overview.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.020
So, Stalker is very well
known for their product,

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.760
Communigate.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.600
You know, they're very committed
to the Mac platform.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.880
They target mainly enterprise, education,
telcos, and very large ISPs.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.200
So, it's a very scalable
email server solution.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.080
They have over 8,000 customers,
52 million active users

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.790
throughout the world.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.570
They're based in California,
but they also have

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.200
some offices in Europe.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.650
And Stalker has been supporting
the Macintosh over 10 years now,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:41.710
and they have over 1,600 customers that
are running Communigate Pro on the Macs.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.310
They are very focused on
standard-based solutions using SMTP,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.380
POP, and IMAP, directory services,
mailing lists,

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.270
calendaring and scheduling,
real-time communication.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.600
All that stuff is basically
part of the package,

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.030
as well as spam and antivirus protection.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.490
And they've got a pretty neat web
interface to manage the entire system,

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.500
so the whole management is
done through the web interface.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.740
JD Mankovsky

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:15.860
Here's an example of the, basically,
the backend server, again, in Safari,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.640
and how you would basically
manage your POP clients,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.850
your IMAP clients, your LDAP clients,
and that's kind of the log,

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:28.340
some of their logging mechanisms to
basically manage and maintain the server.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.850
What's also very interesting about
the product is that it basically runs,

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.830
because of its Unix foundation,
it runs on over 30 platforms,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.010
which is pretty interesting.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.860
And shows their commitment.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.670
I mean, it goes all the way back to,
even runs on AS400, which is interesting.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.490
On the supported client side,
you can see that basically

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.800
they have calendaring support
through iCal and Safari.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.440
They also support Entourage for POP.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.310
And on the PC side, they have this
Exchange connector as well,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.210
and they can actually replace an
Exchange server as well and use

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.590
Outlook through a MAPI connector
and Apple Mail on the IMAP side.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.580
And they also support palm devices,

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:30.610
and their team will be working
with us to develop and implement

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:30.610
the best possible solution

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.730
Here are some customers that
are available or that use

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.120
the CommuniGate product.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.280
Again,
a wide variety of them from education

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.300
and on the business side as well.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.500
Again, a very scalable solution.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.180
Here's some documentation from Stalkker,
Collaterals.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.380
You can as well download their software.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.090
They have eval software
available as well.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.540
Technical support.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.010
And here's some information if you
want to contact someone from Stalkker.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.010
Alice Liprot, and you've got her number
and email at the bottom here.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.820
So, a quick wrap-up.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.960
On the client side,
we've got a pretty good

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.600
solution from Lotus,
Microsoft, and Novell.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.960
Great collaboration solution
from those three vendors.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.540
And again,
if you're looking for a solution

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:35.550
that also would allow you to run
a server solution on Mac OS X,

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.260
we've got three products from Kerio,
First Class,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:47.540
and Stalkker that are available and that
are cross-platform on the client side,

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:47.980
but have a pretty neat server
solution running on our platform.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.870
So what I want to do for Q&A,
we've got plenty of time for Q&A,

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.240
is bring up our panelists.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.970
From IBM, we have Brendan Crotty.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.990
From Microsoft, we have Dennis Chung.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:12.090
From Novell, we have Mike McDonald,
James Gudeli from Kerio Technology,

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:21.090
George Matthews from OpenText,
and Philip Slater from Stalkker.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:21.090
Thank you.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:34.210
We're going to take- let's see,
why don't you guys share

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.710
the microphones here.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:37.870
Perfect.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.430
And we'll take the first- and
please introduce your name,

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.880
company, and your question.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.290
Thank you.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.070
Yes, Luis Donofrio from the
University of Michigan.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.300
This may not be the right form,
not sure if it's going to be,

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.990
but do you know if there's going to be
any more iCal to Exchange integrations,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.090
or is this not the right
one to be asking that with?

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.090
No, not really.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.500
And then my other question
would be for the Stalkker guy.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:06.640
Do I need MS-CALs when using
Stalkker with the Mappy connector,

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.300
or can I just use your product and
just get more licenses through you?

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.470
You mean from using it
with an Outlook client?

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.220
Yeah.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.500
No, you just need the Mappy connector.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.400
I mean the CALs.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.010
I'm talking about licensing.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.600
How many- do I need to have
CALs through Microsoft,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.500
or do I just deal with your product?

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.500
You'd be licensed through
Stalkker for the Mappy connector,

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.500
which is based on the total
number of- So that's a yes?

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.500
That is a yes.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.500
Just checking.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.500
Licensing from Stalkker.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.480
Oh, from Stalkker only.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.880
Okay.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.500
Thank you.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.700
Hi, I'm John McNeil with
Isis Pharmaceuticals.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.070
We're a note shop.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:48.360
I was wondering if we're going to see
inote support for Safari in the future.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200
I'll take this one.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.040
So there's been a lot of conversation,
especially over the last six months,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.340
around what we're going
to do around iNotes,

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.000
or it's now renamed to Domino Web Access,
formerly known as iNotes.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.300
So right now,
there are certain limitations

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.200
when we looked at this,
specifically at the beginning of

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.960
the year around the Safari browser,
specifically around support for the HTML,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.340
which we're working with Apple in
order to be able to resolve.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.400
So within our whole portfolio,
you heard JD talk about Lotus Workplace.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.020
I mean, Domino is part of Workplace.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.850
We're coming out with a lot
of new technologies which are

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.230
going to encompass a lot of our
solutions into Lotus Workplace.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.110
So one of the things that we're looking
to do is we're coming out with what we

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.260
call right now a common mail CNS portlet
that will go against a Domino backend,

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.280
an NSF file,
or the Lotus Workplace messaging backend,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.140
which is a DB2 backend.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.320
As we move forward with
this solution attack,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:44.320
we're going to be looking at
a lot of new technologies that

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:44.320
are going to be coming out.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.730
And if we're going to be looking
at a lot of new technologies,

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.720
we're going to look to
support that solution on the

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.240
Mac versus Domino Web Access.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.140
So you can look to see this support
over the next six to 12 months.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.200
Thanks.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.890
Jordan Winkleman from Lipson
Alport Glass & Associates.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.620
This is a question
directed towards Microsoft.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.070
Two parts.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.340
Number one,
is there ever any intent to have a

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.750
native Mappy client for Mac OS X?

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.960
So the answer to that question is
that Microsoft Entourage is the

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.100
solution that we're pursuing moving
forwards as connectivity with Exchange.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.100
Really, it's not about mapping the
protocol that people want.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.040
It's really the user scenarios that
you want to be able to function

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.100
in an Exchange environment.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.100
And we're going to move forwards with
making Entourage the preferred choice.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.130
And second, is there ever going to be any
resource scheduling such as you

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:48.500
could do in Outlook 2001 or on the
native Windows client so that you can

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.910
actually schedule conference rooms
and projectors and that kind of stuff?

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.840
Uh, let's see, at this point we can do
free/busy for other people,

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.000
but that's something we're
currently investigating.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Feature request?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Correct.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.470
Thanks.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:11.770
Philip Lauer from Lander Associates.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.390
I have a- had all those questions,
but one more is- this is for Microsoft.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:22.250
Are you going to support in a future
version of Entourage 2004 or whatever,

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.000
.pst support so that we can
move people from Outlook 2001?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.160
That's a great question.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.840
Some- it's a- it's feedback
that we've heard a lot recently,

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.400
especially since we've
launched Entourage 2004,

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.600
and that's also something that's
currently under investigation.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.000
So, for a lot of feedback about that,
thanks.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.670
Thank you.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:41.670
Mark?

00:32:42.100 --> 00:34:11.700
[Transcript missing]

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.780
Okay,
we're going to take a question here.

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:20.590
Yeah, Bryant Drescher from the
LDS Church Curriculum Department.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.560
Just a couple comments and
questions about GroupWise.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.390
We've just been recently using that
GroupWise client there from Novell,

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:29.480
and we're really pretty happy with it.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.820
We're glad to hear that you're
putting in some Notify support.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.370
We've got people right now running
the old Notify and Classic so they

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.360
can get notified of their messages.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.760
So that's- the sooner you can get that,
the better.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.460
We have noticed a little bit
of problems with stability,

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:46.600
and we hope that's one of
the things you're working on.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.800
And one of the things we've specifically
noticed about stability is it has some

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.320
problems dealing with PostScript fonts.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.880
If there's a PostScript kind of font
and it's expecting a true type font,

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.520
it seems to not like that.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.240
So just a little bit of feedback on that,
and thanks.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.690
Hi, I'm Mike Dhaliwal from Loyola Press.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.960
I've got a question for Microsoft.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.950
We're currently migrating
from Exchange 2000 to 2003,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.000
and I'm wondering,
with the Entourage 2004,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.750
which is a great client so far,
when we can expect Kerberos

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.100
support for the client?

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:45.500
[Transcript missing]

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.270
We tend to pick really bad technology,
so right now we're standardized

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.280
on Corporate Time by Stalker.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.140
They were recently bought out by Oracle,
and now we can't even find anyone

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.860
there who'll sell us more licenses,
so we're kind of looking to migrate.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:02.860
Now, I'm sorry,
I have to disqualify Microsoft from

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.870
the question because our network
guys are rabidly anti-you.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.180
It's nothing personal.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:12.130
But can anyone else import Corporate
Time stuff so I can transition my users?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.100
I'm actually not familiar
with that solution.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.250
Our support people can typically
help you move any type of

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.660
standardized text mail formats,
if it's .eml files, for example.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.290
And you might have heard that we
do support directory services,

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:34.660
so we can import via LDAP if you have
users in some kind of an LDAP database.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.060
We could probably help
you do that as well.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.510
Yeah, it's not really a user thing.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.510
It's more of a- it's only
a calendaring solution,

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.510
so I'm trying to get
the stuff out of that.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.510
Actually, it's not a solution.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.510
It's only a calendaring problem.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.590
If there's any way you can use
some kind of syncing device,

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.000
I don't know if Corporate
Time supports Palm or something.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.310
That's the only way that we've seen.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.840
Make it happen.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:01.040
Basically use your Palm,
sync your calendaring over to your Palm,

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.320
and then basically upload it back
to whatever solution you pick.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:04.730
Okay.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.880
I was hoping to avoid that, but thanks.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.320
Yeah, thank you.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.310
It's not easy.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.360
Okay, Jason Perel again from
the University of Iowa.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.960
With the Entourage client,
it seems that Microsoft is keeping

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.640
things separate from the system,
such as like the address book

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.090
is separate from the one that's
integrated into the operating system.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.530
I noticed that the
SSL certificates- or sorry,

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.060
not the SSL certificate,
but the personal signature certificates

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.660
are stored in a separate keychain file
rather than the user's own keychain file,

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.480
and it's not reading
the keychains- or sorry,

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.490
the certificates from the
person's keychain file.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.730
You have to go through
the client and import it.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.550
It doesn't automatically
detect it like mail.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.100
And there's also no way
to edit server-side rules.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.400
So is that something that you
guys- I guess you guys are always

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.140
looking to investigate things,
but I mean,

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.150
is that something that you definitely
are going to be working on?

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.910
Jason Perel: Well, actually,
so let me take on the first

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.990
one about the system- the
synchronization of the address book.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.090
Actually, one of the sessions I plan
on attending this afternoon,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.300
and you'll probably see me there,
is about the sync services one.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.300
That's pretty exciting in my opinion.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.840
And so, you know, again,
it's under investigation.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.950
The sync is good, but can you use it?

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.650
Because you should just be able
to use the address book framework

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.400
and not have to sync between
two different data stores.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.990
You should just be able
to use the address book.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.110
Jason Perel: Right.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.320
Yeah,
but sync services is what we're going

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.160
to be investigating in the future.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.200
As for the certificates thing,
I'll have to take that offline.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.770
I'm not too familiar with that.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.800
And your third point
was- Server-side rules.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.300
Jason Perel: Oh, server-side rules.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.290
I don't believe you can modify
those in Outlook Web Access.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.290
I don't believe you can modify
those in Outlook Web Access.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:44.120
And so, because of that,
we- I don't know if you're familiar with

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.900
how Entourage is actually communicating
with the web- with Exchange.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.800
It actually uses WebDAV,
which is what OWA uses.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.800
And since that's not
particularly exposed,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.800
you know, that's something we can't-
we're limited to right now.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.180
But the Exchange team is
committed to moving forward with,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.500
you know, WebDAV compatibility.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.300
So it's something that might
be possible in the future.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:02.790
Jason Perel: Okay.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.700
A lot of sites would
like to see MAPI support,

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.040
even though we don't like MAPI,
but that's the preferred way

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.100
to connect through Outlook.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.230
So we'd really like to see that happen.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.700
Thank you.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.860
And back in the front.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.460
Yes, Louis Donofrio from
University of Michigan again.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.880
Can I ask a question for
the Microsoft guy there?

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:30.100
How do you handle no reliance on
the OWA backend for Exchange support

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.100
a la native MAPI for OS X?

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.560
Well, that's not particularly- well,
we rely on WebDAV, so, I mean,

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.630
basically- Yeah,
but it's like it's a different

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.100
way to package a browser.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:45.570
I mean, like scheduling a meeting,
you're just making the WebDAV calls.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.000
We want to find out from you
when there's going to be no

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.680
reliance on the WebDAV backend.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.310
Well, being that we're not
planning to pursue MAPI,

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.160
I mean,
we are going to use WebDAV in the future.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.940
I mean, that- we worked with
Microsoft Exchange team and,

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:00.380
you know,
we're going to use WebDAV in the future.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.450
And, you know,
that's what they recommended because

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:05.040
even they're trying to think about
moving away from MAPI as well.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.590
So, WebDAV,
which is based on open standards,

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.330
is the way to go in the future.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.100
Okay, thank you.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.100
Hi, I'm Matt Willis, eCornell.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.460
This is to the Stalkker folks.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:21.070
First thing, thank you very much for such
a great product because it's

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.990
doing wonderful things for us.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.100
And love it on OS X.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.600
My question is the newer versions
that are currently in development

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.780
with the SIP and voice messaging
and that kind of stuff support,

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:39.100
will that be able to
integrate with iChat?

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:44.090
Or is that going to be basically a
MSN messenger only kind of feature?

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.840
Well,
we've been in contact with Apple about

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.570
getting iChat AV to be SIP compliant
so that way we're able to provide

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:54.100
something for the OS X users.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.200
And I'm hoping that we get it
since I don't want to have to go

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:01.090
from my desktop to my laptop just
to have that chat functionality.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:03.100
Okay, thank you.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:43:09.900
[Transcript missing]

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:15.940
: Hi,
Alan Sanderson from Cambridge Antibody.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.940
Question for Stalkker.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.530
I saw in the slide from Stalkker that
the Entourage is only supported- well,

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.610
on the slide,
Entourage is a POP-supported client.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.540
Strictly, right now, as it stands,
it is POP and IMAP,

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.700
though it is capable of
recognizing ICS files for invites,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.730
but right now the calendar aspect
does not tie into the central calendar

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.690
on the CommuniGate Pro Server.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.220
I was just wondering,
because we have been using Stalkker for,

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:43.700
I don't know, 10 years,
12 years or something.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.700
Great product.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:49.490
But recently when we started
using Entourage for 10,

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.900
when we did a send mail,
a lot of our users are

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:56.700
getting a disconnect and the
Entourage crashes and burns,

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:00.700
leaves the outgoing message
in the outgoing box.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:04.700
And we have only seen that with
Entourage on the Staulkker side.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.700
I was- Make sure you talk to me after the
conference so we can go over those items.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.680
That would be great.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.690
Thank you.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.700
Thank you.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.700
Gage Boschmann from
Apple Enterprise Consulting.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.700
Two questions.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.690
One for Philip from Staulkker.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.620
Last time I checked,
the LDAP support in CommuniGate

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.610
Pro was a separate LDAP database.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.890
Do you guys have any- have you looked
into integrating it into OpenLDAP?

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:31.090
I'm not aware of any plans to
integrate it into OpenLDAP,

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.400
but again,
it's one of those items where you

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.930
can probably take this offline and
see what is necessary there since

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:39.090
we've made some modifications to the
LDAP integration within CommuniGate

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:40.340
Pro in the last few releases.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.330
Okay.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.850
Also, just wanted to say you
guys are doing a great job.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.720
Really happy with the product.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.960
The other question is
from James from Kerio.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.560
I mean,
I'm more familiar with CommuniGate

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.890
Pro and been very happy with the product.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.200
Kerio looks- 6 looks really,
really interesting.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.750
One of the things I- a lot of
my customers are looking at with

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:06.140
CommuniGate is they're looking at
deploying the cluster solution.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.940
Have you guys- do you
have anything like that?

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.880
Are you looking at doing any clustering?

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.930
We're actually looking at supporting
the Exan technology that Apple's

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:17.900
been so great to have some good
sessions on here at the conference.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:21.880
We're going to spend, hopefully,
a lot of time in the next

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.700
few months to support that.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:28.200
So that people can have their
availability that they need for

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.400
their server and their peace of mind.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.900
But yeah, it's- right now,
you can do simple clustering with,

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.100
you know,
an offline server sitting around on

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.400
the side and we're trying to work
with Apple to make that satisfactory

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.900
until we can support Exan completely.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:44.720
Okay.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.010
Thank you.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.820
John Welch, Kansas City Life.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.740
This is kind of a request from Microsoft.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.940
Working at a company that we're
actually looking at moving away

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.420
from MAPI because we've discovered,
like a lot of people,

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:02.810
that the requirements of it make it
a security risk of rather high note,

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.560
and it's very hard to deal with,
and firewalls and that,

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.940
and since WebDAV works over, well,
the web.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:13.120
One thing that I've noticed, though,
with a lot of Exchange administrators,

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:16.260
it's that they're kind of the odd
parallel to the Apple Stripe admin

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.000
who knew nothing about networking.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.620
They don't know anything about email.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.000
They know a lot about Exchange.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
And so when you start talking
about non-MAPI clients,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.130
they lock up because, you know,
it's almost like the hands

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.990
go over the ears and unclean,
unclean.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
If you guys could get the Exchange group

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.660
put out a white paper too about
working with Entourage that was

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.400
authored by the Exchange group.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.060
They expect it from the Mac BU,
you guys write Entourage.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.030
A lot of Exchange admins
just see Mac BU and go,

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:50.260
"Oop, evil." But something coming
from the Exchange group saying,

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.580
"No, really, it's okay.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.060
It's not going to crash
and burn your server.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.000
It's a good thing to do," would
help a lot of people out a lot.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.810
Yeah, that's an excellent suggestion.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:08.320
I'll definitely follow up with
the Exchange team on that.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.310
Thanks.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:10.180
Thank you for the feedback.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.220
On the back.

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.100
I have two queries.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.600
David Colville from Key Options.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.710
One is any sort of web access.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.570
We've been hitting real
issues with IsoServer from

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.760
Microsoft with authentication and
just getting the proxy working.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.660
Now,
it's not really your particular problem,

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.880
but obviously it just means
that for any web mail issues,

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.940
we get a lot of problems with
IsoServer with our Mac clients.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:35.260
And my other question across the
board actually is probably for

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.230
single sign-on for Kerberos support.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.740
I know Stalkers talking about
developing it in some of their betas,

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:45.720
but I'm just interested across the board
if I get sort of some feature requests

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:50.470
or statements on when you actually
might see some sort of support for that.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.950
We have a care-birth support in our
product for both Active Directory and

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:56.980
Apple Open Directory.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980
Perfect.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:03.890
We'll be starting seeing more of
it with the release of 4.2 and 5.0.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:17.380
We have it in first class as well
with the new module directory

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:17.380
services supporting OpenLDAP.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.340
Daniel Kreitsch from Momentum Marketing.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:27.470
My question is for Kerio, OpenText,
and Stalker, because I'd rather host this

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.690
solution if you guys offer it.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.800
You guys talked about email and
calendar and all that functionality.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.070
I'm looking also,
do any of you guys provide

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:37.700
document management,
document collaboration,

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.570
the ability for multiple offices
to see the same PowerPoint,

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:44.730
same Word document,
work on it in one space instead

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.640
of multiple revisions being
mailed around to each other?

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.860
Document versioning and tracking
is going to be available.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:58.370
It's on our roadmap and a future version,
but we do have some facility at

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.340
this time to do document tracking.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.610
You may want to talk to me
after the session about that.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.370
It's also something that we're
looking at specific to documents,

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.210
but as far as our public
folder support goes,

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:14.700
especially through our webmail,
you can have a single storage place for

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.290
messages that can have any number of
documents accessible by any number of

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.650
appropriate clients with authorization.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.960
So, it's a public folder or personal
shared folder that you don't

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.790
actually have to send a message.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.450
Once it's in there,
the appropriate people can access it

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.050
from their web client and access it.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.740
Actually,
it's supported in Outlook as well

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.850
through the Outlook connector.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.980
Folder sharing as well,
so that way it can be shared

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.150
between those people that have
appropriate access controls.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.760
We're also looking at
with Windows Messenger,

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.710
the ability to pass off control
of an application for an open

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:52.500
file through the built-in
functionality of Windows Messenger.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.280
Thank you.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.140
Hi, Andy Espo.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.130
I'm a consultant from Boston and
I had an observation directed

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:04.510
towards Microsoft and I think
everyone will probably agree with me.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.740
As a consultant,
I like to try to do my troubleshooting

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.820
through the web first just to
avoid the queues in support.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:17.200
And I have to say that the support
website for MBU is absolutely unusable.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.210
There is virtually no information there
and if you go to try to search for

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:25.300
support on any of the Microsoft products,
you get a little smattering

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.280
of the Microsoft products.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:31.320
And then it shoots you off into
the general support site and

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.240
you can do a search on Macintosh
and you'll get something that

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.370
has nothing to do with Mac.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:40.130
And trying to find real hard
information to support problems,

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:44.040
it just winds up directing more
people towards phone support.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.300
Yeah, I definitely hear you on that.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.400
We- our website support
documents is something,

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.860
you know, as I said earlier,
like we're publishing new documents.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.520
We're really- we've heard a lot
of the feedback about how hard

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.540
it is to find support there,
and we're definitely looking to revamping

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.060
that by publishing more documents.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:06.050
Another great resource is hosted
by our- some of our customers.

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.690
It's called the Entrage MVP FAQ.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.870
And if you just search in
your favorite search engine,

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:17.500
Entrage MVP and FAQ,
you're bound to find the website.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.150
And it has a lot of top questions
about Exchange-Entrage integration.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.600
And it's, you know,
hosted by our customers.

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.980
So a lot of it's, you know,
a lot of it are real-world problems.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:27.360
Thank you.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.250
Thank you.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.250
In the back.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.920
Hi, my name is Vinay Varghese.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.830
I'm from
Cornell University Medical College.

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:41.260
My question to you is about address
books and basically finding ways

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:47.250
of publishing address books,
both personal address books and basically

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:53.760
departmental address books in an-
ideally in a- in an LDAP-type directory.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.580
And this is something that we've
really been stumped on in finding a

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.460
product that is truly cross-class,
that has a lot of value.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:57.910
And so I just wanted
to ask you about that.

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:58.470
And if you could tell us a
little bit more about that.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.970
And we'll get back to you
in just a few minutes.

00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:59.240
Thank you.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:06.340
and available to Macs and PCs alike
that our users are able to use that is

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:12.310
authenticatable and available both over
the web and through their email clients.

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:16.100
Do any of you folks support
something like this?

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.910
Is it something that is
readily available now,

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.340
the products that you can recommend?

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.860
Do your products currently support it?

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:29.330
So the requirement specifically is to
have one's personal address book stored

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.020
in the directory and also to have a
departmental address book that a group

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:38.660
of people can share so that and that
we can control the permissions through

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:43.260
some kind of ACLs and ideally we'd
like to store it in an LDAP directory.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:47.880
Okay,
our product lets you have public folders

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.980
to which you can assign public contacts
for example if you wanted to create a

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:56.210
company directory and we have a built-in
LDAP server so that can be shared via

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:59.830
LDAP for example if you're with your
mail client on Mac but those public

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:04.410
folders are also supported through
Outlook client and through webmail and

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:10.710
again individuals can also create their
own shared contacts as we call them.

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.900
It's basically authorized someone with
the administrators help to access their

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:20.300
own clients again through those same
either the webmail or through Outlook.

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.750
Yeah, first class will include
Director Services in version 8,

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:29.000
which will do all or most
of what you dream about.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.750
So visit our website or
talk to me after the show.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.420
GroupWise does that as well.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:38.900
It does it on Mac OS X, Linux, Windows.

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.530
We use eDirectory and
we can go across Tree,

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.780
across WAN,
and there's a bunch of things if you want

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.980
to talk afterwards that you can do there.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:54:50.900
[Transcript missing]

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:53.250
So a lot of the requirements
you've described I think

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.940
can be solved by Exchange,
and as we've discussed so far,

00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:00.200
Exchange can be accessed
by a Mac and a PC.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:05.930
I think we also- Exchange also
exposes the information through LDAP,

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:12.440
so if that sounds like something
that would meet your needs as well,

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:12.440
I'd be happy to take that offline.

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:16.130
For the address books that are created
in web-based mail as well as through

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:20.340
Outlook via the Mappy connector,
those can be shared across the entire

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.240
system or between various locations.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.040
The LDAP server built in to
CommuniGate Pro can also contain

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:30.520
address book information that would
be accessible via LDAP searches or

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.160
via the webmail interface as well.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:33.750
Thank you.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.200
Thank you.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.950
Question for Microsoft again.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:42.560
What is your solution for integrating
with enterprise- or sorry,

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:45.540
Exchange instant messaging servers?

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:48.120
At this time,
there is currently no integration with

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.330
Exchange instant messaging services,
but that's something we've

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:54.340
recently heard a lot about,
and so it's something we're

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.330
investigating for the future.

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.200
Okay.

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.340
Thank you.

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.500
On the back.

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.500
Yeah, Alan Sampson,
Cambridge Interpol again.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.160
Quick question for you, JD.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.530
Why no meeting maker here?

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:10.570
They do the best collaborative, you know,
calendaring system.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.080
Good point.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.100
And I know Apple use it too, so.

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:16.100
Yep, thank you.

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:19.400
Hi, good morning.

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.800
Jess Frickholm, Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.960
Question for the gentleman from Lotus.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:28.630
We are looking to implement a
corporate instant messaging solution,

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.080
so obviously we're looking at same time.

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:35.590
I can see from the presentation here
that there's long-term goals for that.

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.720
I'm wondering if you
could comment on what,

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:40.560
if anything,
we could get in the next 12 months.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.080
Sure.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.160
So, if you notice the slides
that JD presented at the

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.440
beginning of this presentation,
we had a list of what we

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:49.290
call our extended products.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.070
So, we looked at DOMDOC,
we looked at Lotus SameTime,

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:56.310
and we've put a timeframe,
and we're committing to this timeframe

00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:00.010
to be able to give you this solution
within the 6.5.4 and the 7.0 timeframe,

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:02.080
which is going to be the
first half of next year.

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.430
So, for the Mac users who are running
the Lotus Notes client and are

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.440
looking for IM capabilities,
we'll be able to provide that

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.160
in the first half of next year.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.680
Okay.

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.740
That will be- Will it be a separate,
like a standalone application?

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.240
Correct.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.070
It will not be an integration
like we have within the

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:17.370
Notes client on Windows today.

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.270
It will be a separate,
very similar to what you see right now,

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.690
the SameTime Connect client,
which is separate,

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.100
but it won't be integration
within the inbox.

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.290
Thank you.

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.370
Sure.

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.430
Max, Kenneth Alexander from
Kerio Technologies.

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:32.970
Actually,
I have a question for Microsoft.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.740
You know, with the MSDN,
we as IT and we as developers can get all

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:43.190
of the Windows software that we need to
evaluate for deploying in our enterprise

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:47.190
and for developing our software,
except for the MacBU software.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.620
Is there any plans or is there
any reason that this software

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.730
isn't part of the MSDN,
or is there any plans to have

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:57.100
a similar project or product
that we can subscribe to?

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.950
Yeah, that's a great question.

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.450
And to be honest, I actually don't know.

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:07.000
Most of the CDN- most,
as you pointed out,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.300
all the software on the
MSDN stuff is- are for Windows,

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.250
and well,
that's not really useful for my Mac.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.460
You know, I- well,
I'll- we'll exchange information later.

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.060
I'll get- get you an answer for that.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:18.440
Great!

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.360
That would be great.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.060
Thank you.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.060
Okay,
thank you very much for- for attending,

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.060
and have a great Friday afternoon.

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.380
Thank you.
