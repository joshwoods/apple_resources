WEBVTT

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.140
Okay, good afternoon.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.130
My name's Doug Brooks.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.140
I'm product manager for
server hardware at Apple,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.580
and this session is XServe Deployment.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.970
If we take a look, two years ago,
actually at this conference,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.150
Steve Jobs gave us a little teaser
trailer of a new product announcement

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.520
that turned out to be announced
the following week in Cupertino.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.200
And that announcement
turned out to be Xserve.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.910
So Xserve as a product line
is just about two years old,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.580
and it introduced, you know,
Apple technology.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.550
You know, phenomenal at the time,
G4 processing power, great networking and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.360
storage capabilities,
headless management,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.280
remote management capabilities
in an Apple 1U form factor.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.500
Not only great technology,
we happen to kind of think

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.000
it looks good as well.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.380
But since then, we've come a long way.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.950
I mean, if you think about two years ago,
we just embarked on this journey.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.520
And you think of where we've come from
a hardware and a software perspective,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.500
it's quite a bit.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.430
Obviously,
we've introduced what we like to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.370
now call the slot load Xserve,
kind of the speed bump to the product.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.500
The cluster node bringing a
streamlined configuration.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.280
The Xserve configuration for clustering
and more compute centered applications,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.570
kind of removing the things
that you don't need for

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.580
nontraditional server applications.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.570
And of course, most recently,
the Xserve G5 in January bringing

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.980
G5 power and technology
into this 1U form factor.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.300
A big jump from there in just two years.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.950
And of course on the software side,
just amazing innovation.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.470
I like to think the original Xserve,
if you think about it,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.200
shipped with Mac OS 10.1.5.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.990
And since then, of course, Jaguar,
Panther, and of course this week hearing

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.100
about new features in Tiger,
just continuing to add to the pace of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.820
innovation on the server software side.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.620
And of course,
Xserve RAID bringing phenomenal

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.140
capacity and performance and a fiber
channel attached storage device,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.430
really breaking the price barrier for
protected high performance storage.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.870
And also when you look at
things like XSAN introduced,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.160
be shipping this fall,
bringing a SAN file system to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.800
Mac OS X with really excellent
storage and shared storage capability.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.230
It's going to really change
the way storage can be

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.400
deployed on Mac OS X server.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.770
And finally, third parties.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.180
We've had phenomenal third party
adoption in the server and enterprise

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.380
space over the last two years.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.090
More and more developers
bringing their products and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.750
their technologies to Mac OS X.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.280
It's an exciting growth in these
kinds of solutions and kind

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.270
of ways you can deploy Xserve.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.610
And so we see customer
adoption really taking off,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.710
especially with the Xserve
G5 bringing this power and

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.840
technology into the form factor.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.980
Really see customers very excited and
doing great new things with Xserve.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.740
Again, a lot of that has to do
with the G5 processor,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.860
bringing that computational capability,
that bandwidth,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.080
that throughput into that architecture.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.730
But we also think it goes
beyond that and look at the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.700
whole architecture as a whole,
really bringing balance of performance,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.440
storage, and networking.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.000
Along with remote management and
monitoring capabilities into just

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.180
a really well-rounded package.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.200
And of course we've had lots of
great quotes and reviews and this

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.730
is one of the ones that just came
out recently which I really love.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.820
It was a review in VAR business against
a Windows 2003 server and I think

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.470
the last line really sums it up.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.960
Too impressive to pass up.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.300
Just one of my favorite reviews recently.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.820
So just phenomenal reception
of Xserve in this space.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.680
And of course probably one of the best,
just it's really, really fast.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.640
So this is a review of Xserve G5
in computer world just recently.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.360
So what are we going to talk about today?

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.820
Well, first of all,
kind of the quick why XServe.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.240
Touched a little bit on that.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.300
Touched very quickly on just XServe G5.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.890
And then really going to the
deployment side of this product,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.420
taking a look at planning requirements,
deployment strategies.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.220
We're also going to hear
from some customers,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.530
including Apple's own IS&T group,
a little bit on how they

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.170
have deployed XServe.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.160
And along the way,
hopefully pick up some practices and

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.300
guidelines that may help you as you're
looking at the XServe deployment.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.420
So why XServe?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.700
Well, again, you know,
we really think with XServe

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.780
we've really kind of broken the
mold of servers in this space.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.090
Really bringing a great
mix of processing power,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.050
networking, IO, storage,
all into a phenomenal 1U form

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.630
factor with great value and great
capabilities of Mac OS X Server.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.920
And again, the G5 really has

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.740
raise the bar in capabilities for Xserve,
really bringing 64-bit computing

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.280
power that we're continuing to
tap into with Mac OS X Server.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.410
And a phenomenal architecture.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.210
With Xserve G5,
we've really redesigned the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.200
architecture inside the box to
really bring higher throughput,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.620
higher bandwidth into the system.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.470
It's not just about the G5 processor.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.550
It's about more memory bandwidth,
ECC memory capabilities,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.500
PCIX capabilities,
serial ATA hard drives,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.620
phenomenal networking bandwidth.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.180
And not just bandwidth,
but new features like VLAN capability

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.380
and more hardware checksumming
capabilities in the chipset itself.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.300
Just really bringing a
really server-based approach

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.880
into this architecture.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.720
and other really important fact and
we'll touch on this a little bit

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.190
more in the planning segment but

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.390
With the G5,
we really have a great advantage

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.550
in that for the processor,
the amount of power and heat

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.100
that it outputs is significantly
lower than the competition.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.000
And, you know, I like to joke,
you can put an Xserve anywhere.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.070
You can put it in your office,
you can put it on a shelf,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.960
you can put it really a single
Xserve just about anywhere.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.000
But when you start putting
several of these on a single

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.780
power circuit in an enclosed room,
you start to have to really begin

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.060
to factor out into your equation
the environmental impacts of that.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.170
I had a couple extra servers in my
office over the weekend planning for

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.500
some of the demos in this session,
and I had my door all closed up.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.100
Coming in over the weekend,
the room was quite warm.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.480
It just wasn't built for the kind
of cooling that's required to move

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.500
air through this number of machines.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.500
And that's just with the lower
power and heat output of Xserve.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.690
I also want to take a moment to
really comment on the thermal

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.470
design of the architecture.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.880
This is something we take when
we design these systems very,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.700
very seriously.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.420
This is a very,
very rigorous design in the

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.700
thermal and the cooling system.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.700
We're very much purist in this respect.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.540
It's a pure front-to-back airflow,
very intelligently

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.620
monitored fans and systems.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.030
We're leveraging the same technology
that was first introduced in the

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.700
Power Mac G5 with intelligent thermal
monitoring with thermal zones.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.000
And while we don't have
independent thermal zones,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.890
we have a tremendous amount of
monitoring and data coming off this

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.900
logic board to be able to control
how fast the fans should move.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
And we're very much
purist in this respect.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
It's a pure front-to-back airflow,
very intelligently

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
monitored fans and systems.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
We're leveraging the same technology
that was first introduced in the

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
Power Mac G5 with intelligent thermal
monitoring with thermal zones.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
And while we don't have
independent thermal zones,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
we have a tremendous amount of
monitoring and data coming off this

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.900
logic board to be able to control
how fast the fans should move.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.450
should run and make sure
everything's cooled to optimum

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.040
efficiency for best performance.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.510
If you heard a customer comment
in one of the HPC sections,

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.110
who just installed a
cluster of 64 machines,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.380
when he first came into the room,
he thought, "Oh, my God,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.250
these things were really loud," and it
turned out there were two Dell servers

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.240
in the corner that he left on.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.940
Turning them off, it was much quieter,
and that was a 64-machine cluster.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.410
So we're pretty pleased that
for the power and air that we're

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.160
moving through this machine,
it is as quiet, if not quieter,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.830
than the slot-load G4.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.300
This is a look at power efficiency.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.460
And this, again,
is a huge advantage as we look at this.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.160
The processor in the XServe G5
is spec'd at about 55 watts.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.850
So as we look at competing processors,
we see literally twice the power

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.140
performance going through those systems.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.220
And more power means more cost.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.360
You've got to pay for that power.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.460
It means more cooling required.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.370
You've got to pull the
heat out of the room.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.650
And kind of the corollary to thermal,
the heat of the system,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.850
is reliability because thermal
management goes directly into

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.610
the reliability of the system.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.300
Another thing about the XServe G5 is
one of the key differentiators about the

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.800
XServe is that this system is designed
from the ground up as a server platform.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.900
And that means not only really
striving at not just processor

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.500
performance but IO performance,
but it also means

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.900
monitoring and management.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.420
And with XServe,
I like to joke it's one of the most

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.820
instrumented 1U servers in the industry.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.640
We have, last count,
I think it was 38 sensors

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.050
on the logic board,
including 10 temperature sensors,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.650
8 fan sensors,
voltage and current sensors

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.250
throughout the system.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.280
We're literally monitoring
temperature of the incoming ambient

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.260
air through the front of the machine.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.360
We're measuring the
processor temperature,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.610
the core temperature,
the memory temperature,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.220
the power supply temperature,
the PCI temperature,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.940
which gives you outgoing
air temperature as well.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.360
It's just a very well monitored server,
and it gives you a lot of insight.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.840
Not only into how the
server itself is running,

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.350
but the general air flow
in your server environment.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.560
If the ambient air alone is
coming in and is too warm,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.460
you're going to know right away
there's an air flow situation,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.970
cooling situations in your data center.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.720
And of course this data is wrapped
up into our monitoring tools.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.330
Server Monitor really providing
point and click access into the data

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.660
coming off of XServe G5 and able
to monitor one or multiple servers,

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.590
get email alerts, kind of the quick look.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.440
Green is good,
yellow is a warning condition,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.760
red's an error condition.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.180
Being able to take advantage of
things like smart technology,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.910
being able to do pre-failure
analysis on the hard drives is

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.900
a key feature in Server Monitor.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.710
We've enriched Server Monitor quite
a bit with the new data that we're

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.980
now capturing off the XServe G5.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.600
So for example, one of the new tabs in
Server Monitor is the memory tab,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.320
which provides detailed error
reporting on ECC error counts.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.200
And we actually provide that
information by individual DIMM.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.090
So you can actually see what individual
DIMM might be flagging ECC errors,

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.850
should you see any.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.600
And of course, Xserve of course comes
with Mac OS X Server.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.370
So right out of the box,
unlimited client license and

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.140
our server configuration,
a broad range of server

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.040
services right out of the box.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.710
Been able to handle a vast majority
of traditional server capabilities

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.290
with everything you need.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.760
and of course with Tiger coming
we have new capabilities that are

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.140
being brought to the platform.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.350
And of course you've heard all this
week about Tiger so I'm not going to

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.040
need to go into any more of it here.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.770
But I will highlight one or two key
features that I think is going to

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.490
be useful as we look forward with
Xserve deployment with Tiger server.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.220
So let's go into a little
bit about planning,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.900
a little about some of the key
things that should be of concern when

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.940
you're looking at deploying Xserves,
even before you start kind of screwing

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.980
and gluing the machines together and
connecting them up to your network.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.510
So the first thing I want to
touch on is physical requirements.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.870
Being a rack-based system,
there are different things that

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.700
should be accounted for and
things that can be looked at.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.710
So let's start with that.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.570
So racking is probably one
of the most basic things,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.760
probably one of the things
you might take for granted,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.270
but it's kind of interesting
to look at some Xserve in

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.460
the scope of industry trends.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.270
The continual convergence in the
server space toward thinner and

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:02.470
thinner servers is causing changes
in the way systems are racked.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.860
We tend to see a lot more systems
put into a smaller amount of space,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.660
more room for cable routing
and things become very,

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.760
very important.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.620
Now with Xserve,
we've designed it to provide a pretty

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.800
wide range of racking capabilities,
but the reality is it's

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.780
a 28-deep-inch enclosure.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.150
We recommend a 30- or deeper-inch
rack if you're doing a four-post rack.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.440
It does support two-post racks,
of course, with Xserve RAID.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.520
Not exactly something you'll
mount in a two-post rack at

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.490
about 100 pounds a piece,
so really four-post

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.140
racks are ideal for that.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.440
and of course we provide all the
hardware needed right in the box

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.680
to mount those systems both in
English and metric threads in the box.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.180
A couple of really important
things to consider,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.420
even more so with XServe G5 is
that we're moving a tremendous

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.700
amount of air through the system.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.240
XServe G5 we've doubled the CFM through
the box than the XServe G4 is.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.360
So a pure front to back
air flow is really,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.540
really important.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.830
You don't want to put too many
units in small racks like this

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.300
that have an enclosed front.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.400
You want to make sure you have proper
air flow coming in through the front of

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.040
the machine and out through the back.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.860
That becomes really, really important.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.350
The other thing,
if you're planning deployments with PDUs,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.660
power distribution units
going up the back of the rack,

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.620
you really want to look at deeper racks.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.170
The new kind of data center
trend is becoming moving

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.800
from 30 to 36 inches deep.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.720
These tend to be the more popular
racks you see in data centers

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.220
that are being put in now.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.580
And those have the extra room you
might need for PDU deployment.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.490
The other thing that's important to
begin to think about if you're deploying

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.410
more than a few of these is weight.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.480
XServe itself is, you know,
it's a dense server.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.140
It's about 30 pounds a pop.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.760
But when you put a lot
of these in a rack,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.470
that's a lot of pounds per square
foot that you need to think about.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.750
And if you add XServe RAIDs to that,
that even adds more

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.420
weight per square foot.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.260
At Apple,
we have a cluster that we're installing.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.960
It's a 32-node cluster in our
executive briefing center.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.040
It's in a single rack.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.800
And when we met with the facilities
people about installing it,

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.790
the first thing they had to do is pull
out the blueprints of the building

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.940
and make sure we were over a beam
so that the floor could support it.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.020
It's actually something that
you might not think about.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.100
But with the densities that
are happening in servers today,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.280
that becomes an interesting thought.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.080
There's a great section.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.040
One of the kind of bibles for enterprise.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.770
Enterprise data center planning
is actually a book by Sun called

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.700
Sun Enterprise Data Center Methodology.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.360
It's in their blueprint series.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.280
And they talk about planning
for server deployments.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.480
And they tell a story
about bringing in an E10K,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.480
which is their big kind
of mainframe SMP box.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.210
And it weighs a couple thousand pounds.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.200
And they say if you wouldn't drive
a BMW 3 Series up on top of the

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.970
race floor in your data center,
you wouldn't want to bring

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.280
one of these boxes in.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.920
So it's the kind of things that
you probably don't think about the

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.470
floor being able to support this.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.020
But it's a great book.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.870
is something that starts to
need to be thought about.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.510
The other thing that kind of goes along
with racking is good cable management.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.900
And again, with the density and the
airflow requirements,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.660
these all go hand in hand
with good cable management.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.490
This is a picture of
an XServe deployment,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.940
not exactly fully cable managed.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.940
Another little story,
I was talking to a customer who had

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.860
installed the cable management arms in
the back of their machine and saw that

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.610
the airflow or the machines ran cooler
when the cables were properly managed.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.030
And they thought for sure the cable
management arm was part of the

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.940
cooling solution of the XServe.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.830
And actually,
it just turns out to be a benefit

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.370
of improved cable management,
being able to have air flow

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.980
through the system much better.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.710
So keep in mind, cable management is an
important aspect of that.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.120
You don't want to be blocking a lot of
rear panel room with cables and things.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.700
And with multiple network cables and
power cables and fiber channel cables and

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.180
all the other cables that you might be
running out of the back of the machine,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.070
in a one-use space,
that's a lot of cables

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.530
that need to go somewhere.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:09.500
So, again, good racking also means
good cable management.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.040
The other thing is just kind
of the core requirements.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.330
Now, I'll reference you to a
knowledge base article.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.120
We publish all this information
in our knowledge base.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.270
If you go to info.apple.com
and search for Xserve and BT,

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.880
you'll see all this data published
there in kind of gory detail.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.820
Xserve is very,
very efficient in its power and cooling,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.310
but yet you do need to account for it.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.870
These are some numbers for the
various Xserve configurations.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.940
We provide numbers based on stock
configuration as well as fully loaded.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.470
Fully loaded meaning, you know,
three hard drives running full

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.240
complement of memory in the system.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.220
And you can see numbers anywhere
from about 130 watts to somewhere in

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.100
the 290 watts of power consumption.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.300
And so, you know, it's a lot of work.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:01.260
It's somewhere between 400 to 900 BTUs an
hour in that range of power consumption

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.120
and heat output calculated by the Xserve.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.250
The power supply is
officially rated at 4 amps,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.010
although in typical usage considerations,
you'll have a hard time finding

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.090
it go above about 2.2 amps in
real-world power consumption

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.610
after you bypass startup current.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.840
As a matter of fact,
the compute node is very,

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.600
very efficient for the compute power
it delivers at full processor load.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.270
memory since that system
tends to be configured really

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.980
just as processor in memory.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.240
You know, 1.8 amps is pretty,
pretty common for that system.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.980
So all this information we publish
very explicitly in our knowledge base,

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.910
and I'll point you to
that for further details.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.730
Let's take a look now
at system configuration.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.990
How do I configure these systems?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.400
What kind of things
should I be considering?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.810
Pretty common things,
but one of the first and most basic

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.850
things is how many processors.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.100
So when we sell our systems,
we have two main server configurations,

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.800
a single processor and a dual processor.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.200
There's some memory
differences between the two,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.630
but the real differentiation between
the two systems and the two price

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.470
points is number of processors.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.360
And since the processors
aren't upgradable later,

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.250
that's one of the first decisions
that you'll have to make.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.500
Now, what's interesting about the G5
is it has so much performance.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.960
The single processor system now can
solve a much broader range of tasks.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.640
It's actually a very,
very powerful system for general

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.800
purpose server activities.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.250
What's interesting, though,
is I've talked to a lot of customers

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.960
who begin migrating from older servers,
particular G3s or early G4 models,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.840
up to Xserve G5s.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.060
And they're being able
to consolidate systems.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.450
You know, three or four blue and
white G3s into one Xserve.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.170
And so, you know, having the processing
power to back that up,

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.640
the storage throughput,
the networking throughput,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.180
compared to what those
systems are capable of,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.060
you have that flexibility.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.670
And, again, since we can't add a
second processor later,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.710
for situations where you
want that flexibility,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.980
that freedom of growth later, you know,
having that second processor is ideal.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.840
The other thing is.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.440
You know, the storage.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.720
Now, Xserve G5,
one of the differences between

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.440
that and the G4 is a change
from four drives to three.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.990
And that was done mainly to improve air
flow and meet the thermal requirements

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.440
that we had to meet for the Xserve G5.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.340
Now, the implications are that with
the larger serial ATA drives

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.310
that we're working with,
the actual net capacity

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.440
is still 750 gigabytes.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.440
You know, nearly three-quarters of a
terabyte in a one U form factor.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.440
There's actually a tremendous
amount of storage there.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.640
What it really changes, though.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.460
Is the way you deploy
your RAID configurations.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.220
So, with software RAID built in,
you can do mirroring and

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.170
striping built into the system.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.180
And we'll talk more about
RAID in a little bit.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.620
And then we offer 80 gigabyte
hard drives for basic boot drives.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.880
And so, between three drives,
you have a number of configurations.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.650
And, of course,
you always have the ability

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.820
to go out the back through
fiber channel to XServe RAID,

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.680
which gives you a lot more flexibility.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.570
You have more RAID level options.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.220
More capacity options.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.220
A lot of flexibility
through fiber channel.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.220
The ability to add
XSAN initially or later on.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.270
And, of course,
one of the big benefits is you can

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:20.500
have with XServe RAID is you can
have multiple servers attaching

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.220
to the same XServe RAID unit.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.710
So, as a simple example here,
we have four XServes connecting through

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.530
a fiber channel switch to a single
XServe RAID that we've partitioned and

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:36.220
sliced so that each has their own little
private volume on a shared XServe RAID.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:36.800
So, again, for the XServe RAID,
we have a lot of flexibility.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.450
So, again, for certain levels of storage,
this might actually be a better

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.800
solution than stuffing more
storage inside an XServe itself.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.380
As a matter of fact,
having independence of your data

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.660
independent of the server itself
gives you tremendous flexibility

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.190
as you redeploy servers,
change their roles, migrate services from

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.790
one server to another.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.800
This gives you tremendous flexibility
as you look at those options.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.790
I also wanted to talk a little bit
about the cluster node configuration.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.140
Now, as I mentioned up front,
the cluster node configuration

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.470
was really -- I think it was a
little bit more complicated than

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:03.790
it was in the previous slides.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:03.800
But it was a little bit more complicated
than it was in the previous slides.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.240
So, again, for certain levels of storage,
this might actually be a better

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.780
solution than stuffing more
storage inside an XServe itself.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.430
So, again, as I mentioned up front,
the cluster node configuration

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.780
was really designed and tailored
for compute applications.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.100
You know, traditional clusters,
high-performance computing

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.800
clusters and things like that.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.650
But what's interesting is that it
does have a role for other kind

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.800
of roles beyond just clusters.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.960
You know,
keeping in mind that the compute

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.840
node is a dual processor system
with a single hard drive,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.790
it becomes really interesting as kind
of the appliance version of XServe.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.800
It's really great for static services
like things like VPN servers.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.800
Network services.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.500
Things where you don't need storage,
but you might want the processing

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.800
power and the networking
capability that it provides.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.460
Now, one thing you do have to keep
in mind is that it ships with

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.800
a 10-user license in Mac OS X.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.520
So, you know,
you're probably not going to

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.800
deploy this as a file server.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.790
And it's really not the role there.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.350
And by the time you add that license,
you may decide just to go up to

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.790
the full server configuration.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:01.070
But for a number of other applications,
especially network services,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:06.150
application services,
where the limitation on the number of

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.340
file user connections has no impact,
all the other OS X services

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.740
are fully unlimited.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.770
So, again,
I use -- this is a great VPN server,

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.800
for example.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.800
And the 10-user license has no
impact on that kind of role.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.010
So that's something also that you can
keep in mind because you can get a

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.800
dual processor system for a lot lower
price and take advantage of that.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.700
and take advantage of those
features if it's appropriate.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.900
The other thing about these
systems is that you have

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.810
much greater RAM capability.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.300
And for applications that
really appreciate RAM,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.560
you have a lot more
headroom in the Xserve G5.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.160
With Panther Server, again,
we can put up to 8 gigabytes of RAM.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.960
It's ECC RAM,
so you have that protection there.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:54.480
And for applications that will
take advantage of that RAM,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.680
you have that capability.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.510
And of course, with Tiger Server,
being able to bring 64-bit

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.660
user space applications and to
allocate much larger memory,

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.460
we get even more capabilities as
we look down the road toward Tiger.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.360
Another thing I want to talk a
little bit about is networking.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:29.030
Now with Xserve G5,
we now have dual copper gigabit Ethernet

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.640
ports right on the back of the machine.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.370
They're very high performance
gigabit Ethernet ports with

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.940
a number of key capabilities.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.070
They have very large packet buffers.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.470
They have the ability to do jumbo frames.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:48.900
We've added VLAN capabilities into the
operating system for VLAN operations.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.780
And so the bandwidth that we're able
to provide out of the machine is much,

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.400
much greater.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.100
And of course,
you can add multiple port Ethernet cards.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.130
We have a single port
available from Apple,

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.500
multiple port cards from
other third parties.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.920
SmallTree Communications in particular
has a number of cards that are available.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:13.670
And so we're very excited to
see that coming to Tiger is

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:17.490
network link aggregation.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.460
So you'll see that in Tiger Server.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.640
I think that's going to give you
a lot more bandwidth out of XServe

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.300
G5 and be able to take these two
ports and provide more bandwidth.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.300
And of course you can also configure
it in a failover configuration.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:38.200
So that will be available to you
when Tiger Server is available.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.300
Of course that solution is available
today for Panther from a third party.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.300
SmallTree also has that
software as an add-on.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.440
So for people looking
for that capability now,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.770
you do have a way to add that
on to the operating system.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.690
And finally, a number of options that are
available directly from Apple,

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.090
most particularly some
of the new I/O cards,

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:05.290
PCIX SCSI card, for example,
dual channel Ultra 320 card,

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.030
particularly handy for SCSI-based
raids that you may have in

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.060
your architecture already,
and also very popular for

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.670
backup devices in particular.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.960
I want to talk a little
bit about load and usage.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.550
So this is a little bit of a table
out of a knowledge base article,

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.840
again,
that we published on our support site.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.560
And again, I'll point you to that article
for the nitty gritty details.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.500
This is a list of tested and theoretical
limits in the operating system.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.200
We've got a lot of people asking
about scaling guidelines and how

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.040
many users can I put on an Xserve.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.330
And the reality is that's a really
hard problem to answer without

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.080
knowing a whole bunch of variables
about your network architecture,

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.810
about the kind of data that
they're moving back and forth,

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.480
the frequency of IO operations
and things like that.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.890
So this table provides
kind of a baseline,

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.310
kind of the minimum,
maximum capabilities in the operating

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.230
system as the big guidelines.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.000
And then beyond that,
there have been a number of

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.060
kind of informal rules of thumb.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.350
There are a number of rules of thumb
that have emerged that can help

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.580
provide some further guidance on that.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.300
And I wanted to provide a few
here that I wanted to point at.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.350
From a file server perspective, you know,
one of the things that really

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.680
has heavy impact on the number
of users that a single server can

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.610
support is the network architecture,
the bandwidth,

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:32.420
and the size of files that are
being moved on and off the server.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.030
For example, you know,
a user moving Word files,

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.630
saving Word files occasionally is
a lot different from a user moving,

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.030
you know, 40 gigabyte Photoshop images
back and forth.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.130
With home directories becoming
more and more popular,

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.920
that also has a little
higher load on the server,

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:53.040
and that's something to
calculate into in mind as well.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.930
Also, the move toward more centralized
directory services is something

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.080
to take a look at as you're
setting up directory servers.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.040
The number of users who are online.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:07.090
authenticating concurrently become a
factor that you need to take a look at.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.760
What's interesting with XServe G5 is
that we've seen some pretty phenomenal

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.800
scalability on Netboot servers.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:20.330
We've seen the ability to put a lot
higher number of machines on Netboot and

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.660
some tests that we've been able to do.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.670
Still, that depends heavily on the
level of performance and the

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.620
networking that you're looking for.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:32.500
But we've had deployments where
we've put as many as 150 iMac

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.840
clients on a single XServe.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.740
And not that that's a
recommended configuration,

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.830
but to know that it scales
that high is pretty phenomenal.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.400
The other thing is QuickTime streaming.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.150
QuickTime streaming is another one where
you really need to be able to look at

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:52.070
the size of media that you're streaming,
the bandwidth that

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.320
you're able to provide.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.410
You're almost always limited by the
network bandwidth outgoing before the

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.980
server will be the limiting factor.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.910
So let's move on and talk a
little bit more about deployment.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.490
So we've moved from planning
on to actual deployment.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.380
So again, kind of the first thing is,
again, looking at the most common uses

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.420
that Xserve is deployed upon.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.840
And again, if you look at the list,
these are the services that are, again,

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.080
built right into Mac OS X Server.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.980
You know, the interesting thing about
this class of server is that,

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.440
you know, by far the most typical uses
are things like file and print,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.600
network services, mail services,
web services, email services.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.920
And we just have phenomenal
network services built right

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.240
into the operating system.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.270
And this is, of course,
some of the most popular

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.630
deployments used with Xserve.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.340
A couple of important things.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.170
I get asked a lot about
software installation when

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.540
you get a brand new Xserve.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.520
Do I need to go ahead and
reformat it right out of the box?

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.070
The configuration that ships in the
factory after the whole factory process

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.410
is actually the exact same thing
that you get right on the hard drive.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.190
But the reality is most system
administrators really prefer to

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.340
reload the operating system and
know exactly how it's configured.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.690
The other thing is the impact of having
to reconfigure the drives for the

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:19.230
software RAID levels that you're looking
for will require reinstallation as well.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.720
We're going to talk a little bit
about headless administration and

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.940
setup assistant in just a minute.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:30.520
But with the remote setup tools,
you actually have a very robust way to

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:36.020
completely setup and get your server
right out of the box without ever needing

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.300
to hook up a keyboard and a monitor.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.720
And these are tools that we've
worked really hard to make sure

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.440
that we're able to do that.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.820
Thank you.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:45.840
And of course,
software update provides an easy

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:52.820
way to get your server up to date
with the latest security updates,

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.060
software updates that are
available directly from Apple.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.820
The other thing is when you're
deploying multiple servers,

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.600
it's very common to image a single server
and clone that onto other machines.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.570
With the removable
drive modules built in,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.100
that becomes really,
really easy with the capabilities

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.600
right in the operating system.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.600
And of course with front panel target
disk mode being available to you,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.600
you can literally just with a short
firewire cable clone one complete

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.400
server installation to a second server
right using front panel firewire.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.390
So that becomes very handy.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.590
So speaking of front panel mode,
I wanted to provide a

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.720
latest update on this.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.390
One of the new capabilities in Xserve G5,
we've actually added a new

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.200
capability to the front panel mode.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.650
So by holding down the front panel
button on the system identifier

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.820
button on the front of Xserve,
we can perform almost all the

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.570
operations you used to be able to
perform by holding down special keys,

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:53.020
snag keys, zapping the PRAM,
target disk mode, things like that.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.460
This is also referenced in a knowledge
base article on our website as well.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.170
So obviously things like net
boot and capabilities like that,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.140
boot from CD,
target disk mode are available.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.230
You'll see though on Xserve
G5 we added a new one,

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.600
option number 8.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.930
We reserved that one for
future use and this is it.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.890
We've added a diagnostics mode
built right into the Xserve.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.130
And so by selecting a diagnostics mode,
you can actually have the

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.430
system boot up over the network.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.580
So we've added a new one called
Xserve Remote Diagnostics.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.300
It's a new feature on Xserve G5
called Xserve Remote Diagnostics.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.520
And it's particularly handy if you
have a larger installation of Xserves.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.800
What you need to do is
set up a net boot server,

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:45.720
turn on the net boot feature,
and put the diagnostics and activate

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.990
the diagnostics image on that Xserve.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.880
and David The diagnostics tools are
based directly on the tools we use in the

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.900
factory when testing our own machines.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:03.200
They're extremely thorough and some of
the most robust tests that are available.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.380
As a matter of fact,
some of the tests that we use

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:09.180
for testing the CPU and the
memory are absolutely phenomenal.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.650
There have been papers written on
the algorithms used that we use

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.780
to do things like testing memory.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.930
And so those tests are available
to you now directly through

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.940
these remote diagnostics tools.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.520
And so by holding down the front panel,
you can put the machine

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.000
into a diagnostics mode.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.690
If this machine's in a known running
state and you just want to test it,

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.360
by using the command line tool,
you can go in and activate it

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.550
and it will boot in diagnostics
mode and then return to the known

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.560
operating system when complete.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.260
If it is in an unknown state, you know,
you've got a machine,

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.610
you don't know if it's working right,
doesn't seem to be booting right,

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.300
you can use that front
panel mode to trigger it.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.860
And then trigger this from a machine
on your same subnet to run the client

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.500
to run those diagnostics tools.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.470
What's really interesting
about these tools is that

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.490
there's a configuration file.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:01.150
We provide out of the
box two diagnostic tests,

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.520
a short test and a long test.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.880
And one's kind of a quick peek at the key
functions and one's a much deeper test.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.010
These are text files that you can
configure and you can configure

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.840
these to run very specific tests.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.040
If you're really interesting,
you've got a new batch of memory,

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.380
you can run a new batch of memory
and you just want to run the

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.320
memory tests over and over to
test the integrity of your memory.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.150
You have that ability just
to help tell the test,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.640
create a custom file that runs just
memory tests and really burn that

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.220
memory in as you've added to the system.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.880
So very flexible and this is
something that we are really

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.640
excited to get into the system.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.350
So, I wanted to talk a little bit
more about remote management

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.930
and headless operations.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.980
One of the big things that we
did with the XServe G5 is that

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.320
we made the video card optional.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.800
And there's been a little
bit of issue with that.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:55.880
People who are used to having that
video card there in the XServe G4.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.140
This is something that we've been working
to and we're finally at the point where

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.530
we believe the remote management tools
are really robust enough to give you

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.300
a number of ways to manage the system.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.360
Now,
obviously for people who want the video

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.340
card and want to be able to use it,
for example,

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.890
if KVM switches on your network,
it's an easy option

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:15.570
to add to your system.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:18.800
But we've also worked very hard on
things like the remote management tools,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.240
the remote setup assistant to make
sure that you can do everything that

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.940
you need to do through those tools.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.370
So, out of the box,
you have the ability without ever

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.730
hooking up a keyboard or a mouse
to be able to rack the system,

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.060
power it up on your network
and set it up remotely.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.300
So,
that's a really good way to get started.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.240
And then, of course,
you can also use the remote setup tools.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.060
As a matter of fact,
with some of the new capabilities

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.980
that were introduced last
year in Panther Server,

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.040
you can take advantage of
tools like auto server setup,

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.820
where from a configuration file
either on a thing like an iPod,

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.140
a USB key, or even an LDAP server,
if you're setting up a

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.110
large number of machines,
the machines can go to

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:01.750
that reference file,
configure themselves automatically,

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.820
The other thing that becomes interesting
is Apple Remote Desktop for that

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.500
remote screen sharing presence
where you want to really have that

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.000
GUI management perspective but
want to be able to hit it remotely.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.930
Apple Remote Desktop really
becomes a great tool to use here,

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.460
especially the new version of
Apple Remote Desktop version 2.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.660
It gives you a number
of new capabilities.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.000
You can almost think of this
as a virtual KVM switch.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.180
So from a PowerBook anywhere,
you can connect remotely into

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.760
your XServe and manage it.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.040
As a matter of fact,
with the VNC capabilities,

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:38.160
you could even manage your XServe with
a GUI session from a PC running VNC.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.000
So this becomes very, very powerful.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.620
That plus the ability to run shell
scripts and push out software to a

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:49.420
large number of machines make it a
really attractive way to manage XServes.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.280
And it's something you might
want to consider adding to

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.500
your remote management tools.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.530
We'll do a demo in a little bit and
we'll be using Apple Remote Desktop.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.020
What's neat about what we've
done in the Xserve setup is we've

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.160
added Apple Remote Desktop right
in the remote setup assistant.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:08.380
So when you're walking through the
setup tools by turning on one checkbox,

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.840
you can automatically enable
Apple Remote Desktop for the system

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.290
administrator user that you create when
you go through the setup assistant.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.450
So from there on out,
you can manage the system completely

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.400
through Apple Remote Desktop.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.800
and of course for the command line users,
we have really made a lot of effort in

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.400
Panther to add more command line tools,
to upgrade the man pages and

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.890
really make command line a very
robust way to manage the system.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.440
So for command line users who
want to script and automate things

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.500
and really take advantage of the
management tools at that level,

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.900
that becomes a very equal
way to manage the system.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.130
As a matter of fact, a lot of people,
you might not be aware of this,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.940
but we actually provide
off our install CDs,

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.690
boot CD1, when you boot up that CD,
SSH is actually enabled.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.220
So you can actually install the operating
system and manage it from the CD at

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.060
that time while booted from the CD.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:09.250
The username is root, of course,
because it's a single user

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:13.420
on the CD and the password,
just like the remote setup assistant,

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:14.100
is the first eight digits of the CD.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:20.970
So that becomes an access method as well.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.280
I want to point out there's a phenomenal
command line administration guide that's

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.700
available from the server website.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:33.740
And if you're a command line user and
want to know all the subtle nuances of

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.950
some of the unique Mac OS X commands,
tools that might be a little bit

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.290
different from other Unix distributions,
if you're coming from a Linux or

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.990
a Solaris environment and want to
become adept at some of the unique

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.420
tools that are available on Mac OS X,
highly recommend the command

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.430
line user administration guide.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.470
It's just one of many,
many documentation pieces that we make

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.320
available on our website for download.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.480
But it really goes into the
depths of the command line tools.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.580
So again,
with the remote management tools that

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:10.560
we provide in the operating system,
server monitor for monitoring

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.000
the hardware and providing
in-depth view into Xserve itself,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.980
server admin and work group manager,
all these tools can be managed

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.160
remotely from another Mac OS X client.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:28.130
They work over an encrypted and
authenticated link and provide just

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.130
a great remote management experience.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.240
So with that,
I'd like to introduce Greg Smith,

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.300
who's going to come up and
help me with a demo here.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.560
So we actually have two
Xserves here on stage.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.870
And we're going to pull up
Server Monitor and take a look

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.480
at some of the new values that we
make available in Server Monitor.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.360
So looking at the first server here,
we have an info tab,

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.120
and we can kind of get all the
high-level information about this system.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.720
We see here that we have
a dual 2 gigahertz system.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.580
We have the serial number available.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.630
One button gets you a complete
Apple system profile report,

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.940
which is a great tool
for asset management.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.530
Some of the unique things that
are in the new version for

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.060
XServe G5 are the memory tab.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.760
As I mentioned, with XServe G5,
we now have ECC memory in the system.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:21.040
We're actually tracking ECC memory
errors by individual DIMM in the system.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.560
So should you ever see ECC error counts,
and they should almost always be zero,

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.400
but you'll be able to see exactly
what DIMM is causing those problems.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.940
And, of course, they're automatically
corrected on the fly,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.100
so you don't have to
necessarily worry about them,

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.090
but you'll be able to understand what's
happening with that individual DIMM.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.100
The power tab has added a tremendous
amount of more information.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.840
We have many more sensors on the board.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.360
We're able to monitor voltages of
many core ASICs in the systems,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.580
voltages coming off the power supplies.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.560
And one of the ones I really
like is the power pop-up,

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:59.590
which provides real-time calculated
power of the two CPUs and watts.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.600
So we're able to calculate voltage
and power coming right into the CPU.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.600
So if you pull in the power supply there,
go to processor power.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.200
At the top there, Greg,
on the power supply tab, go to power.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.200
There we go.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.280
We'll actually see in real time
the wattage being consumed by the

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.000
dual processors in the system.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.580
So you mentioned,
remember the earlier graph that

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.900
I mentioned that the processors are
typically about 55-watt max processors.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:29.230
Well, in idle, as they're sitting here,
they're barely in the teens, you know,

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.000
just sitting around idling.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.700
So, again, very efficient on power.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.100
Other tabs that are interesting
are the temperature tab.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.300
We have 10 temperature sensors.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.800
We can see the inlet temperatures
in the systems coming in.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.830
If you go to blowers,
we'll see the real-time fan

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.800
speeds in all the system.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.520
and David If you go to
the blower tab there,

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:58.060
Greg, you'll see the different blower
speeds that are in the system.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.110
Now, one of the things you may notice
on this system is that we have a

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.120
yellow light on the hard drive.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.190
So if we click on that,
we'll go instantly to the drive tab and

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.920
you'll see that we're running RAID here.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.780
The system is actually booted from a
software RAID mirror in the system.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.740
So we have two drives in the
system that were mirrored together.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.900
We actually failed one intentionally.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.190
You can see the rate status
is shown as degraded.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.480
So why don't we explore that
a little further if we go into

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:31.090
Apple Remote Desktop and go into a
remote control session on that machine.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.630
We can actually launch Disk Utility
and find out a little bit more about

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.090
what's happening with that system.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.990
If we click on the boot mirror,
we'll see on the RAID tab

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.500
that we have a drive missing.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.560
We actually lost a drive in the mirror.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.160
It's continuing to operate normally.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.860
What's interesting, though,
is now we need to solve that problem.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.950
Now, in previous versions of OS X,
we actually had to boot from the

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.820
CD and rebuild that mirror offline.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.790
Well,
one of the new features that shipped

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.380
in 10.3.2 that we got in for Xserve
G5 is the ability to rebuild a

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.320
mirror online while it's running.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.020
So if we go ahead and drag
that spare drive in the system,

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:13.280
go ahead and add it, and click Rebuild.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.940
and David What we'll actually do is
the rebuild process now lives in the

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.720
driver and it will actually go ahead
and begin rebuilding that drive.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.630
Now it's an 80 gig drive,
it's going to take about 30

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.090
minutes or so to rebuild.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.530
But what's interesting about
this is that we don't even need

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.760
to be running disk utility.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.350
We could actually quit out of disk
utility while that rebuild begins.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.860
and David Notice our
system is still running.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.080
We're starting that rebuild online.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:49.040
And we can actually begin copying data,
if we'd want to, copy data to that drive.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.350
Showing that the drive is
still fully operational.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.600
If we go ahead and launch Disk Utility.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.620
A little hard screening the screen,
right?

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.290
So while that copy is going ahead,
we'll go back into disk utility.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.380
Even though we quit out of it before,
you'll actually see that that

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.460
rebuild is continuing to take place.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.680
So while we're copying data,
we're serving data,

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.060
the system's still online.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.870
and David M.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:28.620
Schaffer will be here.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:28.620
I hope the copy and the RAID continue
to operate in parallel there.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.770
So for raid mirroring,
I think we got you covered with great

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.440
online rebuilding of that system.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.340
So that's the first XServe.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.790
We actually happen to have a
second XServe in that rack.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:48.600
And it has a little option in it
called the hardware raid card.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:54.540
So when we introduced XServe in January,
we announced that we're going

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.000
to offer a hardware RAID card.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.300
It's a PCI card that has a
serial ATA controller on it and a

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.800
processor to provide hardware RAID.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.970
It actually provides 0, 1,
and 5 capabilities,

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:11.640
64 meg of RAID controller cache,
and a backup battery.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.300
And I'm very pleased to say that
the software just went final on it.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.680
And so we're actually able
to demo that to you today.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.100
So the command line,
the tool to manage the hardware

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.840
RAID card is a command line tool.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.140
So it will be accessed and
configured through the command line.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.890
And so by SSHing into
the machine remotely,

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.740
we can actually take
a look at the machine.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.980
We have a system here that has
three internal hard drives.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.500
They're 250 gigabyte hard drives.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.600
And so we can see the three
volumes that are available.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.530
We actually, again,
failed a drive here to

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:50.240
show that it's degraded,
but it continues to operate normally.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.140
If we go ahead and look at
the configuration itself,

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:58.330
one of the unique features of the
hardware RAID card is it allows you

00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.900
to create multiple logical volumes.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:03.080
So what we did is we created a
50 gigabyte boot volume that's

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:08.770
RAID 5 protected and roughly a
450 gigabyte volume that's on

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.460
the same physical drives but it's
almost like a separate partition.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:16.140
And that's around a 450
gigabyte volume there.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.840
And we have both those
volumes available now.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.280
And again,
we're in the process of rebuilding

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.780
those because it's RAID 5 protected.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.700
We have that protection
available with the RAID 5 system.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.340
So we're very excited about that and
we'll be able to get that shipping very,

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.480
very shortly.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.340
is real and coming to an XServe near you.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.700
Thank you, Greg.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.030
We can go back to slides.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.300
Last thing I wanted to talk
about in the deployment section

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.890
was a little bit on backup.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:01.270
Now,
there was a whole backup session here at

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:05.420
the conference this year and hopefully
you had an opportunity to attend that.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.930
One of the big things that we're seeing
with backup is backup continues to be

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.600
a huge challenge in server deployment.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.840
The reality is that more and
more data is being kept online

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.760
for a variety of reasons,
including legal compliance reasons.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.270
There's more data being shurned, right,
when you're working with large

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.150
files or working with large content.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.950
The amount of data that needs
to be backed up on a delta

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.680
basis is becoming much larger.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:35.300
And the reality is that there are no
down times in server operation anymore,

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:35.960
right?

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.670
It's a 24 by 7 internet access world.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.640
There's always someone
accessing your website,

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.140
always someone accessing your data.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.960
So the fact is that the backup windows,
the opportunities for

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.160
backup are shrinking.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:51.340
The other really hard reality is that,
and I remember years ago,

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.980
I used to back up my entire
40 gig hard drive on a 40 gig,

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.350
40 megabyte hard drive, excuse me,
40 megabyte hard drive on

00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:59.810
a single 40 megabyte tape.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.620
It was really easy just
to back up everything.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.910
The fact is these large,
large hard drives just aren't keeping up,

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:08.040
or the tape capacities are just
not keeping up with these large,

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.330
large hard drives.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.500
And the fact is while RAID provides
tremendous data protection,

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.420
matter of fact, looking at the solutions
that we just looked at here,

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.810
RAID is not backup.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.210
Even a mirror,
if you get a virus or some kind

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.540
of corruption that appears,
it happens on both drives.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.660
So RAID is not backup.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.600
Great news is that we're seeing a
tremendous number of industry solutions

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.940
being available on the platform.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:34.460
And again, if you were able to attend
the backup session today,

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:39.740
you're seeing a number of enterprise
solutions available for anything from

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:43.510
single server local backup to work
group backup to enterprise backup

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.520
being available to you on Mac OS X.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.370
As a matter of fact,
the number of clients and server

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.220
solutions continues to grow.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.620
And we're seeing more and
more options available to you.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.360
The main thing I wanted to just
touch on is the growing trend

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.960
toward disk-to-disk backup.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.550
So with the capacity that our
servers are able to hold today,

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:06.540
alternative backup strategies
are becoming very important.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.960
And being able to do things
like disk-to-disk backup,

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.470
staging server backup to disk
for performance and speed

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:17.080
and quick accessibility,
as well as adding capabilities

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.660
like disk-to-disk to tape is
a trend that's not going away.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.920
We're seeing more and more
software add this capability.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.440
We're seeing more and more
software add this capability,

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.140
which is becoming very, very attractive.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.550
The low price point of storage,
especially solutions

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:33.110
like XR-RAID become very,
very attractive for this class of backup.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:36.330
So it gives you a way to
provide massive backup at very,

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.020
very high rates of speed.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:44.130
Something to consider as you look
at large backup requirements.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.490
Another thing I wanted to
touch on is high availability.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.890
If you've heard in some
of the sessions this week,

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:53.700
Tiger Server will add some
new availability options to

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.360
the server operating system.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.490
In Panther,
we continue to have IP failover

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:03.060
capabilities to provide a script-driven
failover operation between key

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.200
services running on your server.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.840
These are particularly
ideal for static services,

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.130
so not things like file services,
but more things like streaming

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.700
services and web services.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.840
These are built right into the operating
system and give you a great capability.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.380
If we look at it from
a diagram standpoint,

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.720
you can have a master server and a backup
server with a heartbeat between the two,

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:29.230
such that if one interface should fail,
the services would fall over

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.520
to the secondary server.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.020
Because it's all script-driven,
you have the ability to reprioritize load

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.780
or even terminate load that you may not
want to keep around in that situation.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:44.990
It gives you a very flexible way
to... to manage those services.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.550
What's interesting, our tools like rsync,
now the IP failover architecture

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:53.420
itself doesn't move data,
but with added services like rsync,

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.660
you have the ability to
replicate data between services,

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.700
between servers themselves.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:02.770
As a fact, you can use it for two-way
replication so that you have failover

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.610
both ways between two servers,
as an example here.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:11.220
What's also very interesting is that
as we see technologies like XSAN come

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.520
to the market later this year,
it's going to give you a number of

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:20.890
new ways to be able to scale out
services across multiple servers.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.010
So being able to provide much higher
availability across a higher number of

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.540
servers for higher performance allows
you to think kind of differently in

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.730
the way you deploy your servers and
your storage in a large environment.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.430
Okay, so we talked a little bit
about XServe deployment.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:45.160
What I would now like to do is introduce
two guest speakers who are going to talk

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.600
a little bit about their deployments.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:51.590
First customer I'd like to introduce
is Eric Senf from F&W Publishing.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.600
He's going to talk to you a little
bit about how he's using XServe.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.460
Eric.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.500
Thank you.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.980
I'm Eric Senf.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.800
I'm the system support team leader and
network engineer at F&W Publications.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.500
During the last year,
it's been very exciting some

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.970
of the technology opportunities
that we've had with,

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:20.930
or some of the opportunities we've
had with this new Apple technology.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.690
We're one of the oldest and
fastest growing special interest

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.660
publishers in the world right now.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.660
We publish nearly 60 magazines.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:37.040
We've got a huge book operation and
our portfolio is continuing to grow.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.200
Because of this,
this is placing a load on storage

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.530
server growth across the enterprise.

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:47.810
We've got operations
currently in Cincinnati,

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:56.040
Iowa, Wisconsin, Devon, England, Boston,
Denver, New York, Savannah, and Herndon,

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.780
Virginia and growing.

00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.800
About 1100 employees total.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.500
Across these 10 locations we've
currently got about 75 servers.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.790
We only have on-site IT presence
at two of these facilities.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:16.740
We rely very, very heavily on remote
management and administration.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.550
We've also got a highly
heterogeneous Windows 2000

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.170
Active Directory based environment.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:28.380
We're running Exchange, SQL Server,
which we're doing heavy

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.100
database publishing from.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:33.660
We've got Suns, AS400s,
and we're running the

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.970
Oracle Financial System.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:40.240
We're about two-thirds PC,
about a third Mac.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.280
Two-thirds of our Macs
have been moved to OS X.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.960
We've got about 10 terabytes
of online data right now,

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.180
and that's growing at a very rapid pace.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:58.620
The first application that we've
got with the XServe has been in an

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.000
enterprise file print service sector.

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.780
Right now in our Iola,
Wisconsin office we have a

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.720
single Apple XServe and XRAID.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.340
We're running OS X Server 10.3.

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:19.540
We're configured to do both
AFP and SMB file services.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.150
The neat thing about this is we're
fully integrated with our multi-domain,

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:28.410
multi-site Windows 2000
based Active Directory.

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:33.130
Services that we're providing,
we've currently got over

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:37.700
one terabyte of production
critical data on these systems.

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.660
It's continually being
accessed by over 100 users.

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:45.350
We're backing these
systems up using Windows,

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:50.810
a Windows 2003 backup server
running Veritas Backup Exec 9.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.340
and our pre-press director is currently
begging us to move the rest of his

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.380
production data over to these servers.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.690
The benefits that we're
getting from this,

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:05.520
this is drastically less
expensive per gigabyte than any

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.540
other solution that we've had.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:12.400
We've got higher performance than
any other platform that we've used.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:16.720
We're seeing real world,
probably five to 800% performance

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:31.510
increase in this migration
at about a third of the cost.

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:41.330
This has also brought another
interesting aspect into our organization.

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:46.100
This is the fastest server currently
in our environment to backup.

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:51.620
Now again,
we are using a Windows 2003 backup server

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:58.100
running Veritas Backup Exec 9 and their
agent on the XServe to do our backups.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.100
So it's integrated in with the rest
of our enterprise backup solution.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.740
One volume alone that we were
struggling with was our book

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.090
production volume in Wisconsin.

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:13.690
We cut an almost 24-hour backup
window down to 8 hours once we'd

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:16.690
moved the data over to the XServe.

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.990
Another exciting thing that we've been
doing with XSERVs because of their

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:32.180
really low cost and high performance
from a CPU standpoint is enterprise

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.690
spam and antivirus filtering.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:43.400
We've got two Apple XServes with a gig
of RAM running OS X Server 3.3 or 10.3.3.

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:47.470
We're using one of the leading
open source antivirus solutions

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:54.090
and we're also using an open source
anti-spam solution called ASSP.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.800
We are geographically diverse and
load balanced with our servers.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.850
The services that are currently being
provided from this are enterprise

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:09.770
wide antivirus and spam screening for
multiple email domains doing hundreds

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:12.060
of thousands of messages per week.

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:16.400
And as everyone knows with all
the wonderful joys of email,

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:19.500
those loads are continually going up.

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:23.620
Some of the benefits that we've
gotten from this is it is a stable,

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:27.310
high performance, open source platform.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:31.350
Small one-use server footprint so
we're not putting large appliances

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.600
or configurations in our data center.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.400
And this is tens of thousands of
dollars less than any other vendor

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:44.190
solution that we considered and
evaluated since it's based on open

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:49.860
source software and leveraging the
performance of Apple's servers.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:58.230
In summary, bringing the Xserves into our
heterogeneous IT environment has

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:00.760
improved performance and reduced cost.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:07.820
Again,
everything that we brought this in,

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:07.820
saving tens of thousands of
dollars on email screening,

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.020
5-800% performance increase
at a third of the cost.

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:14.870
It's really impacting our IT bottom line.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:17.850
We're continuing with
further deployments,

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:21.520
remote office deployments of
the servers because of ease

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.800
of administration remotely.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.700
But one of the things we're most
excited about are the new features

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.530
that Tiger are going to bring.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:34.580
With the ACLs, or active-based security
on the file system,

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.790
failover clustering,
and cross-platform file locking,

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:42.100
this is giving us an
opportunity to take not only our

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.870
publishing and production data,
but our business data,

00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:49.720
and move this and consolidate
this down onto Xserves and use

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:53.750
this as our enterprise-wide
file print server solution.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.160
Thank you, Eric.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.200
So I'd now like to
introduce Richard Moon.

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:12.540
You've heard a lot about this week.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:17.400
If you may have heard reference to
servers in the sky around .Mac services,

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.400
you may be wondering where those
systems are kept and operated.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:27.550
And Richard is responsible for data
center operations and our ICT group.

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:30.270
He's going to talk to us a little
bit about Xserve deployment there.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.600
I'm here to talk about
the RxServe deployment.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.680
I'll tell you a little bit about
our ICT environment at Apple.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.190
Just give you a brief.

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:46.040
We have a large data center.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:51.600
We, ICT for Apple,
does all the infrastructure

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.570
support for all of Apple globally.

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:59.310
We have three major regions, Europe, US,
and Asia.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:07.000
Our US data center supports SAP, CRM,
the Apple retail stores,

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.290
Apple store online, iTunes, music store,
and the .Mac globally.

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:16.390
We have small server rooms in Cork,
that's for Europe,

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:18.620
and in Singapore for Asia.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:23.760
And these just support small,
they support email and language

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.680
specific things for the regions,
as well as maybe like

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.100
VPN and that type of thing.

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:33.000
I'm going to steal Eric's line.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.280
We definitely were asked
to drink our own champagne.

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.730
It's a much better term than
something about dog food.

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:47.050
Currently we have about 300 Xserves
deployed and about 18 XRAIDs

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:49.720
deployed in our data center.

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:54.650
Here's some of the uses that
we're using for web servers,

00:59:54.650 --> 01:00:01.740
web applications servers, DNS, FTP, VPN,
home directories using AFP, NFS servers,

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:05.890
SNMP mail relay servers,
email broadcast servers,

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:07.740
so things like that.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:11.740
Emails are coming from E-News, iTunes,
New Music Tuesdays.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.740
Those are coming from Xserves.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:18.910
Messaging servers,
Java application servers.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:26.950
and David So the biggest challenge,
the biggest migration for us off of the,

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:30.570
in the data center, so in our data center
we have a lot of AIX,

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.920
IBM AIX hosts and Solaris environment
for a production data center.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.040
Our first gain for the XServe,
migrated XServe was off

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.460
of the Sun hardware.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.260
This has been a substantial
savings for Apple.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:50.980
The performance from going to a
Sun to XServe has been amazing.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.730
We have a lot of servers,
web servers are running virtually idle.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.640
The speed is excellent.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.470
And this was a, we were really surprised,
we over architected the environment.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:07.020
We weren't sure of what the performance
would be like and the stability in that.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.880
So we do all our web servers
and web objects in clusters,

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.000
sitting behind a load balancer.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.070
So if we were to lose an XServe, we,
the business wouldn't be impacted.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.620
We do have to have maximum uptime.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.270
And then we were very surprised
with the speed and the uptime.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:32.420
And we actually are, have done,
started deploying many web servers on

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.360
a cluster because of the performance
and the XServe can handle it with ease.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.460
In the past, XServes for us,
because we run a lot of

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:47.860
Java applications on XServe,
our limitation was on the memory.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:47.860
And with the XServe,
we had to run a lot of Java applications.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.960
And with the G5 XServe,
that's not going to be a problem.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.190
Our standard configuration,
because we are standards based, you know,

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.750
because we have a data center,
is to run dual CPU,

01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:02.340
at the time it was all four drives,
varying with two gigs of memory.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:07.940
So moving forward with the G5 XServe,
we're going to be deploying dual G5 CPUs

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:12.670
with two gigs of memory and eight gigs
of memory as a standard configuration.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:15.350
And then that way,
any Java applications that

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.080
require a lot of memory or any,
you know, a lot of memory,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.560
we're going to be able to run them.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:16.740
And then we're going to be able to run
them on a lot of different devices.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.140
And then we're going to be able to run
them on a lot of different devices.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.750
And then we're going to be able
or any applications that do

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:22.700
require a lot of member footprint,
will migrate to those.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:28.100
Yeah, sorry.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:03:53.100
[Transcript missing]

01:03:55.490 --> 01:04:00.340
This is a current photo of the
Xserves in our data center.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.420
We call it the Xrow for it's on display
because we do a lot of tours and that.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.240
And actually we're migrating off of this.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.880
All these Xservers are going
to move into a new area,

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.500
a new part of the data center.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:16.570
And we're actually going to go upon
recommendations to hot and cold rows.

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:22.060
So the fronts of the Xserves or even
other data center equipment will actually

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.060
face out for all the cool air to come in.

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.860
And then go through the back and then
the air will rise and go up out the back.

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.530
So that's a recommendation
that we're taking advantage of.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:38.080
And this is another close
up view of our deployment.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.600
So how we're managing monitoring is,
so our primary tool for the

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.800
data center is HP OpenView ITO.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.800
They currently don't have an ITO agent,
but we were easily able to get that

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.660
brought into our monitoring tools.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.200
We just run a Perl script
that is able to grab,

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.480
gather the information,
the same information if you're

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.500
using ITO on other platforms,
supported platforms.

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:07.270
And then we also take advantage
of all the Apple server

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:10.700
applications like server monitor,
remote desktop,

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.500
RAID admin tools are very, very useful.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.190
And those with ITO, we're able to monitor
the systems closely.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.400
In our production data center,
we use Tivoli Storage Manager for

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.990
backup and recovery.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.390
We worked with Tivoli to beta test
and make their software much better.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.800
And so now there is an agent for.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.790
The agent for OS X on Xserve.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800
And that's what we have.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:47.230
Our view of the Xserve or any server
in the data center would be we want

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:48.900
to treat everything the same way.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:53.560
And we treat OS X as
any other Unix platform.

01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:58.800
So in summary,
we've been extremely pleased with

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.040
the performance of the Xserve.

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:05.710
We were really caught off guard at
how well it was going to perform.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.260
I'll take a step back here.

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:10.690
So we currently have about
24 Xserves in a cabinet.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.350
And the reason why we decided to do that,
not to go with a full rack,

01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:15.580
because some issues with power and space.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:19.260
But then we used to have a lot
of towers as well in the past,

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:21.300
the G3s and G4 towers.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.960
And you could get eight in a cabinet.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.370
So we wanted to save a lot of,
make a substantial leap and save a lot of

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:31.240
foot space by going to 24 to a cabinet.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.920
So you get a three to one ratio there.

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:39.670
This coming year, we're planning to add
about 80 to 100 Xserves.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.330
We're going to add between
60 and 80 XRAIDs as well,

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:46.940
because the storage is cost
effective and very useful.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:50.870
We have a lot of projects that
I couldn't list because we're still

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:55.420
in the process of migrating those
from other platforms to the Xserve.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.660
So the number is just going to grow.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.860
And I also want you to know,
whenever you go to Apple.com

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.600
or store.apple.com or even
the developer conference here,

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.180
all that is served by Xserve.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.060
And lastly,
I just want to make sure that everybody

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.010
takes advantage of filing bugs.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:14.290
And the team does a really good
job of keeping track of those

01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:15.960
and working on your issues.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.120
And they're definitely listening.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.080
Thank you.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:09:12.800
