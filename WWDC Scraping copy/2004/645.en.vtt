WEBVTT

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.060
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome now to the stage,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.300
Eric Zelenkka.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:26.300
Good afternoon.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.290
Thank you for coming to
our presentation today.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.370
We're going to be talking a
little bit about Mac OS X Server,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.300
specifically the Tiger Server release,
and some of the new great features

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.300
and capabilities that we are
introducing in this version.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.830
You've heard some of the
capabilities talked about in some

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.900
of the earlier presentations,
but there's plenty of other wonderful,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.130
great features that we're
going to go into today.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.450
So, as you know, with Mac OS X Server,
we've been rapidly innovating upon

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.040
this operating system for some time.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.120
Several years ago, back in 2001,
was the first new release

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.300
of Mac OS X Server.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.300
That was the 10.0 version.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.270
We introduced that at the
2001 Developers Conference.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.480
Later that year,
we came out with the 10.1 version,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.300
had a number of improvements
and upgrades there.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.030
At the same time, we, you know,
later that year,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.300
we came out with the XServe.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
We announced the XServe,
the XServe platform.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.250
It was a platform that a lot
of people were asking for.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.300
They wanted a purpose server,
a purpose-driven server.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.100
They wanted something that
they could mount in a rack,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.510
that they could run this wonderful, new,
great server operating

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.300
system that we were building.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.160
In 2002, we finally shipped the XServe,
and we've been innovating and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.300
continuing to deliver upon the XServe.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.900
Also in that same year,
we delivered Jaguar Server.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.380
So Jaguar Server was a
wonderful release for us.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.440
We introduced a number
of new capabilities,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.320
not only with Open Directory and
Netboot and Network Install,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.790
but a number of great features
for education markets and

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.970
also higher education,
which was at that time kind of a

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.700
new area for Apple that was going
into the enterprise more and more.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.920
Then just in 2003,
we had some upgrades to the XServe.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.220
We introduced the XServe Cluster Node,
which again was a purpose-built

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.710
machine just for high-performance
computing applications.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.710
We also introduced the XServe RAID,
massive amounts of storage.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.820
Panther Server was,
if you were here last year,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.700
we were talking about
Panther Server at that time.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.500
This year we're talking
about Tiger Server,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.940
but Panther Server continues to
be the server operating system

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.860
that we're shipping today.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.360
In this presentation today,
we'll be talking about a lot of the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.580
capabilities that are in Panther Server,
and then the new improvements that

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.330
we continue to make on top of that.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.740
Other innovation that we've
done earlier in this year,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.140
we shipped the XServe
G5 back at Macworld,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.030
and then also introduced the new XServe
RAID with 3.5 terabytes of storage.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.180
Two new wonderful products
that we're also introducing

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.980
is Apple Remote Desktop 2.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.680
Everyone here should have a
copy of Apple Remote Desktop.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.330
I encourage you to take apart your kits
when you get back to your hotels tonight,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.390
install it on your systems,
and play with it.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.000
This is a full release of
Apple Remote Desktop 2.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.860
It's a wonderful new upgrade,
and in the sessions later this week,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.670
you'll hear a lot more about it.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.070
Also, XAN,
which is our storage area network file

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.960
system for Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.880
Again, there'll be a number of sessions
about it later in this week.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.470
and now Tiger Server.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.920
So let's get into Tiger Server and
talk more about what we're

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.790
doing with the operating system.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.020
But first,
how are people using this operating

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.960
system that we've been building?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.560
Well, let's look at some of the customer
adoptions that are out there.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.120
Initially,
we had a lot of deployments in education.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.890
This picture here is of
a high school district,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.060
K-12 high school district.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.740
They are doing a lot of servers.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.800
I think in this specific situation,
it's a lot of network home directories.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.610
This is a screenshot or a
picture of University of Tokyo.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.700
This, although there's no
servers in that picture,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.760
there are 1,600 systems here, all iMacs,
and they're net booted, disklessly,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.210
off of our servers.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.990
1,600 systems,
disklessly net booted off of

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.020
X Servers or any Mac OS X Server.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.700
Here's another deployment
in the United Arab Emirates.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.040
Again, I think this is a video one.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.610
Virginia Tech using a lot of the desktop
management tools and utilities that

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.560
we've introduced in the operating system.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.620
Core feature animation.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.540
This is a Shake render farm.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.040
They're doing videos, animations,
all again using Shake with

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.390
Mac OS X Server.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.130
is a laboratory in Singapore,
high-performance computing,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.190
computational clustering deployment.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.970
Another one in Princeton.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.180
This is an interesting one.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.700
This is a space observatory in Germany.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.920
Again, taking a lot of data coming
in off of satellites,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.950
taking in data from their
telescope systems that they have,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.810
analyzing that data using the
computational power that we have with

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.360
the X Serves and the easy-to-use,
easy-to-manage operating system that

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.850
we've delivered with Mac OS X Server.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.960
Even in Apple's data center,
we're using this server operating system.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.500
If you've ever connected to .Mac
and using some of the applications

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.320
and services that are up there,
whether it's your iDisk

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.740
or those types of things,
you are connecting to our servers,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.830
our server operating system.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.960
It's kind of that drink your
own champagne type of thinking.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.690
And we've even got customers
who are doing really crazy

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.050
things with these servers.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.930
I'm not sure what these guys are doing,
but they are having fun,

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.970
so that's the good news.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.570
So we see our servers
deployed in lots of areas,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.580
and we're trying to deliver a server
operating system that's flexible,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.160
that can be used for lots of
different types of deployments.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.970
As we go into enterprise spaces,
there are specific types of

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.590
applications for specific purposes,
and you'll hear a lot

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.350
about those as we go on.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.060
You've probably seen this
slide a number of times.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.050
This really is our strategy.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.100
We're building upon standards,
open source,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.360
and we're innovating upon that.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.760
But if you look at our goals,
what are we really trying

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.990
to do with this product?

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.670
Well, we're trying to make
our servers easy to use.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.150
We want to make them very
easy to set up and deploy,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.940
especially if you've got a couple of them
or hundreds or thousands of X Servers.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.420
We want to provide a really good server
for Macintosh and Windows environments.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.000
There's a lot of departments,
a lot of workgroups out there that

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.800
can benefit from the services that
we provide in this operating system.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.680
We want to make it easy for our systems
to integrate with existing networks,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.000
and we want to take some of this
open source movement that's going on,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.660
innovate upon it, integrate it, test it,
and make open source very easy to use.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.330
And so, again,
you'll see that throughout the product

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.120
and as we talk about some of the new
features that we're introducing today.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.550
So let's take a look at Tiger Server,
what we're delivering in Tiger Server.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.500
First of all, before we go into the new
services within Tiger Server,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.420
let's talk about the fundamentals
of the operating system.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.120
When we look at the
server operating system,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.110
there's really two sections.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.980
There's the core operating system,
the Core OS.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.180
That's mostly the Darwin or the BSD,
the low-level components.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.840
And then on top of that,
there are a number of services

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.880
that we have built and we
are designing and delivering.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.920
So I'm going to talk a little bit
about the core server operating system.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.300
There are six major areas of
the server operating system.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.700
We have the kernel and
the networking components,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.840
our directory services and
network authentication layer,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.950
which we've taken normally
as a standalone service,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.980
and we've dropped that down into
the core of the operating system.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.160
The libraries, the utilities,
security infrastructures,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.900
which normally would be like just
a service that's a standalone

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.710
service right on the OS,
we build down deep into

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.460
the core of the OS,
and even high availability services.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.020
So if you look at the kernel,
we continue to innovate on

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.440
top of the kernel and the
Darwin architecture that we have.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.190
It's combinations of
various versions of BSD.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.480
One of the new features that
we're talking about here a lot is

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.150
support for 64-bit applications.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.750
So within Tiger Server,
we now have the capability of

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.120
running 64-bit applications.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.300
And this is especially useful for
our server customers who are doing

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.000
lots and lots of number crunching.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.520
They've got some very large
numerics that they're dealing with.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.060
They need to hold lots of
data in memory at one time.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.670
So now we can actually allocate
up to 64 bits of memory,

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.350
and your application can take
advantage of all of that.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.200
On the networking side
of the operating system,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.120
we've got, as Bertrand mentioned in his
presentation earlier today,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.650
this is a BSD-based
networking architecture.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.120
For server use, we have capabilities
like IP multi-homing,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.010
so you can have multiple interfaces,
assign IP addresses to each

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.240
of those various interfaces.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.280
Jumbo frame supports
for dealing with very,

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.430
very large packets.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:07.750
Innovative things like IP over FireWire,
so we can have high bandwidth,

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.840
low latency interconnects.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.700
One of the new features we're introducing
for the networking... Thank you.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.250
in Tiger Server is support
for Ethernet link aggregation.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.340
This is compliant with
the 802.3ad standard.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.290
What this allows you to do is take
multiple Ethernet links and aggregate

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.160
them together so you have increased
overall throughput to the server.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:57.340
It also gives us network
interface failover.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:57.340
So if one of those connections,
those physical connections were

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:57.340
to get disconnected or break
or something happened to it,

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:57.340
the link can automatically failover to
another cable or another link aggregate.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.080
So this can be used with
one Ethernet switch.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.450
It could be used with
two Ethernet switches.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.840
This is an excellent
feature for X Server G5.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.420
If you look in an X Server G5,
we have two onboard

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.720
gigabit Ethernet ports.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.880
Now, with the right type of switch,
you'll be able to aggregate those

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.780
ports together and get better
overall throughput to your server.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.380
I mentioned this directory
services architecture that we

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.690
call Open Directory that we've
taken and integrated in to the

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.520
core of the operating system.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.250
This is a way of basically
bottlenecking all user account and

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:43.400
authentication lookup requests,
bottlenecking them down deep into the OS,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.260
so that if you're using one of the
applications that Apple delivered

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.640
or a service that we delivered,
or you're building an application or

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.200
you're hosting your own application,
you can be using the same

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.630
sets of user account names,
the same sets of passwords that the

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.850
rest of the operating system is using.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.560
So we build this down
deep into Tiger Server.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.300
Also, the other layer we look at is
the Unix commands and libraries.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.000
There's lots of updates to these.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.900
We continue to try and keep the
server operating system up to date

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.710
as much as possible with the rest
of the goings-on in the BSD world,

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.760
make sure that we have the latest
open source components here.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.060
Bud Tribble mentioned earlier our focus
on security and making sure that the core

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.660
of the operating system is very secure.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.550
And again, there's a number of different
features and capabilities

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.720
that we have for security,
and some of them are listed up here.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.010
What's kind of different in the server
operating system is some of the high

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.600
availability components that we build in.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.960
If you have a server,
you want your server to be reliable.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.250
You want it to be up and
running seven days a week,

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.800
24 hours a day.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.340
You don't want it to have any problems.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.140
And if there are problems,
you want your server to do whatever it

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.570
can to try and fix those problems and
not have those problems to begin with.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.120
So there's some features that we
deliver within the product for this.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.360
As you know,
on the server operating system,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.200
we introduced file system
journaling a long time ago.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.950
We have support for
software RAID capabilities.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.280
Tiger Server, we now have even RAID 10.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.060
We have auto-restart capabilities.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.310
So your service, if your service dies,
we can restart your service.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.150
If there's a problem with the
entire server operating system,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.780
the hardware can actually
automatically restart.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.580
One of the features we delivered
a while ago was IP failover.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.650
And we're introducing a kind of a
next generation of IP failover today,

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.490
and we call it high
availability clustering.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.930
What this allows you to do is take
two X Servers that are connected

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:56.590
to the same shared storage and
have an active/passive failover.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.900
You can create what we
call a cluster pair.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:04.900
And you can create these pairs
and have them do the same thing.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.890
What we're automating in Tiger Server is
support for network file services.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.690
So your AFP, your SIFs,
your NFS file services,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.880
we're going to automate the
creation of these clustered pairs.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.900
So you can have two servers.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.890
If one of those servers were
to fail or was to go down,

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.900
the other server will automatically take
over the responsibilities for that server

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.890
in handling its network file services.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.880
So this is a great solution.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.900
As you'll hear in a
presentation tomorrow morning,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.900
there's a really flexible
network file system.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.050
There's a really flexible
architecture here.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.900
And you can build your own custom
solutions using this high availability

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.890
clustering architecture that we've built.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.500
So those are the six main
components that make up the core

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.200
of the server operating system.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.320
And now I'm going to
invite up Greg Burns,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.200
who's the senior director of the
server and storage engineering team.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.200
And Greg's going to take you through a
walkthrough of all the different services

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.140
that we're introducing in Tiger Server.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:07.200
Greg?

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.230
Thanks, Eric.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.830
So layered on top of the Core OS in
Mac OS X Server is a services layer,

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.090
and that implements the services
and the management that provides

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.410
the server features of the product.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.210
The services layer includes server
administration to make management of all

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.700
the services in Mac OS X Server easy.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.070
We have directory services to provide
naming and authentication to all the

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.340
servers and clients on the network.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.440
Cross-platform workgroup
and collaboration services.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.560
Client management to make management
and deployment of Macintosh

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.900
clients on the network very simple.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.850
Internet networking services.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.410
And new Integra server,
we have high-performance

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.020
computing clustering services.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.940
So first let's talk about
server administration.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.280
The server administration facilities in
Mac OS X Server integrate all of the many

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.050
open source products that we put into
the server and make it easy to manage.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.600
We have two main server management
applications in Mac OS X Server.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.990
Server Admin, which lets you configure,
set up, configure, and monitor all of the

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.020
services in Mac OS X Server.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.650
It also lets you manage multiple
servers from the same console.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.520
Workgroup Manager is our
directory management application.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.850
It lets you manage all of the user
and group accounts in the directory.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.600
It's designed to work
with Open Directory,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.640
but it does work with any LDAP directory.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.690
It also lets you manage all
of the services that are

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.740
configured out of the directory,
such as preference management

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.540
for client management.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.640
We're introducing a couple new
management features in Tiger Server,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.570
the first of which is
access control lists.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.890
We have several types of
access control lists in

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.960
Tiger Server for the file system,
for services, and for the directory.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.200
Now, those of you that are familiar
with Panther Server know that

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.030
it uses Unix permissions,
and Unix permissions,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.190
while they work well in simple cases,
have problems being mapped

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.280
to real-world workflow.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.510
If you have shared files on the
network and you need to be able to

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.450
set up groups of users who can write
to those files and other groups

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.950
of users who can only read them,
it's not really possible to

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.630
specify that with Unix permissions.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.450
So we have full support for
access control lists in the file

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.620
system to provide fine-grained
control over those objects.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.710
We also support other common
features that you would expect

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.780
from access control lists,
like groups within groups and full

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.130
lists of users and groups that can be
assigned to the file system objects.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.610
You can specify inheritance for the ACLs.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.280
And you can specify the access control
list for the file system objects.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.350
You can also have control over the
default permissions of objects that

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.940
are created in the file system.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.780
Now another area that can be difficult
in working with file systems and

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.630
different permissions models is being
able to work compatibly across multiple

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.500
different types of file systems.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.040
But because we support all of
the features such as inheritance,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.340
default permissions,
fine-grain permission settings,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.020
and allow and deny rules,
Mac OS X Server and Mac OS X can be

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.500
made to work in a compatible manner
with Windows Server and with Windows XP.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.690
So it simplifies working in
a cross-platform environment.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.480
We have other access
control in Mac OS X server,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.500
another area of service.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.520
In Mac OS X server today,
if you have a server bound to a

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.990
directory that has thousands or
even tens of thousands of users

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.630
and you set up a file server,
for instance, every user account in that

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.820
directory can log onto the server.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.380
Now, you can control permissions,
file system's permissions to

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.150
ensure that only the correct
users get access to your data,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.660
but in many cases you want to restrict
that only to a core set of users.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.490
And with Tiger Server,
we're introducing service ACLs so

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.220
that every user-based service in the
server can control the set of users

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.390
and groups that can access the server.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.260
You can have the same list for
all services on your server or

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.780
energy server independently.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.190
So that's service ACLs.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.780
And finally,
we have directory ACLs which are

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.250
global ACLs that allow you to
control who can access and update

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.160
the contents of open directory.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.620
And something that open directory
does different from other LDAP servers

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.280
is it stores these directory
ACLs in the directory itself

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.900
to allow them to be propagated
to the replicas by taking advantage

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:20.630
of open directory's replication.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.540
So that's access control
lists in Tiger Server.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.640
Another new feature we have for
management in Tiger Server is

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.100
certificate management.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.720
Now certificate management in X3
involved going into the command

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.720
line and it was different for each
service and although it could be done,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.600
it was sometimes somewhat cumbersome.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.540
So we've simplified this
greatly in Tiger Server.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.540
We've added certificate management in
the administration tools and you can

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.340
use this with certificates that are
signed by certificate authorities.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.770
And you can also use Tiger's
new certificate assistant

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.990
for self-signing your own
certificates in your organization.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.200
You can display all the certificates
you have available and assign them

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.080
to services or websites as necessary.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.690
So that's certificate
management in Tiger Server.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.630
Next up, we'll talk about Open Directory.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.000
Open Directory is Apple's
directory and naming service.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.890
It's standards-based,
and it implements LDAP naming services,

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.130
and it implements Kerberos
for authentication.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.230
We use OpenLDAP and MIT Kerberos.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.300
Kerberos is used to
implement single sign-on,

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.550
which lets you log in
once with one password.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.020
It's never sent over the network.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.880
And you get an authentication ticket,
which is good for all

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.110
services in Mac OS X.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.330
We also have a support for what
we call the password server,

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.000
which supports password
replication to all of the open

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.010
directory replicas on the network.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.400
And this includes replicating all
of the Kerberos support as well,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.260
so that you can have replicated
Kerberos authentication

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.870
across your entire network.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.940
We integrate Samba.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.560
With Open Directory as well to
provide MT domain services for

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.520
your Windows clients to allow
them to authenticate as well with

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.350
the same account information.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.850
And of course,
we mentioned all the replication

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.580
that's built into Open Directory.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.260
We have a couple enhancements
that we're putting into

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.840
Open Directory in Tiger Server.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.800
The first is managed network browsing.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.660
Now, what is this?

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.780
In 10.3 today,
if you have a large organization

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.830
and you go to network,
it can get somewhat confusing and

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.660
unwieldy and difficult to navigate,
and we fixed that in Tiger and

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.900
Tiger Server by allowing you to control
the contents of the network directory,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.780
and you can see you can greatly simplify
it and make it easy to navigate.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.920
We provide virtual network views,
which can be controlled by

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.460
the network administrator.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.390
The view is defined in
the Mac OS X Server,

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.020
and it's stored in the directory,
so any client that binds to

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.620
Open Directory will see the view.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.570
You can combine both dynamic service
discovery protocols for Mac and Windows,

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.520
as well as static entries that
are stored in the directory,

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.660
and you can even have pointers
to other entries that are outside

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.760
of your local network that
show up in the network folder.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.920
And we make it easy to manage.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.380
It's managed through WorkRoot Manager.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.980
Our directory management tool,
where you can create these

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.270
views and preview them.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.460
So this greatly simplifies and
makes it easier to set up the

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.280
network folder in your clients
in Mac OS X Server and in Tiger.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:26.910
We've also made some
enhancements to Open Directory.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.800
Some of which include, as we mentioned,
storage of the access

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.200
controls in the directory.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.990
Another thing that we're storing in the
directory itself is the LDAP schema.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.650
So the schema will now be
propagated to replicas as well as

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.220
the access control information.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.120
So again,
this greatly simplifies managing

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.170
multiple open directory servers and
simplifies the replication process.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.430
We're adding organizational unit
support so you can have multiple

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.720
independent LDAP data sets hosted
out of your open directory server.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.150
We're improving the scalability.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.760
We've tested up to 200,000 servers,
200,000 records per server.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.420
And we've added some tools that
really help simplify the process of

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.900
managing large open directory services.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.480
We've improved search and apply so
you can do batch editing of large

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.480
number of records in the server as
well as improving the import tools.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.300
And additionally,
since you need to back up all this data,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.520
we've built in hot backup command
line utilities that allow you

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.790
to back up your naming and
authentication database on the fly.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.830
And we've made some
enhancements to security.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.560
We have authenticated directory
binding in the server and the

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.000
client so that administrators can
control who accesses the directory

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.200
and you have mutual authentication
between the client and server.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:45.150
And we have the NTLMv2 authentication for
Windows clients to provide more security

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.990
for Windows client authentication.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.060
Another area of services
in Mac OS X Server is

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.000
workgroup and collaboration.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.400
Workgroup and collaboration services
provide for sharing in workgroups,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.530
and the most common of these, obviously,
are file and print.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.140
And like we do today, we support file and
print sharing for Mac,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.960
Windows, and Linux clients.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.670
This works for folders on the
file server as well as home

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.030
directories between Mac and Windows,
and sharing your network

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.920
printers as well,
so all of your local workgroup resources.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.770
These are fully integrated
in Mac OS X Server.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.020
All of the protocols can
share the same SharePoint,

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.590
the same shared folders.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.480
They use the same access privileges,
the same account information,

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.040
so you set it up once and the files
are accessible from all clients.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.870
The Windows domain services
are integrated as well,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.260
so the Windows clients have full access
to all of the resources on the server.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.660
We support Windows roaming
profile for home directory logins,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.750
and we have native print services
for both Mac and Windows clients.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.000
We made some enhancements
to work of services as well.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.300
Couple of these are unified file locks.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.700
Now we have file locking
today in Mac OS X Server,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.680
but we've enhanced this to make sure that
the file locking is consistent between

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.100
all the protocols so that no matter
what client you're logging in from,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.770
no matter what platform,
if you're accessing the same

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.680
data you get consistent locking.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.710
We've added --

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.150
We've added backup domain
controller support,

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.800
which exists today in Samba,
but we've added configuration for this

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.320
and then management tools to make it
easy to set up to provide read-only

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.400
failover for the Windows domain
services for greater reliability.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.340
And we've integrated the print
services more directly with

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.880
CUPS so that when you manage print
services in Server Admin now,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.420
you are managing the CUPS queues,
you're managing the CUPS printing.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.620
We've eliminated some of the middle
layers there and really had tighter

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.620
integration in print services with CUPS.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.480
And we've also added print
authentication so you can

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.440
control access to print queues.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.890
We've added a few new services for
work group and collaboration as well.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.800
The first is the iChat server.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.920
The Tiger iChat server provides
encrypted messaging for your

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.200
intranet and a secure namespace.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.080
It's based on Jabber
using the XMPP protocol.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.790
And it provides cross-platform support,
obviously with Jabber clients

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.660
as well as Tiger's iChat client.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.120
And because it's integrated
with Open Directory,

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.910
it provides a secure namespace for
chat within your local intranet.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.350
We also have a weblog server that we're
introducing in TigerServer as well.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.490
A weblog is a way of easily
publishing and syndicating

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.900
information on the internet.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.510
And what the weblog server does is
allow you to publish information

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.900
and syndicate it using standard
protocols like RSS or Atom.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.900
This morning you heard about Safari SSS.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.820
Our weblog server is completely
compatible with Safari SSS as well

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.900
as any other popular RSS reader.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.800
We have a number of features that
we support around style sheets

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:01.200
and calendar-based navigation
that people who manage weblogs can

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.900
control for their individual log.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.070
The logs themselves are automatically
created as needed for user

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.900
accounts in Open Directory.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.820
And you can post to them directly from
the web or from clients that support

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.890
standard protocols like XMLRPC or Atom.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.710
And another feature we have in
Mac OS X Server and TigerServer is

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.800
the ability to have group weblogs.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:20.980
Eric Zelenk,
Greg Burns We have a number of

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.370
features that we support around style
sheets and calendar-based navigation

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:21.900
that people who manage weblogs
can control for their individual log.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.520
The logs themselves are automatically
created as needed for user

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:22.900
accounts in Open Directory.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.900
as well so that people that are
doing shared project weblogs

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.510
can use a group account in
Open Directory to have multiple

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.480
folks have right access to a weblog.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.790
So now I'd like to have Eric come
up again and do a quick demo of

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.610
Weblog Services and Tiger Server.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.800
Thank you, Greg.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.440
So the Weblog server that we've
built into Tiger Server is

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.970
going to be a wonderful tool.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.800
It's going to allow people to
better syndicate or publish

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.960
their content out to others,
but also allow a new way for

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.720
groups to communicate information.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.530
I think one of the benefits of
RSS and syndication of information

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.410
is it makes it really easy to
communicate with the rest of the world.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.660
Part of the problem with it is
how do I get that information

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.330
out to the rest of the world?

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.480
How can I publish this information?

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.480
I'm not an XML expert,
so how can I create this data and

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.980
push it out to the rest of the world?

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.060
So let me show you how easy that
is going to be in Tiger Server.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.560
First of all, I'm going to launch the
server admin application.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.200
Server admin application here.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:27.870
I'm going to go to Tiger Server.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.930
I'm going to go in and
enter for the web server.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.660
It's very, very simple.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.720
I can go to the site that I'm hosting,
and with a simple checkbox,

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.120
I can enable the Weblog server.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.790
Next, let's go down to Safari.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.970
And I'll open up Safari here.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.560
Okay, let me log back in.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.800
So I've connected off to the
weblog server which is running

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.480
on this Tiger server box here.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.070
You'll notice a couple things.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.060
First of all,
I have calendar-based views.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.490
So with most blogs,
you need to be able to go back.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.160
It's time-based information.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.890
I can go to any date here on the
calendar and it will show me the

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.660
entries that were created for that day.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.540
I have the ability to search
within the various blogs,

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.420
search and return that content to me.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.790
You'll also know categories
that are available down here.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.000
So as I click different products,
I can get the information that

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.830
was posted into that category.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.670
So first thing I'm going to do is
in this view right here would just

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.880
be like the basic end user view.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.830
They're just going up there.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.950
They're just looking at the
data within the browser.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.220
Notice that Safari up
here displays the RSS.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.000
So this is actually an RSS feed.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.620
It notices that there's
RSS information that's available here.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.120
The links that are
available at the bottom,

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.860
by clicking one of those,
I will actually see the

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.980
RSS information that is there.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.160
And by clicking this in Safari RSS,
it actually gets displayed.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.920
I can also take this information
and download it to the desktop

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:06.320
or copy that RSS URL information
or XML information and put it

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.030
into some other type of client.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.520
So first thing I'm going to do
here is I'm going to log in.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:15.000
Now, the log in information here,
this is actually bound to a directory.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.700
So I could be bound to,
if the server's just running locally,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.560
I could just use the accounts
that are on that local machine.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.160
As Greg mentioned,
the server's typically going

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.730
to be... integrated with an
existing directory system.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.030
So we can take advantage of the user
accounts and namespace that's already

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.320
created for you within the network.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.350
So I'm going to log in here.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.080
Hopefully I remember the
right name and password.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.440
I did.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.590
I have the ability now,
as the owner of this

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.360
area of this web blog,
of creating a new category.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.720
So here's a new category here.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.960
So I'm going to create a new category.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.700
And I'm going to name this after iChat.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.260
Because I'm going to go and I'm
going to create an iChat entry.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.250
The next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to go and I'm

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.580
going to make an iChat entry.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.720
So I'm going to pick the
appropriate category here.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.260
and I'm going to go grab some text.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:09.530
So Steve made me famous this morning for
doing a video conference at 35,000 feet.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.560
Unfortunately,
I'm not famous for my product,

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.130
but that's okay.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.310
So I'm going to take
this information here,

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.060
you know, a little bit of text here.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.180
Let me copy some of this.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.660
and just paste the simple
text in and hit save.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.190
And then automatically I get an update.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.950
You'll notice that the weblog server
gives us feedback to the user that

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.830
says that the weblog entry was created.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.530
As users read this,
they can post comments to each

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.520
of the individual entries.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.070
And as an administrator,
I also have the ability to go back,

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:53.400
edit this information,
and delete it at any time that I see fit.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.160
So this is the new weblog
server in Tiger Server.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.060
Thank you, Eric.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.340
So that's Workgroup and
Collaboration Services.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.400
Now let's move on to Client Management.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.400
Client Management Services in
Mac OS X Server let you

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.300
easily deploy and manage large
numbers of Macintosh computers.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.350
We have Client Management Services that
let you control preferences

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.740
and capabilities on the client.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.870
This is called
Directory-Based Management,

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:27.290
or Preference Management.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.530
This is deployed via Open Directory,
and it's configured from the Workgroup

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.400
Manager application in Mac OS X Server.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.370
We also have System Imaging
Services that make it easy to

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:44.100
set up and deploy software on
systems throughout your network.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:44.100
NetBoot lets you

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.530
configure a single image or a
small group of image and boot

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.440
network systems from the server.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.830
You can also use NetInstall to
install those same images to systems

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.670
that are on the network as well.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.600
We've made a few improvements to
system imaging in Tiger Server,

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.960
the first of which is when
you create these images,

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.330
we now configure the open directory
configuration for your network in the

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.070
images to make it easier to deploy
the images without having to tweak

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.800
open directory settings afterwards.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.480
We also are supporting block copy for
software installs and NetInstalls to

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.670
greatly speed the net install process.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.520
And lastly,
we're allowing you to create bootable

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.010
DVD images from your NetInstall images.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.200
So you can install those images
on systems that are offline,

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.660
off the network.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:35.060
We have a few other services
that we're adding to client

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.980
management in Tiger Server,
the first of which is

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.560
mobile home directories.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.570
Mobile home directories
lets you take user files,

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.840
accounts,
and other information that pertains to

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:51.060
your home directory and sync it between
a portable and a network home directory.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.810
This synchronization occurs when the
portable is connected to the network.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.080
It occurs in the background
with trickle sync.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.690
And when your portable is offline
and these files are updated,

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.320
the files in your home directory
and your document folder,

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.240
your preferences, and they're updated,
when you connect back to the

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:08.680
network to the home directory,
they'll be synced back up to the server.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.420
So this allows you to maintain consistent
information between your portable and

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.960
your network home directory server,
and it also allows you to have a backup

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.280
of the contents of the portable on the
network in case it ever becomes lost.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.240
And because the account information
is synchronized as well between the

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.690
portable computer and the network,
the single sign-on on the network is

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.940
also brought down to the portable when
it's offline because all of the account

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.960
information and the authentication
information is synchronized as well.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.100
So that's mobile home
directories in Tiger Server.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.840
And Software Update Server,
we heard in the earlier session,

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:50.430
allows you to

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:55.420
Deal with an issue that we have today
where we have a lot of software updates

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.340
that make it very easy to maintain the
latest software on your Mac OS X systems.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.500
It makes it very convenient.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.950
But when we have a new update like
a Mac OS X 10.10.3.4 and you have

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.540
everyone in your organization downloading
that update the day it comes out,

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.610
it can create a real strain
on your network bandwidth.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.860
So software update allows you to
use Mac OS X's software updates,

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.930
but by providing a proxy cache server for
software updates also conserves network

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.720
bandwidth and makes it easier for you to
get those updates into your organization.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.320
It's totally transparent and automatic.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.470
When software updates become available,
they're downloaded to the server

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.560
and made available to the clients.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.110
But you have control as well.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:40.600
Some sites like to test the
updates to make sure it works

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.840
with their internal software.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.300
Before they're downloaded,
they're going to have to go

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:43.600
through a lot of testing.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.980
How do they make them
available for deployment?

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.180
And so you can either choose to make the
software updates automatically available

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:55.150
to clients as soon as they're posted,
or you can make that step manual and test

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.990
the updates yourself and then release
them once you're satisfied that they

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.940
work with your internal applications.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.700
Software update server.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.720
Internet and networking services
in Mac OS X Server allow you

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.370
to manage your network and host
applications such as web services,

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.800
mail, and Java application services.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.910
For networking support
in Mac OS X Server,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.800
we support DNS for domain
address name management,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.000
DHCP for IP address assignments,
NAT for connecting to the Internet and

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.800
for sharing IP addresses among systems.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.800
We support firewall for securing
your connection to the Internet,

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.040
and we support VPN to
allow remote clients,

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:44.460
whether they be Mac or Windows,
to access the services on your network

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.040
securely from a remote location.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.770
We've made a few enhancements to
networking services in Tiger Server.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.620
The first is site-to-site VPN.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.180
If you have multiple sites and
you want to have a secure LAN,

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.870
virtual LAN between them,
we now allow you to set up

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.360
site-to-site VPN between these sites.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.630
We do this over the internet
securely with IPSec.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.990
We've improved server management
with DHCP by allowing you to manage

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.000
systems that have multiple network
interfaces and handled address

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.900
assignment for those systems,
as well as handling static IP address

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.650
assignment in server admin as well.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.910
And we've improved the
workflow for DNS management.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:26.890
We've greatly simplified
that over the 10.3 release.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:31.500
Another area of networking services
that can be somewhat difficult is

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.210
setting up internet gateway services.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.840
This is fairly complex.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.500
There are a number of services
that all have to be configured

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.310
consistently with each other.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.560
And we've simplified this
in Tiger Server through the

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.780
Gateway Setup Assistant.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.500
This sets up everything you
need for an internet gateway.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.860
So it configures your DHCP and
your VPN address ranges,

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.330
NAT port routing, the firewall VPN.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.910
And it does it in just
a few simple steps.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.360
And so this is ideal for small sites,
small businesses that have a

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.480
connection to the internet,
for remote sites that share one

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480
DSL connection to the internet.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.480
It makes it very easy to set up
the server as an internet gateway.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.250
So I'm going to ask Eric to
come up again and demo this

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.060
and show you how simple it is.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.300
So one of the things that we wanted
to make easy in Tiger Server was

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.860
to make it much easier to set
up complex networking services.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.280
A lot of people are trying to use
servers for port routing or they

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:34.020
want to have one port on their server
for a connection out to the WAN,

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.370
another port for a
connection onto the LAN.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.090
But they've got all these different
services that they need to configure.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.870
You've got your DNS, your DHCP,
you've got your firewall,

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:47.780
you might be running VPN,
you've got to set up port mapping, NAT.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.240
There's a lot of different services.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.330
So in Tiger Server,
one of the things we're making

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:55.760
it much easier to do is set up,
easier to set up all these

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.660
disparate different services.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.710
So within the server admin application,
you can now select the

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.450
gateway setup tool.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.760
What this will do is it's an assistant.

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.180
There we go.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.660
Let me try that again.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:17.840
There we go.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.100
So the Gateway Setup Assistant tool
allows you to configure your

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.900
server for use as a gateway.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:26.900
It's a very simple assistant.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.900
It kind of walks the user through
what needs to be done to the server.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.600
So the first thing you're going to
do is select which port you're going

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.710
to use as your port for the WAN.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.500
This might be a cable modem,
broadband connection using DSL,

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.670
or those sorts of things.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.920
Next,
you're going to configure which LAN port.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.180
So if you have an XServe and you have
another built-in gigabit Ethernet port,

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.660
that might be something you select here.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.630
Obviously, I'm on a desktop system here,
so I don't have multiple

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.460
built-in Ethernet ports.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:06.660
Then what the Internet Gateway Setup
Assistant is going to do is it's

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.280
going to give me a summary of the
configuration changes it's going to make.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.490
So it tells me,
here's what I'm going to do.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.140
I'm going to set up this port.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.680
I'm going to turn on port mapping.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.940
I'm going to configure your DHCP server.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.310
I'm going to set up NAT.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.480
I'm going to turn DNS on for caching.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.210
And if I hit Apply here,
it's actually going to

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.810
reconfigure this machine,
so I will lose some

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.400
networking capability here.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.230
And now it's done.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.240
So now what I can do is I can go back
into the server admin application.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.870
And within this application,
a number of services have

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:39.880
been turned on for me.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.340
So I can go into the firewall.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.710
I can go into its settings.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.650
And I can see that the
firewall settings have been

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.160
automatically configured for me.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.550
Within DNS, I can see that here.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.160
NAT is stopped there.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:51.820
Now it's running.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.990
But what it does is it
automatically configures up

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.520
each of these services for you.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.990
So again,
another really innovative feature

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.560
that we're delivering in Tiger Server,
make it very easy for people to use.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.590
these complex network services.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.100
Internet services in Mac OS X Server.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.560
We had a broad range of
internet services in 10.3,

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.880
and of course we've
carried these forward.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.850
Apache for web services,
the most broadly deployed

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.040
web server in the world.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.950
We have integrated mail
services that are based on a

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.470
number of open source projects,
Postfix for mail delivery,

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.720
Cyrus for IMAP,
and Mailman for list management.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.420
We've integrated these all together.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.920
They're all integrated through
Open Directory for account

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.100
management and through server admin
for management and configuration.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.730
We have QuickTime streaming
services that allow you to host

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.400
streaming media or video on demand,
as well as live media

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.050
that's streamed as well.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.180
You can use QuickTime Broadcaster to
encode the live media and reflect it

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.060
through the QuickTime streaming server.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.070
And we have QTSS Publisher,
which lets you manage your content

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.040
on the QuickTime streaming server.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.590
If you're building
enterprise Java applications,

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.100
we support J2E through
JBoss and Apache Tomcat.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.490
And if you need to host a
back-end database and link

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.280
it into your web server,
we have QTSS Publisher.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.830
link it into your website,
so we include MySQL as well.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.370
We've carried these services
forward and we've provided some

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.540
enhancements to Tiger Server as well.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.830
The first is in the area of mail
services where we've integrated junk

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:32.900
mail filtering and virus filtering into
the mail server with Spam Assassin,

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.890
an open source project
that we've integrated.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.820
We've integrated this in with our mail
services and we've also integrated all

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.480
of the management into server admin,
so it's very easy to

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.290
configure and set up.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:49.770
We support virtual domains
now for the mail server,

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:52.980
where we allow you to set up
multiple virtual mail domains.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.240
So if you have, for instance,
Company 1 and Company 2 on your server,

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.260
you can have the same mail name,
sales@company1 or sales@company2,

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.150
go to multiple independent
mailboxes on the server.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.700
We've enhanced the
support for mail quotas,

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.640
so you can have soft quotas with
customizable messages as well as hard

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:16.290
quotas that will actually stop delivery
of mail to mailboxes that are full.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.240
We've also delivered some
enhancements to QuickTime streaming.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.100
We've enhanced the QTS publisher
for improved workflow and

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.900
added AppleScript support.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:28.830
And we've enhanced the scalability
of QuickTime streaming to support bit

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:35.720
rates that can now deliver HD quality on
local intranets with our latest codecs.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.240
That's internet services in Tiger Server.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.550
And lastly,
another area that you've heard

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.590
in the previous sessions a bit
about today is high performance

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:48.340
computing with grid clusters.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.240
And we have previously released
a technology preview of a

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.060
technology we call X Grid.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:59.020
And we're improving that and
productizing that in Tiger Server.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:03.050
X Grid will provide software that
you need to provide clustering

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.020
in Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.680
You can do that through a dedicated
set of XServe clustering nodes.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:14.070
Or you can also use X Grid to harvest
spare CPU cycles from desktops that

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:18.530
you have in your network when they're
not being used for ad hoc clustering.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.330
X Grid will have an SDK that allows
you to embed awareness and use of

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.760
the grid into your applications.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.850
It also works with command line
applications so that you can distribute

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.820
command line jobs that have no inherent
awareness of the grid or the cluster.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.200
We provide management tools that
let you set up the grid through

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.280
server admin and manage your systems.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.530
And you can manage jobs and
job submission and node status

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.520
from any client on the network.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.120
And like all of the other
services in Tiger Server,

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.680
it's integrated with
Open Directory for security.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:57.010
So those are the services layer in
Tegra Server in Mac OS X Server.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.640
Server administration,
directory services, workgroup,

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:04.210
client management, internet,
and high performance computing.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.830
We've talked about a few
of the major features that

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.600
we're introducing here today,
64-bit applications,

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.020
access control lists,
mobile home directories.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.100
There are a lot more.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.040
We don't have time to
go through them all.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.900
We've actually added about 200
new features in the server.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.460
And in Mac OS X Server,
we have about 100 open source

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.840
solutions that we've integrated.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.310
We've integrated all of these by
integrating them with open directories so

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:31.940
they share the same account information,
the same authentication information,

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.870
and we've integrated them through
server admins so they have the same

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:37.740
management interface and they're
easy to set up and configure.

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.740
So Tiger Server.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:44.920
So next, I'd like to point you to a few
sessions related to the server.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.610
There are actually quite a
few in the IT track this week,

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.670
so we're not going to list them all,
but here are a few that you shouldn't

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.920
miss that I'll call out and you can
check your schedules for the rest.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.360
Tomorrow morning is
Inside Mac OS X Server.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.030
Tomorrow afternoon,
if you want to find out

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.880
more about file settings,
you can go to the system access controls.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.820
There's a session there.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.520
On Wednesday, we have a session on
developing 64-bit applications.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.310
We have sessions on desktop management
technologies and Apple Remote Desktop for

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.920
our client management as well.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.360
We have two sessions
on Wednesday for XAN,

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.980
some sessions on directory services on
Thursday and network authentication.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.680
For J2E and Java programming
on the server,

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.160
we have a session on JBoss on Friday.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.890
And we have a session on
distributed computing with Xgrid,

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:31.900
the clustering service.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.800
We have two sessions on
Mac OS X Server on Wednesday afternoon.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:37.180
If you have feedback,
we have a feedback forum for

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.900
the server tomorrow afternoon.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:45.900
And it may have been moved,
so check your calendar.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.900
And we have an enterprise
feedback forum as well.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.080
So if you need more information,
there is the release notes and

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.870
documentation will be posted for
Tiger Server as it becomes available

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.900
on the Apple Developer Connect site.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.880
And you can get the
current documentation.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.850
documentation for the server
product there as well.
