WEBVTT

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.830
Pardon me a second,
I'm going to do a little house cleaning.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.680
This machine gets video too.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.810
The one I'm presenting on.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.500
Who sets that up?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.080
Because otherwise I can present and
tell you what it looks like to me.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.990
Yes, right here on this side.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.810
"DVI.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.470
Do you need the adapter?"
"We have an adapter." "Okay."

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.440
I'm Sal Soghoian,
I'm the AppleScript product manager

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.530
and while we're working that out,
I just want to thank you for coming

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.000
in here today and spending some
time with Ryan Lynch and myself.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.700
The meeting of AppleScript and
QuickTime has always been an

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.000
incredibly fertile ground for
creating very productive tools.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.580
We first, back in QuickTime 4,
was the first time we had a scriptable

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.000
dictionary in the QuickTime Player.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.350
And since then,
the dictionary within QuickTime has

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.000
grown and grown and grown and you've
been able to do more and more.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.830
And that growth is going
to continue with Tiger.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.130
You're going to see even more
scriptability in QuickTime,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.630
more accessibility to QuickTime,
built into AppleScript itself and also

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.770
into the QuickTime architecture as well.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.850
And we're very excited about that because
the last thing you should have to do

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.990
is some repetitive thing over and over
again like setting annotations to movies.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It should always be an easy process.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.970
And now,
with the introduction of Automator,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it's going to be even easier.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So, while Ryan and I have been skating
on the thin ice of a preview release,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.310
we've still managed to cobble
together some things to give you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.000
a window into what's coming up
for you to take advantage of.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.480
And so, today,
I'm going to spend a little bit of time,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.400
first of all,
showing you what tools you have for

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.970
QuickTime and AppleScript existing,
where you can get them,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.000
what they can do for you already.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.400
So that you can start,
if you're new to the world

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.580
of AppleScript and QuickTime,
you can start using these right

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.850
away to familiarize yourself with
some of the potential that these

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.000
two technologies have together.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.530
Then,
we're going to show you some previews

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.950
of the tools that we've been using.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.640
And then,
we're going to show you some previews

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.000
of what's possible in the future.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.850
And Ryan and I are going to do
some demos involving the Automator

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.990
application and QuickTime.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The two were just made for each other.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.920
It's really incredible.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.940
So, let's see.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.000
How close am I to having video over here?

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.000
None?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.360
Okay.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.720
Then, hang on.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.990
What is this demo machine right here?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
later.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.600
That's me.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.830
Okay.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.550
Well, let me show you first of all,
we'll go to, we'll start with this.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.810
When you go to www.applescript.com,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.740
We own that site.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.330
This is the main AppleScript page.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.770
If you're interested
in AppleScript at all,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.630
this is a great place to get started.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.080
This is where you want to go
first because it contains a lot

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.940
of resources from this site,
but it also points you to other

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.090
locations that have information.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.840
One of the pages in particular
of interest to QuickTime,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.200
if you click the applications
link here in the middle,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.580
this little toolbar, nav bar,
you'll see that we have links to some of

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.200
the scriptable applications in the OS,
one of which is the QuickTime Player.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.580
I'll click that and it takes
you to the QuickTime Player page

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.200
within the AppleScript website.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.800
On this page we've posted

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.560
Hundreds of scripts and examples,
and we've listed them all here.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.410
There's, for example, adding annotations.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.980
Creating streams.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.790
There's hundreds of applets and droplets.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.500
Setting your playback properties.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.180
And then there's a set
of screen menu scripts.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.140
There's about 150 of those.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.630
And all of these you can
download as a collection by just

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.700
clicking that link right there.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.270
And I'd like to show you that as soon
as I get some video on this machine.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.990
Why don't I take a question?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.000
Any questions?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.990
No, any complaints?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.930
Perhaps you feel you've
been treated unfairly?

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.340
Can we turn the lights down a little bit?

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.690
They like it intimate and cozy.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.960
This is a very productive crowd.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.950
Yes?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.680
The question is, will there be ability to
modify the workflows created

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.400
by the Automator application?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.360
If the person who created that
workflow enables you to do that,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.770
yes.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.540
You can open them back up into Automator
and change whatever parameters you want.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.680
And if you're the person that's
writing the Automator actions yourself,

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.400
then you can determine whether you
want to release those with the code

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.840
open that people can go in and mess
with your widgets if you want to.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.920
We're very excited about it.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.150
It looks like there's a lot of people
waiting to develop these kind of things.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.990
Any other questions?

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.170
You want to see card tricks?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.400
I'm not nervous today, let me tell you.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.570
After doing the keynote,
nothing can bother me.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.750
I could have a herd of
wildebeests running straight at

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.620
my nose and I wouldn't flinch.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.770
Okay, maybe I would do that,
I don't know.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.430
I don't know what kind of
network they have here,

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.200
but holy cow.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:53.190
I'm going to start demoing while
they're doing that off of this machine.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.180
I'll just copy these things.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.990
So this is the QuickTime scripts
collection from the website.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.070
I'm going to walk you through
some of these scripts and

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.180
what they can do for you.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.100
Okay, I can't work unless
I can see the hard drive.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.900
That's much better.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.200
Where did it go?

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.040
Oh, it is.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.910
Okay.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.960
Let's switch to that then.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.740
We're switching to this laptop?

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:55.180
So you go to that website,
you download this collection of scripts,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.500
you get the QuickTime scripts collection.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.890
Now, these scripts were written,
some of them have been written,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.710
they've been added to over the years.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:09.640
It originally began with QuickTime 4
and it covers a large amount

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.500
of the basic functionality that
you need to deal with QuickTime.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:19.000
One of the sections in there
involves applets and droplets.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.500
These are the kind of scripts
that you can drag items onto.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.680
You can take folders of movies and
drag these onto these droplets and

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.500
they will do some kind of processing,
whether it's setting annotations,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.500
setting the hint,
setting the URL of a movie.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.780
They're really great tools
for just quick drag and drop.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.080
The QuickTime scripts
collection over here,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.930
QuickTime Player scripts,
those are meant to be

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.160
launched from a script menu.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.270
And by default in Mac OS X you
have a script menu that's located

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.840
You can activate it via
your applications folder,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.860
then your AppleScript folder
within that applications folder,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.640
and then you can use
the AppleScript utility.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.660
In Tiger, to enable that.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.200
There's also in Panther another
application called Start Script Menu,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.580
which would do the same thing.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.750
Once that has been activated,
once the script menu has been activated,

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.820
then the script menu will
appear here in the top menu.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.150
And when you are within the
QuickTime player application,

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.570
you can choose to create a folder

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.660
"We've got a couple of quicktime
player scripts and then place

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.060
those scripts from the collection
in here and they will be available

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.340
from within the QuickTime player.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.810
So I'm going to show you a
couple of those to begin with.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.200
Let me start by opening up
a little sample movie here.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.980
Have a little bit of audio?

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.090
Thank you.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.830
And I think I'm straight.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.160
Does this appear,
it appears correct there.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.990
Here it's like looking like this.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.240
So here's an example of why you
would want to use AppleScript.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.600
So I have a movie here and
I want to add a chapter track.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.650
Any of those that have ever done
building a chapter track in a movie know

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.100
what an involved process it really is.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.430
To create that particular kind of
text file with a certain set of

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.830
codes and then to indicate where
you want it to begin and end.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.090
Well with AppleScript it's
become a really easy process.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.080
I'll just go to the script menu and
my QuickTime player scripts are here.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.100
And one of the sections is chapters.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.960
I'll choose create chapter track.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.830
and it asks me what track
I want to bind the chapters to,

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.040
the audio or video.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.980
I'll choose video.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.200
And you can see that instantly it
creates a chapter track for me.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.520
Then if I want to add a chapter at a
certain point I can just drag the cursor

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.410
To that particular point and
choose add chapter at the current

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.310
time and let's give it a name.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.310
Well, we'll give it something very
creative like first chapter.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.900
First, ch-ch-pah-pah-ch-pah.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.200
Man-na-ma-ha-ma-na-ha-ma-ha-ma-na-ha.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.490
And then you can see that
it automatically adds that.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.460
So I have the start and
I have the first chapter.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.550
And then I'll go over here.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.560
I'll go back to the chapter.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.440
I'll choose another one.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.390
I'll add another chapter
at the current time.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.690
And we'll call this "Second Chapter."

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:45.360
And now I have a start chapter,
a first chapter, and a second chapter.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.000
A very easy process to do
because you let AppleScript do

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.560
all the heavy lifting for you.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.040
It does all the process.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.180
It talks directly to the
application and creates the

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.920
chapter and can edit it on the fly.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.380
That would take you quite
a while to do by hand.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.540
With AppleScript it's very easy.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.600
And you can go back in and edit them.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.310
I can go back and say delete a chapter.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.340
Choose the chapter I want to delete.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.650
And now the first chapter's
gone from the list.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.700
Simple example could save you
a lot of time in annotating

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.040
and chaptering a movie.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.440
There's one example of what you can
do with AppleScript and QuickTime.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.240
Let's take a look at another one.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.530
Let's take a look at some
of the applets and droplets.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:46.920
Let's start with this one.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.960
Now, this particular script is called
the Limited Annotations Droplet.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.280
And what it does is it will put in
three annotations into your movie.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.210
All you have to do is go into
the comments field in the finder

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.960
window for that particular droplet
and set in your annotations.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.800
You put the name of the annotation,
a colon, and then its value.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.500
And when the comment is run,
it will automatically read from its

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.680
own comments field and apply those.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.180
So let me show you.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:21.640
I'll take the sample movie that
I just had and I'll drag it onto this

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:32.230
Okay,
now I'll open back up my sample movie.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.320
Stop.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.610
And you can see that it added the
annotations in for me automatically.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.340
Now, seems like a small thing,
but if that's something that you

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.890
do all the time with your content,
being able to do 150 of those and

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.690
have a donut is a great thing.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.470
It saves time.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.400
It saves money.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.920
Now you'll notice that this
movie is also set to autoplay.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.610
As soon as it opened, it started playing.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.630
Well, there are some playback
properties in QuickTime that

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.750
aren't really exposed to the UI.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.600
Did you know that a movie can
automatically close when it's done?

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.460
Or it can automatically
quit the QuickTime player?

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.600
Or it can automatically
self-present full screen?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.140
You can set these properties yourself,
but nowhere in the UI of the

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.600
application currently can you do that.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.150
So we'll go over here to the applets
and droplets and we'll open up the

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.600
folder called playback properties.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:37.600
Now these particular droplets all set
some individual playback property.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.540
So the first one here is called
reset playback properties.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.580
If I double click it,
it will tell you what it does.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.770
This script will set autoplay,
close when done, auto close when done,

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.600
quit when done, auto quit when done,
and auto present to false.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.510
Presentation size to normal and
presentation mode to normal.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.600
And then it will set the
playback properties to movies.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.570
So if you just want to reset a
movie back to normal condition,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.100
that does it.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.360
It doesn't autoplay.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:11.020
So if I want to set a group of
movies to automatically play,

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.590
then I could determine,
I can set them to right here,

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.560
the autoplay property.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.610
This particular script
will set the autoplay.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.190
You can set the preference
to whatever you like.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.900
Currently it's set to enabled.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.390
So now I'll drag the movie
back onto this script.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.280
And now go play.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.480
So it auto-plays.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:40.670
I can also set the-- I'll save
it as a presentation file.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.600
And that will set the automatically close
when done and automatically self-present.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.370
So now when the user
double clicks the file...

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.550
It self-presents and then
closes automatically.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.100
The user doesn't need to know
how to use the QuickTime player.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.010
And that's a property
that's only settable via

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.220
AppleScript with an interface.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.940
Now that might come in useful
in this kind of a scenario.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.670
If we go back to our
QuickTime scripts folder,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.260
there is a folder called Example Files,
and within there,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.620
there's a Help Center example.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.010
And I'm going to open that.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.810
This has a movie in the help page.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:35.270
The URL of this movie has
been set to selfpresent.move,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.100
which is a movie within the
same folder as the file.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.100
The target, T, is QuickTime Player.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.990
It is also set to
auto-present and auto-close.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:17:00.100
The user can click on the link in
the help page to access the movie.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.100
The movie will then play full
screen and when it's done,

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.910
it will clean up after itself.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.100
All of this can be set with
AppleScript and QuickTime.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:15.500
Here's a very simple example of how
it can be useful in the real world.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.620
Another example of using
AppleScript is with droplets

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.590
and droplets is media skins.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.400
Has anybody done media skins?

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:52.300
[Transcript missing]

00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:05.100
[Transcript missing]

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.500
With inside the queue I want the
plane to fly through the queue.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.910
Well that's exactly
what QuickTime can do.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.170
It has that incredible ability
with media skins to do it,

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.780
but it's a really long process.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.520
So what I'm going to do is
make this an easy process.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.660
I'm going to use this droplet
called the Apply Media Skin Droplet

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.950
and I'll just drag the plane onto
that and let's watch what happens.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.040
It's going to check and then it's
going to ask where do you want

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.810
to place your finished product.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.210
I'll put it on the desktop.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.660
And I've left this droplet showing
you each step of what it's going

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.010
to do so you can see how long
and involved the process is.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.820
If you take out these dialogues
it happens very quickly.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.140
So it's going to open the
MediaSkin background file,

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:57.300
it's going to add that into the movie,
then it's going to position

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.270
it to the back and it's
going to make it transparent,

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.540
it's going to position
the movie into position,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.780
save a copy of that,
then it's going to close that,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.740
then it's going to write an
XML file describing how the

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.500
MediaSkin should be done,
then it's going to open up

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.200
that XML file as a new movie,
then it's going to apply

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.590
the playback settings,
then it's going to save that particular

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.140
thing as a self-contained entity.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.810
And then it's going to
clean up after itself.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.200
So now, thank you.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.950
So now let's play the same movie.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.820
It's set for autoplay now.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.180
How to take advantage of a really cool
technology with a single drag and drop.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.170
That's the power of
AppleScript and QuickTime together.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.300
That's what we're all about.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.550
Also within the QuickTime scripts folder,
I'm going to take you to

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.320
another little example,
are some example files folder.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:14.090
And within that there are some examples
of the code that you need to do this.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.650
What do the scripts actually look
like that can do this and what

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.870
level of control do they offer?

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:26.300
Well one of the examples that I had
open but I don't have open now.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.210
Open this one.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.070
It's called Typewriter Text Movie.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.350
I'm just going to run this one.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.860
It's going to switch to
the QuickTime player,

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.800
create a brand new movie,
and it's going to add frames.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.500
Yes,
you have total control over frame level.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.840
You can control the contents of frame,
you can control the position

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.970
of objects within the frame,
you can control frame duration,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.680
you can control tracks,
you can control the movie,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.860
you can control the audio.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.340
Just about every aspect of
a movie has been exposed to

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.510
QuickTime and AppleScript.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.950
So this movie was created
entirely with that script.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.610
By generating frames on the fly.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.170
That's the level of granularity that
you have with AppleScript and QuickTime.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.890
As a matter of fact,
let's take a look at some of

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.380
the text frame properties.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.060
I'm going to run this one.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.140
This is one of the example scripts.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.910
And this will show you the kind of
properties you have over a frame.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.500
Default font: Chicago is not installed
and needs charcoal.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.100
Greer, Times, Geneva.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.290
You can control the default font size.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:44.740
So this is not a movie.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.040
This is AppleScript talking
to a frame in a movie file,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.670
live.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.450
It's interacting with the player.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.120
It's not a pre-done movie.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.170
So you can control justification,
you can change the foreground color.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.600
Green, blue.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.700
You can change the background color.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.420
You changed the blue type to white, huh?

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.370
Red text on blue so you can
change both of them together.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.550
Yellow text on black.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.470
You can control anti-aliasing, keys,
key text as well.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.270
All of that is controllable.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.840
That's the level of control that you
have with AppleScript and QuickTime.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:39.560
You can really get to a very
fine point in your scripts.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.800
Now,
to write these kind of scripts yourself,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.360
what's involved?

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.650
Okay, yes.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.070
I'll show you.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.500
Some, also within that folder,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.060
are some script templates.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:58.290
There are track syntax examples,
and each one of these scripts will show

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.460
you how to do a particular example,
like adding a frame to

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.710
the start of a text track,
adding an image track,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.060
adding text from a data item,
adding text from a list on disk.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.400
Then there are also some
template examples here.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.220
Where are they?

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:20.620
Favorites, helps, frame, examples,
slideshows, chapter examples.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.440
Oh, script templates are down here.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:29.000
And these are pre-done scripts that
you can add your particular actions to.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.220
For example, if you want to create
a QuickTime droplet,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:38.220
all you have to do is open
up this template and then...

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.750
It'll tell you right here.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.840
You place your own particular script
statements there and the rest of it

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.210
is already pre-done for you to handle,
determining whether the user

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:52.230
actually dragged on a movie file,
determining whether it's a folder

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.100
of stuff and then iterating
through each item in the folder.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.100
All you have to do is open this template,
put your particular lines

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.400
of AppleScript in there,
save it,

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.700
and then it will become a droplet
that you can use just like the other

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.610
QuickTime applets and droplets.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:25:11.200
[Transcript missing]

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.400
Was I good?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.400
Look at that, I'm so,
I have to generate it down into like,

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.760
you know, begging for applause, holy cow.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.540
That's as low as you can possibly go.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:23.190
Okay.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.700
Yes, as you can tell, you know,
Steve was very excited by Automator,

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.270
so am I.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.330
It's a phenomenal technology
that we're working on.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.990
You got to see a preview of it and
there's a preview of it installed

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.400
on your developer disk as well.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.020
And what Automator does is it provides
an interface above and beyond what

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:47.340
the normal droplet kind of thing
where you have these little dialogues.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:53.380
Now it's made into where you can take
the result of one action or one script

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.820
and pass it to the next because you
might have a group of movies that you

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.360
want to set the playback properties for,
right?

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.400
You might want to be able to
browse a whole group of movies.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.300
You might want to be
able to set the URL for.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.400
A group of movies.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.390
And Automator lets you do that.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.370
So I'm going to show you a
simple Automator action here.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.480
I'm going to launch it.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.600
I like the fact the guy bounces.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600
Boink, boink.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.210
He's sure bouncing.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.820
And this is Automator.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.650
In case you didn't see it before,
let me quickly describe the interface.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.640
It's very simple.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.700
On the left-hand side
here are category buttons.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.350
And these represent the kind of
actions that you would normally

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.620
want to do with your computer,
like find things, work with disk items,

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.520
communicate with the
user of the computer.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:56.350
And when you click a category button,
in the list below here,

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:01.690
all of the actions related to that
category appear in this action list.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.050
When you select one of those actions,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.900
Its description will appear down
here in the description field.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.130
And it will tell you basically
what the action does,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.480
if it has any things that it needs.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.600
And then when you want to use
the action you can just drag it

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:23.340
right over into the workflow area
and the action will appear here.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.380
And you can set any kind of parameters
that you want for that particular action.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.660
Any preferences that it has appears here.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:35.520
And it's really easy just to link
these things together and create

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.250
an entire workflow and then just
run the workflow when you're done.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.760
For example,
let's say that I have a lot of

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.000
movies that I want to set some
basic playback properties on them.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:51.020
Well to do that I'm just going
to open up a folder here of

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.580
my favorite Switch movies.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.460
Let's see, I'll grab a bunch of these.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.990
And I'm going to drag them into
the workflow area and just let go.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:09.000
The act of me doing that will
automatically create a new action,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
this is an action,
with those files that I just specified.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.890
They're added to this action
called Get Specified Files.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.250
The result of this action will just be a
list of those files to the next action.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.690
And then once I've
dragged those in there,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.860
then I can click my Movies category
over here and I have an action here

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.430
that says Set Movie Playback Properties.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.600
This action will set the playback
properties of the past movie files.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.170
The settable playback
properties include AutoPlay,

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.910
AutoClose when done, AutoQuit when done,
AutoPresent.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.180
If AutoPresent is active,
the playback size of the

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.160
movie will be chosen.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.040
So let's add that to my thing.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.120
I'll give it a double click.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.980
And then I could say I want these movies
just to autoplay and not set anything

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.240
other than just that particular property.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:04.280
Now I can then say, alright, click Run.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.100
That ain't gonna work.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.430
Because that's the wrong player.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.000
Well, it's gonna attempt.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.640
And the nice thing is
I don't have to do this.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:32.140
It's doing it for me.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.840
Okay, and it tells me here at the
bottom that it's completed.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.910
And what happened to my movie folder?

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:46.770
Back here, Movies, Switch Movies,
and I think Qbert was one of them.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:56.600
[Transcript missing]

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.840
Ain't no audio.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.770
Try it again.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.900
So that's now set to autoplay.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.540
As a matter of fact,
I can then go back here to my

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.260
existing workflow and I can say,
"Alright, well I'd also like to have

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.450
them automatically close
when they're done." And,

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.530
as long as you're at it,
have them present full screen.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.200
Let's say, hold on a second,
this is where.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.100
That's the wrong one.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.380
Let's quit this guy.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:53.100
[Transcript missing]

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:12.280
We need an audio for it.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.940
Or a little Jetson thing.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:20.040
Okay,
now we'll go back to our thing and select

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.070
one of the tracks like Qbert again.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.930
How can I do it?

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.510
Hang on.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.800
Qbert DJ, it should have set it to... Oh,
I didn't set the present, sorry.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.330
Okay, what I'm going to do is select a
couple of these and delete those

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.590
so we don't have to go again.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.690
Let's run this.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:00.780
The execution has been done.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:00.780
Now I can go back to Qbert.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.300
Do I have audio on this laptop at all?

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.000
No, you're not sending it.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:16.400
Well, the player's not playing it,
is what you're saying.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.590
Okay.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.480
Now let's see if it will automatically
quit once the commercial's done.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.590
His mom's going,
"I can't believe he did a nationwide

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:35.070
TV." That's what moms think about.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.180
And it automatically closes when done.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.160
So setting the properties of a movie
using automators is a very easy process.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.010
Drag them in,
add the actions in after it,

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.130
and there you go.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.920
As a matter of fact,
you can do a lot of things with it.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:57.440
You could set the movie annotations,
and then you can browse the movies.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.800
I'm going to add movie annotations here.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.140
And I'm going to have it
delete existing annotations.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.930
Let's choose artist here, or let's see,
copyright.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:12.110
And we'll have option A, copyright,
AppleScript.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.960
And we'll have it do that.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.140
And then when we're done we're gonna
have it browse the movies for us as well.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.630
And go.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:29.550
So it should just be a couple.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.080
Now can you imagine
this with compressing,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.320
with sharpening?

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.100
So now we'll let you browse the movies
in this wonderful little web interface.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.500
And then you can click the next one.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.800
On Panther this draws very fast.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:54.410
So it was very easy for us to be able
to use Automator to do basic production

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.700
actions with the QuickTime player.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.700
And this is the power that's coming
to you when we develop this product.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.660
The next thing is taking this same
kind of idea of having the ease of

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:11.620
creating a workflow and taking it to
the next level of being able to control

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:16.700
this machine and other machines that
are involved in QuickTime production.

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:20.700
And one of the tools that is used
is the QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:25.700
And this is where Ryan is going to
come in handy with this whole thing.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.900
And we're going to show you
how we used the Automator to

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:30.700
automate using the QuickTime.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.780
And we're going to show you how we
used the Automator to automate using

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.700
the QuickTime Broadcaster to control
the actions of a remote computer.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.450
Woo.

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:40.630
Okay, Ryan.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:42.700
Take it away.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.180
Okay, let me steal your video here,
if you don't mind.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.180
Oh, okay.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.720
We only have one video?

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:52.980
Yeah.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.020
Okay.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.940
Mental note to...

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:09.730
So we thought it'd be kind
of fun to figure out a way to

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:13.870
control Broadcaster because it's
a really scriptable application.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:20.790
And with Automator you
get a lot of power.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.790
Can I have this laptop please?

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.790
Maybe?

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:37.490
So we wrote a few little stages/actions
to take care of dealing with Broadcaster.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:45.670
Creating settings is not that great,
so let's consolidate it into a nice

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.670
little interface here and set up

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:52.800
Broadcast to 256, 192, standard, 20 fips.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.270
We like keyframes, they're good.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.660
Well, let's just broadcast to myself,
shall we?

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.190
Or to a server I have, even.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.500
So that's great.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.690
OK, what am I doing with this?

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.240
Well, this action actually is just
going to create a settings file.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.640
It doesn't do much for you.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:24.470
So I can write that out to a text,
a new text file,

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:29.570
and we'll call this Settings,
if I could spell.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.600
So, we're complete.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.700
Well, what did it do?

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.690
On my desktop I have this
little settings file which I can

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:43.500
Here we go.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.630
And me, as you see.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.900
All my settings are loaded
into QuickTime Broadcaster

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.520
with my server and everything.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.720
That's great,
but it doesn't do much for me.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.770
I want to take this and
actually make it work.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.720
So what we decided to do is I'm
going to take this file that

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.810
I just created and automatically
broadcast it over to Sal's machine,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.610
have him start broadcasting for me,
so you can control a remote

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.040
broadcaster over wireless.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.270
Except I need your IP address.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.000
Oh, OK.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.080
Now, nobody else-- you muck
with this right now.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.600
I'm going to give my IP address.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.440
I don't want to see any other
weird messages coming in,

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.640
because I know how you are.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:33.280
It's 17.210.65.14.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.370
I'm going to zoom in
because I can't see it.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.980
There it is.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.200
17.210.65.14.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.100
Excellent.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.440
Okay.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:47.240
So now on my machine I've made sure
that I have program linking turned on.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:53.120
Under the sharing preferences there
is an option for remote Apple events.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.900
And I have enabled that and we
have him on my machine as a user.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:04.110
Those are two requirements that you
need in order to be able to control my

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.050
machine remotely using Apple events.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.620
Go ahead.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:07.600
Okay.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.600
So we have a broadcast already.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.690
So you added a new action.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.200
Yeah, okay.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.450
So, yeah,
instead of sending it to a text file,

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.570
we've got a nifty little app.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.180
Excellent, okay.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:28.060
We have a nifty little action we created
called initiate remote broadcast,

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.920
which was at the top of the list
because it's the most relevant item

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:36.000
to follow the one that I just created,
just added to my workflow.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.600
Hello, okay.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:58.200
So, I'm going to put in Sal's IP address
because we have the remote machine here,

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:58.200
which he just gave me.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.600
We're going to call my broadcast
settings file "broadcast," why not?

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.100
And I automatically want
it to start broadcasting.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.360
So let's let that run
and see what happens.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.040
We have to log into his
machine with a user that we

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.190
already have on that machine.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:23.360
Today I'm Trudy.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.800
So what it's doing is it's logging in,
writing to the desktop the

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:36.700
broadcast file that I just created,
launching Broadcaster with that file.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.990
and hopefully starting the broadcast.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.540
Hang on.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.480
It wrote it.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.800
And broadcaster keeps quitting on me.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.100
But that's okay.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.090
Let me show you.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.630
From my computer.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.990
There it is.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.300
Oh, it's actually doing it right now.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.170
Yeah, it kicked in.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200
It just took a little delay.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.740
So you can see that it is
broadcasting from this camera.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.300
There is the file and there's the crash.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.300
Oh, but even better,
let's... I think I want to watch.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.140
But it did work.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.300
It actually controlled my
machine from his computer,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.300
wrote the broadcast
settings to my desktop,

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.440
opened it up with the
QuickTime broadcaster,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.240
it initiated the broadcast.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.240
It worked for a little while.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:27.300
That's not too bad.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.300
Remember, this is all, you know,
introductory stuff.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.300
You're peering at the future here.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300
That was good.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.290
Yeah, peering at the future.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:37.930
Okay.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.200
Excellent.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.190
So that's great.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.500
That's one of the wonderful
applications that we have in

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.100
the world of QuickTime that
actually is really scriptable.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.590
A new one that we have coming up-- oh,
yeah, OK.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.620
A new one that we have coming
up with Tiger is going to be

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.780
QuickTime Streaming Server Publisher.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.850
And we have a new rev with that
that you actually have shipping

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.460
in the disks that you have today.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.000
And we've added some scriptability.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.760
So we thought it would be a little
fun to do something with that.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.370
So I'm going to upload
some files to the server.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.740
Create a playlist with those files
I just uploaded and automatically

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.000
start that playlist broadcasting.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.330
Ooh.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:17.990
Ooh.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Yes.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
So I've got one Nifty
file here on my desktop.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.950
Great.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.630
So you just drag that in to
get the specified stages,

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.000
right?

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.000
Exactly.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Yep.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Okay.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And then I'm going to
upload to Publisher.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.990
So I've got my Nifty IP address.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.830
That's supposed to be bullets.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:52.450
Well, I forgot to ask Jim how to do
the bullets in the text field.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.560
OK.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.560
New playlist.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.000
I've been occupied with other stuff.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.900
Sorry, Ryan.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:41:59.380
It's all right.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.390
Oh, we're bouncing.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:00.880
What does this mean?

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.340
So let's go look at what--
see what's happening.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:07.690
It's logging in, and look,
it's uploading our file for us.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.840
"I think you have to go
connect or something,

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.420
right?" "Well,
it's already connected." "Oh,

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.100
really?" "It's already uploading."

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:18.800
I think that was it.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.800
But it's hanging.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.780
I think I have a corrupt file.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.640
Oops.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.580
Is that making progress?

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.120
We need a percentage thing here.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:30.860
OK.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.480
I'm turning this into UI feedback for it.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.860
How come it's not saying
like 10% or something?

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.160
Just let me know.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.840
Hmm.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.880
Oh, it's still uploading.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:59.800
[Transcript missing]

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.820
So we have this neat
little thing in music.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.000
We've got this action set,
get playlist tracks.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
I think you're still going
there for the previous one.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.990
All right, stop.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.300
You might have to just use a
new workflow for right now.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:29.700
[Transcript missing]

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.480
These are important things.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.090
So here we go, back to this.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:39.480
So we've got the-- we want to get
the playlist tracks from iTunes.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.340
Let me choose a playlist I have here.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.470
Music for streaming, that sounds nifty.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.140
I'm going to get the file tracks.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.920
And this actually,
if you notice at the bottom here,

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.420
delivers an iTunes track.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.040
So it's actually a path to the
iTunes track within the program.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.690
Actually, it's a reference to the
iTunes track object,

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.460
which you don't need to know about.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.120
Why?

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.630
Because Automator will handle it for you.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.000
Go ahead.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.220
It automatically figures out that
what I require is a file or a folder,

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:12.080
converts the output of the last action
into what I need for this action.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:13.860
Ooh.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.430
Invisible conversion.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.110
Didn't know it was there, did you?

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.780
OK.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.470
And now you all know my name
and password on this machine.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.640
Call this iTunes and run.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.090
So these are,
see data conversion completed here.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.500
Logging in.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:39.240
I'm going to get progress bar here.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:44.180
It's having a hard time
transferring things.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:50.610
Well, it's trying again,
but it's transferring up my MP4 audio,

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:55.940
AAC audio, up to the server and it will
create a playlist eventually.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:57.570
and add this to the playlist.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:02.150
So you can automate this quite easily.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:10.500
We have also the option to automate,
you can save this and ask when it's run

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:17.990
so that when you save this whole workflow
as a script you can actually access

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.450
this via an iCal event or something
else and automatically have this pop

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.820
up and create your own playlist on demand
without having to go through all these

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.030
steps of setting up another workflow or
setting up your own AppleScript later on.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.180
So this is the power of Automator.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:35.980
Yes.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.010
Is that interesting?

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.350
Thank you.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:44.440
Yeah,
you can see where we're going with this.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.880
You're catching it.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.200
Just leave that running.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.400
So you're catching this
at a really early stage.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.160
But isn't the whole idea behind
automation the fact that you should

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.900
just be working with what you want
to do and not have to deal with

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.160
the intricacies of how to do that?

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.830
And that's the beauty of
what Automator can do.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.000
As you've seen before,
as you saw initially,

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.720
AppleScript can automate things,
but now this takes it to the next

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.440
level to where you're just saying,
"I want to do this task, then that task,

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.020
then this task,
and go do it for me." And even if

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.320
that task involves communicating
to a machine across a network,

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.140
you don't have to deal with all the
other things that are involved with it.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.290
So this is where we're
taking QuickTime and

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.320
AppleScript together in the future.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.600
We're very excited about
Automator and the new versions

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.720
of QuickTime that's coming out.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.040
There's also one more thing
I wanted to show you about...

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.950
Are you running Tiger here?

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:36.550
I am.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.220
Okay, just leave it.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:37.720
All right.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:43.980
I wanted to show you one more thing
about AppleScript and QuickTime.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.370
It is this.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.150
So we're very focused on AppleScript in
giving you access to the various

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.320
components in the operating system.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.000
And I'm in the script editor
application right now.

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:58.320
This is located within
your applications folder,

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.500
AppleScript.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.880
And I've opened up the library window,
which you can also get

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.230
from the window menu.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:08.490
And within the library window we keep a
list of some of the favorite applications

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:10.080
that you might want to access.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.500
They're scripting dictionaries.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.470
And one of the applications
is called System Events.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:20.500
This is an invisible process that
runs in the background that controls

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.880
a lot of what's done with AppleScript.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.590
And you can see that it has a
rather extensive dictionary.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:32.560
I just want to point out that
it now has a new XML suite for

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:34.570
reading and writing XML stuff.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.400
Yay!

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:39.600
And it also has a

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:40.320
Where is it?

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.320
QuickTime File Suite.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.800
Let's take a look at this and
show you what is available there.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:52.500
This particular suite will allow
you to access information about

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.330
QuickTime media files without
having to use the QuickTime player.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.340
You can just ask the question or
get the properties of it and as you

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.480
can see there's a class of object
called annotation because that's a

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.800
common thing that people want to do.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.310
They want to be able to get
information about the movies

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.800
that they're working with.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.250
You can also see that QuickTime data
has basically your core things

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.980
about presentation size,
presentation mode,

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.800
is it a storage stream,
what's the time scale,

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.800
is it set for auto-quit when done,
is it set to automatically play.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.550
And you can see that there's
also other information about

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.800
the contents of the file and
information about QuickTime tracks

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.780
and all the data about tracks,
QuickTime tracks as well.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.800
So this particular set of,
this particular set of files is

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:37.800
a set of files that are available
on the QuickTime platform.

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.310
And this particular set of commands in
the QuickTime File Suite will be really

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:46.210
great for just getting quick information
and sending quick information about

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:49.750
QuickTime media files without having
to rely on the player in the future.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.630
So this is coming up for
you in Tiger as well.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.800
Well that's what we have for you today.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.090
We'll be glad to stand here
and take some questions about

00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.800
this and any of your ideas.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.800
Thank you.
