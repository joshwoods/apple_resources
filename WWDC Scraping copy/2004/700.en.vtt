WEBVTT

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.650
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Senior Director of

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.230
Product Marketing,
Interactive Media Group, Frank Casanova.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.960
Good morning guys,
thanks for coming to our session.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.360
This year, you know typically Tim Schaaf,
my engineering counterpart

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.000
and I kind of join,
we do a session together.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
But there's so much new stuff this year.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.000
There's so much that
Tim needed to talk about,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
about the architecture of what
was going on in our space.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.940
Because it's grown considerably
bigger than QuickTime.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.180
And there's so much new stuff that
we've been doing on our side around

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.500
3G and a bunch of other technologies
that we separated into two sessions.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.490
And Tim's was yesterday and mine is now.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.310
We wanted to go through today a whole
bunch of different things that we're

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.820
doing in a space around content creation,
content development.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.990
You know,
what's important to us and what's coming.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.660
And so I'll have a whole bunch
of folks join me on stage,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.900
other presenters and demoers to
kind of get this message across.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.680
This is the second time that we've
come to the Developers Conference kind

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.480
of as a QuickTime community.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.480
As you guys may remember,
for about three years or so,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.240
we had a QuickTime live conference
that we held down in LA,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.830
which was pretty much
all things QuickTime.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.940
And last year,
we moved the conference kind of up

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.650
into this Developers Conference because
this Developers Conference has taken

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.230
on a whole new kind of profile.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.720
It's not just about
API development anymore.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.870
It used to be back in the day a
pretty engineering-centric conference,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.060
but it's grown.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.580
It's evolved.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.040
It's changed a lot,
and we saw an opportunity to leverage

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.790
the incredible infrastructure of
WWDC to include our conference,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.070
and we benefited in a lot of ways.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.310
There's 41 different sessions,
a bunch of different labs,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.760
a very diverse audience.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.670
Everybody in this audience comes across
from a wide variety of backgrounds.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.070
And one thing we definitely
heard from last year that people

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.710
wanted to see improve or change
was improve the community.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.020
You know,
the QuickTime live community was a very

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.000
vibrant and very definite community.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.620
And so,
We've done a lot of changes when I think

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.540
the room build outs are finished.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.750
We have,
instead of smaller rooms where people

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.840
are packed in and standing room only,
we've increased the size of the rooms.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.500
There's a couple of them
that are pretty large.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.920
And our Quicktime lounge is no longer a
back alleyway with a bumpy couch and a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.070
fake plant that used to be back there.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.420
We actually have a lounge,
so if you're part of this community

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.960
you can go over and hang out and meet
other people that are in this space.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.930
There's beverages and various things.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.890
So we've changed a lot of things
to make this conference better.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.270
And we really look forward to the
feedback session later this week for

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.030
you guys to give us more feedback
on what you want to see next year.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.000
So what's changed in QuickTime?

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.080
In its simplest form, our logo changed.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.840
We got a new logo.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.960
I think this is what maybe our, Rhonda,
our fifth one?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.760
Yeah, fifth one.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.700
A good question for Stump
the Experts later tonight.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.640
How many logos have
the QuickTime guys had?

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.140
Well, we were surprised with the rest
of the company when all of a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.140
sudden this new one showed up.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.000
And as we stared at it for a long time,
trying to figure out what was different.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.750
Certainly, the light source.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.170
They changed the angle of attack
for the light that defines our logo.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.130
What else?

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.790
The thingy in the middle got wider.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.970
I'm not sure what that thing really is,
but it got wider.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.720
And then, of course,
they removed the hole out

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.820
of the center of our logo.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.740
And so,
and I think it's a little bit more jelly,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.100
too.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.430
I think they jellified
it a little bit more.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.200
You know, but it's pretty cool.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.100
I mean, it looks modern, I guess.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.840
As long as we stay in the dock,
that's all that matters, right?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.800
The never-ending battle
of who's in the dock.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.220
So what we really want to talk
about is covering a lot of

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.280
ground in this presentation
about what we've done at Apple,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.720
what our partners have done,
what technologies we've been working

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.180
on to kind of improve this sense.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.960
And then, of course,
we want to talk about

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.990
what we've done at Apple,
what our partners have done to

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.740
kind of improve this sense of,
you know,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.360
what we've done to make a media platform,
standards-based media platform.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.610
This slide is expanding
on a regular basis.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.500
This set of technologies and the
way our OS is architected is being

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.650
updated seemingly every release.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.860
And certainly the two guys in the middle,
Core Image and Core Video,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.360
which we'll spend some
time talking about,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.330
have added a lot.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.970
And to help me talk about what's
going on and to help explain,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.880
I'd like to introduce Aimee Nugent.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.350
Aimee's on my team, recently promoted to
product line manager.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.360
She is responsible for all the various
core technologies within the OS from

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.460
a product marketing standpoint.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.010
I'd like to introduce Aimee and
have her step through this and

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.300
do some cool demos for you guys.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.460
Great.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.450
Aimee?

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.840
Welcome, good morning.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.400
Thanks for coming out, everybody.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.930
What I'd like to do is just explain
a little bit of what is built into

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.880
our OS and try to explain why you
as content professionals really

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.900
care and why you benefit from this.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.760
One of our key proof points has been
Core Audio is built into Mac OS X.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.050
When we transitioned from Mac OS to OS X,
we had a great and rare

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.900
opportunity to build something
from scratch for modern hardware.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.900
And from that,
we were able to make Core Audio.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.800
And we really have ended up with an
industry-leading platform for audio.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.850
In fact, over 80% of professional
audio market is on the Mac.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.520
And why?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.540
Well, we've built an ultra-low
latency platform,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.870
one of the lowest figures on any OS.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.550
We have support for 24-bit
192 audio and beyond.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.900
In fact, when 192 has started to emerge
as an industry standard,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.900
we didn't need to make
any changes in Core Audio.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.900
It just automatically scaled.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.870
We also don't have any software
restrictions as far as the number

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.900
of channels that you can work
with for playback or capture.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.320
And it'll scale just with your hardware.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.770
And with the G5,
we're seeing some massive scalability.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.900
We also have plug-and-play
for audio devices.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.900
So your FireWire and USB,
connect them up, they just work.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.820
And we've really built a robust
developer community around audio units.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.840
We have the plugins into Core Audio that
allow you to do effects with

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.900
DSP and virtual instruments.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.790
We have dozens and dozens of developers
who are both hosting and creating.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:07:02.800

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.940
- Ready to have some fun?

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.480
I am.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.800
Rock and roll guitar at
nine o'clock in the morning.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.630
- Let's do it.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.480
- Frank, you owe me.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.240
We get some audio here?

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.660
Are we happening, guys?

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200
Are we live in the house?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200
Yeah.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.190
Is that coming through the mains?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
Yeah.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200
Okay.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200
So, we're live in the house.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200
Yeah.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.070
Okay.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.280
Anyway, I'll talk about it while
they work on the problem.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.130
As a musician and a person who
spends an awful lot of time creating

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.160
music and working on audio for a lot
of different professional people,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.940
I'm always looking for
applications that really,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:05.940
really help

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.650
really helped me, in terms of sound,
in terms of my ability to

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.720
get through to other systems.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.380
And one of the things that I found
using devices and applications

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.570
that are designed for core audio
is the sound quality has just

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.680
been dramatically improved.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.010
As Amy said,
about 80% of the professional audience

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.610
out there uses the Mac as their platform.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:41.490
Well, you know,
the entire market is really quite huge.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.380
We found through some research

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.770
There's about 54% of US households have
somebody playing a musical instrument.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.250
And what's remarkable about
that is that about 32 million

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.400
of them are guitar players.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.970
And so, and that's US figures only.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.200
It's about 72 million worldwide.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.130
So this is like a great big market for
the developers to create and really spend

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.900
some time going after these applications.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.650
We have sound, we have...

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:37.400
[Transcript missing]

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.220
Excuse us one second.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.210
One, two, three, two.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:10:28.500
[Transcript missing]

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.800
One of the engineers
is sitting right there.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.890
You owe me this.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.900
Yeah.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:53.080
Okay, switch that back.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.000
- Okay.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.750
Well, don't know what the problem is.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.100
Well, sorry about that.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.710
Hopefully you guys got to see
Guitar Rig in the Steve keynote.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.560
If you didn't,
the webcast is online that you can

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.770
check it out at apple.com/quicktime.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.400
What fun!

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.160
All right, so if you could take
a look at Guitar Rig,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.110
this whole section through here,
this is just like a virtual

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.900
rack of instruments,
of amplifiers,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.430
and what can come with this
thing is really pretty amazing.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.740
In terms of amplification,
we have like a Mesa Boogie,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.160
a Fender Twin, a Marshall Plexi,
a Vox AC30.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.810
In terms of distortion pedals,
we have some of the classics.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.750
The Tube Screamer, I love that name.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.630
Distortion, treble booster.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:00.300
Under the mod section for modulation,
there's tremolo and phasers, blah, blah,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:00.600
blah.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.930
Under the filter section,
there's wah-wahs, there's talk-wahs,

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:10.130
all kinds of EQ, volume pedals,
and even things that are a little

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.210
silly like this psychedelic delay here.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.100
And all you have to do to make
use of these is just click them

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.930
and drag them where you want them.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.030
And then they... Turn on.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.320
And we're still having problems here,
guys.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.200
Okay, so one of the cool things
this application does,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.640
it has its own little tape delay.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.800
So, you know, sometimes I'll get files
from friends of mine.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.660
Let's say Frank Casa Nova sent
me this one.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.650
One, two, three, two, two, three.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.700
Okay, this is just playing.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.040
This is just an MPEG-4 file.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.930
It's a QuickTime file.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.680
And I can choose a sound to work with.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:44.900
[Transcript missing]

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.430
I kind of like that,
but I need it a little bit more modern.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.200
You mind if I goof
with this a little bit?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.140
Okay.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.390
So I'm going to launch GarageBand.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:00.490
and in GarageBand,
I've taken the concept of that tune,

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:06.960
and I'm going to launch
Native Instruments' guitar

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.520
rig as an audio unit.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:10.520
And all I have to do is click.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:29.600
[Transcript missing]

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:23.800
[Transcript missing]

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.300
and if you're interested in finding
out more about audio at Apple in

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.520
the OS as well as in our products,
there is a hands-on lab

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.240
tomorrow from 12:00 to 6:00.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.300
Some of our audio
engineers will be there,

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.670
and they can help you even from
a content creation standpoint.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.070
So I suggest you check that out
on the second floor tomorrow.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.230
So Frank introduced at the beginning
the idea of we have some new members

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.240
of our media architecture in Mac OS X.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.360
You might have seen mention of them in
some of the other sessions prior to now.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.120
And what I'd like to
explain is why do you care?

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.930
Why is this important for
content professionals?

00:16:08.300 --> 00:17:59.100
[Transcript missing]

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:05.310
From a matching perspective,
we're taking a look at Core Video.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.500
Core Video is really providing a new,
modern architecture to video.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:15.630
It really enables the pipeline
between QuickTime and OpenGL.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.610
What does that mean?

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.500
It's really a hardware-accelerated
pipeline that we can use for

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.510
some amazing effects using GL,
or you can pipe it right through to

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.690
Core Image for real-time effects.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.600
So why do you care about this?

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.500
What does it mean for you?

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.100
So let me show you one of my demos
here and kind of walk you through it.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.240
I mean, all these things are
built right into the OS.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.190
And what I have here is a little
demo app called Funhouse that we

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.100
just have for internal testing.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.010
And it really helps us test
what the filters are in the OS.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.970
And we have a huge list of
things built into the system.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.900
And they're all,
what's great about Core Image is

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.800
that we can take these chains of
effects and stack them together

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.200
in a non-destructive way.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.450
So your original content is untouched.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.700
It's there to do whatever it is
you want to do with it later,

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.410
as long as you remember these effects.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.600
And they're all responding in real time.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.000
And again, this is all built in the OS.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.670
And it works with video as well.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:30.590
All in real time,
all leverage on the GPU.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.060
And you can,
the performance of this is just amazing.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:38.260
What we're working on top
of is a 720p 264 clip,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.300
and I can in real time distort this.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.300
We're doing a bump distortion.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.690
We can do things like...

00:19:49.100 --> 00:20:53.400
[Transcript missing]

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:01.290
My dad thanks Aimee for
pronouncing my last name correctly.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.300
This is the Motion interface.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.000
Motion is a brand new application.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.240
It's not released yet.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.130
And it will show you some things
that you can do when you build

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.500
a brand new application from the
ground up that takes advantage of

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.200
the Mac OS X and the Mac hardware,
including the technology

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.080
that Core Video is based on.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.010
So over here, you have a file browser.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.260
And the file browser kind
of mimics the Finder.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.240
You have drives, mounted servers,
anything that you have

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.640
in your Finder level,
you have up the top here.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.760
And down below are all the files
that you would find in any folder.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.160
So if you want to take one,
you just import it by dragging

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.020
and dropping it from the
file browser into the canvas.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.240
And you just hit Play.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.900
So once you have it start playing,
you can do a bunch of things.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.250
You can scale it down as it plays.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.760
You can grab the little
handle and rotate it.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.920
You can come in and choose to have
a kind of a perspective distortion.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.680
And you can see it's very interactive.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.020
You can just drag this stuff around
and move it around really quickly.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.640
And this is the kind of
interactivity that you can get.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.240
By using what Amy was showing
and just inside of Motion.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.840
Besides the onscreen controls,
over here in the file browser,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.690
it's a tabbed window.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.880
So you can go to the inspector
just by clicking on a tab.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.960
And you have all the sliders and
dials that you would want to do

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.820
this by numbers if you wanted to.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.980
Or you could just reset it all.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.110
Besides that, you have a library,
and in the library,

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.130
that's where all the goodies are found,
that's where all the fun

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.140
stuff to play with are.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.880
You have things like filters,
a lot of the filters, you can see they're

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.000
all accelerated again.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.380
So we can come in and we can
choose some like distortions,

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.850
and we can choose like black hole here.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:49.200
[Transcript missing]

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.070
But you have a bunch of these filters.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.530
Some are very stylized filters,
like you can come in and say,

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.300
"Stylize." This is kind
of one of my favorites.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.020
It just kind of makes this
Doctor Who kind of tunnel-y

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.100
slit kind of thing effect.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.370
So you have a lot of these
filters that you can just play

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.130
with as the clip plays back,
and you can layer up multiple clips.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.040
But you can also create animations,
and you can create animations

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.330
through different ways.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.540
We created this animation.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.620
You can see the little preview up
the top here in the file browser.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.860
It's just a keyframed
animation that we saved off,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.250
and you can bring it back in.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.000
So you can just drag layers
from your projects into the

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.150
file browser to save them,
and you can just drag them back into

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.960
another project and lay them down,
and then you get the

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.460
same animation playback.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.150
So what you can do,
you can actually choose

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.130
this little clip here,
and you have a full keyframe

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.130
editor that you can open up
and keyframe things as well.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.360
Besides that, you have text tools.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.360
Up the top, you have a tool palette,
a tool bar.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.700
You have hand panning,
and you can zoom in on clips,

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.000
and the clip still plays,
and you can zoom in very quickly.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.200
So it's very interactive.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.480
You can choose your text tool.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.180
This might be like a broadcast promo,
so we'll do KPL8.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.770
And now that you have the text on screen,
you can do different things.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.750
You can change the size
very interactively,

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.350
the tracking, all the things you might
want to do with text.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.160
You can change the color,
get a nice yellow there.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.430
You can change the font.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.510
It's very interactive on the
font as it dynamically changes

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.320
as you scroll through the list.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.620
So that's kind of fun.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.470
And the whole goal was to make
this very interactive and very fun

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.420
to play with as a working tool.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.500
Over here,
this little dashboard is a floating

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.920
transparent little widget that gives you
all the most common controls you would

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.720
have for anything you select on screen.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.480
So I have text selected,
so it gives me all the text controls.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.940
If I have something else selected,
you'll notice then it will

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.320
give me different controls.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.450
For instance,
to animate this text right now,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.110
instead of keyframing it,
we can go back into the library and we

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.940
can choose something called behaviors.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.120
Behaviors are kind of a
different way of animating things

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.320
rather than using keyframes.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.640
They don't set keyframes.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.680
They apply these kind of
natural forces to objects.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.640
So I can choose something
like a basic motion behavior.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.900
And I can come in and choose-- let's see,
we'll come down.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.940
That's not released yet.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.980
Did I say that?

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.610
Now I'm going to bring out my guitar.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:14.040
Let me just get back into this,
and I'll show you some behaviors.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.730
So we'll just load our clip back in.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.880
and our animation,
and we'll start playing.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.570
And we'll choose our text tool.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.240
and go back into our library
and our basic behaviors and

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.620
put on a throw behavior.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.030
Now, the throw behavior just lets me
choose which direction using this

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.740
dashboard I want to throw it in.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.930
So the more I pull it out,
the faster it throws,

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.780
and the less I push it in,
the more I push it in,

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.540
the slower it throws.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.640
We can just get it very quickly
going along a line here,

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.740
just very smooth.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.150
If I want to make a copy,
I can just option drag this out,

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.530
and I have a copy of it.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.700
Same animation in everything.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.810
I can go back to the copy now in the
animation and just change direction if

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.740
I wanted to go in a different direction.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.730
So very quickly,
I have this animation of text,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.320
and I can pull this one
over as it animates.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.440
Maybe make it go a little bit slower.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.430
And I can just double click
it and select evening.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.190
News.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:17.800
Something like this.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.090
As it goes off screen,
it's actually really,

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.660
it's great for the demo,
but it's not practical in daily

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.070
use where you can actually,
because the text is

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.580
going all over the place.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.170
Okay, anyway,
but we have this animation here,

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.190
and you can do other animations
with behaviors like different

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:35.110
types of behaviors understand
specifically about text.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.880
For instance, if I want a nice little
highlight on this,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.180
I can come in and just
throw on a highlight here,

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.230
and as the text animates
across the screen,

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.640
you'll see it gives it a
little sequence of highlight.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.200
Across the screen.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.080
You can also animate the position.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.810
I can come in,
and I can choose a different behavior,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.580
maybe a zoom behavior that
just zooms in the KPL text.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.750
So now the text will
kind of zoom on screen,

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.310
and the highlight goes
across evening news.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.960
Besides all these behaviors,
you have a full particle

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.370
engine that you can choose.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.680
You have things like smoke,
and we can come in here

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.010
and see a little preview.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.380
You can drag it around.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.480
You have things like sparkles.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.380
Anything you would normally find in
a full-blown particle engine would

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.440
come with over 140 little presets
that you can play around with,

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:18.880
or you can create your own.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.300
We created this one earlier,
and we can just drag and drop it on.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.280
It gives it a little
nice little glowy line,

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.560
and you can see everything
is still very interactive.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.610
I can come to the background still and
move it around as things play on top.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.910
Okay.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.110
The last little bit I wanted to
show you was you can import any

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:40.300
QuickTime file format as well as export,
including MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.000
And you can bring in Photoshop documents,
and when you bring in

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.500
Photoshop documents,
if they have layers,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.300
it will show you the layers here.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.230
You can import all the layers.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.300
These are our anchors for our newscast,
maybe.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.300
And we can shrink them down.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.300
Now, behaviors don't necessarily
just operate on one layer.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.270
They can operate on multiple layers.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.630
You have sophisticated kind of
simulation behaviors that simulate

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.300
gravity and things like that.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.410
And we can just come into our
behaviors in the library again,

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.300
and we can choose simulations.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.300
We can try one like, um, attractor.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.510
We'll direct the attractor
on the center anchor,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.930
and when we do that,
the other two are attracted.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.200
Right?

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.650
So this is great because
they're not keyframes,

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.990
and what that means is I can
actually come in and move her around,

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:25.990
and they'll follow her.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.140
You can do these things very quickly.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.780
We all have people that we work with.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.080
We might want to put a
rappel version on there.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.480
We can do rappels.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.960
You can come in and you can
go full screen and you can

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.320
work on this at full screen.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.620
This is an idea of motion and what
you can do when you actually build

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.330
an application that takes advantage
of everything the Mac has to offer.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.120
As well, if you're interested in more,
tomorrow at 10.30 there's

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.480
a full session on this.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.360
That's motion.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.130
Thank you.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:11.000
[Transcript missing]

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.900
One of the cool things about this
core architecture that we've built in,

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.820
it allows us to provide a
predictable and reliable set of

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.560
services that let developers,
in this case, you know,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.690
Apple and our applications group,
kind of like play with the notion of

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.330
user interface and user experience.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.300
We can kind of rewrite the rules about
how UI is done when you can count on a

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.840
set of services and capabilities to be
built in at a very predictable level.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.300
And we're really looking forward
to seeing what happens over

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.710
the coming months with some
of these core technologies.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.750
So, what I'm going to do is because of
some of the technical demo errors,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.480
problems we had there, I'm going to blast
through some of my slides.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.150
I'm sure you guys are going
to be really sad about that.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.370
But,
so I'm going to power through this area

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.300
because I want to save time for some of
the cool demos that we have coming up.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.350
And what I wanted to do is,
in this section,

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.280
just kind of do an update on
standards and where things are

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.630
because it's so important to what's
been going on in QuickTime and

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.780
driving the incredible growth and
distribution of what's been going on.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.300
We've always supported
standards in QuickTime.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.220
You guys know that.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.430
You can't have a serious
architecture or media architecture

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.020
in the world if you don't support
and respect these standards.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.690
And to us, lately,
it's been standards from this part of

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.410
the world that's really been driving a
lot of what's been going on in our space

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.050
and a lot of the adoption of QuickTime.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.000
A lot of people ask us, you know,
how is MPEG-4 doing?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.520
We do a lot of press interviews,
a lot of analyst interviews.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.550
And I'm going to move
closer to the clicker thing.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.460
There it is.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.020
And you know,
if you do a search on the web,

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.800
you can find just hundreds of
companies with thousands of products,

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:48.560
various bits of hardware devices that are
all just capturing and coding in MPEG-4.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.240
It's really taken off in a huge way.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:55.350
Our own iTunes Music Store, AAC,
our friends up in

00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:00.500
Washington State switched over
using AAC in their music store.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.440
I mean, that was sweet.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.410
I mean,
the thing that's kind of interesting is,

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.480
you know,
at Apple and the QuickTime team,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.410
you know,
we have a cap that's got two logos on it.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.180
In the front, there's a blue Q,
and then we're very proud and we're very,

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:15.180
you know, we're very dedicated to making
sure that QuickTime does well.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.460
But we have to flip that cap around,
and it kind of says, you know,

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.170
the ISO logo on the other side.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.480
And that means we want to be, you know,
we're card-carrying members

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.810
of the ISO-compliant universe,
and we want to make sure that we invite

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.620
as many people to play as is possible.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.580
So while we do compete head-on
with Real Networks and with

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.700
Windows Media from Microsoft every
day in a variety of areas,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.390
we also, when we flip our cap around,
invite them, very much so,

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.060
to do what we've been
doing with standards.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.000
Because the more people
that play in this space,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.580
the better off it is for everybody.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:50.450
These guys have been just driving
MPEG-4 adoption in huge ways.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.950
Docomo, KDDI,
certainly these are some of the

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.070
earlier guys who have massive
distribution of multimedia-enabled

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.020
phones and people using them.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.210
We go to Japan a lot,
and when we work with these

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.470
guys in Docomo and KDDI,
the stuff that they're doing and a lot of

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.680
the content is created using QuickTime,
actually all of the content

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.430
that Docomo creates and all of
the content that KDDI creates

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.170
starts off as a QuickTime movie,
saved off as a 3G file,

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.060
and distributed over their
networks to these phones.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.580
They're massive users,
and it's not just those guys.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.340
We took this on a street corner.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.520
This is a storefront.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.350
These are all media-enabled phones.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.500
It's absolutely amazing
what's happening overseas.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.350
The good news is it's coming here too.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.310
Part of what you're going to hear
about in just a little bit is how

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.380
it is in fact coming here and why
it's going to really matter for us.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.100
A lot of what we've been doing to date,
though,

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.190
has been creation of QuickTime files,
and, you know,

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.330
they're on a G5 using Final Cut Pro or
on a PC using a PC app,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.860
and that file then moved off to a
server somewhere of someone's design.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.440
And as we've been traveling
the world and talking with

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.580
telcos a lot lately in the past,
you know, past couple of years,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.460
and certainly in the last year,
we've been asked routinely

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.090
for an N10 solution.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.900
We've been asked constantly, what,
can we buy this whole

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.070
thing from you guys?

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.070
You have servers, right?

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.560
And we're like, yeah.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.200
And you have a streaming
server for the internet.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.260
And we're like, yeah,
I guess if we plug them all

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.910
together and change it a little bit,
we could do the same thing

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.870
on the wireless internet that
we're doing on a wired internet.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.450
And so what we've started doing,
and very, very recently,

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.020
but incredibly successfully,
it's unbelievable how quick

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.560
the uptake for our solution
has gone in parts of the world.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.600
We're selling racks of XSERVs right now
into telcos and selcos around the world,

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:39.030
providing solutions for streaming
to this whole new 3G space.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.440
So I'm going to step
through this very quickly.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.100
The part that we're most
familiar with is this,

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.960
content creation.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.840
You're going to see a demonstration in
a little bit about Final Cut Pro HD,

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.110
you know, editing content in high def and
then saving it out as a 3G file.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.860
And so we're very familiar
with this part of the world.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.960
And we all know that it's
not just our own tools,

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.990
but any tool that uses QuickTime,
the suite of APIs that are there,

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.240
as we update the version
of QuickTime underneath,

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.860
the application above it gets
all of the new capabilities,

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.180
all the new features,
and all the new features.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.520
And more importantly,
access to all the new codecs.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.430
So as we add 3GPP and
then 3GPP2 and then later,

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.850
you know, H.264,
all of these applications will

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.410
automatically expose those capabilities,
which is really,

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:22.120
really cool for content creators.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.320
You don't have to buy new
hardware or buy new software.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:30.770
And after the content is created,
our delivery solution has been updated,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.800
has been modified to
include our XSERV G5.

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:42.460
This monster device can reflect over
10,000 simultaneous streams to handsets,

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.150
over 10,000 simultaneous,
just from one of these devices.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.170
And if you've got stored files,
on-demand files,

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.260
around 4,000 or so 3G files
simultaneously streamed.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.950
And what's kind of interesting is
certainly if you have a lot more files,

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.150
we have a lot more storage available.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.200
But, you know,
we have a flexible solution.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.850
What's interesting is the software,
like OS X Server,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.600
and the streaming server,
like QuickTime streaming server,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.280
ship on this hardware when
you buy this for free.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.840
And this has presented a pretty
interesting proposition for us,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.630
a value proposition for the
folks that we're talking to.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.700
When we compare our solution with some of
the folks who are also in this industry,

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.250
most notably real networks,
who have had the early mover advantage,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:26.380
they got out there very early,
have done a very interesting job,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.780
we compare our solution.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.080
We can take our XSERV G5
and slide it into a rack,

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.900
and with it comes all the software that,
you know, we're talking about, you know,

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.970
the hardware that you need.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.980
And the server costs, I don't know,
$4,500 or so.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.480
And that's it.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.290
The same thing done on
the real network side.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.990
You buy a piece of hardware
from HP or Dell for,

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:48.480
you know, $4,500 or so,
and you slide it in a rack.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.160
And then you get to pay real
networks about $45,000 for the

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.470
right to use their software.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.050
And so as we've started going to the
different telcos around the world,

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:01.040
and one noticeably,
we're in the Pacific Rim, some country,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.100
talking to some telco,
and we lay this thing out.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:04.800
The senior vice president, you know,
he's the one who's going

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:04.970
to be talking to us.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.280
And he's going to be talking to us.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.270
And the senior vice president
of the company is like,

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.410
okay, so you're telling me that I paid
$4,500 or whatever unit of

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.280
denomination for this device,
and there's no software charge.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.280
There's no licensing fee.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.130
I can just use it?

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.280
And the answer was yes.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.280
And it was a no-brainer,
and they ordered a rack of XSERVs.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.360
It was just such a beautiful thing
to see QuickTime and the solutions

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:30.190
that we've built helping create
a whole new market for Apple.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.250
We're selling XSERVs into
telcos because of QuickTime.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:34.910
And that's it.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.880
With that often goes a G5,
a cinema display, and, you know,

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.280
Final Cut Pro or some other software
for people to do the creation and

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.100
the management of these servers.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.100
It's really working out well for us.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.060
And now that we have
active communications,

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:53.100
trials and tests with over
25 telcos around the world,

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.100
and it's just growing, growing fast,
really fast.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.910
So that's working out pretty well.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.100
Now,
we've always been doing content creation.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.070
Of course,
we could always do content playback.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.810
Our client supports 3GPP.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.920
And 3GPP2 without a problem.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.920
We have got the best built-in
support for that anywhere.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.150
And so the folks like Docomo and
KDDI have always recommended to

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.370
their subscribers download and
install QuickTime because people

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:19.090
with their phones are grabbing movies
and they email them to people and

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:20.750
they want QuickTime to play it back.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.980
And now companies like Docomo, KDDI,
Sprint here in the U.S., they're

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.920
showing up in our download list.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.920
We look at our numbers every single day.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.520
They're showing up in our download list
repeatedly every day in our top 20 or

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.740
25 referrers for QuickTime downloads.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.410
That many of their subscribers and
their subscribers' friends are getting

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.740
QuickTime to play back these movies.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.740
It's really starting to pick up.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.400
So, what I'd like to do now is
introduce Joseph Linaschke,

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.580
who works in our professional group,
professional marketing

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.690
applications group,
to do a quick demo of Final Cut Pro HD.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.550
And what we're going to do is
check this cool application out,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.650
and then we're going to use the
output of the work that he's done,

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.790
and we're going to push it up to a
server and stream it back to a phone.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.340
So, Joseph.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.680
Thank you, Frank.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:04.510
All yours, man.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.750
The Final Cut Pro HD -- Thank you.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.830
Final Cut Pro HD is the newest
version of Final Cut Pro,

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.280
which was announced and released
earlier this year at the

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.100
NAB conference in Las Vegas.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.970
Now the most important new feature
of Final Cut Pro HD is a direct

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.820
result of our close working
relationship with Panasonic,

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.100
the manufacturer of the very popular
high definition VeriCam camera.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.020
What we can do with Final Cut Pro HD is
actually capture the native

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:35.190
DVC Pro HD content shot on those
VeriCam cameras over FireWire,

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.100
that's standard original FireWire,
not even FireWire B,

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.090
into your G5 or even onto
your laptop G4 computer.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.620
Not only capture it over FireWire,
but also edit that high

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.100
definition content in real time.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.170
Now you might be wondering why are we
up here talking about high definition

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.100
non-linear editing in the middle
of a QuickTime delivery session.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:57.100
Well, regardless of your final output,
your content needs to be created,

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.130
and if that content is video,
then the obvious choice

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.060
is Final Cut Pro HD.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.470
But why high definition?

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.100
That's an awfully big scale to go
from HD all the way down to the phone.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:08.960
Well think of HD or high definition
as a universal master format for you.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.090
If you shoot and edit in HD,
your choices are unlimited.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.100
You can deliver to high def TV, HDTV.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.100
You can print to film.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.100
You can deliver an
HD projection in an HD theater.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.930
Or in the future,
you'll be able to create

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.040
high definition DVDs.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.050
Now from there,
you can scale that down to

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:28.020
standard definition for standard
def broadcast or standard def DVD.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.020
Of course, you can bring it down farther
to MPEG-4 for the web.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.100
Or today, you can finally export that
content onto a 3G phone.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.340
And that's what we're
going to look at today.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.680
So let's take a look at Final Cut Pro.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.120
This is Final Cut Pro 4 HD,
and I have a project that's

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:48.800
partially finished here,
and we're just going to finish it up

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.800
and then deliver it to the cell phone.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.790
So here's what I have so far.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.580
We have a project that's
been started here,

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.740
but it needs a little bit of work.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:11.900
So I'm going to do three things to it.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.110
The first will be very simple.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.770
I want to add a transition
between these two shots here.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.000
So to do that, I'll go to my Effects tab,
and as you can see in here,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.700
I have a Video Transitions category.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.790
If I open that up,
I have several categories to choose from:

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.190
Dissolves, Wipes, Irises, Maps,
and so on.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.190
And I have in here a QuickTime category.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:35.280
So let's go ahead and take a
QuickTime push and drag and drop that

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.200
directly onto the timeline like so.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.690
Now I can change the duration of that
transition by simply dragging it directly

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.770
on the timeline and then play that back.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.000
Just like that.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.680
Now you can see that
happened in real time.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.150
There was no rendering required.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.740
In fact, if I want to make a
change to that transition,

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.700
I can open it up into the viewer,
change that from a top

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.230
push to a right push,
play it again,

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.200
once again without rendering.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.960
So off to a good start here.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.410
Now the next change I'm going
to make is to this pool shot.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.790
You'll notice that the break
happens right on the beat.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.400
But then the shot continues,
not a whole lot else happens,

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:14.540
but the beat repeats.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.910
So what I want to do is have a little
bit of fun with this clip and work with

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.460
the time remapping tool to take that
pool cue break and have it happen twice,

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.140
both times on the beat.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.780
So let's see what we're going to do.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.920
First thing I'll do is just go ahead
and zoom into this clip a little

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.800
bit and open up my my tool set here,
my little mini timeline,

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:36.960
and grab the time
remapping tool from here.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.480
Now once again, if I play through this,
you'll see there's the first beat.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.610
And there's the second beat right there.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.000
Now the first break is
already lined up to the beat,

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.200
so I'm going to go ahead and
add a keyframe to lock that in.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.900
And I'll also turn on my time remap
graph so that I can see what's happening,

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.240
I can see the changes to my timeline.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.400
I'm going to go ahead and
let that play normally,

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.540
just for a little bit.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.700
We'll go ahead and add a keyframe there,
so it's going to lock into that position.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.430
And then if I go forward
to where that last beat is,

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.910
which is right about here.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:08.910
There's that beat.

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:12.760
I'm going to go ahead and grab that
keyframe and adjust the frame of

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.900
video that we're actually looking at,
dragging it back in time until

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.220
I get to the break again.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.500
So there's the break.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.380
So now I have the break happening twice.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.940
So far so good,
but what I really want is to

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.090
have that cue ball go back a
little bit farther back to the

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.180
pool cue so he shoots it twice.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.540
So let's go ahead about
halfway in between here,

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.920
add another key frame,
and I'll just drag that

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.900
back right about there.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:48.900
All happening in real
time in high definition.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.540
One more thing I want to
add on to here is a title.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.300
Let's go ahead back to the
beginning of the project.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.900
This is a small bumper for San Francisco,
so I want to add a little title

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.390
that says San Francisco right here.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.990
There's some built-in titling
tools inside of Final Cut Pro,

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.970
but it also ships with a
program called LiveType.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.750
LiveType is an awesome
tool for doing very quick,

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.480
very easy animated titles.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.000
Let's go ahead and have a look at that.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.470
I've already exported
this single clip here,

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.000
so let's go ahead and
switch over to LiveType.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.570
You'll notice I can even check my
mail in the background here while

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.000
working with Final Cut Pro HD.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.980
Let's go ahead into LiveType here
and place a background movie.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.500
There's that Golden Gate Bridge shot,
drop it onto the timeline.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.950
Now I need to add some text,
so I'll just go in here

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.500
and type in San Francisco.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.500
Did I spell that right?

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.000
San Fran-cisco.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.680
You know, you can type 120 words per
minute until you get up on stage.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.330
Did you know that?

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.500
That's the way it works.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.340
Alright, there we go.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.460
San Francisco on there.

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.990
I can change the size of
that text if I want to.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.520
I can of course change the font.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.980
Let's go ahead over to my fonts category,
choose any font that I want in here.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:52.300
I'm going to grab this Bauhaus font,
apply that.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.500
I'll bring the type size
up just a little bit.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.000
I can even go in here and individually
manipulate these characters.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.500
So for example, bring the F over here.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.480
I can drag this over a little
bit to tighten that up.

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:03.330
Now if I want to animate this,
much like in motion

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.000
where we have behaviors,
here I have something called effects.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.790
And these effects are pre-done
animations that I can simply

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:10.500
drag and drop onto the timeline.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.490
You'll see we have various
fade effects in here.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:58.900
[Transcript missing]

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.070
and David Cronenberg.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.430
For more information about the
QuickTime and Digital Media project,

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.190
visit www.quicktime.com.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.190
This is Frank Casanova,
and I'll see you next time.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:31.840
. and choose Open in Editor,
which will launch that

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.200
project back into LiveType.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.200
I can now go to my Style Tab, Outline,
turn that on,

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.120
and let's just give it a nice heavy,
beefy black outline on there.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.200
I'll simply hit Command+S to save,
tab back to Final Cut Pro HD.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.850
It's immediately updated,
and there's the piece

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.200
back on the timeline.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.150
Let's go ahead and see what this
would look like in the final piece,

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.200
and we'll look at this
in full-screen here.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:14.700
[Transcript missing]

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.430
and that's all there is to it.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.370
So from here I'm ready to
export this out for 3G.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:27.910
So simply choose File,
Export using QuickTime conversion,

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:31.050
and directly from within
Final Cut Pro I can choose to

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.130
export a 3G file and of course
have access to all the options

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:37.000
that I would need for a 3G output.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.160
That file has already been saved on
the desktop and I'd like to bring

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.860
Frank back up here to go ahead
and show you how we output that

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960
or stream that to the cell phone.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.910
Thanks a lot guys.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.190
OK.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.620
So we'll stay on this demo machine.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:02.680
Because what I want to do now is now that
we've looked at how this edits in HD,

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.680
and Joseph showed you our export panel,
what's interesting is Final Cut Pro,

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:11.080
like any other QuickTime app,
can access these export controls.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.020
They look exactly the same whether
you're using QuickTime Pro,

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.180
Final Cut Pro,
or any application on the Mac or the PC.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:19.400
And it's very straightforward
and very easy.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.820
And what I want to do now is
now that we have this file,

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.760
Can we have this guy go back up, please?

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.960
Thanks.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.910
What I want to do now is get
this file off my computer

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:36.140
and get it out onto a server,
for example, in a telco somewhere.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:40.110
And we have a product.

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:45.280
called QTSS Publisher that
we ship with our server.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:48.560
We can connect to the server,
which we have set up.

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:51.920
And the file that Joseph--
we kind of pre-baked this,

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:55.710
so we didn't make you sit
through the actual transcode.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.930
This is the file.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:00.150
And all I need to do-- I mean,
it really is a pretty straightforward

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:01.410
drag and drop operation.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:06.780
I grab this 3GP file,
drag it into this window.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.890
It moves over to the server.

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.150
I can click on this.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.290
Click on this published media file,
and you get a lot of

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:17.760
interesting information.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.800
You know, I can make sure that
I do the right thing.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.660
You get poster frame with this.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.200
You get HTML automatically written.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.380
You can copy this HTML right
out of this screen,

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.600
put it on your web page.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.070
It has all the links,
all the right information on how

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.810
to actually access this file.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.330
And then if I wanted
to see how it worked,

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.490
because when we pushed it up there,
it was automatically

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:38.420
made streaming ready.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:39.610
It automatically hinted it.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.170
What QuickTime uses are
hint tracks in a movie file.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.260
MPEG-4 employed that because, of course,
they're using QuickTime as

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.260
their file format.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.320
I can hit play here,
and there's that file

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.340
that Joseph created.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.120
So that's streaming back
to our desktop here.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.790
But now that it's streaming
back to our desktop,

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:08.140
we know that it works.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.090
If we can go back to slides, please.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.880
What do we want to do with this?

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.540
Well,
we probably want to take it somewhere

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.540
more interesting than a desktop.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.500
We're talking about workflow,
we're talking about

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.560
how files are created,
how files are hinted,

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.400
how files are moved.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.400
Now, how can they be played back in
the larger scheme of things?

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.280
What I'd like to introduce is
David Vernicki from AT&T Wireless to

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:36.710
join me on stage and talk a little bit
about the way that our companies are

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:40.610
benefiting from the development and
the use of standards to actually just

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:44.180
work together very seamlessly because
we both read from the same recipe book.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.560
David, welcome.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.070
Thanks for having me,
and my dad thanks you for

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.860
pronouncing my last name correctly,
too.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.310
About three years ago,
I made my first trip over to Asia to view

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:04.820
one of the first live demonstrations of
streaming video on a wireless network.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.450
And naturally, we all came back pretty
excited from that journey.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.680
And I was asked, you know,
what does it take for this to

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.070
become reality in North America?

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:20.580
And my response was convergence,
and a convergence of networks, devices,

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.780
and standards, I think, are key.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.440
So we started to see
some of that convergence,

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.190
and I really think 2004 is the year
of convergence because now we finally

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.940
have devices with the capabilities,
both with displays, with memory,

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.220
and battery capabilities to
actually render this content.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:39.110
We have networks that have evolved,
whether they be GSM or CDMA-based

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.670
networks that can now deliver
the bandwidth required for this

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.840
content to be enabled to the phone.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.580
And we now have standards convergence,
where previously we were

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.120
operating in a telco center,
or a desktop internet-centric world.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.880
We've seen the convergence arrive.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.530
And really,
the epitome of that convergence, I think,

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.020
is demonstrated in what Apple's
done with their QuickTime tools

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:05.280
and content authoring and creation
capabilities that they've developed,

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.040
all based on standards and the diligent
work that Frank and his team have done

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.480
in working to make sure that all of the
products allow the content to be created,

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.370
delivered,
whether it's by you as a developer,

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.820
one of our content partners.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.220
So, as I said, we're working to create a
system that allows users to have

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:24.710
access to all of the content,
whether it's a mobile, a carrier,

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:25.280
or even a consumer,
to take their own personal

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.180
content and publish it and make
it available to other users on the

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:26.820
desktop or on the mobile phone.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:32.300
So what I've done is I've
browsed out to the website that

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:39.400
Frank has posted that content on,
and I'm going to actually stream the

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:43.950
content directly off of the server here.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.950
Can we have this,
the back-load device on the screen?

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.080
And of course, the demo gods will
cooperate here with me.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.500
We'll get this to work here.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:59.570
Hey guys, can we get this camera rig?

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:13.630
So I've browsed out to the site.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.400
There's a link up there to the content.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:21.800
And as I've connected,
we actually get to see the real thing.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:28.800
And of course it's cybers.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.030
So it was that easy for Frank to
take the content and publish it,

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.250
and for me to browse it on the phone.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:48.440
Just to be clear,
certainly we could have done this as a,

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.460
you know, played it from the phone or,
you know, like stored it on the

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.420
phone and played it back,
but this was real-time streaming.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.570
I mean, this is pretty cool because the
only place you could normally see

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:59.380
this up until now is if you got
on a plane and flew for 14 hours,

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.840
you know,
somewhere where they serve Asian food.

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:04.950
But now we can hear,
we're starting to actually get a network

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:09.040
that has evolved enough where we can push
content to servers and the bandwidth,

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.100
the wireless bandwidth is enough to
actually do this stuff in real time.

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.980
This is getting really exciting
to be able to do this right now.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:15.800
Right here in San Francisco.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.460
So... Yeah,
and this is actually available

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.820
nationwide on our network and our
friendly competitors' networks.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.360
Sure.

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.550
This device is an upcoming
Nokia Edge-enabled phone.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.260
You've probably seen the
European counterpart to this,

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.020
the 6600.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.300
This is the 6620.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:34.020
This device has the ability to
stream up to 130 kilobits per second.

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.990
So, convergence has happened,
and in 2004, it's here.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:39.400
Cool.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.290
Thanks a lot.

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.580
Appreciate you joining us here.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.210
So, one example from one of the
folks that we're working with,

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:53.250
and certainly as we just kind
of rally around standards,

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:56.110
you know, it works out incredibly well.

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:59.690
You don't have to cut deals
because the standard is the deal.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.460
The standard is what makes things work.

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.420
And that was all just done
because we both kind of,

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.400
you know,
do the right thing at the right time.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.150
So, we showed one example
that was kind of like,

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.620
you know,
a make-believe from a professional

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:14.320
content creator doing HD,
exporting out the 3G to the AT&T phone.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.110
But we also have an opportunity...

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.160
Where's that clicker thing?

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.510
Here it is.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.480
If we could go back to slides real quick.

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:25.710
To take a look at another example,

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:31.800
and David We've worked closely with the
AT&T guys and with Verizon Wireless guys,

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:34.000
they're both kind of friends
of the family and of course,

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.600
card-carrying members of
the standards community.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.840
And what I'd like to do is introduce
Doug Busk to join me on stage.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.140
Doug's been a friend of the family
as has Dave for a long time.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.740
Welcome.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.740
Doug Busk: Thanks, Frank.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.120
And so, you know,
like the other one started

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.690
from kind of Final Cut Pro,
professional content creation,

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.460
we'll take a more kind of
like consumer-oriented content

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.440
creation play on this one.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:53.910
Doug Busk: Excellent.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:54.430
Well, thanks, Frank.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.920
Well, first of all,
let me say we're very excited to be here.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.720
The timing is perfect because we
launched our video messaging product,

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.170
which is a part of our GetFlix
line of products on Friday.

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.880
The timing couldn't be
any more impeccable.

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:11.770
Our video messaging product allows
recording of full video and sound

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:16.770
up to 15 seconds or about 200
kilobytes to be sent peer-to-peer,

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:19.460
online and down to mail,
which we're going to

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.640
demonstrate in a moment.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.340
So when we looked around
in the playback universe,

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.540
there really wasn't much of a question.

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.810
We chose 3GPP2 as our standard,
and so we went with QuickTime as

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:31.870
our preferred playback mechanism
on the desktop on PC and Mac.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.860
There really was no issue there.

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.040
QuickTime was excellent to work with.

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:39.360
And I think as you'll see,
the QuickTime really gives the product

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.070
a wonderfully holistic approach.

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:45.270
So you're able to send from device
to desktop and back with ease

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.220
with QuickTime and QuickTime Pro.

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.870
So do you want to go and show
off a little bit of the demo?

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:50.880
Let's give it a go, man.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.940
Doug Busk: Okay.

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.560
So talk about the demo
gods blessing us here.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.790
I'm going to go ahead and
take a short video of Frank.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:57.800
Go ahead and stop Frank.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.800
Are you recording?

00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.800
Doug Busk: Yep, I'm recording.

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.800
Hey, everybody.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.800
Mark, you should have played
a little heavier music,

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.700
man.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.850
Doug Busk: So I'm going to stop that,
and I'm going to send that

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:10.460
over to both Frank's email and
his phone at the same time.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:14.500
So let me go ahead and add
those out of my contacts list.

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:19.100
We're going to move right
over here to the computer.

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.300
Okay.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.500
Give me just a moment here.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.340
Again,
this is a set of activities that you

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.430
would normally have to go pretty far
away from here to actually see happen.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:32.900
Right.

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.840
So right now I'm connecting
up to our 1X RTT network.

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:37.220
It's branded as National Access.

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.610
So it's currently sending the message.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.880
This National Access runs
around dial-up speeds,

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.100
50 kbps, which shouldn't be confused
with our EVDO network,

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.820
which is broadband access,
which we have launching in several

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.720
cities currently available in
San Diego and D.C., which is

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.520
more like 500 kbps downstream.

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.720
There's no lacking of
acronyms in this industry.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.740
Yeah.

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:02.090
Okay, so the message has been sent.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:08.660
I'm also going to upload this to our
PixPlace website at the same time.

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.430
So I'm going to go ahead and
do that while we're waiting

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:11.480
for this to come into mail.

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:31.900
Okay, we're looking for it.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.900
Just thinking.

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:41.900
Okay, so it's coming to the phone
and it came in the mail.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.900
We got it at the exact same time.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.900
How about that?

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:45.900
That's never happened before.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:46.860
Can you hear me now?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.880
That's what my network
guys are going to say.

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:52.900
They're here, I have to say that.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.270
Okay,
so where do you want to look at it first,

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.890
on the computer?

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:58.620
Yeah, let's take a look at it in
Mail Playback to give you an idea

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:00.900
of the power of QuickTime delivery.

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:06.970
This is a video we just took,
uploaded via our video messaging service,

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.420
and it's right there in
message and preview thanks to

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.900
QuickTime integration into the Mail app.

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.760
So should I just go ahead and play?

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.900
Yeah, go ahead and play.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:28.530
So we realize that not everybody is going
to have a video messaging capable phone,

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:31.560
but we hope that people run
out and buy our LG VX7000,

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.440
which will be available here on Friday.

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:37.240
So Frank's going to take a look at the,
I'm going to put the 7000

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.230
up on the demo stand,
and let's see if we can connect

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:41.770
up and download the video.

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.600
So my phone said that I had a message.

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:45.500
Yep.

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:47.600
And...

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.150
Where did it go?

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.540
Yipes.

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.540
Did the right beeping thing.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.720
Right there under message.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.740
On the inbox.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.390
It said message.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.590
These newfangled devices.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:07.640
So I will... Go ahead and
pop that right in there.

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.290
Go pop this... Oh, can we switch over,
guys?

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:09.630
Thank you.

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:11.060
Switch over, guys.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:11.860
Thank you.

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:14.280
There we go.

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:17.250
I will push the little play button.

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.600
and that was delivered simultaneously
to the desktop to mail to anybody

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.530
who has QuickTime 6.5 and above.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.220
Now what I'm doing is logging
into our PIX Place website,

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.900
which is vzwpix.com.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.430
- Anybody who's gonna go ahead
and ask me for a free phone,

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:53.140
this number is gonna be defunct
about 10 minutes after the show,

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:55.300
so you'll have to come and
approach me separately.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.440
- Damn.

00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:01.100
- So we'll just walk into the inbox here,
and again, you'll notice we've got

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.430
the QuickTime integrated
right into the website.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.300
It pulls up the player
embedded in Safari,

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.610
and we also have the mention on
the side here for anybody who

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:11.220
doesn't happen to have QuickTime,
although we don't believe

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.490
that number to be many.

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:22.320
So I can go ahead and copy and move
and organize all of my video messages.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.790
But what's really exciting about what
we're doing with QuickTime is the ability

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:30.830
to create and deliver content downstream
to VZW video messaging customers.

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:34.040
So Frank's going to pull
up a QuickTime edit here.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.940
Okay, so what we have is personal video.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.720
One of the cameras that I showed
earlier from Sanyo is this

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:42.980
really cool MPEG-4 camera.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.580
You may have seen it.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.780
It shoots stills and video,
solid state on SD cards.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.540
And the video that it
captures is a .mp4 file,

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:51.980
and that's what this is.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.000
We capture some content,
and I'll just play

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.980
this back for you guys.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.260
You just can't go wrong with kids,
can you?

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.440
Yeah,
it's a total sucker punch for a demo.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.410
It really is.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:09.320
You just gotta do it.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:09.900
Alright.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.580
So what we want to do is,
Joseph started doing this earlier,

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.520
but we're going to actually finish it.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:17.580
We're going to export this,
move it to 3G.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.300
Now, hopefully all the settings are set
so I don't have to go through it,

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:23.710
but what you can see is we support,
of course, 3GPP for the GSM guys,

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:28.340
3GPP2 for the CDMA 2000 guys,
like Verizon.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.890
And, of course, when I did that,
it reset everything, didn't it?

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:35.020
So I'll go up to 82 and audio.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.520
We want, Alisa, what data rate?

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.710
Okay.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.740
We want to use the other
speech codec at this data rate.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.090
Does that work?

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.830
Okay.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.120
Good.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:48.690
So let's just say okay,
and we'll save it as

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.800
gobyslide.3g2 on the desktop.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.750
And that was what,
about seven seconds long,

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:56.150
so we're exporting it right now.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:58.750
and there it is,
and there it is on the desktop.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.190
So now though,
let's send this to his phone.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:05.920
So people in their homes can very easily,
using these incredibly simple tools,

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.800
they're powerful at the same time,
create content and send it out.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:12.540
So we're finished with this,
and now what I'm going to do is

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:17.670
launch our email client again,
and this time, create a message and send

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:24.420
it to Doug called Fun--oops,
Joseph's right, Fun in the Park.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:39.500
[Transcript missing]

01:02:39.800 --> 01:03:39.600
[Transcript missing]

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:47.200
I haven't had a manicure lately.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.890
And just go ahead and press pause.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.460
So from digital video to
mobile in three steps.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.640
We're very proud of this and
we're looking forward to this

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.970
extended out to your world,
your pre-existing content that you have.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.150
I think you can see now this
is excellent for a home user,

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:15.690
but there's a world not too far from
now where you'll be taking your news,

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:19.960
sports, weather, travel, corporate,
marketing content, whatever you have,

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.670
and bringing it down with
the power of QuickTime to

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.590
VZW video messaging customers.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.480
So we're excited to be here and we look
forward to a great future with you.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.820
your help.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.530
Thanks everybody.

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:29.930
Thanks Doug.

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:30.940
Thanks Frank.

01:04:34.700 --> 01:07:55.900
[Transcript missing]

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.490
So, with that said, what's up?

01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.310
What's next?

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:00.910
What are we going to try to do?

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.250
Well,
you saw it yesterday in Steve's keynote,

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:08.660
if you were there,
you saw me demonstrate H.264 AVC.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.030
It's a remarkable video codec.

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:13.280
It's one of those things where
you don't get to see a video

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.550
codec like this very often.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.920
You don't get an opportunity to
introduce a technology like this,

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.210
you know,
but maybe every number of years.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.850
The benefits: incredible quality.

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.220
I mean,
this codec has generated quality that

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:30.640
we thought was really kept in the upper
echelons of HD and other really big,

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.500
big formats.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:35.830
Not a codec that's scalable
and available to use across an

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:38.440
entire spectrum of bit rates.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.580
The efficiency of this,
I demonstrated yesterday,

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.600
I'll show you guys again today,
is incredible.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.070
You hold a data rate stable,
you hold a data rate constant,

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:49.700
and the frame size and resolution
goes up by like a factor of four.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.590
From, say, today's standard MPEG-4 codec,
which is absolutely incredible.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.240
That's like free.

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.600
That's free resolution.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.600
You just re-encode and you're off
with a much higher resolution image.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.030
And a bunch of other capabilities
that I want to just power through

01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:03.990
because we're running out of time.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.740
But I wanted to talk about this.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.300
Get this question a lot,
as you might guess,

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.750
as we're talking to press and analysts.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.720
What's up with Windows Media 9?

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:14.150
Where is it vis-a-vis H.264?

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.400
What about VC9?

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:19.000
How does that relate to
Windows Media 9 and therefore H.264?

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.700
Well, lots been going on in
the world of standards.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.100
Certainly the HD-DVD forum has made
some decisions about the codecs

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.800
that they're going to support.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.970
MPEG-2, H.264, and VC9 have been ratified
into the HD-DVD spec,

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:33.800
which is kind of interesting.

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.600
So certainly H.264 and people using
QuickTime tools will be able to author

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.400
content for that next generation set.

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.600
The DVD audio guys have selected AAC,
H.E.AAC,

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:49.000
as the audio format of choice for the
next generation second session DVD audio.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.540
playback format.

01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:52.610
But Windows Media 9.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.340
I think it's an incredible technology,
I'll be honest with you.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.460
I think it's absolutely remarkable,
but it has two issues.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.500
It's closed, and it's proprietary.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.420
Therefore,
limiting its distribution and use

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:07.070
in some of the professional mediums,
for example, broadcast cable, you know,

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:08.640
the telcos and celcos.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.420
When we first visited Docomo,
they were actually using Windows Media,

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.980
and they switched over to MPEG-4.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.340
They felt that was a better and safer
choice for them because it's a standard,

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.950
where Windows Media 9 was not.

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:19.950
And if you wanted to
license Windows Media,

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.350
you could get a technology license,
no problem.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.490
But patent licenses, big problem.

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:25.960
You couldn't get that from them.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.230
So that was limiting
some of their adoption.

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:31.640
So they made a very interesting
and I think a really smart choice.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.590
They went to the
SMPTE standards committee,

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:37.800
very big and powerful
standards organization,

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.250
and proposed Windows Media 9
as an open standard called VC9.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:46.270
So Windows Media 9
pretty much equals VC9.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.150
VC9 is now a SMPTE standard.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.550
But then an interesting thing happened.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.960
Certainly,
they've been marketing VC9 very

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.380
aggressively as an open standard,
and they could all go talk to the people

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.250
that normally wouldn't talk to them.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.180
But what hasn't happened with
VC9 yet is the patent stuff,

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.920
the stuff that we're very
used to in the MPEG-4 side.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.840
So you know,
there's this group of lawyers, MPEG-LA,

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.290
stands for Licensing Authority,
not Los Angeles.

01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:18.080
We have other acronyms back in campus.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.260
But insert your own LA acronym.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:25.180
And these guys are the storefront,
if you will, for MPEG-4.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.300
These are the folks that work with all
of the patent holders in the patent

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:32.060
pool and allow you to walk up and talk
to just one person and get a patent

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.290
license that covers you completely.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.890
So enter VC9, you know, an open standard.

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:42.700
Is it possible that Microsoft owns
every single bit of intellectual

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.350
property that's in Windows Media?

01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:48.370
Is it possible they've invented every
technique and every technology and every

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:53.100
algorithm and every approach to encoding
and decoding that's in Windows Media 9?

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:53.840
We don't know.

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:57.080
Well, we're going to get a look
because MPEG-LA has done

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.340
a call for patents on VC9,
which means France Telecom.

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.480
They've been around for a while.

01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:02.990
Sony, they've got a lot of IP.

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:05.640
All these guys get to go over
and kind of like sit around a

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.190
round table and pare down and say,
"I recognize that." You know,

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:10.640
I've seen that before.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.670
And what's going to happen is VC9
is going to have a patent pool.

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.470
MPEG-LA is going to manage it.

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:18.660
So while Windows Media 9
licensing is really attractive,

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.860
you can get it at a really,
really good price

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.500
without patent coverage.

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:25.490
VC9 will have costs associated with it.

01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:29.810
We don't know how much the patent pool
hasn't even really started forming yet.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.990
H.264 is off and running.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.160
It's already been deployed
in a number of places.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.700
The Japanese broadcast community
have already selected H.264 as their

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.910
technology they're going to use.

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:41.100
We've been ratified into a
bunch of different places.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.670
I'm really eager to see what's
going to happen with VC9.

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.480
I mean, the jury's still out.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.160
We'll see,
but it's important to understand

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.850
that Windows Media 9 and VC9 are
these very similar today codecs.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.740
How that's going to evolve with
Windows Media 10 just being

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.640
introduced and what direction
that's going to go versus VC9.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.440
And the patent questions around
VC9 will be just interesting

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:03.430
things to think about.

01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:05.740
So just keep your ears
open when that happens.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.100
In the last couple of minutes,
what I'd like to do is just show

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.440
you guys what we've been doing,
though, for a while with this

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:14.580
H.264 AVC technology.

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:18.180
If you're wondering about
the name in a nutshell,

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.140
the ITU,
International Telecommunication Union,

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.880
these are the folks that
have been famous for H.261,

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.900
H.263, and now H.264.

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.750
They've done a bunch of
incredible codec work.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.840
And the folks in
ISO MPEG that did MPEG-1,

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:35.230
MPEG-2, MPEG-4, they brought together the
best and brightest of their

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:38.940
respective organizations and
created a joint video team,

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:39.760
or JVT.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.010
This codec, as it's evolved,
has had a number of names, H.26L, JVT,

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.960
AVC, H.264.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.610
We think, like today's MPEG codec,
which is called MPEG-4 Part 2,

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:54.960
this codec may end up as MPEG-4 Part 10.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.850
I don't know what
happened to 3 through 9.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:59.000
Probably the same thing
that happened to MPEG-3.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:13:59.400
I don't know.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.090
It's just missing.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.220
But, you know, the name of that will
likely come out as Part 10.

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:10.660
So let me show a couple of
examples of what this codec can do.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.980
And you saw me do something like
this in yesterday's keynote.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:18.460
This codec in the bottom here,
and what data rate are these, Amy?

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.140
One.

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:23.340
Okay, this is a one megabit encoded file.

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.880
Both of these are one megabit.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.300
Same piece of content, same data rate,
one megabit.

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.420
The bottom right window is
today's MPEG-4 Part 2 codec.

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:35.430
The upper left is H.264,
same piece of content.

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:37.200
So I'm going to play them
both at the same time,

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.060
and you're going to see
what they look like.

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:45.050
♪ ♪

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:05.700
[Transcript missing]

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:06.940
Sugar?

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.900
Ah.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.460
Oh, you thought I was calling you sugar.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.780
Hey, you're not that rich.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:17.740
So, it's a great trailer and a really
good comparison of what the two

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:21.920
codecs do and what you get from
an efficiency standpoint with 264.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.950
So let me go back one,
and we talked about scalability

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.430
from 3G to HD and beyond.

01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:29.670
So I've got like four seconds left.

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.720
This is my last demo.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.850
I'll be out of here in no time
to the folks in the house.

01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:36.050
Let me play one trailer for you.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.730
We got this trailer just last night.

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:39.820
Actually,
you guys might be the first crowd

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.860
it's been shown to outside of a movie
theater where it's been displayed.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.000
This is the new movie,
Phantom of the Opera.

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:48.720
And so let me just play this,
and we'll be off.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.880
This is encoded at about, what, what?

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.900
Five megabits.

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:58.000
The longest lead-in I've ever seen.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.620
and David Koehn,
and the team of Mark and Dion.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.590
We have a codec team in engineering
that's just absolutely outstanding,

01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:31.500
and they're doing an incredible
job taking the recipe of what's

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.430
specified as 264 and implementing it.

01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:35.400
It will ship in the next
version of QuickTime,

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.580
and I'll tell you, we just can't wait.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:41.140
So, I want to thank you very much
for coming to our session.

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:45.560
There is a 264 session
at 2 o'clock today.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.510
This was one of the kind of secret
sessions that we couldn't talk about,

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:50.330
so if you want to learn
more about this codec,

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.540
at 2 o'clock today we have a
session dedicated to H.264.

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.560
Thanks for attending.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.480
We'll be around all week.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.160
Take care, guys.
