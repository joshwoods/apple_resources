WEBVTT

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.760
My name is Aliza Hutchison.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.820
I'm with QuickTime Product Marketing.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.870
It's my great pleasure today
to have two speakers for you.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.500
We have Gudrun Enger, the Director of
Communications for ACM SIGGRAPH,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.590
and we also have Dave Bergivin,
Director of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.500
Technical Operations for SOMA Media.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.970
So I would like to ask if we could hold
all of our questions until the end and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.730
we'll do a short question and answer.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.890
And with that,
I invite Gudrun up on to the stage.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.840
Thanks for joining us this morning.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.500
Again, my name is Gudrun Enger.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.780
I'm the ACM SIGGRAPH Director for
Communications.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.940
That is my volunteer
position at ACM SIGGRAPH.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.860
For my day job,
I work at Stanford University.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.820
And I'm here today to tell you
just a little bit about my role.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.900
I just want to tell you a little
bit about our organization.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.110
I want to tell you why we chose
Soma Media to do our product

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.300
and what our plans are for 2004.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.830
And then I'm going to turn it over to
Dave and he's going to give you the

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.300
technical background of the product
because that's of course why you're here.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.960
ACMC Graph,
for those of you who don't know,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.300
is a professional computer society.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.720
It stands for the Association of
Computer Machinery Special Interest

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.300
Group Computer Graphics
Interactive Techniques.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.110
We are a volunteer run organization
with about 6,500 members.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.270
The majority of our members
are extremely technical.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.290
They are researchers.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.120
They come from industry and education.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.880
One of our events every year is
our annual conference which is

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.300
typically held the end of July,
beginning of August.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.300
We have anywhere from 20,000 to
50,000 attendees at this conference.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.300
The other events and activities that we
do as part of our association include:

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.300
chapters, educators program,
symposia and other co-located events.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.910
The annual conference is our
biggest program but it is not

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.140
our only program but it is where
we have the most visibility.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.230
This year's conference will be in
Los Angeles the second week of August.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.970
We have technical programs
which include papers,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.300
panels, courses, sketches which are short
innovative new research.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300
We have special sessions.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.250
We also have a keynote
and awards ceremony.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.300
In addition to the technical part of
the conference we also have an art show,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.080
an educators program,
the electronic theater and computer

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.300
animation festival which the clip
we just showed you from that.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.810
And of course a large exhibit hall.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.540
So one of our main goals,
we try to do a membership survey every

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.670
couple of years and one of the things
that was continually coming out in the

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.760
membership survey was that our members
wanted to see more content from the

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.120
conference and have it accessible online.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.710
And so we, over the past three years,
2001, 2002, 2003,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.150
we've been doing pilot experiments to
see the best way to capture that content,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.690
the best way to deliver it,
how to put it online,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.500
how to keep it safe,
all these kind of things.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.100
Last year we teamed up with
Soma Media to capture a small

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.160
portion of our conference,
basically all the technical

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.760
content that was in two of the
largest rooms at the conference.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.690
That included most of the papers,
a couple courses, some sketches,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.790
and a couple special sessions.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.920
This product proved to be very
successful with our membership.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.280
We had originally anticipated
that we would just offer

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.350
it online and we decided,
Soma was pushing really hard to get us to

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.100
do a DVD product of it and the executive
committee of ACMC Graph was not so sure,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.920
but in the end we decided to do the
DVD in addition to the online version.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.400
online streaming application and the
DVD sold really well at the conference,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.550
it sold really well after the conference.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.650
We've probably had more interest
generated about the DVD than

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.000
the online streaming version.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.600
So we're really pleased
with how that's worked.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.510
In the future though we do hope to,
you know, we plan to continually offer

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.610
both because ACM has a component
called the digital library,

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.190
and all of our content from the
conference goes into the digital library,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.900
so the OSA from SOMA will
go in there as well.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.240
It's just another member benefit
that we're pleased to offer.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.200
The reason we chose SOMA is the solution
that they offer is really cross platform.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.290
It's not browser dependent,
which a lot of the other

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.850
solutions out there are.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.130
It works well on Macs and PCs.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.120
We have a large Mac population,
highly technical users.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.680
A lot of the creative folks
use it as well as a lot of the

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.420
researchers and technicians.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.420
So, we're really excited to be able
to offer this to our customers.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.340
It's a flexible system by
offering the DVD and the OSA.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.700
We were able to allow people to take
it on the road with them as well

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.540
as sit and use it in their office.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.400
And overall we're just really
pleased with how it turned out.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.440
Our plans for 2004 are to
expand the content capture.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.730
We plan to capture all of the
technical content at the conference.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.800
So that's all the papers, courses,
panels, sketches, special sessions.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.000
And it's in ten rooms.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.660
It's approximately 300 contributors
with a lot of technical content.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.120
So, we're really excited to be able
to offer that to our customers.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.180
And we're really excited to be able
to offer that to our customers.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.190
So, we're really excited to be able
to offer that to our customers.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:15.280
And we're really excited to be able
to offer that to our customers.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.640
And we're really excited to be
able to offer with 250-300 hours of

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.320
video and PowerPoint presentations.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.940
The other thing that we're doing this
year is we're only going to capture

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.330
video in the two largest rooms.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.750
For the other smaller rooms we're
going to do just a head shot

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.300
with the slides and the audio.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.210
So I now want to turn it over to
Dave Bergevin who will explain

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.170
exactly how it was accomplished.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.540
Thanks.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.300
Thank you very much, Gudrun, Aliza.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.130
For the past several years,
Apple Computer has recorded the

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.180
proceedings of its worldwide developers
conference on DVD-ROM and the web.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.360
When did it be great if every
single conference we attended

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.260
would also be recorded?

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.550
If that were the case,
we would not miss a keynote speaker.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.320
We would not miss a single session.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.690
We'll be able to see the session we wish
and see it any number of times we want.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.730
We would be able to instantaneously
jump to the presentation we want to see,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.730
to that particular
slide we want to study,

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.320
and we'd be able to review the
material sufficiently to absorb

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.690
the knowledge being disseminated.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.730
We would move our exposure to the
material from the level of awareness

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.720
to the level of comprehension.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.530
This ability would allow us to
jumpstart our research in our

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.990
respective areas of interest.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.720
This newfound ability would also
allow our colleagues who may not be

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.060
able to attend the conference the
opportunity to share in the knowledge

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.330
being disseminated at the conference.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.130
SOMA Media specializes in creating
knowledge dissemination solutions

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.710
to help organizations distribute
their content beyond the walls

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.600
of the conference center.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:17.170
In 2003, ACM SIGGRAPH hired SOMA Media to
record a portion of their

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.710
conference on TVD-ROM and the web.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.610
This year we're recording the whole
SIGGRAPH 2004 conference and also

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.600
putting it on DVD-ROM and the web.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.080
Today I'm excited to be here to
present the process of creating

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.750
the 2003 DVD-ROM and our
online streaming application,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.580
or as we refer to it as the OSA.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.960
Okay,
so here's the agenda for this morning.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.760
I'll briefly talk about Soma Media,
our company,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.090
the benefits to conference recording,
what you'll learn in this session,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.620
and then we'll go in-depth
on the case study for the

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.960
ACM SIGGRAPH DVD-ROM and OSA.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.240
Then I'll talk about the
technology framework,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.560
the technologies we used,
and the workflow,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.930
the improvements that we're
going to introduce in 2004,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.570
and then I'll conclude and we'll
have time for some questions.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.570
So SOMA Media specializes in
knowledge dissemination solutions.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:19.220
We work with the organization to come
up with a custom solution for them.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:26.500
We provide complete end-to-end solutions
starting with the logistics from

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.180
pre-production all the way to delivery.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.300
We handle the speaker permission forms.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.080
We capture the content.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.300
We compress it for DVD,
DVD-ROM or the web.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.940
We author the content.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.160
We create the interface,
do all the design and the packaging.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.600
And we do the sales and marketing,
including all the print materials and

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.990
having a sales booth at the conference,
including a sales team.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.040
So here are some of the benefits.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.490
Obviously, recording the conference is a
great way to create an organized

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.830
archive of that conference.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.120
Currently, right now, there are, I think,
eight other presentations going on.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.440
So because this conference
is being recorded,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.300
you know you'll have access
to the other presentations.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.380
As well,
when it's available online or on DVD-ROM,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.500
people that couldn't attend a
conference can still participate

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.500
and actually see the content that
was presented at the conference.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.270
A huge benefit also is being able
to watch it on your own time.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.500
This is great.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.680
I mean,
you pop it into your computer or you

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.330
go online on the Internet and you
choose to watch the presentations

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.490
when you want to watch them.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.490
And finally,
recording a conference can be

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.600
a revenue-generating source
for conference organizers.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.060
It can help to offset the
expenses related to actually

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.070
recording the conference.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.820
So what you'll learn in this session
is our knowledge dissemination

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.050
solution that we came up with
for SIGGRAPH working with them.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.970
I'll talk about capturing
content efficiently.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.370
How to avoid the bottlenecks and
developing a workflow with your

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:13.310
software and the technology that you're
going to use to develop the project.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.150
So here we're going to go in
depth right now onto the case

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.550
study for the ACM SIGGRAPH 2003
conference presentations.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.440
So at SIGGRAPH 2003,
there were some physical constraints.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.060
We weren't recording
the whole conference.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.060
We were recording only
two presentation rooms,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.460
the main two presentation rooms which
included most of all the paper sessions,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.250
some of the courses.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:41.370
It was five days of recording
and this resulted in about 800

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.830
gigabytes of video that was digitized
on the fly at the conference.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.590
We also captured over 40 gigabytes
of PowerPoint presentations

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.470
and extra videos,
including 101 total

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.390
PowerPoint presentations
and 140 extra videos.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.010
So what we delivered was over
62 hours of video on two DVDs,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.200
115 presentations.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:13.450
This included over 4,000
synchronized slides and 140 of

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.030
those videos were synchronized with
their PowerPoint presentations.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.030
So we had a two-disc DVD-ROM set.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.040
The first disc was the paper's disc.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.030
It was on a 9-gig DVD-ROM.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.450
The second disc included the keynote,
the courses, the special sessions,

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.760
and the sketches, and that was actually
on a 4.7-gig DVD-ROM.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.340
And then finally we created the
online streaming application.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.520
So we captured 78 out of
the 81 paper presentations.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.900
I believe the three presentations
we didn't capture were due

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.340
to copyright problems that we
weren't allowed to record them.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:54.680
We captured the keynote,
the four courses that were presented

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.170
in the two rooms we recorded,
four of the special sessions,

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.330
and one sketch.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:07.100
So these were the technical
requirements for producing this product.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.780
We had to come up with a cost-effective
solution with a low sale price.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:17.170
The price of the DVD was $79 for
non-members and $59 for members,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.640
so we had to keep the cost low.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.640
It had to be cross-platform,
so it had to work seamlessly on

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.780
a Mac and a Windows platform.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.050
It had to work also on
the Internet and DVD-ROM.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.500
Another important criteria is
the slides had to be legible,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.580
so the presentation screen,
which I'll show you in a few minutes,

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.330
had to be big enough so that
you can read all of the text

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.370
displayed in the PowerPoints.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.180
We also included chapter lists.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.420
I'll go through what the chapter list is.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.510
It basically divides the presentation,
allows you to navigate the

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.420
presentation by the slide titles,
so each presentation is divided

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.240
into their slide titles,
and you can jump to any part

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.100
of the presentation seamlessly.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.260
We had to include as many
extra videos and demos.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.800
SIGGRAPH shows a lot of demos,
similar to here at this conference

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.800
where they show a lot of different
types of demos of new technologies.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.800
And everything had to be synchronized.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.060
The final requirement, we actually,
there was already AV crews in

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.140
the two rooms and we had to
work with their technology and

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.800
find a way to link that to ours,
our setup.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.670
Now we also handled the
sales and marketing.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.700
So we included all the
marketing materials.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:42.180
This included flyers that were
in all of the conference bags,

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.760
posters.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.220
We had two booths at that
conference and a sales team.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.120
We worked with ACM SIGGRAPH to
come up with an online ordering

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.890
system and we have a website with an
online working demo of the product.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.520
Now we also had to deal with
the speaker related issues,

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.060
which meant collecting all
the speaker permission forms.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.940
Since it had not been recorded,
speakers had to be contacted

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.610
and we had to collect all of
their speaker permission forms,

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.270
collect also their slides,
all their extra videos and demos.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.760
So we set up an FTP site for
them to upload their information.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.160
We also had to include,
we had to remove the

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.560
copyrighted images and sounds.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.250
A lot of presentations at
SIGGRAPH refer to films,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.100
movies and a lot of times you
don't have permission to actually,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.720
you can show it at the conference,
but you can't actually show

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.150
it or record it for the DVD.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
Okay, so let's move to the demo.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:59.050
Actually, can we have the other demo,
the one on the G5?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.040
Okay,
so this is the paper's desk and I'll

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.000
go through the interface a little bit.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.070
We had to develop--every year SIGGRAPH,
I guess, they come up with a design for

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:17.000
the conference with graphics and
logos and certain fonts and styles.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.520
So we created an interface that
worked with their design requirements.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.960
We also wanted to create an
interface that was easy on your eyes,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.990
because if you're going to
watch a presentation that's 25,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.840
30 minutes long,
you don't really want something.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.040
You want something that's
very easy to look at.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:41.000
We developed the interface like a player,
so you can easily move through.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.910
You can easily select any
presentation by their event.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.140
Here it's the paper's disc.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.330
And each paper topic,
we divided it by day, so you have Monday,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.570
July 28th, and if you scroll down,
you go all the way to Thursday.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.590
And these are each of the session titles.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.590
So if you click on a session title,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.670
There are four presentations that
were presented during that session.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:13.400
You'll see the speaker pick
and their title of their talk.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.730
We'll click on Vivek.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.720
So your video plays here and your
PowerPoint presentations are here.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.040
So it's fairly large screen size.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.510
And just to begin, you simply press play.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.870
Here are a few examples of what we are
able to achieve using our technique.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.770
Here is an image of two water
lilies that we found on the web.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.390
So you see it's all
completely synchronized.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:48.000
It'll keep switching the slides
throughout the presentation.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.500
This presentation also includes
some of the demos and animations.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.270
This one is showing an animation,
so we integrated it and synchronized

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.770
it inside the presentation.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.380
Now as I mentioned before,
this is the chapter list.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.100
So you click on it and you'll notice,
if you notice in the scrubber,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.010
you're actually moving through the
presentation all by their slide titles.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:22.010
So here's a thing on the patch placement.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.500
And here's another video that
was included in the presentation.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.500
This is the original draft sequence
from the video text newspaper.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.500
Note is the intermittent.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.500
Okay, we'll select another topic.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.800
Now, as I mentioned before,
we had copyright issues

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.980
that we had to deal with.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.180
This individual, Alice Sheffer,
she actually had a picture of

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.570
Madonna that was taken from a magazine.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.020
So what we did was, it's right over here,
we blocked it out.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.070
We had to do that on a number
of presentations where there was

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.670
images that had copyright issues.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.950
I'll show you another.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.110
So I've selected shadows,
the paper topic,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.940
and the title of this talk was
A Geometry-based Soft Shadows.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.080
You'll see the slides are also-- this
one's all-- everything's in sync.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.440
This one also included an animation.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.180
So wherever speakers provided
us animations and demos,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.070
we included them.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:09.800
[Transcript missing]

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.840
This one actually the individual
included a QuickTime VR.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.920
He sent it to us.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.660
He probably didn't think we would
actually include it in the presentation,

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.220
but we actually did.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:33.670
Here's his full QuickTime VR,
and you can actually move around

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.490
the space that he had given us.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:44.120
I'll show you a final...

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.690
So any video that we
were able to include,

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.440
we were able, we put it in,
we compressed it,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.900
and we synced it with their
PowerPoint presentations.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.380
Can we switch to the other demo machine?

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.700
So I'll show you the keynote
because I'm going to talk a

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.130
little bit about it later.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:42.630
At this moment it's my very great
pleasure to welcome Anthony Lazenby,

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.630
our SIGGRAPH 2003

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.960
So he also included animations.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.420
And he had many animations
throughout his presentation.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.820
You'll see the size of
the video is 320 by 240.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:01.830
The size of the PowerPoint is 548 by 411,
so it's a fairly large size.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.100
When I show you the OSA a little later,
the video will be smaller,

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.980
but the PowerPoints will
still be quite large.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.780
Starship in the 3D hyperbolic space.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.620
Now, this new technique we
call conformal geometry.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:24.810
Now this presentation, the courses,
just to show you that,

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.900
Some of them included a lot of code.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.490
Well, we wanted to make sure that
people could read the code,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.290
so the video had to be,
the video presentation screen had to be

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:38.470
large enough so that people could clearly
see what the speaker was talking about.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:50.700
[Transcript missing]

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.880
This was a special session that
included a demonstration of a

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.610
robot that Sony was developing.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:15.000
[Transcript missing]

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:24.000
[Transcript missing]

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.600
and the song that he used was
copyrighted and so Masahiro contacted

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.780
us and said well we could show
the video but we can't show the song

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.500
so we actually went through the video
and muted out the dance sequence.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.340
So all through this,
the audio is muted out but

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.700
you get to still see what
was shown at the conference.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.570
Robobot was actually interpreting a song,
so it was coming up with the dance moves

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.910
as--it wasn't a pre-programmed thing,
it was actually coming up with the dance

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.510
moves according to the song's beat.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:25.500
[Transcript missing]

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.100
This was done as a promo for
the NHL and the LA Kings.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.100
So before we get to the slides.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.840
Okay,
let's go back to the slides and let's

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.530
see how we put this all together.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.500
Okay, so these were the challenges.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.570
The first one is how to digitize live
analog feeds to hard drives and tapes.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.730
Then how to compress 800 gigabytes
to less than 17 gigabytes,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.070
because we figured at the time that we
were going to put it on two 9-gig DVDs,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.980
we actually got it down to 11,
so that's why we had one

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.370
9-gig and one 4.7-gig DVD.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.300
Next really large challenge was
synchronizing 4,000 slides with

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:28.220
their videos and then synchronizing
the 140 videos with their slides.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.100
Now,
the conference was at the end of July.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.310
We did about a month,
six weeks of work pre-production

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.820
before the conference,
getting speaker permissions

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.160
and doing basically most of the
authoring and collecting the slides.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.280
We had a deadline in October.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.910
We actually finished work
on the product October 8th.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.960
We had sent it to the DVD manufacturer.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.410
Unfortunately,
the DVD manufacturer took a

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.320
lot longer and we ended up
delivering it in November,

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.360
not in October.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.190
So here's the technology framework.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.500
Everything begins and ends
basically with authoring.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:10.350
We started building the whole iShell,
the whole project in developing

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.600
the skeleton structure within
the authoring environment.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.050
We collected the slides.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.250
So we collected as many
slides as we could beforehand,

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.400
the animations and videos.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.740
We started doing the compression,
but we basically waited because

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.980
we know that speakers are
going to change their slides,

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.690
which often happens right
before the conference.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:32.320
So we did most of the--we did all
the compression afterwards and

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.740
then we created a chapter list for
the presentation--for the slides.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:43.200
At the conference, we captured the video,
then we compressed the video,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.650
and then we also created,
we created chapter lists so

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.210
that we could synchronize them.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.980
So everything was done in
the authoring environment to

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.960
synchronize the chapter lists.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.360
and then we delivered it to both
DVD-ROM and on the web with our

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.080
online streaming application.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.190
So let's begin with authoring.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.000
Well, the authoring environment
had to be cross-platform.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.990
It also had to be robust.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.800
It couldn't, you know,
we didn't want it to crash.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.880
We wanted to work on a
large number of machines.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.210
We wanted to be able also to
create a really intuitive interface

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.000
that was really easy to use.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.510
As I showed you,
three clicks basically gets you

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:25.970
anywhere in the player and you can
watch any presentation very quickly.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.820
We also wanted an authoring tool that
we could build before the conference

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.720
and have it all ready so that all we
had to do was compress the videos,

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.840
synchronize them and put them
into the authoring environment.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.630
And then very importantly,
having a file naming system,

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.190
something that you do in
the pre-production so it

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.400
makes your life really,
really easy.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.500
So the authoring platform we
chose is TribeWorks iShell.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.010
Their head office is not far from here.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.250
and mainly we chose it
because it's cross-platform,

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.280
work Mac, Windows seamlessly.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.050
We can deliver on DVD-ROM on the
web with very minimal changes.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.210
The only changes we had
were the videos themselves.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:09.410
One is going to a QuickTime streaming
server with the web version and the

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.850
other one is reading them off the DVD.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:16.860
As well, TribeWorks iShell is really an
easy-to-use object-oriented environment,

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.400
so that translated to really
fast development times.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.210
The whole interface was
developed in about two weeks.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.600
The author environment also allowed
us to do the synchronization because

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:31.840
it includes advanced controls of
QuickTime with the chapter tracks.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.580
So we did all the synchronizations
between the presentations

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.020
using chapter tracks.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.130
So how did we capture all
of these chapter lists?

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.590
Well, we did a lot of it at
the conference itself.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.940
We captured the slide timings
right at the conference,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:54.250
put it in an Excel spreadsheet that had
a macro that outputted formatted text

00:30:54.470 --> 00:31:00.900
file ready for embedding into QuickTime.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.380
We also had to then, with a chapter list,
check the timing,

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:11.110
verify that it all was working properly,
that the spelling of the

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:15.060
slide titles was correct,
and that we could add these chapter

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.740
lists at the end to QuickTime.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.550
Because we had to do all of that before
we could start synchronizing them,

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.860
because we had chapter
lists in both of them,

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.040
in both the PowerPoint and the video.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.120
So this is how we captured the
content actually at the conference.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.700
We got the AV source footage from
the AV crew at the conference.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.620
We used the Canopus ADVC 500.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.630
This is an analog-to-digital
video converter.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.700
It actually goes both ways,
digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:53.480
It has two outputs, one firewire,
two firewire outputs that we could use.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.700
One went to a DV cam deck.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.690
That was actually our backup,
which we never had to use.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.980
And the other went to a fire store,
which converted the video

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:07.700
information and stored it on our,
let's see, 500 gig hard drive.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.700
So this is where we actually
had two hard drives at the

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.700
conferences in the two rooms.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.700
And we were easily able to capture all
the presentations in those two rooms.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.700
As well as the video.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.360
So we had a terabyte
of storage and we only,

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.700
we didn't fill it all up.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:30.800
So after you have the content,
you ought to prepare it for compression.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.440
We had all these, many of them were four
presentations per session.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.550
Well, we recorded the whole session,
so we had to think of, well,

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.850
what video editing
software we wanted to use.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.910
We wanted something really easy to use
that all we wanted to do was the editing,

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.760
the in and the out points.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.980
We also wanted to be able to remove
the copyrighted materials quite easily.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.210
And we wanted to use the functionality
of QuickTime reference movies.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.570
So what we used was QuickTime Pro.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.260
Mainly, well, it's cross-platform.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.640
It supported the different media types,
video, audio, text for the chapter lists.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.320
QuickTime VR, which was great.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.530
Flash, which we didn't have to use,
but there's so many things that

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.330
you could do with QuickTime.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:19.410
And having the editing capabilities
right in the program is fantastic.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:24.380
So all we had to do was set the in and
out points and create a reference movie.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.840
Scriptability is really a key.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.980
We didn't take advantage of it as
much as we will be taking advantage

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.530
of doing scripts in QuickTime.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.840
Of course, adding the chapter tracks.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.790
We were able to remove all the
audio and copyrighted images and

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:44.960
sounds all within the QuickTime Pro.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:50.350
And we use QuickTime mainly because
we've used Sorensen Video 3 in the

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.120
past and we're getting into using
MPEG-4 and they work flawlessly for us.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.350
So, QuickTime was our solution.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.860
Well now we have to
move on to compressing.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.170
We've got them all prepared,
the content all prepared,

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.290
but we have to compress the content.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.300
So we have to determine what
kind of compression software.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.710
We've used different ones in the past.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.390
But we wanted one that was
fairly simple to use again,

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.960
that worked,
that we could come up with a workflow.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.110
So once we edit all the videos,
we can get it into and

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.890
start compressing them.

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:25.660
So we wanted to be able to control the
settings for compression and do small

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.600
adjustments to the audio and the video.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.790
So the compression software we used,
was Sorenson Squeeze 3.1.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:38.230
Why it was really simple to use,
basic image adjustments.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.970
All we wanted to really do was crop,
de-enderlace,

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.670
and adjust the gamma so that it would
look equally good on a PC and a Mac.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:51.780
As we were editing the videos and saving
them as quick time reference movies,

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.780
we were dumping them
into our watch folder.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.390
So once we had our compression settings,
it was just turning out,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.380
our computers were compressing.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:10.590
So we wanted to really use,
was Sorenson Video 3 for the

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.560
DVD-ROM and MPEG-4 for the
online streaming application.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.630
And one final note,
we didn't actually have, it didn't crash.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.760
The only time we had a problem was when
the power went out on the East Coast.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.900
We were out for four days,
and that was right in the

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.110
middle of our encoding,
but that was the only problem that we

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.420
actually had with Sorenson Squeeze.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.540
So it was really robust.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.270
for our purposes.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.340
So a little bit about
Sorenson Video 3 Pro.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:40.120
We'd used it before
in a previous project.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.500
We knew it fairly well.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.930
Worked great on the DVD-ROM,
gave us really high-quality video,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.680
as you can tell at the conference.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.580
Very small file sizes,
and we can optimize the

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.890
compression settings.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.080
Now, the fast compression times,
we were able to achieve

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.540
really good compression times.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.170
The example here is the keynote,
which was 48 minutes in length.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.530
We compressed it in 90 minutes on
a dual 1 GHz G4 with 1 Giga RAM,

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:14.140
and that was at a
resolution of 320 by 240.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.190
Now with MPEG-4,
for the online streaming application,

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.800
we used it because it works great
with the QuickTime streaming server.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.360
Really high quality and low bandwidth.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.380
I will show you that later.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.430
Really excellent audio codec.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.330
Also, really fast compression times,
our keynote, which was 48 minutes,

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.110
compressed in 60 minutes
on a dual 1 GHz G4.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.000
Now,
the frame size is a little bit smaller.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.520
I'm not trying to compare
the two codecs here.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.890
I'm just trying to give you a point
of reference in terms of how long it

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:52.020
took us to compress all of the video.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.920
And basically at the end, the DVD-ROM,
all of the videos that we compressed

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.880
on the DVD-ROM took less than a week.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.230
So it wasn't really the
bottleneck of the project.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:07.190
Now back to the technology framework,
we went through the authoring,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.330
went through the slides, capturing them,
how we collected the chapter lists.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.250
And the key is that we synchronized
everything on the chapter list

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.940
between the slides and the video.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.420
So now we're on to the delivery.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.100
So we put it on to the
DVD-ROM and then on to the web.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.010
So here are the differences.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:30.370
The DVD-ROM has 140 demos and animations.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.940
It's on two disks.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.900
It includes a booklet.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.690
So you can actually use it as
a reference to go through the,

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.500
to look for the presentation.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.590
It's higher quality.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.640
The video quality is better.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.370
The video quality is
larger and it's smoother.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.060
And it's available for
members and non-members.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.470
On the other hand,
the online streaming application,

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.280
it's just one interface,
which I'll show you,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.540
and it's free to all ACM and
ACM SIGGRAPH members.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:10.610
Okay, so we'll go back to the demo on
the G5 and I'll load up the...

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.070
So this is the online streaming version.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.680
It checks the internet
first to see if it's there.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.670
It's actually just pinging a
server and then it'll load up.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.340
This version actually
doesn't have the login.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.100
The one on the net has a login,
so you have to be a member,

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.350
and it won't let you in
unless you're a member.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:13.120
So the nice feature about the online
streaming application is the papers,

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.800
special sessions,
they're all in one environment.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.190
So you don't have to change discs.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.200
Okay, here we go.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.140
So this is all running online
right now here from the conference.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.600
So you have the keynote, the papers,
the courses, the special sessions.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.280
It actually tells you at the bottom,
select an event.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.640
So if you click on the keynote,
now it's downloading the next section.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.440
It tells you at the bottom,
select a topic and you can

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.590
click on the keynote address.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.220
and Anthony Lazenby.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.630
And it tells you to
select a presentation.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.400
You'll notice the blue highlights
as you go through the process,

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.540
so we try to make this
as easy as possible.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.520
So let's press play to begin.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.210
So this is connecting to
the QuickTime streaming

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.400
server at ACM SIGGRAPH.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.900
You notice the video is smaller.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.360
It's 240 by 180.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.550
But the PowerPoint,
it's a bit more compressed,

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.700
but it's the same size,
so you still get to

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.400
see everything clearly.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.380
And one great feature is the
chapter track still works.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.990
So you can jump through the
presentation just like on the disc.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.930
Now the only difference is
you don't get the animations.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:09.240
We weren't going to put that much
bandwidth issues onto their server.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.220
So all that's streaming right
now is his presentation.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.740
So you do lose out on the animations,
but you get the full

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.220
PowerPoint presentation.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.910
The feature I didn't show earlier,
you can actually move through the

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.730
presentations and pause the video.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:29.240
You can move forward and backwards,
so if you want to scrutinize a

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.600
certain presentation or certain slide,
you can go and just pause it and look

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.990
at the different slides that way.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.630
So with this interface we can also
see the papers which is really,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.660
really handy.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.440
And you'll see that
it'll load up over here.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.610
Obviously it's not going to be as,
it's as fast as your internet

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.720
connection is going to be.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.090
Gives you a little watch.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:13.000
[Transcript missing]

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.730
Some presentations obviously take
a little longer to load as it is

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.900
downloading it from the Internet.

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.340
Now it's connecting it to the stream.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.940
The audio quality is really good.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.460
That's really key.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.100
You want to make sure the audio
quality is very good because

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.940
that's what you're listening to.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:54.060
And see the synchronization,
everything is all functioning very well.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.380
You can adjust the volume here.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.530
And you can again go through
the presentation quite quickly.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.900
So if you've seen the
presentation and you're interested

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.340
in a particular section,
you can go to that area and

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.830
it'll jump right to that area.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.380
It's a really handy feature.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.940
It's very competitive and very expensive,
but we can speed.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.350
Okay, let's go back to the slides.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.300
So what were the bottlenecks?

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.630
A lot of people would have
thought it was the compression,

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.780
800 gigs down to 11 gigs.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.430
How long that would take?

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.630
Well, it didn't take that long.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.160
Once we had edited all the videos,
it didn't take that long

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.160
on the two machines that we
had dedicated for encoding.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.020
What really took a long time was
developing the chapter list and creating

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.550
and then synchronizing those slides
with their videos and making sure

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.290
that the synchronization was correct.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.850
Also, synchronizing the extra
animations with the slides.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.680
There's all sorts of
issues related to that.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.130
Now, the speaker permissions forms,
that was also a bottleneck because

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:01.400
you're contacting the speakers
after they've already been accepted

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.960
to speak at the conference.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.720
They're busy and they
have to sign a form,

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.900
fax it in.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.610
They have to upload their slides.

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:14.220
You're asking them to do a lot to do
and sometimes it's hard to contact them

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:20.480
and when you're contacting 120 people,
it took a long time to get through.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.780
We still collected speaker permissions
long after the conference was

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.990
through mainly because we wanted
to include as many presentations

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:32.420
as possible on the DVD-ROM and
the online streaming application.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:35.390
Removing the copyrighted materials.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.840
That took a while because we had
to go through each presentation.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:42.000
We knew on the speaker permission
form that they had copyrighted issues,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.010
but we had to develop a way to
kind of remove those images and

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.380
sounds that we couldn't record or
couldn't keep in the presentation.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.350
And of course testing
and troubleshooting,

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.150
that took a fair bit of time
to go through to make sure it

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.290
ran on a number of platforms,
a number of different computers and make

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.180
sure everything was working correctly.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.330
And then of course the
manufacturing of the DVD-ROMs,

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:07.780
that took way too long.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.160
We were really disappointed in that.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:13.850
So how are we going to remove
the bottlenecks for 2004?

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:19.280
Well, last year's conference,
the compression wasn't a bottleneck.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.080
This year, it's going to be when you're
dealing with 290 presentations as

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.420
opposed to 115 and 250 to 300 hours.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:32.060
So what we've come up with,
we're putting together a dual G5 network.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.520
So that should significantly
reduce the compression times.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.500
For the speaker permissions forms,
we've actually come up with an online

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.550
speaker data management system.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.000
So now speakers don't
have to fax anything in.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.260
It's all, they're given,
they're sent an email with a password

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.850
and username and authorization
and basically a digital signature

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:53.700
and they can do everything online.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:58.030
They can give us keywords,
they can give us their speaker profile

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.800
or their picture and their permission.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.050
So it's a great system
that we've developed.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:09.470
Well, we're in the process of coming
up with a way of automating the

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.380
chapter list so we can significantly
reduce the amount of time it took

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.680
to create all the chapter lists.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.020
And then finally,
we picked a new DVD manufacturer

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.720
that will turn it around in 10
days as opposed to almost 6 weeks.

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:28.270
So a little bit about quality control.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:33.890
The video quality and the compression
that we achieved here was due

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:39.290
because we had the best quality
audio feeds and video feeds.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.350
If you think you're going to be
able to fix it in post-production,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.300
you're wrong.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.300
It's just going to take too long.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.250
62 hours is too much video to go through,
so you really want the best

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.190
quality audio and video.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.300
You also don't want to
do a lot of editing.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.870
You only want to do in and out points,
basically when the presentation

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:58.300
starts and when it finishes.

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:03.170
If you're going to do other editing,
that's going to be a huge bottleneck.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:07.140
And then experiment with
your compression settings.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:11.290
I can give you the compression
settings for this product,

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.390
but every time we've done
a conference or a project,

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:18.280
we always use different settings because
whatever is optimized for one conference

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.300
doesn't necessarily work for another.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.300
And the reason being is SIGGRAPH,
everybody was at a podium.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.100
Nobody was allowed to walk around.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.290
And the background, there was no shadows,
there was no issues like that.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.270
It was really well lit,
so we could use a different setting.

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:38.160
We just did another project with ATI and
we didn't have the same kind of controls.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.750
So we had to use completely
different compression settings to

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.300
still get a good quality video.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:52.440
So, to summarize,
ACM SIGGRAPH 2003 was a big success.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.390
We worked within
ACM SIGGRAPH's framework.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:48:02.280
We created workflows that did actually
produce the project by October.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.600
It was really well received by
the computer graphics community

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.640
and it did really well in sales.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.100
So, for 2004, this year,
it's going to be a five-disk

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.910
DVD-ROM as opposed to a two-disk.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:17.150
There will be an online
streaming application.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:21.390
We're moving from two rooms to ten
rooms and it's going to go up to

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.070
about 250 to 300 hours of video.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.750
So these are the improvements
for 2004 where we're recording

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.090
the whole conference.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.200
We're including all the live demos,
so we're doing the demos a

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.840
completely different way this year.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.070
We've got the online speaker
data management system.

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:44.210
Already it's working right now
because the conference is in August.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:48.640
We're adding a search engine to our
product and we're developing a new method

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.660
for creating chapter lists and this will
inevitably improve the synchronization

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.670
of the slides and the video.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.670
So to conclude,
I've gone through our knowledge

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:04.430
dissemination solution for SIGGRAPH.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.820
I've talked to you about optimizing
high-quality audio and video,

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:09.790
creating the intuitive interface.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.080
I've talked about the large
presentation window that we

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.420
used instead of a smaller one,
the chapter list that

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:21.850
we used for SIGGRAPH,
and now that we're working with 2004,

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.010
we're adding the search engine.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.890
So our approach, I'll emphasize this,
is designed to serve an audience

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:34.540
who is interested in detailed and
in-depth information retrieval.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:41.740
This means academics, researchers,
and developers.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.250
So there's some contact information
for you there on the screen if

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.640
you're interested to talk to
these guys after the conference.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.100
But I'd also like to take the
opportunity to let you ask some

00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.400
questions if you have them.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.140
Please come up to,
there's mics in the middle here

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.560
and on the side if you have
some questions for these guys.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.450
And I'll ask Gudrun to
come back up on the stage.
