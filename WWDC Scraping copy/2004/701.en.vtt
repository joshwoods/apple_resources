00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.140
Good morning and welcome to session 701,
Introduction to Digital Media.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.100
My name is Steven Tone.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm a product manager on the
QuickTime product marketing team.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.400
And we thought this would be a
great way to sort of kick off

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.600
the entire QuickTime and digital
media track by having sort of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.020
an intro course that explains,
you know, just about everything you need

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.300
to know about digital media from
deinterlacing to 3:2 pull-downs.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.320
Everything you need to do to take that
tape content you have and digitize

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.300
it and make it look really good.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.290
And so we have a special guest today.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.140
We have Hagie Van Dijk from
Discrete who knows just about

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280
everything about QuickTime.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.300
He's even an old
QuickTime guy from Apple.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
And he will be able to take you
guys through for about an hour.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.300
So, Hag.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.870
Hagie Van Dijk Great.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.300
Thank you.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.870
Hi, everybody.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.940
First thing I'd like to say
is thank you all for coming.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.900
I appreciate coming down here and talking
about one of my favorite subjects,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.180
which is digital media.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.500
And also thanks to the QuickTime team
for allowing me the opportunity to speak.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.470
So let's get right into it.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.500
If we can switch to the machine please.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
I want to talk a little bit about
what we're doing here today.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Get this started.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.250
So what I want to talk about today,
sort of digital media basics,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.480
real simple stuff is
how do we go from this,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.180
which is our camera, you know,
taking pictures of stuff, very, you know,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.500
well, what I will say,
used to be analog format, but, you know,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.390
capturing pictures and assembling them,
putting them together

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.500
in very creative ways.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.540
This is what a lot of
you are specialists at,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.500
is really in producing this media.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
So that's the next step.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.490
So let's get to the next
real level about it.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
And then ultimately, how do we get that?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500
And what do we do with it?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
And where's it going?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.870
Increasingly, more and more,
I have to play the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.020
video to catch up here,
but we're starting to see that

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.500
we need to take our media.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.440
You know, they used to say that
editing touches every frame.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.480
Well,
now encoding really touches every frame.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.500
And your media needs to be
distributed in a variety of ways.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.980
So how do we sort of sort out all
of the issues and logistics with our

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.500
media as we take it from the camera,
where we put it in the camera,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.500
to the computer?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.450
And then ultimately, how do we get that?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.200
Well, we have to collect those images,
sometimes in random, haphazard,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.410
any sort of format ways,
produce them in exciting ways using

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.070
great creative tools like this,
and ultimately get them down into formats

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.500
that we might have in our pocket anytime,
anywhere.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.480
So that's the basic premise
of my discussion today.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.500
And again, hopefully we'll have some fun.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.370
And we will take questions at
the end if people are interested.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.500
We'll have some time for that as well.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.500
So, okay,
I'd like to switch to the slides, please.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.170
Let me find my little switcher here.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:03:01.400
Capture, create, output, capture,
management, deliver, produce, deliver.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.940
How many folks have been to
a trade show and seen these

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.230
words somewhere in the last 10,
15, 18 years?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.310
Often times when we go to shows we see
words like this on big banners above

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.670
the convention center drawing us all in.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.280
What does all this mean?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.530
These are really terms that are
used to describe the media workflow.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.100
So in order,
what I'm trying to do today is give

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.550
us a language that we can use to
discuss digital media and hopefully

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.330
that some of these basics will help
bring value to you as you attend some

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.710
of the other sessions here at WWDC 04.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.690
So again, having these sort of
catch phrases capture,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.140
create, output, they're stages in the
production workflow.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.080
We use these terms to describe that.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.260
What I'm going to be doing is just
using that as a frame of reference

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.520
for our discussion today and kind of
breaking up the media production process

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.260
into those three categories capture,
creation and output.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.310
Just to kind of screw
things up a little bit,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.560
I'm going to start in the
middle with the create part.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.950
So create, how do we create media?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.430
Well, we're already on the desktop
in the center thing and the way

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.330
that we create media is using the
very powerful QuickTime format.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.720
So what is QuickTime?

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.220
There's obviously one of the
reasons why I took this talk,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.050
I'll have to admit this,
is that how often have you

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.350
been on the receiving end or
been the customer who said,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.270
you know,
what kind of content are you using?

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.610
And you either said or heard,
I have a quick time.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.600
Okay, some of you have got to
have heard that before.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.780
Well, that's sort of one of the things,
it's like I'm speaking

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.590
here in the United States.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:56.080
QuickTime is a system software.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.290
It is a core set of services
that allow applications to treat

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.600
media in a consistent fashion.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.220
QuickTime is a time base,
a universal time base for

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.600
multiple synchronous events.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.080
What that means is that
on my computer over here,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.510
I can play a movie.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.600
My computer over there,
I can play a movie.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.530
That movie has audio and video,
maybe a few other kinds of

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.720
tracks associated with it,
but they play back in sync and then

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.600
I can play them in different places.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.720
Now that's kind of a minor point
that we all take for granted,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.600
but at one time, we had a real hard time
making things synchronize up.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.440
The fact that QuickTime sort of
handles this as a master time base

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.600
is again something that we might
take for granted a little bit.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600
But the one that we really
want to talk about today,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.800
the thing that we're all focused on,
and the element that we all deal with,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.600
is the QuickTime file format.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.600
That's really, again,
what we're talking about today.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.500
So a QuickTime movie, as it's known,
is a container for your media.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.830
That's the most important
thing to remember,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.600
is that, again, QuickTime is the services
and its timing references,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.490
but it's a container for media.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.130
And what I mean by that is it's a
wrapper that lets your video frame

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.600
move through the production process.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.820
And sometimes it's transcoded,
but that's the central idea

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.600
is QuickTime is a container.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.600
It's not a codec in and of itself.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.590
It has codecs,
and we'll get to that in just a second.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.580
Rather, it's a container that
wraps around your media.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.210
And kind of protects it as it
goes and is used by different

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.550
applications in different ways.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.500
It is track based.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.600
So again, QuickTime is a container
of multiple tracks.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.570
We're all familiar with
an audio and video track.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.600
But QuickTime has many
other exciting track types,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.560
including MIDI tracks, text tracks,
sprite tracks.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.950
We're always trying to get people to
use these other track types because,

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.600
again, QuickTime is such a technically
robust and fruitful foundation.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.450
And fruitful foundation for media,
we have all these track types.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.600
So we're just not used to using them.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.590
So it's always good to be aware of that.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.450
And again, obviously,
it's identified by the

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.520
.move file extension.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.570
We're all used to what movies are.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.540
So let's talk about this a little bit.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
What is a QuickTime movie?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.050
I realize this is really obvious stuff,
but again,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.600
it's good that we all sort of repeat it,
have the same perspective on it.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.880
Video Frame Size How tall
and how wide it is.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.000
The actual frame is the reference there.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.000
Frame Rate How many frames are
repeated one after another.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.000
Codec or decompressor We'll
talk about that in a second.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.000
Data Rate Let's talk about these things.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.000
First of all,
frame size measured in height by width.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The frame size I started
with is 720 x 480.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That's a pretty big size.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I think the resolution
I'm here is 1024 x 768.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It's the pixel size.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.960
A computer screen is made up of pixels.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.960
Those are called pixel elements.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.000
That's what that's short for, a pixel.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:21.000
A computer display shows
video by turning on a pixel.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.000
What they use is a value.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Already with digital video,
we have a resolution component.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.930
How many colors do I see?

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.000
If we had a black and white
monitor with a pixel on it,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.990
a pixel has two states.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.900
That's white or black, off or on.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.860
I get a black and white
image with a single pixel.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.790
If I take that pixel and I make it 8-bit,
I multiply it, get an 8-bit word that I'm

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.000
using for that one pixel.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
For a single color, I get 256 shades of
gray for that one color.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.970
That's a lot of pixels.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.960
I can see the color.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.000
I can see the color.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.600
The color is made up
on a computer of red,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.000
green, and blue.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We add those three colors together at
256 levels of gray for each of them,

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.990
put it all together,
and we get a few million colors

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.920
that we're used to on our display.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.990
The main thing to realize is that, again,
computers display in pixels.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.920
The 720 x 480, that's the measurement
that we're talking about.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Also, switching to the audio here,
audio has the same thing.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.970
Audio has a sample size.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:23.000
Much like the pixel,
the 8-bit pixel that I just talked about,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.910
which is determining
the video resolution,

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.610
audio also has a sample size,
and that determines the dynamics.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.000
For audio,
video quality is the difference

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.990
in loud and softness,
and that, again,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.000
is controlled by your sample rate.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.990
That should have been first.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.950
So sample size, rather.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.000
What I'm talking about is 16-bit audio,
8-bit audio,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.870
determining that dynamics there.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So, for example,
if you have a sample rate or frame rate,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.350
a picture--so we have a single frame,
and a movie is made up of multiple

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.890
frames that play back in order,
okay?

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.000
And those frames play
back at a specific rate.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.880
So as pictures repeat, again,
you get frame rate.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We have some common frame
rates that the video works at.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
My video camera here is NTSC.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.820
That shoots at 29.97 or
30 frames per second.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.000
In Europe, they have a different
electrical standard.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.940
Which relates to a
different video standard.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.960
And the video over there
moves at 25 frames per second.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.870
Again, that's in a camera.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.150
But what we're talking about
right now as a container is

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.980
just that video has a rate.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.260
So these repeat after each
other at a certain rate,

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.960
okay?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.000
Then the last thing is we
have--or here we have a codec.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.830
So it's interesting.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.000
A codec is a concept that
QuickTime brought us.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It means compressor, decompressor.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Okay.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.330
Before, when we'd have a video frame,
we'd have to deal with

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.000
its uncompressed form.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.060
So if I just take a picture,
that picture is about a meg or

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.000
the size of an old floppy disk.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.950
I was gonna bring a floppy disk today,
but I realized some of us

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.000
wouldn't know what to do with it,
so I didn't bother.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.960
But anyway, floppy disk is one meg.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So at uncompressed video,
it's 720 by 480, one meg.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.990
If I run that at 30 frames per second,
that's 30 megs a second.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.990
Okay.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.000
So that's starting to be
a large amount of data.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.650
Now,
QuickTime introduced this revolutionary

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.870
concept when it came out in 1992
called a codec or compressor,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.000
decompressor.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
What a codec does for you is it
takes that data and shrinks it down,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
often ten times that original size.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.890
It also decompresses it.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.910
But because that codec is real time
or you don't notice that it's there,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.470
then if you store your media,
if you store your media

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.000
in a particular codec,
it essentially is ten times smaller now.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.000
Okay.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Now, we always have a tradeoff
with using codecs.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
The tradeoff is image quality.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
We want to preserve image quality.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And so for that reason,
there's really two types of codecs,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
two general categories for
codecs and how they're used.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
One of those is for the
production of media,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.430
high data rate codecs,
where I want to take high quality

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.000
images and bind them together.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
What I want to do is use a
high data rate codec for that.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.100
Then there's distribution,
where I want to take my media and

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.000
I want to play it in as many places
as I can and get that media exposure.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Those are distribution codecs.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So there's two different times.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.000
And again, the beauty of QuickTime is
QuickTime allows you to convert between

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
those codecs very easily and efficiently,
because again,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.990
it's all within the QuickTime architects
that lets you to do that.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.000
So the last thing about codec is again,
data rate or video size,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
which is analogous to video quality.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:54.960
Again, the amount of data that we can
allocate for a particular movie

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.000
would be considered its data rate.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.950
And that's measured by per second.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.400
So data rates are usually talked
about in megabytes per second for

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.400
production or megabits per second,
much smaller unit when we're

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.000
talking about distribution.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.990
And again with audio.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.990
So audio has a similar set of attributes.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Again, the sample size
determines its resolution.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Sample rate really determines
how good it sounds.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And the data rate is
very much tied into that.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We use less codecs.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.140
There's really less codecs for audio,
more the codecs in audio are

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.760
either uncompressed for production,
and then we have distribution

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.910
codecs for audio.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.990
All right.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.110
Now what I'd like to do, I believe,
is show you just a quick

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.000
demonstration of what I mean there.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.390
I'm going to hide this and bring up...

00:13:47.900 --> 00:14:15.800
[Transcript missing]

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:34.430
If you are a beginner or someone
who could use a refresher course,

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.430
this is a must-see session.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.430
Hage Van Dijk

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.940
When you have a series of movies,
so still image frames,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.800
determine your frame rate,
and then over time, again,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.180
multiple frames.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.150
So this is going to turn for us and
show us that we have multiple frames.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.350
So that's the basics of a movie.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:15:02.460
Again, frame size, frame rate,
codec or format, and data rate.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:10.040
So what I'm going to do is
bring up – just stop this,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.070
hide that.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:23.090
What I want to do is just
quickly bring up QuickTime.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.570
And if I go to export this as
though I have QuickTime Pro,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.220
Let's just take a look at the codecs
available to us inside QuickTime.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.800
So here I am exporting
inside QuickTime Pro.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.010
I have video and audio settings.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.580
And if I bring up the
standard compression dialog,

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.980
you see that inside here,
QuickTime has a lot of different

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.800
codecs associated with it.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.560
And so what are all of these things?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:54.440
Well, these codecs are different ways of
compressing media for different purposes.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:16:01.250
So for instance, if I'm doing DV,
I can select DV Pro or DVC Pro NTSC.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.880
That's a DV codec.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.270
It runs at 3.5 megabytes per second.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.170
It's a production codec.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.860
So I could take my media,
preserve the quality, assemble it.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.650
What's really important about
production codecs is often they're,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:20.090
what we say, fully – they're all iframe
or they're fully editable.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.460
So as we start to get
into distribution codecs,

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.360
what we do is we start to pull tricks
that manipulate the image resolution and

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.860
all of the data isn't necessarily there
in a codec that is used for distribution.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.940
For production codecs,
what we do is usually try and

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.130
preserve all of the image quality.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.360
It's called an iframe.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.810
And again, iframe formats are what
are used for production.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:47.160
So again, JPEG or motion JPEG is a real
popular format for production.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.110
Because every frame is fully editable.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.620
And as we get into DV,
DV is a slightly compressed format.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.030
But again, it's always editable.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.470
Other choices that you see inside here,
I do have component video.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.100
So again, production codecs.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.650
I also have a few other ones in here.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.160
I have MPEG-4 video.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.760
And I also have Sorenson video.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.410
So these are other codecs that
are used for distribution.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.610
Again, much lower data rate codecs.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:21.880
So two types of codecs.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:21.880
Okay, I think we can switch back
to the other machine now,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:21.880
please.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.430
Okay, so that starts to get us
into the create part of it,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.860
how we create stuff, again,
QuickTime movies.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.240
Now let's go back out into the
real world and talk about how we

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.160
capture stuff and the formats that
we deal with when capturing video.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.130
So, I have a DV camera.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.170
It shoots at 720 x 480.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.500
Again, if this was a PAL camera,
it also shoots at, again,

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.090
30 frames per second.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:55.130
You've heard the term
SD or standard resolution,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.200
standard definition.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.050
What that means is that
it's a 4:3 aspect ratio,

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:05.200
very common standard definition,
and again, the size of that is 720 x 480.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.150
You can think of SD as
like our television.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.180
Again,
our television is a 4:3 aspect ratio.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.390
640 x 480.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.200
The reason why this is 720 x 480 is
because the pixels are not quite square.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200
Again,
now I'm on the edge of going less than,

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.150
a little more than video basic,
so I'm going to stay a little

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.180
bit away from pixel sizes.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.630
But again,
just realize that you have SD 720 x 480.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.200
That's the size that we're used to.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.030
Now, there's a new frame rate in town,
and there's been a lot of buzz

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.190
over a format called HDTV.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.200
Everyone says, you know, coming soon,
HDTV.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.200
So, HDTV is a much larger size.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:52.200
It's taking our SD size, 720 x 480,
and basically multiplying it by 4.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.200
So, there's a variety of HD sizes.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.560
The two main ones that we're
concerned about are the,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.200
what we call 720,
which is 1280 x 720 in size,

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:08.200
and then 1080, which is, again,
a huge frame, which is 1920 x 1080.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.200
So, a huge video frame.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:16.190
Now, what's also interesting about HD is
that it's also higher resolution.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.200
So, again,
it can be up to 10 bits per pixel,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.000
which means that we can't even
display it on our computer screens,

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.500
all the color information at once,
because our computer

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.070
screens are only 8 bit.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.190
So, dealing with HD has a whole bunch
of interesting attributes to it.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.200
It's very big frame size.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.200
It has a lot of color
information to capture.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.860
And what's also interesting about
HD is that we're back into a situation

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.160
where with HD and HD production,
when you're building

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.390
a system around that,
often your video quality is

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.060
constrained by your data rate.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:20:00.200
And a data rate for an HD signal is
up around 160 megabytes per second.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.300
So, again,
a DV camera shoots a steady data

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.380
rate of 3.5 megabytes per second.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.540
and HD at 160.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.210
So again, a lot more data.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.560
What's really interesting
about HD production is we

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.400
get more and more into it,
is that we start to learn

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.340
a lot more about HD.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.370
HD is, you know,
technically a lot of resolution there.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.810
But what we're starting to learn
a lot is that there's a lot of

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.470
issues associated with HD capturing.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.290
So you want to go out
and shoot an HD movie,

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.750
all of a sudden you need a better
makeup person or a lot better makeup.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.600
You need good lights.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.600
All of the detail that film and
DV cameras was so forgiving about,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.810
because we're in the initial
stages of HD production,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.840
we're really suffering from that.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.680
And so we have to blow a lot of smoke
on stage to create a lot of depth.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.440
The images tend to look very flat.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.950
And again, over time,
I'm sure that we'll work with

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.430
lenses and ways of softening that
up so it's a little more useful.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.750
But today, HD is this huge frame size,
very hard to struggle with.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.540
But once you get it,
obviously the quality is four times that.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.820
Now, we also have frame rates that when
you make a movie on your computer,

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.740
the frame rate can be any
frame rate that you want.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.220
Again,
the idea of starting with the idea of

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.290
a QuickTime movie as a frame size and
a frame rate is just to let you know

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:28.280
that those sizes are arbitrary and that
you can make them whatever you need to.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.220
But out in the real world,
sizes are dictated to

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.420
you by the hardware.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.430
So again, my camera shoots full size.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.120
That size happens to be 640 by 480.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.100
And so, again,
we're starting with the camera.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:37.120
And again, the camera shoots full size.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120
That size happens to be 640 by 480.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.150
Runs at 2997.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.120
Now, film and HDTV run at
24 frames per second.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.940
So that's a little bit different,
a little bit slower.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.240
And actually,
the difference between 24 frames

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.840
per second and 30 frames per second
is really enough that that matters

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.620
about how the background looks.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.190
That there's actually aesthetic
considerations made to film

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.710
shooting at 24 frames per second.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.800
And how you can pan a
subject on a camera.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.700
And the way that the camera is
panning the subject is by the

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.200
way that that looks versus video,
which runs at 30 frames per second.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.750
Actually, it's interleaved.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.470
And I'll get to that in just a second.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.220
So it's actually showing
you 60 images per second.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:22.250
So video is much higher resolution
than the 24 frame for film.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.700
That's why, again,
video is very popular for sports,

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.400
any sort of content where you
need a lot of fast action.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:35.220
Again, video resolution at 30 frames per
second allows you to capture that.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.690
Okay?

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.590
So, again, out in the real world,
we have different formats.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:40.840
We have SD.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.440
We have HD.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.380
We bring those in.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.200
So what we need to do at a certain
point is capture that video.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.190
Now, I used to say that this was...

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.540
an analog versus digital scenario,
and that it was real easy that

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.590
our cameras were always analog,
and that we'd just be digitizing that.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.320
More and more, though,
it's really portable versus not.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:11.170
That, increasingly,
our cameras digitize on-site

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.490
and already have converted that.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.900
So this is a digital camera.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.860
This is a DV camera.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.000
It's a mini-DV camera.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.740
It's very old.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.910
I've dropped it about 14
times from places like this.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.180
You can see I need a new one.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:26.360
But the main thing to think-- that,
again, at--

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:33.050
So, at 720 x 480,
this is 3.5 megabytes per second,

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.300
so the video comes in.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.800
When I capture this, okay,
it's digitized right on the camera,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.300
so all I need to do when I capture
this is I take the FireWire output.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.510
What I'm doing is I'm moving
that digital information between

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.380
my camera and my computer.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.570
So,
you can think of this as a hard drive.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.320
Again, I can push the video back,
but I'm just taking visual information

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.360
in a digital format and pushing
it back and forth with my camera.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:03.380
So, DV is very easy to use because
the signal is already digital.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.270
If you have an analog format,
we need to digitize that.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.370
And again,
there's a variety of products to do that.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.440
We have the IO products from AJA, again,
very high-end cards that

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.310
let you do component input.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.840
If you have, say, a computer that's a
little bit more advanced,

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.380
you can use that.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.380
We have a lot of products that
are producing on digital beta.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.380
Digital BetaCam has a digital
output called an SDI jack.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.750
And again, that SDI jack you can bring
into a DeckLink Blackmagic card,

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.330
again, an AJA box, and bring that in.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.130
But at some point,
you need to take the video from

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.200
that outside world and bring it in.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.380
And again, that's where you capture.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.170
And again,
what we're talking about there is that

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.460
you have to be aware of the frame size,
the frame rate, the codec,

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.370
and the data rate of all
those different formats.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.370
Thanks.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.140
OK, so we talked a little
bit about capturing,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.380
again, a variety of ways of capturing.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.500
So once you've captured that video,
what do you do with it?

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.780
And again, we showed the video of
the different content.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.550
There's a variety of applications.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.260
What mainly happens in that
production phase is that you're

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.500
taking those QuickTime movies,
you're combining them all together,

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.970
either editing,
which is a temporal issue-- so you're

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.240
combining to create a story-- or
you're compositing them together.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.620
The main point about production, though,
the creation of content,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.770
from a technical perspective,
is that you end up mastering

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.820
that format at the same size.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.940
Again, a common misconception is that
I'm just going to output that

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.720
video once I'm done to a small
resolution and be done with it.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.080
And the point, really,
of having the discussion today is

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.140
just to let everyone know that,
really, increasingly,

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.030
you're going to go back to
that content and want to

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.140
deliver it in multiple formats.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.600
So we must make a master
version of that content that,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.540
again,
can be used in many different places.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.560
So the best way to do that is to
produce it at full size and then to

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.490
take that master file and start to
convert it off to different formats.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.410
Also, at some point down the road,
you're going to come back and want to

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.020
make another version of it-- a DVD,
another CD, or something like that.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.960
So again, having a full ResMaster is
really important.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:28.310
So when you're producing your content,
again, DV, I'd output a 720 by 480 movie,

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.880
30 frames per second, using the DV codec.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.420
So at a high, again,
a distribution data rate--

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.150
or production data rate,
excuse me.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:44.500
So, once we've gotten our video,
we've created the master,

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.310
now what we want to do is
start to distribute that video.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:54.500
What formats do we take to communicate
our message out to multiple formats?

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.320
There's really a few different
sizes there and again,

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.210
a few different things that
happen with that video as we go

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.750
through the production process.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.400
The first thing is we want
to make a DVD out of it.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.990
That's the most popular kind of format or
very accessible format for making video.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.070
Well, DVDs are interesting.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.290
If we take our little formula here,
frame size, frame rate, codec, data rate,

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.100
the frame size of a DVD is set for us.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.010
It's full size, 720 x 480.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.670
So what's great about a DVD and
one of the reasons why it looks

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:39.100
good is we've preserved that
full frame size of our media.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.060
Now, MPEG-2 is the codec.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:46.090
So that is actually the compression
scheme when we talk about MPEG-2.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:52.100
MPEG-2 is a compression scheme and that
has a data rate associated with it.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.100
And the data rate that we most
commonly use for DVDs is 5.2.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.080
So that's 5.7 megabits.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:04.100
Again, a DVD has a data rate
choice of up to 10 megabits.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.650
But I work with a lot of
compression products and what

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.100
happens is a lot of times people
have a short 20-minute movie.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.470
They want to go ahead and
make a DVD of that and we're

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.100
all concerned about quality.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.080
We want to get the highest
possible quality from our media.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.100
So if I have less than an hour
and 15 minutes to put on my disc

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.430
and I'm compressing that to DVD,
I'm going to have to

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.030
compress that to MPEG-2.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:31.050
What I'll often do is turn the data
rate quality up or what I would think

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:36.100
is to turn the video quality all the
way up to 8 or 9 megabits per second.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.100
Go ahead and encode that media
and then go ahead and play it.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.830
Well,
there's a little bit of a problem with

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.100
that and that what we've determined,
you know, sort of extensive testing,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.220
has found that if you have a
real high data rate like that,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.530
you're going to have an inconsistent
playback experience between

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.100
the different DVD players.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:01.100
So increasingly, when I talk with people
about making DVD content,

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:06.020
I really urge them to try the data
rate of 5.7 megabits and to try and

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.620
use filtering or other processes
to preserve that video quality

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.400
as much as possible because what
we found is that a 5.7 megabit

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.100
DVD really plays well in all places.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.500
Now as we move from DVD to other formats,
for instance web video,

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.060
the choices open up a lot more.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.800
Again, with web video,
what we're trying to do is to

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.210
get the video to play smoothly.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.530
That's where the data rate comes in.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.600
But the sizes are rather arbitrary.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.110
And really, when we're talking about
compressing for video,

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.600
we're looking at those same trade-offs.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.600
So I have uncompressed
video that's full size.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.600
The first trade-off that I can make
is the frame size to reduce that data.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.520
And again,
common web sizes is 320 by 240.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.600
What we're trying to do with web video
is really get a theatrical experience.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.900
Whether or not we realize it,
we all want a theatrical

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.600
experience from the web.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.560
So we're really trying to get
as full-size codec as we can.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.600
My work experience has
been rather interesting.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.600
I've been doing digital
video for 18 years.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:20.650
And what we started off with was
a technology called QuickTime,

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.600
where everyone complained that they
were little postage stamp movies.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.700
And what we did was we
worked really hard to,

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.480
with hardware assist,
get that to be full screen, full motion.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.440
And we achieved that in about 1994,
the variety of products to do that.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.940
Then what happened was about 1996,
the Internet became

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.600
more and more prominent.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.600
And we started to get digital
video happening on the web.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.590
And there was once a
time when Peter Hottie,

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:55.600
who was the QuickTime architect,
asked me to make him a 60K movie.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.600
No, he wanted a 30K movie, 30K bit movie.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.650
And I said, "Well, Peter, that's,
you know, going to be 60 by 90 and

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.570
not look too good." He says,
"I want a movie that played."

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.600
And so I made the movie.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.590
He used it for the demo.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.560
But what was interesting
about that was that,

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600
you know,
I was working with a lot of people.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.110
And what I was thinking about
that was that we've now,

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.580
we went to a software world.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:20.020
And then for, after 1996,
what happened was slowly we've been

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.330
trying to get that frame size to grow.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.430
So it's in stretching that frame size,
it's in codec developments

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.600
and increasing the data rate.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.600
Can we actually stretch that
size out to be full size?

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.600
And we've almost achieved that.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.590
But there was an announcement yesterday,
very significant announcement

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:40.600
for anyone making digital media.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:48.280
Which is that Apple's going to include
a new H.264 codec in the next version

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.600
of the OS in the Tiger operating system.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:55.260
Now what's really exciting about that is
that right now we can do a fairly good

00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:00.540
job of stretching MPEG-4 to full screen,
full motion.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.600
It's pretty difficult to get it.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.360
But if we increase the
video by a factor of four,

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.600
that's going to look fantastic.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.600
So we really look to
MPEG-4 to deliver that.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.350
And we're going to use MPEG-4
to deliver a software version

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.580
of a codec that is full screen,
full motion.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.790
Now, the interesting thing for me is
just about the time right now

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.600
that we're getting that together.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.600
There's a new thing on the horizon.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.780
And that is everyone's driving
around in their car with their Wi-Fi,

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.510
at least in Hong Kong.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.600
They're watching video on
these portable formats.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.260
So again, what's kind of interesting
about this is we work really

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.600
hard to make it full screen,
full motion on software.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.600
And they invent a new platform for us.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.340
So this is a Clie.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.590
This is a TJ37.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.600
And what this is is a 200 megahertz CPU.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.280
So again,
what they've done is they took my

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.600
Beige G3 or so and they shrank it.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:35.700
[Transcript missing]

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:42.850
Switch to my machine for a second please.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.740
And so what this is just a picture
of relative frame sizes for you.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:11.480
So again, the big white box is our
1920 by 1080 frame size.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:21.250
The next box is our
1280 x 720 frame size.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.340
Here's our 720 x 480.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:29.070
Here's our 320 x 240 standard web size.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.190
Here is our 160 x 120 cell phone size.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:39.100
One of the ways we are reducing data
is by stretching the frame size down.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:46.110
We can do the same thing with frame rate,
but we are a little less forgiving with

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.300
frame rate because that has to do with
temporal motion or motion over time.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:55.710
Again, what you want to be aware of about
frame rates is that we have really

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:01.190
good eyes as far as seeing deteriorated
motion and motion resolution.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.300
What we really want to do is
preserve motion wherever possible.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.450
You have to really look at your
content to see how fast it is

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:12.300
moving to determine whether or
not you can switch the frame rate.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.290
I kind of go back and forth on this
and I am currently in a personal

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.710
phase where I try to keep my frame
rates matching as much as possible.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.430
I will make my frame rates 29.97 or 24.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:28.790
You can hit 15 or 7 at lower bit rates,
but again, the movie gets choppy.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.350
The nice thing about that is, again,
with QuickTime as the technology,

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.790
that choppiness will
at least be consistent.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.780
You won't get snappy video,
you will get choppy video.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.300
That is why I am an
expert in choppy video.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:46.370
Great, we can go off of there.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.370
Back to the video.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.840
Okay, so actually I want to do a little
bit of a demo now and just talk

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.370
a little bit about distribution.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.950
There's going to be some seminars.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:58.100
We can go actually back to my machine.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:03.840
There's going to be some
sessions during the week about

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:25.500
[Transcript missing]

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.760
So I'm going to be using Cleaner as
an application to sort of talk for a

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.660
minute about the process of distribution
and how to get the most out of it.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:43.120
The reason why I want to use Cleaner
here is because we're going to

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.240
be talking about pre-processing.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.910
When you spend your time
creating your content,

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.230
you don't really want to think about
color values and things like that.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.270
You really want to have a time
when you're being creative

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.740
and assembling your media.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.020
But at a certain level,
you have to come back and

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.900
take a look at that media in
terms of distribution and go,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.730
"Okay, now I need to distribute this.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.440
I need to shrink this thing
down many hundreds of times

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.480
smaller than its original.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.330
How do I do that?" And that's
where compression applications

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.650
offer you these pre-processing.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.970
So the first thing, again, video,
when it's shot, it's shot in fields.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.240
So we talked about this before where
you actually have alternating fields.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.230
The reason for that is
that when we started,

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.480
remember that a computer
display has a pixel on it.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:36.320
A single pixel is going to shoot
that always on when you see

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.520
that display on your computer.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.740
Well, a television works a
little bit different.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.640
It's a little more arcane, if you will.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.740
A television works by
scanning every line.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.740
It draws one line in a 30th of a second.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.740
Then it goes back and draws
another line in a 30th of a second.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.640
That's called interlaced video.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.740
Again, a field that's made up of
these alternating fields.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:04.210
They're scanned even and odd
depending on your video format.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.140
So DV, it's even, odd, even, odd, even,
odd.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.240
And again,
that alternating back and forth

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.240
happens at the point of the camera.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.740
So all of your video resolution is
caught in that alternating field.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.600
And when you digitize that video,
those alternating fields

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.730
are also captured.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.240
And if you produce your video
and output it at full resolution,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.220
those alternating fields are
maintained through that process

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.240
when you're doing video.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.240
So what happens is when you get to the
computer screen to view that video,

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.990
all of a sudden you have a
problem because the computer

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.240
video doesn't display that way.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.240
It's always on.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.240
And if you're going to show
that frame with both of those,

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.790
you're going to see a difference there,
the interlaced difference

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.190
in what that motion is.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.240
And if you're not careful with
how you process that video,

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.970
all of that difference in motion,
is going to be interpreted

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.240
by the computer,
which doesn't know what it is, as noise.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.570
It's going to create a,
giving you a very blotchy outcome.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.030
So again,
one of the things that we have to

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:11.630
do when we take video in is start to
deinterlace it or reduce that data

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:16.740
down by taking away one of those fields
and thus capturing that motion smooth.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.220
And we're going to use Cleaner
to see that in just a second.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.220
So again,
video alternating and deinterlacing

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:26.090
is really critical to data reduction,
but it's also critical to getting

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.670
a good look for your web video,
because again,

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:35.240
those motion artifacts will be
interpreted as noise for you.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.200
Another thing is that
if you're using film,

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.880
film is shot at 24 frames per second.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.100
There's a problem with film though,
if I edit my film on video,

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:57.430
video runs at 29.97,
so that's a different frame rate.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.340
So there's a difference in the
frame rate that film is shot

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.930
at 24 and the video at 29.97.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.480
So how do we deal with that?

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:09.000
Well, there's a very standard
process called telecine,

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:15.270
which is the process of moving 24
frames per second video up to 30.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.140
So it's not like the video case
where every field is interlaced,

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.920
you basically have the 60th of a field.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.540
What's happening with telecine video
or video that originated on film

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.850
is we get two progressive frames,
so progressive frame,

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.150
just the whole frame is captured.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.420
We get two of those and then
we get three interlaced frames.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.120
So we're going to use the telecine
process to make up that difference

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.590
and it's that difference of five
over four over time in the telecine

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.950
process that makes up that 29.97.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.620
So we've taken four frames,
mapped them to five frames and

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.410
added three interlaced frames
and two progressive frames.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.310
So that's where we hear that term
three-two pull up or pull down.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.820
Again, it can be two-three or three-two
depending on where you start,

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.820
but the main thing to realize is
that there you have two progressive

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.560
frames and three interlaced frames.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.730
Now when you're in that situation
and you apply a deinterlaced filter,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.600
what you're doing is only,
you're only doing the appropriate thing

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.580
for those three frames because it's mixed
of progressive and interlaced frames.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.080
Deinterlacing all of that is
going to cause a deterioration

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.220
on those two progressive frames.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.570
So what we need to do when we go
back to web video is we need to

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:30.680
do a process called intellicine,
which is to remove that

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.560
three-two pull down back to
that 24 frames per second video.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.910
So one of the really what
I consider the pinnacle of web

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.560
quality is the Apple trailer site.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.580
The team in Cupertino does a
fabulous job encoding those.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.580
And if you look at them,
they're all 24 frames per second.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.640
And again,
the key to that was that those,

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.540
all those movies have gone
through an intellicine filter to

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.570
restore that original frame rate.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.580
Never know where your media
is going to come from today.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.000
So again, restoring that original 29,
the original 24 from

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.560
your 29.97 is important.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.520
If you're doing stuff in PAL,
it's just a 1% raise and lower.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:09.530
So it's a little bit different.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.490
They don't go through quite
the intricate process.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:19.580
The telecine process in telecine is
really only relevant to 29.97 video.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:26.330
Okay, so again, as I was talking about,
the next thing is how to process

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.580
the video so that it looks good.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:34.560
We're taking uncompressed video that's
this big and we need to restore that.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.560
And we're running through
a hole that's this small.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.670
So we want to do every single
thing we can to preserve

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.450
the quality of that video.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:46.580
So again, throwing off the frame rate,
making the frame size a lot smaller.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.490
Well, that helps.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.580
There goes half the data.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.750
Deinterlacing that video takes
away half that resolution and

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.580
actually helps us reduce that data.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.580
But we're left with a variety of other
techniques to preserve that video.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.490
And that's where you're going to
see some sessions on pre-processing

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.560
because the key to good looking
web video is pre-processing.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.510
And what I'm really talking
about now here is web video.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.620
When we talk about DVD,
we're not going to do a lot of

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:16.480
processing to our DVD because
it's already full size 720 by 480.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.720
The number one thing that I see people
running into with DVD production is

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.540
they need to go from their interlaced
format to a progressive format.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.550
They're going to be playing DVD that
will always be played back on a computer.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:34.560
The only problem with that is that when
you take your full size interlaced video,

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.560
and you deinterlace it
to make it progressive,

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:43.380
you've eliminated half the
resolution vertically on that

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.580
and you've softened that video.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.270
So the one thing that you need
to be aware of when you're making

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:55.580
DVDs when moving from interlaced to
progressive is your videos can go soft.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.770
Now there is some tricks that
you can do with the green channel

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.420
and balancing that stuff out.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.560
But just remember that, again,
video goes soft.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:19.670
So what you need to do is,
you can go to the So I'm going

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.580
to walk through that now a little
bit with Cleaner and talk about

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:24.580
what some of these pre-processing
principles are and how you use them.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:28.530
So I'm going to use my
Bubbles movie for this.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:45:53.000
[Transcript missing]

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:07.480
This is a before and after view of my
movie before I actually compress it.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.720
Let's look at the before view.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.620
Again,
I've intentionally picked this piece of

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.840
media because it's got a lot of motion.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:21.440
You'll see these sort of horizontal
lines in my video in this before section.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.170
What those are is because what we're
seeing is a frame of video of a

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:27.230
bunch of bubbles rushing up at us.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.600
So the whole thing is moving.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.670
And again, all those interlaced lines,
what those are is the difference in

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.590
movement between that 60th of a frame.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:39.840
So this is where I'm talking about
deinterlacing your video in order

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.580
to get the best possible look.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.380
Because again, if I were just to compress
this without deinterlacing it,

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.270
look what I'm feeding the encoder.

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:48.680
It's a mess.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.580
It's never going to get
above this high-level noise.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.760
It's never going to get above this
high-level noise to get me any

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.540
sort of picture of an image at all.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.020
So again,
deinterlacing as the first step to

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.680
creating a delivery for your media,
an output platform,

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.630
is extremely critical because
with all that otherwise,

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.040
you're going to get all
that noise in there.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:08.900
Now, cleaner is kind of interesting.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.290
Cleaner has a feature
called adaptive there.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.810
You see now if I go to the output also,
conversely,

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.770
notice how much that cleans up,
particularly this group

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:18.300
right here in the center.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.580
See how much just pulling
away has a lot of noise.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:25.600
Half of that field really cleans that
video up to get that started there.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.420
So again, deinterlacing,
probably the most important

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.500
filter when making web video.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.220
Because again,
you're able to decrease that video,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.660
but you're really preserving the size,
the look of this video.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.190
Adaptive deinterlacing.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:45.310
If I have a Batman shot,
everything's at an angle.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:48.610
I have lots of diagonal
lines in my video.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.560
And I were to take a picture of that,
I'm going to have to do

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:51.560
a lot of diagonal lines.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:55.610
and in video and I were
to deinterlace it.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.760
Because I had diagonal lines in there and
I take away that half every other line,

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:06.490
what I'm doing is starting to
introduce jaggies into my output.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.890
Little jagged lines there.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.850
Well, with an adaptive deinterlace,
you're only deinterlacing

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:13.040
pixels that move,
so you're only going after

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.640
these artifacts to get rid
of that motion stuff to,

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.890
again, prepare your video for
a distribution codec.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.640
So again, adaptive deinterlace,
very important.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.200
You'll notice that Cleaner
has a Sharpen filter in there.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.840
That Sharpen filter is just
to brighten things up again,

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.700
because codecs inherently
dull our content.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.700
So again having that Sharpen
codec in there is very helpful.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.690
And what we have is a
concept of noise reduction.

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:40.970
So with all of your video,
when you go down to lower data rates

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.570
you're going to be using noise reduction.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:45.700
Noise reduction filters are very,
very cool.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.440
What they do is they'll take the edges,
they'll preserve those edges,

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.890
and they'll apply blur
to everything in between.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:58.190
So the areas of less detail that our
eyes are much more forgiving for,

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.700
again,
can see this noise reduction filter.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.600
It helps scale the video down very well.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:09.740
So again, how to use noise reduction is
really keep it on mild or moderate,

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.130
depending on how much motion you have.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.130
Again, we'll do that.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:17.400
The next filters just to
talk about for image quality,

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.380
we have a few of them that
you need to be aware of.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.390
First thing is Gamma.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:34.390
There is a difference in Gamma
between the Mac and Windows platforms.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:43.460
There is a difference in gamma
between the Mac and Windows.

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.090
A Mac computer is darker
than a Windows display.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.740
If you are always producing your
media on one platform on a Mac and

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:56.250
you play it for your Windows friends,
they might say that it is

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.090
a little bit dark for them.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:02.610
The way that we handle that when
producing content for the web is

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.090
to add a gamma filter for that.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:08.500
What a gamma filter does is just
brightens up those mid-tones.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:14.490
You can see here, I'm just going to turn
these off for a moment.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.600
"Just update that.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.600
So if I add just a little bit,
I'll turn the gamma filter off.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.880
And again,
it's just going to take that and

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.570
brighten that up just a little.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.590
Not too much.

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:27.590
Go the other way.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:52:31.000
[Transcript missing]

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.410
The Cleaner has two other very
important filters in it that are used

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.560
for making the video really look the
level of quality that we're talking

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.400
about on the Apple Trailer site.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.400
That is the concept of
black and white restore.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:48.890
So what these filters do here for you is,
again, they'll take and they'll

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.400
actually regenerate those colors
for black and white for you.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.540
So this is significant because, again,
it's going to really ground

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.310
your – it's going to give your
content good color values.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.400
So you might say, "Well,
there's not a lot of black in this video.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.970
Why would I use a black restore
video on content like this?" Well,

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.390
if we notice,
if we bring up the amount of

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:14.650
black restore in the video image,
you'll see that this blue that's

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:18.400
all over this content really
does have elements of black,

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.910
that there's a darkness
associated with this whole

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:26.210
background inside this video clip,
and that I can sharpen that

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:27.400
up or increase the clarity.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.400
If you will, of that kind of stuff using
a black restore filter.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.530
So how you actually use these
filters is you'll notice they

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:37.400
have a smoothness control.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.600
So if I just turn on the black
restore and then turn this way up,

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.380
you're going to see
that at a certain level,

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.400
it's going to start to get very blotchy.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:53.400
So you'll notice in here it's starting
to get – so black is being added and

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.400
just regenerated into all these areas.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.710
use a smoothness control here.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.870
What I'm able to do is just get a
little bit of softness and get a

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:08.900
little bit of edge and nice lift to
that and really get those colors back.

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:12.940
So to get good contrast in that video,
I can go ahead with a lot of

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:16.920
smoothness and softness and bring
up that with that black filter.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.470
Same is true for the white restore.

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:23.520
So again, same principles apply that all
colors have an element of white

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.310
in them and that by regenerating
this black and these white colors,

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.400
we're able to really
preserve those color values.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.340
So that when you go ahead
and compress that video,

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.560
you get the highest possible output.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:37.140
So we call this media mastering.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.130
The other thing is to realize
that when you do audio,

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:45.910
again, for audio formats,
audio is an interesting case.

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.740
For a long time,
starting with QuickTime 3,

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.860
we had audio codec called
the QDesign Music Codec.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:58.870
So QDesign was a very good codec for
reducing the data rate of our video,

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.810
but QDesign did have an unfortunate
artifact associated with it.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:08.460
It would produce a phase shift at
high – at the upper frequencies.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.930
Basically,
it would make your audio sound –

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:15.860
So you get a swishing sound
with the QDesign codec.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:20.530
Now, that was followed up by
the very popular MP3 codec.

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:24.510
And MP3 was available, I believe,
with QuickTime 4.

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:32.150
It came in and, again,
MP3 – very popular, very portable format.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:58:08.200
[Transcript missing]

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:22.600
[Transcript missing]

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.780
Okay, so I'm starting to wrap up here
and I really wanted to finish

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.540
again where I started a little bit,
which is this concept of video.

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.220
What is digital video?

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.160
Well, digital video is a quick
time movie or other formats,

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:40.280
but it has a frame size and a frame rate.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.610
These frame rates are really,
and a lot of the size is

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:46.820
controlled by the codec,
and ultimately that codec has

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:50.080
a data rate associated with it,
and that data rate really is what

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.340
determines the quality of your video.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:56.340
Great, can we switch back to
the demo machine please?

00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:00.070
So I wanted to show you that again,
what we've talked a

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.100
little bit about here,
we've introduced this idea of

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.380
this great new H.264 codec and
what's going to be happening there.

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:09.380
And really want to talk a little bit
about some of the trends here in media.

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:13.460
So one of the exciting things that
we have here inside Cleaner is we

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:18.200
have the ability to go out using
the Konoma exporter to the Palm OS.

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.380
Again, Palm OS devices are extremely
good at playing video.

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:25.780
I have my little Clia here that,
let's go ahead and play this,

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.960
and I think more and more what
people are seeing is that our

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.370
video is on our cell phone,
that we can take pictures

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.420
with our cell phone now.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.490
So it's just a matter of time
before our cell phones will be

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:40.390
able to actually display video,
moving pictures.

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.420
Okay, so we've got the single frame,
now we need to get multiple frames.

00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:47.300
There's also a really exciting
component to this technology,

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.410
well there's two other components.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:50.420
First of all,
there's a thing called Blur.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:55.140
802.11,
wireless technology that will be able

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.300
to allow me to view this video anywhere.

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.420
And increasingly we're
seeing more and more,

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.460
you probably have it at your house,
but increasingly down at Starbucks.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.220
You can go to places,
just last week it was

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.460
announced in Washington,
D.C., they're actually deploying Wi-Fi in

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.390
a whole neighborhood under city blocks.

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:14.460
So more and more we're going to be
able to take media wherever we want.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.460
Now, if you capture a video
on your cell phone,

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:19.460
and you're using your phone,
you're going to be able

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:19.460
to take it to your home.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:26.460
Realize that the resolution is this size,
it's going to be 160 by 120.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.460
So we're going to have an interesting
period of time when we try and take

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.460
that video and scale it up to full size.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.180
But again,
we're going to have very exciting

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.440
codecs like H.264 that will
help us make that transition.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.530
So again, what's very exciting about
that is what will happen,

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.380
you know, where this media is going.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.360
And increasingly,
what we'll see is that you'll produce

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.500
your video in these high-end formats,
perhaps in a lot of different formats.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:51.970
Perhaps HD, SD, very high data rate,
a lot of creative stuff

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:53.490
happening with that.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.490
You get to a point where you
need to distribute that media.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:59.500
And oftentimes you're going to
distribute it in multiple formats.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.800
You'll make a DVD of it,
you'll make a web movie of it,

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.360
you'll make a cell phone version of it.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.500
And again, the idea here is that we're
distributing this in multiple formats.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.500
So you're going to make
a master version of that.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.000
And you're going to then, from that,
derive all of these other versions

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.530
at these lower data rates.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.500
And then you're going to make a version
of that that's much smaller sizes.

01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:21.540
Okay.

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.540
We can go back to the demo machine,
to the presentation machine, please.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.710
So again,
we've hit some basics today and just

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.910
sort of discussed what QuickTime was.

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:35.900
QuickTime is a container for your
media that's extremely important

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:39.000
that it's not just a codec,
it has codec attributes

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.290
associated with it.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.040
This is – the reason why I have to
draw that contrast is there's some

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.080
other formats in the world where you
don't have this level of technical

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.140
complexity and this amount of tools
and really rich features to use,

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.600
where the codec is the
name of the format.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.220
So I shouldn't have to say what they are,
right?

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:56.850
Thank you.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:57.600
Okay, good.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.780
So again,
QuickTime is really codec-based.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:06.600
So it really gives you that frame size,
that frame rate, codec and data rate.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:10.200
And then again,
data rates determine how you produce it,

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.560
how that image quality looks,
and that we have different codecs for

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.420
distribution than we have for production.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.330
And again, the codecs for distribution
are very small,

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:22.520
the codecs for production are very high.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.780
We have all these frame rates,
different sizes of video that we

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.550
collect from all over the world.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.960
We bring those all into our – we
digitize those on our computers,

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.530
assemble those,
and then output them at still more

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.470
smaller sizes in different formats.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.600
So again, lots happening with the media.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.980
I think that we're going to
now take some questions if

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.600
people are interested in that.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.470
And again,
what we do is we have – first of all,

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:45.600
who to contact.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.870
If you have any questions about
the topics that we've talked

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.600
about today or just QuickTime and
QuickTime technologies in general,

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:50.600
we're happy to answer them.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:50.600
And again, we're happy to answer any
questions that you may have.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:50.600
So again, we're happy to answer any
questions that you may have.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:50.600
So again, we're happy to answer any
questions that you may have.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:50.600
So again, we're happy to answer any
questions that you may have.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.700
QuickTime and
QuickTime technologies in general.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.070
There's a few very important
names you should know.

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:56.930
First is Guillermo Ortiz.

01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:00.330
He's a developer relations
person for QuickTime.

01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:03.500
And again,
wonderful key person to know for any

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.770
of your questions you have regarding
QuickTime and the media track here.

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.530
In addition, my colleague Steven.

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:10.660
Steven is available.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:15.530
He's the product manager for QuickTime,
available for questions and follow-up.

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.900
And then myself, I'm Hegy Van Dyke.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.210
I'm available here at Discrete.com.

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:23.020
And my role is I'm an
applications analyst.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.550
So I'm really a person who
works with all phases of media

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.900
production and delivery and actually
product development and delivery.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.780
I work for a company called Discrete.

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:36.150
At a certain level,
we're known for a product called Cleaner,

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.690
which is a kind of transcoding
tool designed for compressing

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.830
video from one format to another.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:46.920
But Discrete also has a real legacy and
a history in high-end media production.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.840
We have a product called the Flame,
which is an SGI-based real-time

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.680
independent resolution system
designed to give you very

01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:59.220
high-quality motion effects.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.980
And again,
what's interesting about the Flame is

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.780
those deal with still image formats.

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.030
So again, large stuff.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.600
And we're going to take some questions,
I believe.
