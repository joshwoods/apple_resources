Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13

Taking iPad Apps for Mac to the Next Level

Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC.My name is James Magahern.I'm from the iOS Keyboards team, and I'm here to give you a brief primeron how to make your app a first-class app on devices with hardware keyboards.iOS applications have always embraced user interfaces designed all around touch,which is a truly excellent way to interact with content.Discovering UI in your application is as easyas just showing something on the screen.iPad users with hardware keyboards attached, however,have become quite common.Embracing hardware-keyboard support in your applicationallows your users to become more productiveand navigate your UI more quickly and ergonomically.They can leverage muscle memory to execute functionswithout even thinking about it.Also, by implementing standard system shortcuts,novice users can approach your application with a familiar, consistent interfacearmed with expectations brought from the Mac.To be a first-class appon a next-generation computing platform like the iPad,your application should excel at both touch and hardware-keyboard interactions.Here's a quick setup for what we're gonna be talking about today.Let's jump right in and talk about keyboard shortcuts.To go briefly over how keyboard shortcuts work on iOS,let's first talk about UIKeyCommand.UIKeyCommand is an objectthat represents a custom keyboard shortcut in your application.It has all the properties that you might expect,such as the discoverability title shown to the user,what keyboard input is required to invoke it,and optionally, a set of modifierFlagsdefining which modifier keys should be held.This fits together with your UIby returning an array of key commands via an overridable propertycalled keyCommands on UIResponder,where you return an array of all the commandsfor that particular responder.Most common UIKit widgets are subclasses of UIResponder already,so in most cases, extending your application to include these key commandsshould be as simple as just overriding this one propertyand returning whatever key commands are relevantfor that particular part of your UI.The way this all fits together in your applicationis via the responder chain.The responder chain loosely follows the view hierarchy of your application,with the UIApplication instance at the very endand the responder the user is currently interacting with at the beginning.Your application's first responder is the UIResponder objectin which all keyboard events first funnel into.If a responder in the chain isn't able to handle a particular event,the event goes further up the chain.UIViews, for example,have their designated next responder in the chain as the view's superview.Key commands are then collected by the application from each respondervia the keyCommands method that you override,starting with the application's first responderand ending up at the top-level UIApplication instance.Once all of your key commands are collected by the system,users will be able to discover them via the discoverability heads-up display,which is accessible by holding the Command key anywhere in the system.This is great, not only for your users to be able to discover keyboard shortcuts,but it's also handy during developmentto be able to test and inspect all of them in one place.Now let's take a look at how all this fits together in practice.Let's take the Music app as an example.When the Music app is in the foreground, the user can press the space barto easily toggle the playback of the currently playing song.This works consistently across all apps that do media playback of any kind,such as when playing videos in the Photos appor for QuickTime videos in Safari.Following the model-view-controller pattern,the ideal place to define this behavior is in your custom view controller subclass.In this example,we have a player view controller subclass of UIViewController,which manages playback in our applicationand whose view contains things like the play button.Because all UIViewControllers are UIResponders,all I need to do is override a few methods hereto allow this to start accepting keyboard shortcuts.First, override canBecomeFirstResponder and return true.Then, override viewDidAppear and call becomeFirstResponderto make sure this view controller is first responder when it first appears.Lastly, override the keyCommands propertyto return our custom space-bar keyboard shortcut.Here you can see we provide a localized stringto show in the discoverability HUDwhich action to perform when it's invoked in the form of a selectorand which input is required.In this case, a string just containing spaceto indicate this is for the space bar.You're getting really excited right about now,thinking about adding some commonly used keyboard shortcuts to your appthat your users are expecting from other apps.For example, if you're working on a music library application,you'll want to add a few shortcuts that would make it fasterto interact with songs and playlists,such as select all, copy, and paste.Or if you're working on an illustration app, for example,you'll want to have things like Command-Plus for zooming inand Command-Minus for zooming out.Well, fortunately, for many of these commonly used keyboard shortcuts,you don't even need to create a single UIKeyCommand.All you need to do is override a couple of methods.Every UIResponder subclass conforms to a protocolcalled UIResponderStandardEditActions,which can respond to any method listed here.All you need to do is override the relevant method.You don't have to create a single UIKeyCommand.Here's a quick example.In your UIResponder subclass, our UITableViewController subclass here,we just need to override the same two methods that we did beforeto make sure it can become first responder.As always, this will be requiredif you decide to implement this inside of your view controller subclass.Then you can override any of the methods mentioned on the previous slide,such us select all, copy, paste, and a few others,all without creating a single UIKeyCommand.Check out the documentation on UIResponderStandardEditActionsfor more commands and for more information.UIKeyCommand was designed with Catalyst in mind.Making all these new key commands work with the macOS Menu bar is extremely easy.For the UIResponderStandardEditActions I mentioned on the previous slide,you get those for free.But for custom UIKeyCommands,luckily, UIKeyCommand is a subclass of UICommand,which means this is easily integrated into the command-builder APIthat we introduced for macOS Catalina.For more depth and for more information about how the command-builder API works,check out the "Taking iPad Apps for Mac to the Next Level" session from WWDC 2019.The next thing I want to talk aboutis how hardware keyboards interact with table views and collection views.If you have a list of files, like in the Files app,your users will expect some common shortcuts from the Macto also work on their iPads.For example, holding Shift and tapping on two list itemsto select a contiguous list of files should work.And secondly, holding Command and tapping multiple items in a listshould extend the user's selection without having to enter edit mode first.Fortunately, it's extremely easyto implement this behavior your users expect in your applicationif you're already using UITableView or UICollectionView.All you need to do is implementshouldBeginMultipleSelection InteractionAt indexPath and return true.The system will then automatically put your table view into editing modeor your collection view into multiple selection modeand extend the user's currently selected set of index pathsbased on which modifier key has been held.Likewise, implementdidBeginMultipleSelection InteractionAt indexPathto adapt your surrounding UI to the factthat it was automatically placed into editing mode.To find out what else the multiple selection API can offer you,check out the "Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13" session from 2019.Now, on to some new things for iOS 14,starting with some additions that we made to gesture recognizers.To start with another example, let's take a look at Numbers.One of the ways Numbers leverages the hardware keyboard on iPadto provide advanced functionality,is by allowing users to hold the Shift keywhile resizing a shape with their finger or the trackpadto constrain the scale of the selected shape to its aspect ratio.In addition, Numbers allows users to hold the Command keyto select multiple objects by tapping on them,so you can move them all at once, for example.This is all possible because in iOS 13.4,when we introduced the new Magic Keyboard,we added a property on UIGestureRecognizer called modifierFlags,which allows any application to implement this kind of behavior.This property will be setto whatever modifier keys the user had been holding downwhen the gesture recognizer's state changes.So, if we're implementing something like what Numbers did in our example,all we need to do is consult this propertywhen out gesture-recognizer callback is firedand do the appropriate action based on which modifier key is held.For more information about what else is newwith events and gesture recognizers,check out the "Handle Trackpad and Mouse Input" session.The last thing I want to talk about is a new APIfor responding to raw keyboard events.Embracing hardware-keyboard interactions within your applicationcan give your users much more fine-grained controlover certain aspects of your app.Back to Numbers as an example.Numbers leverages the accuracy of the hardware keyboardand matches expectationsto allow users to be able to make small adjustmentsto shapes or layers using the arrow keys.This requires you to respond to a key-down eventto start moving the objectand a key-up event to stop moving the object.Both things are not possible with UIKeyCommands,which are only fired once after invoked by the user.Well, new in iOS, we've added the ability to respondto all key-down and key-up events from an attached hardware keyboard.Back to our friend, the responder chain,all this is done via UIResponder methods called pressesBegan and pressesEnded.You only need to override these two methodson your view or view controllerto start getting notified as soon as a key goes down or is released.Again, using the model-view-controller pattern,we override pressesBegan and pressesEndedon something like our canvas view controller, for example.In pressesBegan,which is called when a key goes down on a hardware keyboard,we can check the key code to see which arrow key was pressedand perform the appropriate action in our appto start moving a shape continuously while the key is down.Then, in pressesEnded,simply perform whatever action in your app stops moving the shape.It's as easy as that.Likewise, similar to what we added for gesture recognizers,you can also check the modifierFlags for every key eventand make adjustments as necessary.For example, allowing the user to hold Shiftto select while moving something.In addition, we'll also notify you about key-down and key-up eventswith just the modifier keys as well.So finally, what you need to do next.Make sure your app workswith all the common keyboard shortcuts your users expect.Enhance the functionality of your appwith completely customized keyboard shortcutsto make your users more productive.Create menu items so your app feels right at home on macOS.And finally, use the new hardware-keyboard APIsto complete the awesome keyboard experience in your app.Thanks for watching.
