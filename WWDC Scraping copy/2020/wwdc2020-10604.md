Advances in AR Quick Look

Search this video…Hello, and welcome to WWDC.Hi, everyone. Thank you for tuning in.My name is David Lui, and I'm excited to present to youhow to bring AR Quick Look to commerce and retail workflows.Starting in iOS 12,we introduced AR Quick Look, our built-in system-wide AR viewer for 3D contentwhere you can preview USDZand Reality File scenes right with you in your world,all without needing to download an app.With iOS 13, we added new featureslike launching straight into ARthe moment you tap the 3D model from any application or website.You can now share product links instead of the 3D modelto bring users back to detailed product pages from retailers.We added support for detecting vertical planesalong with horizontal planesmaking it possible to anchor picture frames or lightson floors and walls in your space.There's even support for viewing face accessories,like glasses and masks,using the front camera coupled with our automatic face occlusionfor that realistic try-on experience.We gave a session last yearwhere you can learn more about our other features and advancementsin AR Quick Look.In the last year,AR Quick Look was accompanied by two new products in the AR family...Reality Composer and Reality Converter,and serves as a great visualization toolfor viewing and sharing your 3D compositions.And in support of those applications and frameworks, like ARKit and RealityKit,we've added new featureslike instant AR placement and object occlusionthat make the AR experience more responsive and realistic,especially on the new iPad Pro with LiDAR scanner.Now objects appear immediately in your worldand can be anchored anywhere from the flat surfaces of your floorto the curved surface of your couch.And together with object occlusion,AR furniture could be placed in your spacebetween and behind pieces of real furniturefor more realistic product visualization.But one of the amazing things we previewed last yearwas our retail integration,and we started with Apple Pay.Our goal is to provide a tighter integrationof AR technology and commerce with retailersin a really simple and easy way,and AR Quick Look was a fantastic solutionto enable not only a richer and more immersive experience for consumers,but also for businesses to sell their products in AR.We've seen a lot of great companies like Home Depot, 1800Flowers, and Wayfairadopt this technology and integrate AR Quick Lookas part of their shopping experience with great feedback,resulting in increased purchases.And one of the most notable is Bang & Olufsen,where Jakob Kristoffersen, Senior Manager of Customer Experience said,"Users who engage with the AR experience in our iOS app or on the websiteare four times more likely to seek out our Store Finder to visit a B&O storeand has aided our sales effort to great extents."So let's take a look at how this works.We've added a banner at the bottom of the AR Quick Look viewwhich provides a quick one-tap wayfor the customer to immediately purchase the item, like this alarm clock,after seeing the product in the world with AR.The Apple Pay banner has a very clean and templated layoutwhere the product information is located on the leftand the Apple Pay button is on the right.In addition to the Apple Pay banner, there is a custom action bannerwhere retailers can provide their own call to action text.Our third banner style is entirely customizable,so you can completely configure the look and feel of the banner using custom HTML.These three banner styles are available through the webstarting with iOS 13.3 on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.Let's take a look how this experience works from end-to-endand discuss what's needed to create the banner.Suppose I run an online store selling retro alarm clocksand I want to add the Apple Pay button to my AR experiencewhen customers visit each product page.On my web page, I can add a link to my USDZ modelso that customers can preview the alarm clock on their nightstandusing AR Quick Look.Last year, we introduced a way to customize the AR Quick Look experiencethrough the web URL's fragment identifier.We can use the same system to provide the required informationfor AR Quick Look to use to display an Apple Pay banner.These customization options get passed to AR Quick Lookwhen the user taps on the link.AR Quick Look then parses the fragment identifierand creates the appropriate banner style.The last step for me is to add an EventListener to my page.This way, when the customer is ready to take action,tapping on the banner will dismiss AR Quick Look,and notify the EventListener on my website,which can then present the Apple Pay prompt.Now, let's go into more detail about how to specify these customizations.Before we jump in, I'd like to first give you a refresheron how to integrate AR Quick Look with your website.On my product page I've added an "a" tagwith a link to the USDZ model of my retro alarm clock.I've also nested an image tag to show a thumbnail of the clock.Adding the rel="ar" attribute tells Safari that this is an AR experienceso it will draw an AR badge and will present AR Quick Look directly,instead of first navigating to another page.Next, we customize the experience by passing in customization optionsthrough the web URL's fragment identifier,which appears after the hash mark.To help with code readability,I've separated each parameter on its own line,but in practice they should be separatedonly by an ampersand without any spaces in between.Normally, tapping on the share buttonallows the user to share the current page that they are on.However, specifying the canonicalWebPageURLoverrides the default URL.In my example,users can share a direct link to this fictitious product page,even though they were originally viewing iton the Quick Look gallery page.We also support disabling content scalingthrough the allowsContentScaling parameter,so people can preview content at the intended size.In my example,I always want the alarm clock viewed at its true real-world size,so I've provided a value of zero to allowsContentScalingwhich disables scaling.So that's a quick recap on integrating AR Quick Look on your websiteand how to use the fragment identifier to customize AR Quick Look.Now let's talk in more detail about each of the three available banner styles...starting with Apple Pay.If you're already accepting Apple Pay as part of your business payment methods,the Apple Pay banner is the simplest and most convenient way to get set upand allow customers to make purchases right within the AR experiencewith all the benefits of Apple Pay, like being a fast and secure way to pay.If this is your first time incorporating Apple Pay on your website,there's a lot of great resources online including guidelines to help get set up.As a reminder, AR Quick Look is a system extensionand was built with security in mind.So no payment information is collected or storedsince the payment happens after the AR experience dismissesand the customer is returned back to the retail web page.Retailers have a wide selection of button types to choose fromto best match with their business.Specifically seven types.The first four button types, like Pay with or Check out with Apple Pay,are focused on purchasing a product...while the last three payment styles, book, donate and subscribe are tailoredfor specific use cases, such as travel or subscription-based businesses.Underneath each button type is their corresponding valuefor the Apple-Pay-Button-Type parameter option,which we'll talk about shortly.Here's the code sample which will present AR Quick Look with the Apple Pay button.The first thing you might notice is there's an additionalid="ar-link" attribute.This specifies the unique identifier for this link elementwhich we will use later when we start listening for tap events.There are four required parameters:applePayButtonType, checkoutTitle, checkoutSubtitle and price.In our example, I've chosen the plain Apple Pay style,which is simple and compact.The title and subtitle is where you can supply the product informationto the customer.Because URLs can't contain spaces, the values in the fragment identifierneed to be percent-encoded such as the spaces in the title and subtitle.If your website supports multiple languages,you'll need to localize the string values provided to the parameterssince AR Quick Look will display them as is.This is especially important for the price parameterwhen representing currency for different locales.And of course, you can also combine thiswith other AR Quick Look customization optionslike allowsContentScaling.Let me show you what the full Apple Pay experience looks like.Say I'm shopping and I find an alarm clock that I like.I can place it on my nightstand and see it up close, right in my room.Oh, this looks great.I'll rotate and position it to my preferred spot close to my bed.Okay, I'm definitely going to purchase this.Since the banner's always visible on-screen with the Apple Pay button,I can immediately tap "buy" to start the transaction.AR Quick Look will then dismissand return to the web page with the Apple Pay prompt brought up,where I can then authenticate and complete my purchase.Now let's look at the second style--the custom action banner.The custom action banner provides the same intuitive layout of the Apply Pay bannerbut provides the ability for supplying your own call to actionslike "Add To Cart" or "Preorder" to help move the customer one step furtherin the purchasing flow.This conveys the intention by the user to proceed to follow-up questionssuch as asking for an e-mail address to be notified when the kids slide is released.After AR Quick Look dismisses,your website can then perform custom logicsuch as adding to the item to the shopping cart,prompting for the product size,or even opening Apple Maps to help the customerfind the closest store near them.The call to action provides more flexibilityto enable additional retail use cases besides purchasing,providing more ways to integrate with AR.The code is very similar to Apple Pay except we need to specify callToActioninstead of the Apple-Pay-Button-Type parameter.Again, be sure to percent-encode the URL parameter valuesin the fragment identifier and localize the strings for different localesfor both the call to action text and price fields.In addition, the price parameter is now optional for the custom action in iOS 14.This provides better flexibility for productswhich might have varying prices depending on the product variant.However, keep in mind that this field is still required on previous versions of iOSand should not be empty.Let's take a look at a kids slide from the AR Quick Look gallery page.I'll go into object mode, where you can see the custom action banneris always visible for quick access.Tapping on the custom action button will dismiss AR Quick Lookand take me to the documentation page,which is how I've defined and set up the custom action.Now let's look at the last style, the custom banner.This banner is the most customizable,where you can supply your own custom HTML file to fit your own unique use case.This allows you to customize the entire viewso you can use your own font, layout and graphicto match your business' branding and style.This banner supports three predefined heights which can be used to communicateadditional information and contain personalized messaging.Like the custom action, it is up to you to decide how to respond.For example, you can start a Business Chat conversationby redirecting to your unique Business Chat URL.To comply with AR Quick Look's security standards,the HTML resource must be sent over HTTPS.Otherwise, the banner will not display and the request will be ignored.To display the custom HTML banner,you'll need to set just one parameter, "custom,"and provide the absolute URL to the HTML file.Like the other two banners, make sure to percent-encode this valuebefore appending it as a URL parameter.There's an optional "customHeight" parameter availableif you want to set the banner height.Supply a value of 'small' to set the banner height to 81 points.Or 'medium' to set the banner height to 121 points.And 'large' to set the banner height to 161 points.If you omit the custom height URL parameter,AR Quick Look uses a default small height.Here's a great example of shopping for a guitar from our fictitious store,called Acoustic House.I'll go ahead and tap on this guitar image which will push me into AR Quick Lookwhere I can preview the Stratocaster guitar in my room.You can see Acoustic House is using the custom banner styleand has presented the banner for a conversational experiencewith the immersion in AR.On tap, AR Quick Look launches a Business Chat conversationin Messages,where I can chat with a live agent and ask questionsand eventually place an order.This illustrates how AR Quick Look provides a really powerful handofffrom the AR experience to applications like Business Chat,allowing customers to connect directly with companies to learn moreand quickly get answers.If you're not already familiar,Business Chat allows consumers to connect with brandsto ask questions, schedule appointments and deliveries,purchase goods and services using Apple Pay and moreright from the Messages App.Here, in this example, The Home Depot is using AR Quick Lookto help consumers check out home appliancesin an immersive and engaging way as part of their buying process.And with our new banner feature,AR Quick Look can then launch Business Chatwhere consumers can start a conversation with businesses like Home Depotabout the washer machineand receive a USDZ file of the companion dryerwhere they can place it virtually in their laundry room with AR.This is a great way for customers to learn more about a productand really make an informed buying decision in a private and secure channel.And for businesses, it is really easy to providethis seamless customer experienceby using a Business Chat URL as a custom action or custom banner event.Here's a summary of the different customization parametersfor each of the different banner styles.As a reminder, the highlighted parameters are optional for that banner style.Now that we've gone over how to customize AR Quick Look to show a banner,let's go over how your website can get notifiedwhen users interact with the banner.From earlier, we saw the code snippets of how to use the fragment identifierto specify which type of banner to show.To listen for and be notified of tap events,we need to add an EventListener like this.Remember the id="ar-link" earlier?This is how the script is able to retrieve the corresponding "a" tagthat we defined previouslyand assign it to the constant linkElement.When WebKit invokes your listener, check the data property.A value of "apple_ar_quicklook_button_tapped"confirms the user tapped the banner in AR Quick Look.From here, you can either invoke the Apple Pay sheet,or perform some custom logic like adding the item to the shopping cartdepending on the banner style displayed.The AR Quick Look gallery has been updated with new 3D modelsand the banner examples we've gone through together.Visit the gallery page on your iOS devices and try everything out.It's really amazing to see how people are taking advantage of ARand integrating AR Quick Look into their websiteand iOS application workflows.We love seeing all the many types of contentpeople are sharing and experiencing in AR Quick Look.You saw the Apple Pay and Custom Action bannerwhich are really simple and easy templated stylesto quickly add purchasing options to your AR experience.With the custom HTML banner, retailers have even greater flexibilityin customizing the view to match their branding and colors.There's lots of great documentation available on developer.apple.com,including how to add an Apple Pay buttonor a custom action in AR Quick Look that I've went through today.We love to hear from you,and you can send us feedback on your Apple Payand custom banner integrations, along with any requests you may have,through Feedback Assistant.Thank you, and thanks for watching.

Hello, and welcome to WWDC.

Here's the code sample which will present AR Quick Look with the Apple Pay button.The first thing you might notice is there's an additionalid="ar-link" attribute.This specifies the unique identifier for this link elementwhich we will use later when we start listening for tap events.

There are four required parameters:applePayButtonType, checkoutTitle, checkoutSubtitle and price.

In our example, I've chosen the plain Apple Pay style,which is simple and compact.

The title and subtitle is where you can supply the product informationto the customer.

Because URLs can't contain spaces, the values in the fragment identifierneed to be percent-encoded such as the spaces in the title and subtitle.

If your website supports multiple languages,you'll need to localize the string values provided to the parameterssince AR Quick Look will display them as is.This is especially important for the price parameterwhen representing currency for different locales.

And of course, you can also combine thiswith other AR Quick Look customization optionslike allowsContentScaling.

Let me show you what the full Apple Pay experience looks like.Say I'm shopping and I find an alarm clock that I like.I can place it on my nightstand and see it up close, right in my room.

Oh, this looks great.I'll rotate and position it to my preferred spot close to my bed.

Okay, I'm definitely going to purchase this.Since the banner's always visible on-screen with the Apple Pay button,I can immediately tap "buy" to start the transaction.AR Quick Look will then dismissand return to the web page with the Apple Pay prompt brought up,where I can then authenticate and complete my purchase.Now let's look at the second style--the custom action banner.The custom action banner provides the same intuitive layout of the Apply Pay bannerbut provides the ability for supplying your own call to actionslike "Add To Cart" or "Preorder" to help move the customer one step furtherin the purchasing flow.

This conveys the intention by the user to proceed to follow-up questionssuch as asking for an e-mail address to be notified when the kids slide is released.

After AR Quick Look dismisses,your website can then perform custom logicsuch as adding to the item to the shopping cart,prompting for the product size,or even opening Apple Maps to help the customerfind the closest store near them.

The call to action provides more flexibilityto enable additional retail use cases besides purchasing,providing more ways to integrate with AR.

The code is very similar to Apple Pay except we need to specify callToActioninstead of the Apple-Pay-Button-Type parameter.Again, be sure to percent-encode the URL parameter valuesin the fragment identifier and localize the strings for different localesfor both the call to action text and price fields.

In addition, the price parameter is now optional for the custom action in iOS 14.This provides better flexibility for productswhich might have varying prices depending on the product variant.However, keep in mind that this field is still required on previous versions of iOSand should not be empty.Let's take a look at a kids slide from the AR Quick Look gallery page.I'll go into object mode, where you can see the custom action banneris always visible for quick access.Tapping on the custom action button will dismiss AR Quick Lookand take me to the documentation page,which is how I've defined and set up the custom action.

Now let's look at the last style, the custom banner.This banner is the most customizable,where you can supply your own custom HTML file to fit your own unique use case.

This allows you to customize the entire viewso you can use your own font, layout and graphicto match your business' branding and style.

This banner supports three predefined heights which can be used to communicateadditional information and contain personalized messaging.

Like the custom action, it is up to you to decide how to respond.For example, you can start a Business Chat conversationby redirecting to your unique Business Chat URL.

To comply with AR Quick Look's security standards,the HTML resource must be sent over HTTPS.Otherwise, the banner will not display and the request will be ignored.

To display the custom HTML banner,you'll need to set just one parameter, "custom,"and provide the absolute URL to the HTML file.Like the other two banners, make sure to percent-encode this valuebefore appending it as a URL parameter.

There's an optional "customHeight" parameter availableif you want to set the banner height.Supply a value of 'small' to set the banner height to 81 points.Or 'medium' to set the banner height to 121 points.And 'large' to set the banner height to 161 points.If you omit the custom height URL parameter,AR Quick Look uses a default small height.

Here's a great example of shopping for a guitar from our fictitious store,called Acoustic House.I'll go ahead and tap on this guitar image which will push me into AR Quick Lookwhere I can preview the Stratocaster guitar in my room.

You can see Acoustic House is using the custom banner styleand has presented the banner for a conversational experiencewith the immersion in AR.On tap, AR Quick Look launches a Business Chat conversationin Messages,where I can chat with a live agent and ask questionsand eventually place an order.This illustrates how AR Quick Look provides a really powerful handofffrom the AR experience to applications like Business Chat,allowing customers to connect directly with companies to learn moreand quickly get answers.

If you're not already familiar,Business Chat allows consumers to connect with brandsto ask questions, schedule appointments and deliveries,purchase goods and services using Apple Pay and moreright from the Messages App.Here, in this example, The Home Depot is using AR Quick Lookto help consumers check out home appliancesin an immersive and engaging way as part of their buying process.

And with our new banner feature,AR Quick Look can then launch Business Chatwhere consumers can start a conversation with businesses like Home Depotabout the washer machineand receive a USDZ file of the companion dryerwhere they can place it virtually in their laundry room with AR.

This is a great way for customers to learn more about a productand really make an informed buying decision in a private and secure channel.And for businesses, it is really easy to providethis seamless customer experienceby using a Business Chat URL as a custom action or custom banner event.

Here's a summary of the different customization parametersfor each of the different banner styles.As a reminder, the highlighted parameters are optional for that banner style.

Now that we've gone over how to customize AR Quick Look to show a banner,let's go over how your website can get notifiedwhen users interact with the banner.

From earlier, we saw the code snippets of how to use the fragment identifierto specify which type of banner to show.To listen for and be notified of tap events,we need to add an EventListener like this.

Remember the id="ar-link" earlier?This is how the script is able to retrieve the corresponding "a" tagthat we defined previouslyand assign it to the constant linkElement.

When WebKit invokes your listener, check the data property.A value of "apple_ar_quicklook_button_tapped"confirms the user tapped the banner in AR Quick Look.

From here, you can either invoke the Apple Pay sheet,or perform some custom logic like adding the item to the shopping cartdepending on the banner style displayed.

The AR Quick Look gallery has been updated with new 3D modelsand the banner examples we've gone through together.Visit the gallery page on your iOS devices and try everything out.

It's really amazing to see how people are taking advantage of ARand integrating AR Quick Look into their websiteand iOS application workflows.We love seeing all the many types of contentpeople are sharing and experiencing in AR Quick Look.You saw the Apple Pay and Custom Action bannerwhich are really simple and easy templated stylesto quickly add purchasing options to your AR experience.With the custom HTML banner, retailers have even greater flexibilityin customizing the view to match their branding and colors.

There's lots of great documentation available on developer.apple.com,including how to add an Apple Pay buttonor a custom action in AR Quick Look that I've went through today.We love to hear from you,and you can send us feedback on your Apple Payand custom banner integrations, along with any requests you may have,through Feedback Assistant.Thank you, and thanks for watching.
