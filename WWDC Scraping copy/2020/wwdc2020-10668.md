Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC.Hello and welcome to the session "Meet Nearby Interaction."My name is Yagil, and I'm an engineer from the Location team here at Apple.Today we will talk about how to builda completely new class of user interactionsthat are based on spatial awareness in iOS.Spatial awareness, in essence,means understanding the physical world around you.Such understanding in a device you're holding in your handcan translate into fluid interactions with the environment.This is AirDrop in iOS 13.The top selection that I'm highlighting hereuses spatial sensing technologiesavailable for the first time in the iPhone 11.The user can orient their device toward someone else's deviceto give a strong hint to the share sheetfor presenting the most relevant sharing selection.This sort of high-fidelity interactivityis only possible thanks to the Apple-designed U1 chip.We wanted to empower you to use such capabilities in your application.So today, we are introducing the Nearby Interaction framework,a powerful yet easy-to-use interface to spatial awareness in iOS.Let's start by talking about user control and transparency.Say your app wants to run a Nearby Interaction sessionwith another user's device.The first thing the system will dois present a permission prompt to both users.The user can choose between not allowing your appto interact with a nearby device,or granting it a one-time permissionthat remains in effect until your app is exited.If users on both sides choose to grant permission,their devices can start to understand how far apart they areand in which relative direction.This kind of rich spatial information enables you to create user experiencesthat are more natural and more intuitive in your application.Nearby Interaction will be available to your appson U1-equipped devices running iOS 14.Here's what we'll cover today.I will talk about spatial awareness in iOS with Nearby Interaction.Then I will take you through what it takesto start streaming relative position updates.And I'll close with some best practices for you to adopt in your application.So let's jump right in.Nearby Interaction provides your app two main types of output:a measurement of distance between devices,and a measurement of relative direction from one to the other.So when your app is running a Nearby Interaction session,it is able to get a continuous stream of updatescontaining distance and direction information.As this slide shows, these updates are bi-directional,and both sides of the sessionare learning about each other's relative position simultaneously.Your app is not limited to interacting with just one device.Each device can run several sessions at the same time,each session with one other peer.In this graphic, I'm showing four devices interacting with one anotherby each running three sessions in parallel.Let's talk about the interface for making this happen.You start with creating a Nearby Interaction session object.All Nearby Interactions are encapsulated in sessions.Similar to patterns in other Apple frameworks such as ARKit,you provide your session objecta configuration you would like it to run with.So let's say that there are two or more users running your app,and they want to interact with one another in some spatial manner.Before this can happen,your app needs to let the system know, on both sides,how to identify the other device when it is nearby.Peer discovery is a key concept.Devices can discover each other in a privacy-preserving mannerby using something we call a discovery token.A discovery token is a randomly generated identifier for a given devicein a particular Nearby Interaction session.The discovery token has a limited time period for which it can be used,and that time period is exactly as long as the session itself,meaning that if you invalidate the session or if the user exits your app,any session and its associated token get invalidated.The token is generated by the system,and you receive it in your application through the session object.Each session you create has its own unique associated discovery token.Finally, your app needs to copy the discovery tokenfrom the session objectand then share it between users that want to interact.Let's go into a little bit more detail about what that means.Let's say that your app is running on both of these devices,and that your app has some networking layerover which the devices can talk to one another.Use your networking layerto send a discovery token from one device to the other,and do exactly the same on the other side.How do you do this?The discovery token type conforms to the NSSecureCoding protocol,which means you can easily encode it and then shuttle it overusing whatever transport technology is available to your app.For example, you can use Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework,or, if applicable to your app, via the cloud.Coming back to the block diagram.The discovery token your app exchanged goes into the session configuration,and the configuration is provided to the session via the "run" method.Let's jump into the code.This short code snippet hereshows you all you need to do to get a session going in your app.First, create a session object.Behind the scenes, this call allocates all the needed resourcesfor running a session, including a discovery token.Next, to be able to receive callbacks from the system,set the session's delegate.The next step is exchanging the session-specific discovery token.This needs to be done over your app's networking layer.When the token exchange step is complete, proceed to create a session configuration.And finally, run the session with the configuration.Let's keep building this down to match the code.The session takes a delegate to provide updates to,and after calling "run,"your delegate starts getting updates about nearby objects.That's the basic structure of a Nearby Interaction session.Time for a demo.Let's see a fun little app that makes use of distance and direction:Monkey Time.I have an app herethat is also running on the phone behind me on the table over there,and I already started the session.Let's see what's on the screen.We see a measurement distance at the top, and you see it's updating.And we also have our little friend, the monkey here,and he's covering his eyes.So I'm going to head over towards the other phoneand see what's gonna happen.All right. I went through a lot of new stuff, so let's recap.To run a session, first create a session object for each peerand exchange tokens with that peer.Once discovery tokens are exchanged, create a session configuration.And to start streaming updates, run the session with the configuration.You can also pause a sessionand resume it later by calling the "run" method again.I mentioned that after calling "run,"you will start getting updates from the session.With that in mind, let's go into a little more detailabout the delegate callbacks you can implement in your app.This is the session delegate protocol.Your app receives updates about nearby devicesby implementing the didUpdate callback.There are a few more interesting methods here.The system will notify your appwhenever it is no longer interacting with a nearby object.This notification comes with a reason associated with it.The two reasons you can expect are "timeout" or "peerEnded."They are different in some important ways.Timeout means that there wasn't any activity in the sessionfor over some time period.This may happen, for example, if the devices are too far apart.PeerEnded, on the other hand,means that the session was explicitly invalidated on the other end.A word of caution here.This notification is delivered on a best-effort basisand may not always be received.Those were the nearby object removal reasons.The final three delegate callbacks have to do with the session life cycle.Whenever there are conditions preventing your session from running,your delegate will get a suspension notification.The session will be suspended, for example,when your app is no longer in the foreground.You need to wait for a notification that the suspension endedbefore being able to use it again.When you finally get a callback that the suspension ended,your session will not resume automatically.This is to allow you to decide what to do with the session at this point.If you want to resume the session, you can call "run" on both sides,just like you did when you first started the session,but this time, there's no need to exchange discovery tokens.Last but not least is the sessionDidInvalidate callback,which notifies your app about session invalidation.The session will be invalidated with an associated error codeupon certain error conditions or resource constraints.Sessions that are invalidated cannot be run again,and their associated tokens cannot be used anymore.To restart interaction, you'll need to create a new sessionand re-exchange discovery tokens.These were the different delegate callbacksyour app might get from the system.Back to the full diagram.This is illustrating a single session.I mentioned that your app can run several simultaneous sessions.This is what it would look like with multiple sessions.You create a session for each peer,and you can re-use other parts of your app whenever it makes sense.For example, here, I'm using the same delegate for all sessions.Maintaining the principle of "one session for one peer"makes managing multiple sessions straightforward.You can interact with multiple nearby devicesby creating an interaction session for each one.You can think about it like a conversation with that device.We recommend storing sessions in a data structure like a dictionaryin order to map your app's notion of peer usersto their respective Nearby Interaction sessions.All right. You've constructed and run a session or two,and you start getting updates about nearby objects.Now I'll dive into what nearby objects containand how you can use them in your application.Each nearby object comes with three properties.A discovery token that you provided to the session in the configuration.This property is here to allow you to tie back these updatesto the user from which you received the token in the first place.The next property is distance.It contains a distance measurement in meters,indicating how far apart the two devices are.And the final property is direction.It contains a three-dimensional unit vectorpointing at the other device, relative to the local device itself.This is what it looks like in code.A discovery token identifying this nearby object,a distance measurement in meters between you and the object,and a vector expressing the relative direction to the object.I'd like to call your attentionto the fact that the distance and direction properties are nullable.This is an excellent segueto some best practices we'd like you to keep in mind.First, always verify hardware support.Choose a strategic place in your appto check whether Nearby Interaction is supported.Make sure to fall back to a different user experience when necessary.Next, become familiar with the concept of the directional field of view.Similar to other hardware sensors, like the camera, for example,the hardware used in Nearby Interaction is also subject to a field of view.The field of view, notionally, is a cone that looks just like thiscoming out of the back of the phone.It roughly corresponds with the Ultra Wide camera's field of view on the iPhone 11.When devices you're interacting with are inside this field of view,both distance and direction updatesare expected to be produced with high confidence.But if a device is outside that directional field of view,your app may get distance updates about it but not direction updates.Remember this when developing your apps and designing your user experiences.Next, understand the impact of physical device orientation.For optimal performance,devices should be held in the portrait orientation.One device in portrait and the other in landscapewould lead to limited measurement availability.This is something you absolutely want to avoid,so make sure that your app does not lead users to this situation.Moving on, be mindful of occlusions.Devices that are in clear line of sight of each otherwill achieve optimal performance.You can think about it in terms of the devices looking at one another.Brick walls, people, or any body or object in between devicesmay reduce measurement availability.Like I mentioned,the distance and direction properties of a nearby object are nullable.So whenever either one cannot be produced due to the scenarios I just talked about,these fields are expected to be nil.Be prepared for thisand handle nullability accordingly in your application.As for best practices around your development process,take advantage of the natively integrated Simulator support in Xcode.The same application code that runs on actual deviceswill get triggered with distance and direction updatesbetween two or more Simulator windows.We're happy to be able to ship this to you,and we hope that this functionalitywill simplify and accelerate your development process.This makes our final best-practice recommendation.Leverage the native Xcode support for simulating Nearby Interactions.Today we introduced Nearby Interaction.It enables you to add spatial awareness to your applicationand create new kinds of user interactionsthat are based on knowledge of relative device position.Thank you for joining the session today,and we truly can't wait to see
what you'll build with this.
